The captives, spoils, and plunder represent the totality of what was taken from the defeated Midianites, including people, livestock, and goods. This practice was common in ancient warfare, where victors would take the possessions of the vanquished as a sign of triumph and as a means of sustaining their own people. Theologically, this reflects God's judgment against those who oppose His people and His purposes.<p><b>to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of Israel</b><br>Moses, as the leader of Israel, and Eleazar, the high priest, represent both the civil and religious authority in Israel. Bringing the spoils to them signifies the acknowledgment of God's leadership and the need for divine guidance in handling the results of the battle. The congregation of Israel, representing the entire community, is included to ensure transparency and communal participation in the distribution of the spoils. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israelite society, where religious and civil matters were intertwined, and decisions were made with the involvement of the entire community.<p><b>at the camp on the plains of Moab</b><br>The plains of Moab were located east of the Jordan River, opposite Jericho. This area served as the final encampment of the Israelites before they crossed into the Promised Land. The location is significant as it represents a transitional phase for the Israelites, poised to enter Canaan. Archaeologically, the plains of Moab are identified with the region around modern-day Jordan, and this setting underscores the historical reality of the biblical narrative.<p><b>by the Jordan across from Jericho</b><br>The Jordan River was a significant geographical boundary for the Israelites, symbolizing the transition from the wilderness wanderings to the inheritance of the Promised Land. Jericho, located just across the Jordan, was the first city to be conquered in the land of Canaan (Joshua 6). This phrase situates the narrative in a specific geographical context, highlighting the proximity to the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land. Theologically, the Jordan River often symbolizes a crossing from death to life, from the old to the new, prefiguring Christian baptism and the believer's entry into the promises of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
