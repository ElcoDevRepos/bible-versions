Aaron, the brother of Moses, was chosen by God to lead the priesthood, establishing a hereditary line of priests from the tribe of Levi. This divine appointment underscores the importance of the priestly office in mediating between God and the Israelites.<p><b>Behold, I have put you in charge of My offerings</b><br>God entrusts Aaron with the responsibility of overseeing the offerings, signifying the sacred duty of the priesthood to manage the worship practices of Israel. The offerings include sacrifices and gifts brought by the people, which were central to maintaining the covenant relationship with God. This charge reflects the priestly role as stewards of divine worship, ensuring that offerings are made according to God's instructions.<p><b>As for all the sacred offerings of the Israelites</b><br>The sacred offerings refer to various types of sacrifices, including burnt offerings, grain offerings, peace offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings. Each type of offering had specific purposes and regulations, as detailed in Leviticus. These offerings were integral to the Israelites' worship and served as a means of atonement, thanksgiving, and fellowship with God.<p><b>I have given them to you and your sons</b><br>This provision for Aaron and his sons, the priestly family, highlights God's care for those who serve Him. The offerings provided sustenance for the priests, who did not have a territorial inheritance like the other tribes. This arrangement ensured that the priests could focus on their spiritual duties without the burden of agricultural labor.<p><b>as a portion and a permanent statute</b><br>The phrase "a portion and a permanent statute" indicates that this provision was not temporary but an enduring ordinance. It established a lasting principle for the support of the priesthood, reflecting God's unchanging nature and His commitment to the covenant community. This statute also prefigures the eternal priesthood of Christ, who is both the ultimate High Priest and the perfect offering for sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who establishes the laws and statutes for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel, representing the priestly line.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are commanded to bring offerings and contributions to the LORD.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_offerings.htm">Holy Offerings</a></b><br>These are the sacred gifts and sacrifices brought by the Israelites, dedicated to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God among His people, where the offerings are brought and where Aaron and his sons serve.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_for_his_servants.htm">God's Provision for His Servants</a></b><br>God ensures that those who serve Him, like Aaron and his sons, are provided for through the offerings of the people.
