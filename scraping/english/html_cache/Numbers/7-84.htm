This reflects the unity and shared responsibility among the tribes. The leaders' involvement underscores the importance of leadership in guiding the people in worship and obedience to God. This act of offering is reminiscent of the communal worship seen in <a href="/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5-8</a>, where the leaders participated in the covenant ceremony.<p><b>for the dedication of the altar</b><br>The dedication of the altar was a significant event, marking the altar's readiness for use in sacrificial offerings. This dedication parallels the consecration of the Tabernacle in <a href="/exodus/40.htm">Exodus 40</a>, where the altar was anointed and set apart for holy purposes. The altar symbolizes the place of atonement and communion with God, foreshadowing the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is both the altar and the offering (<a href="/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a>).<p><b>when it was anointed</b><br>Anointing the altar signifies its sanctification and setting apart for divine service. Anointing with oil in the Old Testament often represents the Holy Spirit's presence and empowerment (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). This act of anointing connects to the anointing of priests and kings, pointing to Jesus as the Anointed One, the Messiah, who fulfills the roles of Prophet, Priest, and King.<p><b>twelve silver platters, twelve silver bowls, and twelve gold dishes</b><br>The number twelve is significant, representing the twelve tribes of Israel and symbolizing completeness and divine order. Silver and gold were precious metals, indicating the value and honor given to God in worship. The use of these metals in offerings is consistent with the materials used in the construction of the Tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/25-3.htm">Exodus 25:3</a>). The offerings reflect the wealth and devotion of the people, as well as the splendor and holiness of God's dwelling place. The specific items&#8212;platters, bowls, and dishes&#8212;were likely used in the service of the altar, emphasizing the practical and sacred aspects of worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leaders_of_israel.htm">Leaders of Israel</a></b><br>These were the heads of the twelve tribes of Israel, each representing their respective tribe in the dedication offering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>The central place of worship in the Tabernacle where sacrifices and offerings were made to God.
