Immediately after Moses relayed the regulations for celebrating Passover (<a href="/numbers/9-1.htm">Numbers 9:1-8</a>), God Himself responds.<p>- Scripture often marks pivotal moments with &#8220;then&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/3-15.htm">Matthew 3:15</a>), signaling God&#8217;s timely intervention.<p>- It underscores that divine revelation comes exactly when needed, affirming <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>&#8212;&#8220;A man&#8217;s heart plans his course, but the LORD directs his steps.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD</b><p>- The covenant name points to the self-existent, promise-keeping God who delivered Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14-15</a>).<p>- His unchanging character grounds every command He gives; see <a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>, &#8220;I the LORD do not change.&#8221;<p>- The same holy God who spoke from Sinai now guides Israel&#8217;s worship life, echoing <a href="/leviticus/25-1.htm">Leviticus 25:1</a> where &#8220;the LORD spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai&#8221; with equal authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>said</b><p>- God chooses spoken revelation, underscoring <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>, &#8220;faith comes by hearing.&#8221;<p>- His words carry creative and directive power (<a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>). When the LORD speaks, obedience isn&#8217;t optional but expected, as modeled in <a href="/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7</a> where Israel replies, &#8220;All that the LORD has spoken we will do.&#8221;<p>- The verb also highlights ongoing relationship: God continues to communicate, not merely issuing a one-time decree.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Moses</b><p>- God addresses His appointed mediator, reaffirming Moses&#8217; role first defined in <a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10-12</a>.<p>- Authority flows from God through His chosen servant; <a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7-8</a> notes that God speaks with Moses &#8220;face to face,&#8221; distinguishing him from other prophets.<p>- This pattern anticipates the ultimate Mediator, foreshadowed in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a> and fulfilled in <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>, where Christ stands between God and humanity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/9-9.htm">Numbers 9:9</a>, though brief, anchors Israel&#8217;s worship regulations in the sovereign timing, unchanging character, spoken authority, and mediated leadership of God.
