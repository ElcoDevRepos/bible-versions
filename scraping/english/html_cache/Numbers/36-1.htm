Gilead is a region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and rugged terrain. Machir was the firstborn son of Manasseh, and his descendants were known for their valor and military prowess. The mention of Gilead highlights the importance of land inheritance and tribal identity in Israelite society.

"The mishpachoth of the Beni-Gilead" certainly did not include the Machirites, who were somewhat sharply distinguished from the other Manassites (see above on Numbers 26:29; 32:39 ff.); it is even doubtful whether they included the Gileadites proper, who took their name (and perhaps traced their descent) from Gilead, but not from his sons. It may be confidently assumed that the Machirites, who had received an extensive and remote territory beyond Jordan, had nothing whatever to do with this application.
