Aaron and his descendants were chosen by God to serve as priests, a role that was not open to others. This exclusivity underscores the holiness and separation required for those who serve directly in God's presence. The priesthood is a hereditary office, passed down through Aaron's lineage, emphasizing the importance of family and lineage in Israelite society. This also foreshadows the New Testament concept of Jesus as our High Priest, who fulfills and surpasses the Aaronic priesthood (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>for everything concerning the altar and what is inside the veil</b><br>The altar and the veil are central elements of the tabernacle, representing the means of atonement and the separation between God and humanity. The altar is where sacrifices were made, symbolizing the need for atonement and reconciliation with God. The veil separated the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place, where the Ark of the Covenant was kept, signifying the holiness of God and the barrier sin creates between God and man. In the New Testament, the tearing of the veil at Jesus' crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>) signifies the removal of this barrier, granting believers direct access to God through Christ.<p><b>and you are to perform that service</b><br>This phrase highlights the active role of the priests in the worship and sacrificial system. The service of the priests was not just a privilege but a duty, requiring diligence and obedience. This service included offering sacrifices, maintaining the tabernacle, and teaching the people God's laws. It reflects the broader biblical theme of service to God as an act of worship and obedience, which is echoed in the New Testament call for believers to offer themselves as living sacrifices (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>I am giving you the work of the priesthood as a gift</b><br>The priesthood is described as a gift from God, emphasizing that it is not earned or deserved but granted by divine grace. This gift comes with responsibilities and privileges, highlighting the concept of stewardship. The idea of the priesthood as a gift also points to the grace of God in choosing and equipping individuals for His service. In the New Testament, the concept of spiritual gifts given to believers for the edification of the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</a>) parallels this idea.<p><b>but any outsider who comes near the sanctuary must be put to death.</b><br>This severe warning underscores the holiness of God and the sanctity of the tabernacle. Only those consecrated and appointed by God could approach the sacred space, reflecting the seriousness of sin and the need for purity in worship. This restriction highlights the separation between the holy and the common, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament. In the New Testament, the concept of holiness is expanded, with all believers called to be a royal priesthood (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), yet the reverence for God's holiness remains paramount.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The first high priest of Israel, chosen by God to lead the priestly duties and serve as a mediator between God and the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron's_sons.htm">Aaron's Sons</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron who were also appointed to serve as priests, continuing the priestly lineage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>A sacred place where sacrifices and offerings were made to God, central to the worship practices of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_veil.htm">The Veil</a></b><br>The curtain in the Tabernacle that separated the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place, symbolizing the separation between God and humanity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/unauthorized_person.htm">Unauthorized Person</a></b><br>Anyone not appointed by God to perform priestly duties, highlighting the importance of divine appointment and order.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_appointment_and_order.htm">Divine Appointment and Order</a></b><br>God establishes specific roles and responsibilities within His community.

The word which is employed in this place (<span class= "ital">parocheth</span>) is used only of the second vail. (See <a href="/leviticus/16-12.htm" title="And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring it within the veil:">Leviticus 16:12</a><span class= "ital">.</span>) When the outer vail or <span class= "ital">hanging </span>is designed to be understood, the word used is <span class= "ital">masak. </span>The reference appears to be to the whole of the priestly duties which were discharged by Aaron and his sons, from those connected with the altar of burnt offering to those which were performed in the most holy place.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall keep your priests' office for everything of the altar, and within the vail.</span> That the Levites were made over to Aaron and his sons to relieve them of a great part of the mere routine and drudgery of their service was to be with them an additional and powerful motive for doing their priestly work so reverently and watchfully as to leave no excuse for sacrilegious intrusion. The altar (of burnt offering) and "that within the vail (cf. <a href="/hebrews/6-19.htm">Hebrews 6:19</a>) were the two points between which the exclusive duties of the priesthood lay, including the service of the holy place. <span class="cmt_word">A service of gift.</span> A service which was not to be regarded as a burden, or a misfortune, or as a natural heritage and accident of birth, but to be received and cherished as a favour accorded to them by the goodness of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/18-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But only you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
