The Israelites are continuing their journey through the wilderness, emphasizing the theme of pilgrimage and reliance on God for guidance.<p><b>along the route to the Red Sea</b><br>The route to the Red Sea indicates a southern detour, as the Israelites were avoiding the land of Edom. This detour is a result of Edom's refusal to allow passage through their territory (<a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>). The Red Sea, or Yam Suph, is a significant body of water in Israel's history, notably where God parted the waters for their escape from Egypt (Exodus 14). This reference serves as a reminder of God's past deliverance and faithfulness.<p><b>in order to bypass the land of Edom</b><br>Edom, descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, had a longstanding, complex relationship with Israel. The refusal of passage by Edom highlights the ongoing tension and enmity between the two nations.

It reflects a lack of trust in God's provision and timing. This impatience often leads to complaints and rebellion, as seen in previous instances (Exodus 16, <a href="/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11</a>).
