The Israelites longed for the variety of foods they had in Egypt, expressing dissatisfaction with the manna provided by God. This statement emphasizes the duration of the provision, indicating that it will be more than just a temporary solution. The emphasis on "not for one or two days" suggests a significant period, highlighting God's ability to provide abundantly beyond immediate needs. This reflects God's patience and willingness to address the people's complaints, despite their lack of faith and gratitude.<p><b>nor for five or ten or twenty days</b><br>The continuation of the duration underscores the extent of God's provision. By specifying "nor for five or ten or twenty days," the text emphasizes that the provision will be substantial and prolonged. This can be seen as a test of the Israelites' faith and obedience, as well as a demonstration of God's power and sovereignty. The specific numbers may also serve to build anticipation and highlight the seriousness of the situation. In a broader biblical context, this passage foreshadows the concept of God's provision through Christ, who is the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), offering spiritual sustenance that surpasses temporary physical needs. The emphasis on duration also reflects the idea of God's eternal provision and care for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is interceding for the people and communicating God's message.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are complaining about their circumstances in the wilderness, specifically their lack of meat.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who responds to the complaints of the Israelites with both provision and a lesson.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites are journeying from Egypt to the Promised Land, a place of testing and reliance on God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/q/quail.htm">Quail</a></b><br>The meat that God provides in response to the Israelites' complaints, which becomes a lesson in contentment and trust.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_patience.htm">God's Provision and Patience</a></b><br>Despite the Israelites' complaints, God provides for their needs, demonstrating His patience and provision.
