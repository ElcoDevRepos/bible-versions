Their death is recorded in <a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>, where they offered "unauthorized fire" before the LORD. This event underscores the holiness of God and the importance of following His commands precisely. The phrase "in the presence of the LORD" indicates the seriousness of their offense, as they were serving in the tabernacle, the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. This incident serves as a warning about the consequences of disobedience and irreverence in worship.<p><b>when they offered unauthorized fire before the LORD</b><br>The "unauthorized fire" refers to incense that was not prescribed by God. In <a href="/exodus/30-9.htm">Exodus 30:9</a>, God gave specific instructions about the incense to be used in the tabernacle. Nadab and Abihu's actions represent a deviation from divine instructions, highlighting the necessity of adhering to God's commands. This act of disobedience is often seen as a symbol of human presumption and the danger of approaching God on one's own terms rather than His.<p><b>in the Wilderness of Sinai</b><br>The Wilderness of Sinai is a significant location in Israel's history, as it is where they received the Law and established the covenant with God. It is a place of divine revelation and instruction, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19.htm">Exodus 19-24</a>. The setting emphasizes the formative period of Israel's identity as God's chosen people and the establishment of their religious practices.<p><b>And since they had no sons</b><br>Nadab and Abihu's lack of descendants meant that their priestly line ended with them. In ancient Israel, lineage and inheritance were crucial for maintaining family roles and responsibilities, especially within the priesthood. This detail underscores the importance of Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's remaining sons, in continuing the priestly duties.<p><b>only Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests during the lifetime of their father Aaron</b><br>Eleazar and Ithamar, the younger sons of Aaron, took on the priestly responsibilities after the death of their brothers. This transition highlights the continuity of the priestly line despite the tragedy. Eleazar later becomes the high priest after Aaron's death, as noted in <a href="/numbers/20-28.htm">Numbers 20:28</a>. Their service during Aaron's lifetime signifies the importance of family and succession in maintaining the religious leadership of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nadab_and_abihu.htm">Nadab and Abihu</a></b><br>Sons of Aaron, the first high priest.
