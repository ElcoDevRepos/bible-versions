The soldiers here refer to the Israelite warriors who participated in this divinely sanctioned conflict. Historically, the Israelite army was composed of men from the twelve tribes, organized and prepared for battle as described in earlier chapters of Numbers. This reflects the communal and covenantal nature of Israel's identity, where each soldier represents not just himself but his tribe and the nation as a whole.<p><b>had taken plunder</b><br>Plunder, or spoils of war, was a common practice in ancient warfare, where victors would take goods, livestock, and other valuables from the defeated. In this biblical context, the taking of plunder was not merely for personal gain but was often seen as a divine provision and a fulfillment of God's promises to Israel. The plunder from the Midianites included gold, silver, and other valuable items, which were later used for religious purposes, such as contributions to the tabernacle. This act of taking plunder can be connected to God's provision for His people, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>, where the Israelites took spoils from the Egyptians.<p><b>for himself</b><br>This phrase highlights the individual benefit each soldier received from the victory. While the collective victory was for the nation, the personal gain underscores the tangible rewards of obedience to God's commands. It also reflects the personal responsibility and participation of each soldier in the battle. In a broader theological sense, this can be seen as a type of the believer's inheritance in Christ, where each individual receives a personal share in the blessings of salvation. The concept of individual reward is echoed in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/1_corinthians/3-8.htm">1 Corinthians 3:8</a>, where each will receive their own reward according to their labor.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who directed the campaign against the Midianites as commanded by God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_soldiers.htm">Israelite Soldiers</a></b><br>The men who fought against the Midianites and took plunder for themselves.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>A people who were enemies of Israel and were defeated in this campaign.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/plunder.htm">Plunder</a></b><br>The goods and valuables taken by the Israelite soldiers from the Midianites after their victory.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_command.htm">The Lord's Command</a></b><br>The directive given by God to Moses to take vengeance on the Midianites, which led to this event.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' actions were in direct response to God's command.

Verse 53 zeros in on every combatant: &#8220;Each of the soldiers&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; No one was excluded; every man in the ranks shared in God&#8217;s victory (cf. <a href="/joshua/1-14.htm">Joshua 1:14-15</a>, where all tribes unite in conquest).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that God values the contribution of &#8220;each&#8221; individual, echoing passages such as <a href="/1_samuel/30-24.htm">1 Samuel 30:24</a>, where David declares that both front-line fighters and rear-guard share alike.<p>&#8226;
