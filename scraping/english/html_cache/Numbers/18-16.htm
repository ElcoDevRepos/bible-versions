The redemption price for a firstborn male, whether human or animal, was a symbolic act acknowledging God's sovereignty and ownership over all creation. This practice is linked to the Passover event, where the firstborn of Israel were spared, and thus, they belonged to God (<a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>). The age of one month signifies the child&#8217;s survival past the most vulnerable period of infancy, marking him as a viable member of the community.<p><b>according to your valuation: five shekels of silver</b><br>The valuation of five shekels of silver for the redemption of a firstborn son reflects the economic conditions and standards of the time. Silver was a common medium of exchange in the ancient Near East, and the specified amount indicates a standardized value for this religious obligation. This valuation underscores the importance of the firstborn and the need for a tangible expression of redemption. The use of silver also points to the preciousness of life and the cost of redemption, which can be seen as a type pointing to the ultimate redemption through Christ, who was betrayed for thirty pieces of silver (<a href="/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>).<p><b>according to the sanctuary shekel</b><br>The sanctuary shekel was a specific standard of weight used in the tabernacle and later the temple, ensuring uniformity and fairness in religious transactions. This standardization reflects the order and precision required in worship and offerings to God. The sanctuary shekel was heavier than the common shekel, emphasizing the sacred nature of the transaction. This precision in measurement can be seen as a reflection of God's holiness and the need for integrity in worship.<p><b>which is twenty gerahs</b><br>A gerah was a small unit of weight, and twenty gerahs equaled one shekel. This detail highlights the meticulous nature of the law and the importance of exactness in fulfilling God's commands. The use of gerahs in this context underscores the thoroughness with which God&#8217;s people were to approach their obligations, ensuring that nothing was left to chance or personal interpretation. This precision can be seen as a foreshadowing of the fulfillment of the law in Christ, who perfectly met all the requirements of the law on behalf of humanity (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God to whom the laws and commandments were given, including the instructions for redemption.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>The tribe set apart for priestly duties, responsible for the spiritual leadership and service in the tabernacle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God among His people, where the Levites served and where offerings and redemptions were made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the law from God and communicated it to the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctuary_shekel.htm">The Sanctuary Shekel</a></b><br>A unit of currency used in the tabernacle, specifically mentioned as the standard for redemption.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_redemption.htm">Understanding Redemption</a></b><br>Redemption in the Old Testament was a physical and financial transaction, symbolizing spiritual truths.

Rather than taking each firstborn child into tabernacle service, God accepted a ransom&#8212;&#8220;redemption&#8221;&#8212;that released the child back to the family while still acknowledging His ownership.<p>&#8226; This tangible payment reminded parents that life belongs to God first (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>) and pointed forward to the greater ransom accomplished by Christ (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Mary and Joseph obeyed this very command when they presented Jesus at the temple (<a href="/luke/2-22.htm">Luke 2:22-24</a>), showing its ongoing validity until Christ fulfilled the Law.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for a month-old male</b><p>&#8226; The payment was not made at birth but once the child reached thirty days, a point at which infant mortality had lessened and personhood within the covenant community was publicly affirmed (compare <a href="/leviticus/27-6.htm">Leviticus 27:6</a>, where a thirty-day threshold also appears).<p>&#8226; This timing underscored both the value of the child and God&#8217;s patience, giving families time to prepare for obedience.<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; presentation at roughly forty days fits the same window (<a href="/luke/2-22.htm">Luke 2:22</a>), highlighting His parents&#8217; faithfulness and the continuity of God&#8217;s requirements.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>according to your valuation</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Valuation&#8221; refers to an official assessment overseen by the priests (<a href="/leviticus/27-2.htm">Leviticus 27:2, 12</a>).<p>&#8226; In this case, God Himself fixed the amount, but the phrase stresses that the priestly authority certified every transaction&#8212;no shortcuts, no substitutions (<a href="/malachi/1-8.htm">Malachi 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226; By submitting to the priest&#8217;s valuation, parents acknowledged both God&#8217;s standard and the mediating role of the priesthood (<a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>five shekels of silver</b><p>&#8226; The fee was identical for rich and poor, symbolizing that every soul carries equal worth before God (<a href="/numbers/3-47.htm">Numbers 3:47</a>; compare <a href="/exodus/30-15.htm">Exodus 30:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Silver consistently pictures redemption in Scripture&#8212;e.g., the silver sockets under the tabernacle boards that upheld God&#8217;s dwelling (<a href="/exodus/26-19.htm">Exodus 26:19-25</a>) and the thirty pieces of silver that Judas misused (<a href="/matthew/27-3.htm">Matthew 27:3-10</a>).<p>&#8226; At roughly 100 grams total weight, five sanctuary shekels represented a significant yet attainable sum, teaching that redemption is costly but accessible.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>according to the sanctuary shekel</b><p>&#8226; All payments had to match the temple&#8217;s standard weight, safeguarding fairness (<a href="/leviticus/27-25.htm">Leviticus 27:25</a>).<p>&#8226; A &#8220;sanctuary shekel&#8221; eliminated regional discrepancies and personal cheating, upholding the purity of worship and justice (<a href="/proverbs/11-1.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Since the sanctuary belonged to God, using its measure proclaimed that His standards&#8212;not human convenience&#8212;govern every act of worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which is twenty gerahs</b><p>&#8226; God even defined the sub-unit (&#8220;gerah,&#8221; about 0.5 grams) so no one could claim ignorance (<a href="/ezekiel/45-12.htm">Ezekiel 45:12</a>).<p>&#8226; This precision reveals the Lord&#8217;s detailed care for both worship and daily economics; nothing is too small for His authority.<p>&#8226; Clarity about weights and measures anticipated the gospel truth that God&#8217;s terms of salvation are likewise fixed and trustworthy (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/18-16.htm">Numbers 18:16</a> lays out God&#8217;s clear, gracious plan for redeeming a firstborn son: at one month old the parents bring five sanctuary shekels&#8212;exactly twenty gerahs each&#8212;to the priest. Every detail underscores divine ownership of life, the equal value of every soul, and the certainty that redemption comes only on God&#8217;s terms. The command looked back to the Passover rescue and forward to Christ, the ultimate Redeemer, who paid the full price for all who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">According to thine estimation.--</span>See <a href="/context/leviticus/18-3.htm" title="After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein you dwelled, shall you not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, where I bring you, shall you not do: neither shall you walk in their ordinances.">Leviticus 18:3-7</a>, and Notes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From a month old.</span> Literally, "from the monthly child," as soon as they reach the age of one month. <span class="cmt_word">According to thine estimation.</span> See on Leviticus 5:15; 27:2-7. It would seem that the priest was to make the valuation for the people, since each first-born or firstling was separately claimed by God, and had to be separately redeemed; but at the same time, to prevent extortion, the sum which the priest might assess was fixed by God. <span class="cmt_word">For the money of five shekels.</span> About seventeen shillings of our money (see <a href="/numbers/3-47.htm">Numbers 3:47</a>). It is extremely drill cult to estimate the number of first-born, but it is evident that in any case a large income must have accrued to the priests in this way. No value is here set upon the firstlings of unclean beasts; in the most usual ease, that of the ass, the rule had been laid down in <a href="/exodus/13-13.htm">Exodus 13:13</a>; and in other cases it was apparently left to the discretion of the priests, subject to the right of the owner, if he saw fit, to destroy the animal rather than pay for it (see <a href="/leviticus/27-27.htm">Leviticus 27:27</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/18-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You are to pay the redemption price</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1456;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1464;&#1493;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#363;&#183;y&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
