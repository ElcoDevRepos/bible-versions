It is mentioned in the context of the Israelites' 40-year journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. Libnah, meaning "whiteness," may have been named for its white soil or stones. The journey from Libnah signifies a stage in the Israelites' progression towards the fulfillment of God's promise. This movement reflects the transient nature of their journey, emphasizing reliance on God's guidance. Libnah later appears in the conquest narratives, indicating its continued significance in Israel's history.<p><b>and camped at Rissah.</b><br>Rissah, meaning "dew" or "drizzle," is another encampment site during the Israelites' wilderness wanderings. The exact location of Rissah is uncertain, but its mention highlights the detailed record of the Israelites' journey. The movement from one camp to another underscores the nomadic lifestyle of the Israelites during this period. This stage of the journey can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual progress and the need for perseverance in faith. The transition from Libnah to Rissah is part of the broader narrative of God's faithfulness in leading His people to the Promised Land, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/libnah.htm">Libnah</a></b><br>A location where the Israelites camped during their wilderness journey.

The phrase highlights forward movement that God directed (<a href="/numbers/33-2.htm">Numbers 33:2</a>; <a href="/exodus/40-36.htm">Exodus 40:36-38</a>).<p>&#8226; Every departure in Israel&#8217;s journey came after the cloud lifted, underscoring obedience to God&#8217;s timing (<a href="/numbers/9-17.htm">Numbers 9:17-23</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminds us the wilderness season was not random wandering but a series of purposeful stages ordained by the LORD (<a href="/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from Libnah</b><p>&#8226; Libnah means &#8220;whiteness,&#8221; a location most likely in the wilderness of Zin (<a href="/numbers/33-20.htm">Numbers 33:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, the name appears in accounts of victory under Joshua (<a href="/joshua/10-29.htm">Joshua 10:29-32</a>), hinting that God would later give Israel possession of places they merely passed through now.<p>&#8226;

Camping speaks of temporary rest under divine protection (<a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern of moving, then pitching camp, portrays a rhythm of trust: active obedience followed by settled dependence (<a href="/exodus/14-15.htm">Exodus 14:15</a>; 16:13-15).<p>&#8226; Each camp also served as a classroom where Israel learned lessons of provision, discipline, and worship (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at Rissah</b><p>&#8226;
