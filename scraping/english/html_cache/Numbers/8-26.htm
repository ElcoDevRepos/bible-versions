The Levites, who were set apart for service in the Tabernacle, had specific age-related duties. <a href="/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a> specifies that Levites were to serve from age 30 to 50. After reaching 50, they were no longer required to perform the heavy labor associated with the Tabernacle service. Instead, they were to assist their younger brethren. This reflects a respect for the wisdom and experience of older Levites, allowing them to mentor and support the younger generation. The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and sacrifice for the Israelites during their wilderness journey, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<p><b>but they themselves are not to do the work</b><br>This clause emphasizes the cessation of active labor for Levites over the age of 50. The work referred to includes the physical tasks of setting up, taking down, and transporting the Tabernacle, as well as performing sacrifices and other rituals. This division of labor ensured that the physically demanding tasks were carried out by those in their prime, while still valuing the contributions of older Levites in advisory and supportive roles. This principle of assigning tasks based on capability and age can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament teaching on the body of Christ, where each member has a unique role (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>This is how you are to assign responsibilities to the Levites.</b><br>This final phrase provides a directive for the organization and management of the Levitical duties. The Levites were chosen by God to serve in the Tabernacle, taking the place of the firstborn of Israel (<a href="/numbers/3-12.htm">Numbers 3:12-13</a>). Their responsibilities were divinely ordained and structured to ensure the proper functioning of worship and service. This structure reflects God's order and care in the administration of His people, paralleling the New Testament church's organization, where roles and responsibilities are given by the Holy Spirit for the edification of the body (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-13</a>). The Levites' service also foreshadows the priesthood of all believers, as described in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, where each believer has a role in serving God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties and service in the Tabernacle, later the Temple.

The duties of the Levite over fifty were in fact honorary, given to him probably for his own sake, that he might have some place and post in the house of God. This careful provision for those who should attain the age of fifty shows that the commandment was designed for the promised land rather than for the wilderness. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/8-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After that, they may assist</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1512;&#1461;&#1448;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#183;r&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
