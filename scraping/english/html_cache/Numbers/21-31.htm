After years of wandering in the wilderness, this marks a significant transition to occupying a land. It reflects God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promise to give the Israelites a place to dwell. This settlement is temporary, as the ultimate goal is the Promised Land, Canaan. The act of living in a land also implies a degree of control and dominion, which is a fulfillment of God's covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><b>in the land of the Amorites.</b><br>The Amorites were a significant Canaanite tribe known for their strength and influence in the region. Historically, they were one of the peoples that God promised to drive out before the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/23-23.htm">Exodus 23:23</a>). The land of the Amorites here refers to the territory east of the Jordan River, which includes the regions of Heshbon and Bashan. This area was conquered under the leadership of Moses, as recorded earlier in <a href="/numbers/21.htm">Numbers 21</a>. The conquest of the Amorite land is a testament to God's power and the fulfillment of His promises, as well as a foreshadowing of the future conquests in Canaan under Joshua. The Amorites' defeat also serves as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, as the Israelites' victory over their enemies prefigures the spiritual victories believers have through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, consisting of the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
