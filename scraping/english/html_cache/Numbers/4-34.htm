Moses, as the prophet and lawgiver, and Aaron, as the high priest, were responsible for spiritual and civil leadership. The "leaders of the congregation" refers to the heads of the tribes or elders who assisted in governance. This structure reflects the theocratic leadership model where God&#8217;s law was central, and leaders were chosen to implement it. This phrase highlights the importance of organized leadership in maintaining order and fulfilling God&#8217;s commands.<p><b>numbered the Kohathites</b><br>The Kohathites were one of the three main divisions of the Levites, descended from Kohath, a son of Levi. Their specific role was to care for the most sacred objects of the tabernacle, such as the Ark of the Covenant, the table, the lampstand, and the altars. This census was crucial for organizing the duties and responsibilities of the Levites. The act of numbering signifies preparation and readiness for service, emphasizing the importance of each individual's role in the community. This also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of the body of Christ, where each member has a specific function (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>by their clans and families</b><br>The organization by clans and families underscores the importance of family and tribal identity in Israelite society. This structure ensured that duties were passed down through generations, maintaining continuity and tradition. It also reflects the covenantal promise to Abraham, where God promised to make his descendants a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). The emphasis on family and clan highlights the communal nature of worship and service to God, where each family had a role in the larger purpose of the nation. This organization is a precursor to the New Testament church, where believers are seen as a family united in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

Earlier God had said, &#8220;Take a census of the Kohathites&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/4-2.htm">Numbers 4:2</a>), and Moses takes that word literally. This consistent faithfulness frames Moses as a model leader&#8212;never substituting personal ideas for God&#8217;s commands (<a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>). For readers, the phrase underscores how divine directives move from revelation to action through obedient servants (<a href="/hebrews/3-2.htm">Hebrews 3:2&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Aaron</b><p>Aaron joins his brother because priestly oversight is essential. As high priest, he guards the holiness of tabernacle service (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-32.htm">Leviticus 16:32&#8211;33</a>). His presence guarantees the census will align with ceremonial purity laws, since the Kohathites will carry the most sacred objects (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). The verse quietly reminds us that spiritual work must be supervised by those God appoints, not by self-appointed voices (<a href="/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the leaders of the congregation</b><p>The tribal chiefs (compare <a href="/numbers/1-4.htm">Numbers 1:4</a>; 7:2) stand alongside Moses and Aaron, showing that accountability is shared, not isolated. Their involvement:<p>&#8226; Confirms transparency&#8212;everyone can verify the count (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-21.htm">2 Corinthians 8:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Unites the whole nation behind its worship responsibilities (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-10.htm">Deuteronomy 29:10&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Prevents favoritism; the census is witnessed by leaders from every tribe.<p>God&#8217;s pattern values cooperative leadership while maintaining clear authority lines.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>numbered the Kohathites</b><p>&#8220;Numbered&#8221; is more than arithmetic. It sets apart every qualified Kohathite male (ages 30&#8211;50, <a href="/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>) for hands-on service: carrying the ark, table, lampstand, altars, and utensils once Aaron&#8217;s sons cover them (<a href="/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4&#8211;15</a>). Cross references amplify the gravity of this task&#8212;Uzzah&#8217;s fatal mishandling of the ark (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6&#8211;7</a>) stresses why exact rosters matter. Counting ensures:<p>&#8226; No unqualified person touches holy items (<a href="/numbers/1-51.htm">Numbers 1:51</a>).<p>&#8226; Enough manpower exists for the journey (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>).<p>Literal record-keeping protects life and honors God&#8217;s holiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by their clans and families</b><p>God organizes ministry through households (<a href="/genesis/18-19.htm">Genesis 18:19</a>). Listing &#8220;by their clans and families&#8221; safeguards inheritance lines (<a href="/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1&#8211;7</a>) and keeps service responsibility embedded in everyday life. Each father teaches the next generation its calling (<a href="/psalms/78-5.htm">Psalm 78:5&#8211;7</a>). In the broader biblical story, this pattern prepares Israel for Messiah&#8217;s traced lineage (<a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>). Orderly families strengthen orderly worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/4-34.htm">Numbers 4:34</a> illustrates obedient, orderly leadership. Moses acts on God&#8217;s word; Aaron provides priestly oversight; tribal leaders supply accountability; every Kohathite is counted for specific, holy work; and all is organized by family. The verse shows that sacred service thrives when God&#8217;s people follow His instructions exactly, value teamwork, and honor family structure&#8212;principles still vital for faithful ministry today.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/4-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Moses,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1447;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Aaron,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1435;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;ha&#774;&#183;r&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
