The earth opening up is a literal event that signifies God's direct intervention. This act of the earth swallowing the rebels is unique and underscores the seriousness of their rebellion against Moses and Aaron, who were God's appointed leaders. The imagery of the earth opening is reminiscent of the judgment seen in <a href="/genesis/4-11.htm">Genesis 4:11</a>, where the ground receives Abel's blood, indicating a divine response to sin.<p><b>along with Korah</b><br>Korah was a Levite who led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, challenging their leadership and the priesthood. His rebellion is significant because it represents a direct challenge to God's established order. Korah's fate serves as a reminder of the consequences of pride and rebellion against divine authority. This event is later referenced in <a href="/jude/1-11.htm">Jude 1:11</a> as a warning against false teachers and those who reject God's authority.<p><b>whose followers died when the fire consumed 250 men</b><br>The 250 men who followed Korah were leaders within the community, indicating that the rebellion had significant support. Their death by fire is a demonstration of God's holiness and the seriousness of approaching Him without His appointed mediator. This event parallels the fate of Nadab and Abihu in <a href="/leviticus/10.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>, who also faced divine fire for offering unauthorized incense, highlighting the importance of obedience to God's commands.<p><b>They serve as a warning sign</b><br>The judgment against Korah and his followers serves as a perpetual warning to the Israelites and future generations. It emphasizes the importance of respecting God's chosen leaders and the dangers of rebellion. This warning is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are cautioned against similar attitudes of rebellion and disobedience (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>).

The Samaritan Pentateuch, however, has a different reading here. It transposes the words "and Korah," and combines them with the words"and the two hundred and fifty men": thus--"when the fire devoured Korah and the two hundred and fifty men." (See Notes on <a href="/numbers/16-32.htm" title="And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained to Korah, and all their goods.">Numbers 16:32</a>; <a href="/numbers/16-35.htm" title="And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.">Numbers 16:35</a>.) It is possible that there may have been an omission here of the words which are found in <a href="/numbers/16-32.htm" title="And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained to Korah, and all their goods.">Numbers 16:32</a>, "all the men that appertained unto," or of words denoting "all the goods belonging to."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Swallowed them up together with Korah.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5ea;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>.

This distinct statement, which is not modified in the Targums, seems decisive as to the fate of Korah. If indeed it were quite certain from the detailed narrative in chapter 16 that Korah perished with his own company, and not with the Reubenites, then it might be deemed necessary to force this statement into accordance with that certainty; but it is nowhere stated, or even clearly implied, that he perished by fire, and therefore there is no excuse for doing violence to the obvious meaning of this verse. Korah, Dathan, and Abiram were swallowed up, we are told, at the same time that Korah's company were consumed by fire; that is a clear statement, and cannot be set aside by any supposed necessity for avenging the sacri1egious ambition of Korah by the element of fire. <span class="cmt_word">And they became a sign.</span> The Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>properly means a banner or ensign, and is unusual in this sense.
