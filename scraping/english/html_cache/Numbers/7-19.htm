The silver platter, or dish, is a significant item, symbolizing wealth and dedication. The weight of a hundred and thirty shekels indicates a substantial offering, reflecting the importance of the occasion. The use of silver, a precious metal, underscores the value and purity expected in offerings to God. This act of giving is reminiscent of the offerings made for the construction of the Tabernacle in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25:1-7</a>, where the Israelites contributed materials for the dwelling place of God.<p><b>and one silver bowl weighing seventy shekels</b><br>The silver bowl, like the platter, is a valuable item, further emphasizing the generosity and devotion of the giver. The specific weight of seventy shekels, according to the sanctuary shekel, indicates a standardized measure used in the religious context, ensuring fairness and consistency in offerings. This standardization is crucial for maintaining order and integrity in worship practices. The bowl's use in the offering can be seen as a type of the vessels used in the Temple, which were later fulfilled in the person of Jesus Christ, who is described as the ultimate vessel of God's presence (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>both according to the sanctuary shekel</b><br>The sanctuary shekel was a specific weight standard used in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple. This standardization ensured that all offerings were measured equally, reflecting God's justice and order. The use of the sanctuary shekel highlights the importance of precision and honesty in worship, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35-36</a>, where fair measures are commanded. This principle of fairness and integrity in offerings is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to give generously and honestly (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>).<p><b>and filled with fine flour mixed with oil for a grain offering</b><br>The grain offering, consisting of fine flour mixed with oil, represents sustenance and the fruits of human labor. This offering is a symbol of thanksgiving and dedication to God, acknowledging His provision and blessing. The use of fine flour indicates the best quality, reflecting the principle of giving God the first and best of what one has, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>. The oil, often associated with anointing and the Holy Spirit, adds a spiritual dimension to the offering, symbolizing consecration and the presence of God. This offering prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), providing spiritual nourishment and fulfillment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the instructions from God regarding the offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_judah.htm">Tribe of Judah</a></b><br>The tribe that presented the offerings on the first day, as described in the broader context of <a href="/bsb/numbers/7.htm">Numbers 7</a>.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The sacred tent of meeting where the offerings were brought and presented to the Lord.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offering.htm">Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice in which the entire animal was consumed by fire, symbolizing complete dedication to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nashon_son_of_amminadab.htm">Nashon son of Amminadab</a></b><br>The leader of the tribe of Judah who brought the offerings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_sacrifice.htm">Symbolism of Sacrifice</a></b><br>The burnt offering represents total surrender to God.
