The completion of the tabernacle followed detailed instructions given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai (Exodus 25-31). The tabernacle's construction was a communal effort, involving contributions and skilled labor from the Israelites (Exodus 35-40). This event signifies the transition from the Israelites' nomadic lifestyle to a more structured form of worship. The tabernacle served as a precursor to the Temple in Jerusalem, highlighting the importance of a designated holy space for worship.<p><b>he anointed and consecrated it and all its furnishings</b><br>Anointing and consecration were essential for setting apart the tabernacle and its furnishings for holy use. Anointing with oil symbolized the presence and blessing of God, and it was a common practice for sanctifying priests, kings, and sacred objects (<a href="/exodus/30-22.htm">Exodus 30:22-29</a>). The act of consecration involved dedicating the tabernacle to God's service, ensuring that it was pure and holy. This process reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness, where God calls His people and their worship practices to be distinct from the surrounding nations (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>).<p><b>along with the altar and all its utensils</b><br>The altar was central to the sacrificial system, which was a key aspect of Israelite worship. Sacrifices offered on the altar were a means of atonement and fellowship with God (Leviticus 1-7). The utensils used in the tabernacle, such as bowls, basins, and tongs, were also consecrated, emphasizing the meticulous care required in worship. This attention to detail underscores the reverence and obedience expected in approaching God. The altar and its sacrifices foreshadow the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the sacrificial system through His death and resurrection (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and guide them through the wilderness.

Completion matters to God (cf. <a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The tabernacle was not a human brainstorm but a divine blueprint; finishing it meant every socket, board, and curtain matched God&#8217;s pattern (<a href="/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>).<p>&#8226; In our lives, partial obedience is incomplete obedience.

The passage calls us to finish the work He assigns, devote every area to His rule, and remember that true access to His presence rests on a consecrated sacrifice&#8212;ultimately fulfilled in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the day that Moses had</span> fully <span class="cmt_word">set up the tabernacle.</span> This expression, "on the day" (Hebrew, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1fc6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;</span>), has given rise to considerable difficulty. Strictly speaking it should mean the first day of the first month of the second year (<a href="/exodus/40-17.htm">Exodus 40:17</a>); and so the Targum of Palestine, "It was on the day which begins the month Nisan." It is, however, quite clear from the narrative itself, as well as from its position, that the offerings were not actually made until after the taking of the census and the distribution of their respective duties to the Levitical families, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, until the eve of the departure from Sinai. Moreover, since the same phrase, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, occurs in verse 10, it is certain that it cannot apply to the actual presentation of the offerings, which was spread over twelve days (verse 11). The majority, therefore, of the commentators would read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span> here as in <a href="/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>, "at the time." It is, however, impossible to admit that there is any similarity whatever between the two passages. In <a href="/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a> the context itself, as well as the subject matter, oblige us to understand the phrase in the looser sense; but in a plain historical account such as the present the obligation is all the other way. Either the date here given is a mistake (which, on any supposition, is most improbable), or it must be referred to the intention and inception of the princely offerings, the actual presentation being made at the time indicated in the narrative, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, in the first half of the second month. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> <span class="cmt_word">had anointed</span> it. From <a href="/leviticus/8-10.htm">Leviticus 8:10</a>, as compared with <a href="/exodus/40-35.htm">Exodus 40:35</a>, it would rather appear that Moses did not anoint the tabernacle on the day it was set up, but on some subsequent day. It is, however, a mistake to suppose that the tabernacle and the holy things were anointed through seven successive days: the statement in <a href="/leviticus/8-33.htm">Leviticus 8:33-35</a> refers only to the consecration of the priests. Since the anointing of the tabernacle was connected with the setting of it up, as the last act of one ceremonial, and was only unavoidably postponed, there is nothing remarkable in the two things being spoken of as if they had taken place on one and the same day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/7-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On the day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
