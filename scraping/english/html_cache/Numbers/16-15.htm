In the biblical context, anger is often seen as a response to injustice or rebellion against God. Moses, as a leader chosen by God, is reacting to the rebellion of Korah and his followers, who challenge his God-given authority. This anger aligns with other instances in Scripture where leaders express anger in defense of God's honor, such as Jesus cleansing the temple (<a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13-17</a>).<p><b>and said to the LORD</b><br>Moses' immediate response is to turn to God in prayer, demonstrating his reliance on divine guidance and justice. This reflects a pattern seen throughout Moses' leadership, where he consistently seeks God's counsel in times of crisis. It underscores the importance of prayer and communication with God, especially when facing opposition or conflict.<p><b>&#8220;Do not regard their offering.</b><br>Moses requests that God not accept the offerings of the rebellious group. In the cultural and religious context of ancient Israel, offerings were a means of seeking favor or forgiveness from God. By asking God to disregard their offerings, Moses is essentially asking God to reject their attempt to legitimize their rebellion. This highlights the principle that God values obedience and a right heart over ritualistic offerings (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p><b>I have not taken one donkey from them</b><br>Moses defends his integrity by stating he has not taken anything from the people, not even a donkey, which was a valuable asset in that time. This assertion of honesty and fairness is crucial in establishing his credibility as a leader. It echoes Samuel's similar defense of his integrity in <a href="/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3-5</a>, emphasizing the importance of leaders being above reproach.<p><b>or mistreated a single one of them.&#8221;</b><br>Moses further asserts that he has not wronged any of the people, highlighting his just and fair treatment of them. This is important in the context of the accusations against him, as it demonstrates that the rebellion is unfounded. It also reflects the biblical principle that leaders should be shepherds who care for their flock, as seen in the example of Jesus, the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt.
