Jealousy in this context refers to a husband's suspicion of his wife's infidelity, which could disrupt the family unit and community harmony. The feeling of jealousy is acknowledged as a natural human emotion, but it is also seen as a potential threat to marital fidelity and social order. This provision in the law reflects the importance of maintaining trust and purity within the marriage covenant, which is a reflection of God's covenant with His people.<p><b>and he suspects his wife.</b><br>The suspicion of infidelity was a serious matter in the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel. Adultery was not only a personal betrayal but also a violation of the covenant community's standards. The suspicion needed to be addressed to prevent false accusations and ensure justice. This reflects the broader biblical theme of truth and justice, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15-21</a>, which emphasizes the need for evidence and fair treatment in legal matters.<p><b>He is to have the woman stand before the LORD,</b><br>Standing before the LORD indicates bringing the matter into the divine presence, acknowledging that God is the ultimate judge of truth and righteousness. This act underscores the belief that God is intimately involved in the lives of His people and that His presence is central to resolving disputes. The tabernacle, where this would take place, was the physical representation of God's dwelling among His people, emphasizing the seriousness and sacredness of the proceedings.<p><b>and the priest is to apply to her this entire law.</b><br>The priest acted as an intermediary between God and the people, administering the law and ensuring that the process was conducted according to divine instructions. This reflects the role of the priesthood in maintaining the holiness and order of the community. The "entire law" refers to the specific ritual outlined in <a href="/numbers/5-11.htm">Numbers 5:11-31</a>, which was designed to reveal the truth of the situation. This ritual underscores the importance of divine justice and the need for a process that both protects the innocent and convicts the guilty. The involvement of the priest also points to the need for spiritual discernment and guidance in resolving complex personal and communal issues.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jealous_husband.htm">The Jealous Husband</a></b><br>A man who experiences a feeling of jealousy and suspects his wife of infidelity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_suspected_wife.htm">The Suspected Wife</a></b><br>The woman who is suspected of being unfaithful by her husband.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>The religious leader responsible for carrying out the ritual prescribed in the law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, before whom the ritual is performed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ritual_of_jealousy.htm">The Ritual of Jealousy</a></b><br>A specific ceremony outlined in the Mosaic Law to address suspicions of marital unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_jealousy.htm">The Seriousness of Jealousy</a></b><br>Jealousy is a powerful emotion that can lead to destructive behavior.
