It suggests a misunderstanding of God's power and faithfulness. Theologically, it challenges the notion of God's omnipotence, which is a central tenet of the faith. The context here is the Israelites' rebellion and lack of faith, which led to their punishment of wandering in the wilderness for 40 years (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>). This phrase also echoes the covenantal promise God made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob regarding the land of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 26</a>:3, 28:13). Theologically, it underscores the importance of human obedience and faith in the fulfillment of divine promises.<p><b>He has slaughtered them in the wilderness</b><br>This phrase refers to the consequence of the Israelites' disobedience and lack of faith. The "slaughter" is not a literal massacre but a divine judgment resulting in the death of the generation that left Egypt, except for Joshua and Caleb (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-30</a>). This judgment serves as a warning and a lesson about the seriousness of unbelief and rebellion against God. Historically, the wilderness period was a time of testing and preparation for the new generation that would enter the Promised Land. Theologically, it prefigures the concept of spiritual death due to sin and the need for faith and obedience to enter God's rest, as later expounded in <a href="/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16-19</a>. This also typologically points to Jesus Christ, who, unlike the Israelites, perfectly obeyed God and leads believers into the ultimate Promised Land, eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who led the Israelites out of Egypt and promised them the land of Canaan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert area where the Israelites wandered for 40 years due to their disobedience and lack of faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who interceded on their behalf when God threatened to destroy them for their rebellion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land (Canaan)</a></b><br>The land promised by God to Abraham and his descendants, representing God's faithfulness and blessing.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_vs._human_unbelief.htm">God's Faithfulness vs. Human Unbelief</a></b><br>Despite human failure, God's promises remain steadfast.

Of course, the very history of Israel proves the opposite:<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a> records the Red Sea&#8217;s parting&#8212;hardly the act of an impotent God.<p>&#8226; Moses had already prayed against this very accusation in <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-12</a>, reminding God that Egypt would say, &#8220;With evil intent He brought them out&#8230; to kill them in the mountains.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17</a> later exclaims, &#8220;Ah, Lord GOD! You made the heavens and the earth&#8230; nothing is too difficult for You.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a> has the Lord asking, &#8220;How long will they not believe in Me, despite all the signs I have performed?&#8221; The people&#8217;s unbelief, not God&#8217;s inability, is the issue.<p>The phrase highlights how human unbelief twists reality, attempting to blame God for consequences that flow from rejecting Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to bring this people</b><p>&#8220;These people&#8221; are God&#8217;s covenant people&#8212;chosen, redeemed, and carried &#8220;on eagles&#8217; wings&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-4.htm">Exodus 19:4</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7-8</a> shows God&#8217;s intention: &#8220;I will take you as My own people&#8230; and bring you into the land.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/100-3.htm">Psalm 100:3</a> reminds us, &#8220;We are His people, and the sheep of His pasture.&#8221;<p>Yet the same people who had been singled out for blessing allowed fear (<a href="/numbers/13-31.htm">Numbers 13:31-33</a>) to eclipse faith. Their identity in the Lord should have inspired confidence, but instead it magnified their responsibility. When the people doubted, the greatness of their calling only intensified the seriousness of their refusal to trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into the land He swore to give them</b><p>The land promise goes back to God&#8217;s oath to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>). By oath God bound His own reputation to Israel&#8217;s entry.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/1-8.htm">Deuteronomy 1:8</a> says, &#8220;See, I have placed the land before you. Go in and possess it, as the LORD swore to your fathers.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a> will later testify, &#8220;Not one of all the LORD&#8217;s good promises&#8230; failed; every one was fulfilled.&#8221;<p>So when Moses repeats this phrase in his intercession (<a href="/numbers/14-17.htm">Numbers 14:17-19</a>), he appeals to God&#8217;s faithfulness. The Lord&#8217;s honor is tied to keeping His word; He cannot break covenant. The question, then, is not whether God will keep the promise, but how He will do so while judging unbelief.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He has slaughtered them in the wilderness.</b><p>The word &#8220;slaughtered&#8221; underlines the severity of judgment. Yet the deaths in the wilderness were not random; they were the just consequence of persistent unbelief.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/95-10.htm">Psalm 95:10-11</a> recalls God&#8217;s verdict: &#8220;They shall never enter My rest.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-5.htm">1 Corinthians 10:5</a> comments, &#8220;With most of them God was not pleased; their bodies were scattered in the wilderness.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/3-17.htm">Hebrews 3:17-19</a> states that they could not enter &#8220;because of unbelief.&#8221;<p>Importantly, the discipline fell on the unbelieving generation, while their children would inherit the land (<a href="/numbers/14-31.htm">Numbers 14:31</a>). God&#8217;s judgment and mercy function together, preserving His promise even as He upholds His holiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/14-16.htm">Numbers 14:16</a> voices the nations&#8217; mockery&#8212;&#8220;Your God couldn&#8217;t finish what He started.&#8221; The charge is false:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s power had been displayed in Egypt and at Sinai.<p>&#8226; His covenant people were secure in His choice, though responsible to respond in faith.<p>&#8226; His oath-bound promise of the land remained intact.<p>&#8226; The wilderness deaths showcased not God&#8217;s weakness but His holiness and justice against unbelief.<p>In short, the verse reveals how unbelief distorts God&#8217;s character, while His subsequent actions vindicate His power, faithfulness, and righteousness all at once.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land.</span> Moral or religious difficulties could not be comprehended by those heathen nations as standing in the way of God's purposes.
