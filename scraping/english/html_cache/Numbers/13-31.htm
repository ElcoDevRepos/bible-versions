The "men" are the ten spies who accompanied Joshua and Caleb. Their report contrasts with the faith-filled perspective of Joshua and Caleb. This reflects a recurring theme in the Bible where a minority stands firm in faith against the majority's fear or disbelief, as seen in the stories of Noah and Elijah.<p><b>We cannot go up against the people</b><br>The spies express their lack of faith and fear of the Canaanites. This statement reveals a failure to trust in God's promise to give Israel the land. Historically, the Canaanites were known for their fortified cities and warrior culture, which could have intimidated the Israelites. This lack of faith is a recurring issue for the Israelites, as seen in their complaints and rebellions throughout the wilderness journey.<p><b>for they are stronger than we are!</b><br>The spies' assessment is based on human perspective rather than divine assurance. The Canaanites were indeed formidable, with giants like the Anakim among them, as mentioned in other parts of Scripture. However, the Israelites' fear overlooks God's power and past deliverances, such as the Exodus from Egypt. This phrase highlights the tension between walking by sight versus walking by faith, a theme echoed in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spies.htm">The Spies</a></b><br>Twelve men, one from each tribe of Israel, were sent by Moses to scout the land of Canaan.

Their identity matters because they were leaders (<a href="/numbers/13-3.htm">Numbers 13:3</a>), men whose words carried weight. When leaders lose heart, the whole camp trembles (<a href="/1_kings/18-22.htm">1 Kings 18:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/15-14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>). Their &#8220;but&#8221; signals a contrast&#8212;Caleb has just voiced confidence (<a href="/numbers/13-30.htm">Numbers 13:30</a>), yet these men immediately counter him. Unbelief often rises quickest when faith speaks up (<a href="/acts/19-9.htm">Acts 19:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who had gone up with him</b><p>They saw the same land, the same giants, the same fortified cities (<a href="/numbers/13-28.htm">Numbers 13:28</a>). Experience alone doesn&#8217;t produce faith; response to God&#8217;s promise does (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>). Like Lot&#8217;s wife who looked back though she had physically left Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-26.htm">Genesis 19:26</a>), these spies returned in body but not in spirit. The trip only exposed what was already dominating their hearts (<a href="/mark/4-18.htm">Mark 4:18&#8211;19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>replied</b><p>Their reply is public and immediate. Words spread fear faster than facts (<a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5&#8211;6</a>). Notice they reply to Caleb, not to God. Dialogue that ignores God&#8217;s voice quickly turns into discouragement (<a href="/malachi/3-13.htm">Malachi 3:13&#8211;14</a>). Where Caleb drew courage from God&#8217;s oath (<a href="/exodus/6-8.htm">Exodus 6:8</a>), these men speak only from human calculation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We cannot go up against the people</b><p>This is the core confession of unbelief&#8212;&#8220;we cannot.&#8221; Yet God had already said, &#8220;I am giving the Israelites this land&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/13-2.htm">Numbers 13:2</a>). Declaring inability in the face of divine guarantee is rebellion (<a href="/hebrews/3-18.htm">Hebrews 3:18&#8211;19</a>). Compare Saul&#8217;s &#8220;I thought&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/13-11.htm">1 Samuel 13:11&#8211;12</a>) and the disciples&#8217; &#8220;We have only five loaves&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/14-17.htm">Matthew 14:17</a>). In each case, human limitation eclipses divine provision when faith falters.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for they are stronger than we are!</b><p>The spies measure themselves against giants instead of measuring giants against God (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45&#8211;47</a>). Size disparity was real, yet irrelevant where the Lord fights (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-1.htm">Deuteronomy 9:1&#8211;3</a>). Fear magnifies obstacles and minimizes God (<a href="/psalms/34-3.htm">Psalm 34:3</a>). Caleb later recalls that the Anakim &#8220;dissolved the hearts of the people&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/14-8.htm">Joshua 14:8</a>), showing how one fearful statement can melt courage (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-28.htm">Deuteronomy 1:28</a>). Unbelief forgets past victories like the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30&#8211;31</a>) and views future promises through the lens of self-strength.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/13-31.htm">Numbers 13:31</a> captures the pivot from faith to fear. Ten leaders erase God&#8217;s promise with a single sentence: &#8220;We cannot&#8230; they are stronger.&#8221; Their outlook ignores God&#8217;s past deeds, disregards His explicit word, and infects the camp with despair. The verse warns that unbelief speaks loudly, spreads quickly, and calculates without God. Faith looks at the same facts and says, &#8220;Let us go up at once&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/13-30.htm">Numbers 13:30</a>); fear looks and says, &#8220;We cannot.&#8221; The choice between those two voices still defines every step of obedient living today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they are stronger than we.</span> In point of numbers the enormous superiority of the Israelites over any combination likely to oppose them must have been evident to the most cowardly.
