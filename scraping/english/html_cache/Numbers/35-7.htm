Unlike the other tribes, they did not receive a large territorial inheritance in the Promised Land. Instead, they were given specific cities scattered throughout the territories of the other tribes. This distribution ensured that the Levites could fulfill their roles as spiritual leaders and teachers across the nation. The allocation of cities to the Levites reflects God's provision for their needs and His desire for them to be integrated into the community life of Israel, serving as a constant reminder of God's presence and law.<p><b>will be forty-eight</b><br>The number forty-eight is significant as it represents the completeness of God's provision for the Levites. These cities were strategically located to ensure that the Levites could minister effectively to all the tribes. The number also symbolizes the comprehensive nature of God's care and the importance of the Levites' role in maintaining the spiritual health of the nation. This allocation can be seen as a type of Christ, who is present and accessible to all believers, providing spiritual guidance and sustenance.<p><b>with their corresponding pasturelands</b><br>The inclusion of pasturelands with the cities was essential for the Levites' sustenance, as they did not have large tracts of land for agriculture. These pasturelands provided for their livestock, which was a primary source of food and resources. This provision underscores the principle of God's care for those who serve Him, ensuring that their physical needs are met while they focus on spiritual duties. The pasturelands also symbolize the spiritual nourishment that the Levites were to provide to the people, much like how Christ, the Good Shepherd, provides for His flock.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>The tribe of Levi, set apart for religious duties and service to the Tabernacle, and later the Temple.

Earlier, in <a href="/numbers/35-1.htm">Numbers 35:1&#8211;5</a>, the LORD had already instructed Moses to carve out space within Israel&#8217;s tribal allotments for the Levites. This summary statement confirms that nothing was left vague; every tribe would contribute an exact share. Such specificity echoes God&#8217;s previous meticulous commands&#8212;think of the tabernacle measurements in <a href="/bsb/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25&#8211;27</a> or the census figures in <a href="/bsb/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>. He is a God of order, not randomness (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>), and the total here underlines His careful shepherding of His people&#8217;s practical needs.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you give the Levites</b><p>The Levites were set apart &#8220;to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD, to minister to Him and to bless in His name&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>). Because &#8220;the LORD is their inheritance&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-9.htm">Deuteronomy 10:9</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-14.htm">Joshua 13:14</a>), they received no large contiguous territory like the other tribes. Instead, God wove them into the national fabric through donated cities. This arrangement fulfilled Jacob&#8217;s prophetic blessing over Levi&#8212;scattered yet honored in service (<a href="/genesis/49-5.htm">Genesis 49:5-7</a>). Each tribe&#8217;s gift of city-space became a tangible partnership in worship life, making the Levites accessible across the land (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-8.htm">2 Chronicles 17:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will be forty-eight</b><p>The exact number matters. Six of the forty-eight were Cities of Refuge (<a href="/numbers/35-6.htm">Numbers 35:6</a>; <a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7-9</a>), places where an accused manslayer could flee for a fair hearing&#8212;a vivid picture of justice and mercy metering side by side (<a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>). The remaining forty-two were standard Levitical towns (<a href="/joshua/21-41.htm">Joshua 21:41</a>). Altogether they formed a network strategically sprinkled &#8220;from the Negev to the hill country&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/21-9.htm">Joshua 21:9-19</a>), ensuring every Israelite lived within reach of Levitical teaching (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>; <a href="/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>). Forty-eight also provides mathematical symmetry: four cities from each of the twelve tribes, reflecting national unity around God&#8217;s law.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with their corresponding pasturelands</b><p>Each city came &#8220;with their pasturelands around them&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/35-7.htm">Numbers 35:7</a>). These fields&#8212;measured carefully at &#8220;a thousand cubits on every side&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/35-4.htm">Numbers 35:4-5</a>)&#8212;supplied space for flocks, herds, and community gardens. Because Levites relied on tithes and offerings (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-24</a>), the pasturelands supplemented their livelihood, enabling them to focus on priestly duties without neglecting daily sustenance (<a href="/nehemiah/13-10.htm">Nehemiah 13:10-13</a>). Moreover, the green belts created a buffer, preserving each city&#8217;s sacred function and symbolizing fruitfulness for those who dwell near God (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/35-7.htm">Numbers 35:7</a> displays God&#8217;s precise, caring provision for His servants. Forty-eight cities&#8212;six for refuge, forty-two for regular ministry&#8212;were scattered among Israel so the Levites could teach, intercede, and model worship. The accompanying pasturelands safeguarded their practical needs. In this single sentence we see the LORD&#8217;s balance of order, justice, and compassion, weaving the ministry of His chosen servants into the everyday landscape of His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Forty</span> <span class="cmt_word">and eight cities.</span> The Levites numbered nearly 50,000 souls (see on Numbers 26:62), so that each Levitical city would have an average population of about 1000 to start with. There seems no sufficient reason for supposing that they shared their towns with men of the surrounding tribe. Even if the provision made for their habitation was excessive at first (which does not appear), yet their rate of increase should have been exceptionally high, inasmuch as they were not liable to military service. It is possible that mystical reasons led to the selection of the number forty-eight (12 x 4, both typical of universality), but it is at least equally probable that it was determined by the actual numbers of the tribe. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/35-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The total</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">number of cities</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1462;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
