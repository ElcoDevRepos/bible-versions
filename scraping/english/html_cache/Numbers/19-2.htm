Statutes in the Old Testament are specific decrees given by God, often related to ceremonial or moral law. This particular statute is unique to the purification rites in Israel, highlighting the seriousness of maintaining ritual purity. The use of "the LORD" underscores the authority and covenant relationship between God and Israel, as seen throughout the Pentateuch.<p><b>Instruct the Israelites:</b><br>The directive to instruct the Israelites indicates the communal nature of the law. It was not just for the priests but for the entire nation, reflecting the collective responsibility of maintaining holiness. This instruction is part of the broader covenantal framework where Israel is called to be a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). The role of Moses as the mediator of God's law is also emphasized here.<p><b>to bring you an unblemished red heifer:</b><br>The red heifer is central to the purification ritual. Its unblemished state signifies purity and perfection, essential for sacrificial offerings (<a href="/leviticus/22-20.htm">Leviticus 22:20-21</a>). The rarity of a red heifer, which must be entirely red without more than two non-red hairs, adds to its significance. This requirement points to the need for a perfect sacrifice, prefiguring Christ, who is described as without blemish (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>).<p><b>that has no defect:</b><br>The absence of defect further emphasizes the need for purity and perfection in offerings to God. This mirrors the requirement for other sacrificial animals (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3</a>). Theologically, it points to the sinlessness of Christ, the ultimate sacrifice, who was without sin (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>).<p><b>and has never been placed under a yoke:</b><br>The stipulation that the heifer has never been yoked signifies freedom from labor and service, symbolizing purity and separation for a holy purpose. In biblical symbolism, a yoke often represents bondage or burden (<a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29-30</a>). This aspect of the red heifer can be seen as a type of Christ, who bore the yoke of humanity's sin but was Himself free from sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who provides specific instructions for the purification process.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>Leaders of the Israelites, responsible for conveying God's commands to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are to follow the statutes and laws given by the LORD.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_heifer.htm">The Red Heifer</a></b><br>A unique sacrificial animal, symbolizing purity and used for the purification rites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God among His people, where the purification rituals are centered.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_purity.htm">The Importance of Purity</a></b><br>The red heifer symbolizes the need for purity in approaching God.

Law-statute: an unusual combination only found elsewhere in <a href="/numbers/31-21.htm">Numbers 31:21</a>, which also concerns legal purifications. <span class="cmt_word">A red heifer.</span> This offering was obviously intended, apart from its symbolic significance, to be studiedly simple and cheap. In contradiction to the many and costly and ever-repeated sacrifices of the Sinaitic legislation, this was a single individual, a female, and of the most common description: red is the most ordinary colour of cattle, and a young heifer is of less value than any other beast of its kind. The ingenuity indeed of the Jews heaped around the choice of this animal a multitude of precise requirements, and supplemented the prescribed ritual with many ceremonies, some of which are incorporated by the Targums with the sacred text; but even so they could not destroy the remarkable contrast between the simplicity of this offering and the elaborate complexity of those ordained at Sinai. Only six red heifers are said to have been needed during the whole of Jewish history, so far-reaching and so long-enduring were the uses and advantages of a single immolation. It is evident that this ordinance had for its distinguishing character oneness as opposed to multiplicity, simplicity contrasted with elaborateness. <span class="cmt_word">Without spot, wherein is no blemish.</span> See on Leviticus 4:8. However little, comparatively speaking, the victim might cost them, it must yet be perfect of its kind. The later Jews held that three white hairs together on any part of the body made it unfit for the purpose. On the sex and color of the offering see below. <span class="cmt_word">Upon which never came yoke.</span> Cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/21-3.htm">Deuteronomy 21:3</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/6-7.htm">1 Samuel 6:7</a>. The imposition of the yoke, according to the common sentiment of all nations, was a species of degradation, and therefore inconsistent with the ideal of what was fit to be offered in rids ease.
