The "land flowing with milk and honey" is a reference to the Promised Land, Canaan, which God had promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). This description emphasizes the fertility and abundance of the land. The Israelites' complaint highlights their lack of faith and impatience, as they were still in the wilderness and had not yet entered Canaan due to their own disobedience and lack of trust in God's promises (<a href="/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22-23</a>).<p><b>or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards</b><br>The expectation of receiving "fields and vineyards" underscores the Israelites' desire for a settled, prosperous life in the Promised Land. In ancient Near Eastern culture, land ownership was a sign of stability and blessing. The promise of an inheritance was significant, as it was tied to the covenant God made with the patriarchs (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The complaint here reflects a misunderstanding or impatience with God's timing and plan, as the journey to the Promised Land was delayed due to the Israelites' rebellion and lack of faith (<a href="/numbers/14-34.htm">Numbers 14:34</a>).<p><b>Will you gouge out the eyes of these men?</b><br>This rhetorical question is an expression of anger and accusation against Moses. It suggests that the leaders felt deceived or misled, as if Moses was trying to blind them to the truth. The phrase "gouge out the eyes" is a hyperbolic expression indicating severe mistreatment or deception. In the cultural context, sight was often associated with understanding and perception, so this accusation implies that Moses was trying to lead them astray or keep them in ignorance.<p><b>No, we will not come!</b><br>This statement of defiance and refusal to obey Moses' summons is indicative of the rebellion led by Korah, Dathan, and Abiram against Moses' authority (<a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16:1-3</a>). It reflects a broader theme of rebellion and disobedience among the Israelites during their wilderness journey. This refusal to submit to God-appointed leadership is a recurring issue in the narrative of the Exodus and wilderness wanderings, highlighting the tension between divine authority and human resistance. The rebellion ultimately leads to severe consequences, as God reaffirms Moses' leadership and punishes the rebels (<a href="/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31-35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and into the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/korah.htm">Korah</a></b><br>A Levite who led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, questioning their leadership and authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/dathan_and_abiram.htm">Dathan and Abiram</a></b><br>Sons of Eliab, who joined Korah in his rebellion against Moses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>Referred to as a "land flowing with milk and honey," it symbolizes God's promise and blessing to the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebellion.htm">Rebellion</a></b><br>The event where Korah, Dathan, Abiram, and others challenged Moses' leadership, leading to God's judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_promises.htm">Trust in God's Promises</a></b><br>Despite circumstances, believers are called to trust in God's promises, as His plans are for our ultimate good.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_rebellion.htm">The Danger of Rebellion</a></b><br>Rebellion against God-appointed leadership can lead to severe consequences.

They charge Moses with failing to deliver on God&#8217;s promise first voiced in <a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a> of &#8220;a land flowing with milk and honey.&#8221;<p>&#8226; They ignore that the Lord had already led Israel to the edge of Canaan, but the nation turned back in unbelief when the spies returned with a fearful report (<a href="/numbers/13-25.htm">Numbers 13:25&#8211;14</a>:4). Their complaint is therefore misplaced; it was their own rebellion, not Moses&#8217; leadership, that delayed entry (<a href="/hebrews/3-16.htm">Hebrews 3:16-19</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;milk and honey&#8221; underscores abundance and blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-9.htm">Deuteronomy 11:9</a>). By claiming Moses hasn&#8217;t brought them there, they question both his integrity and the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness, even though God&#8217;s timetable was still unfolding (<a href="/numbers/14-34.htm">Numbers 14:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards</b><p>&#8226; Inheritance language looks ahead to the tribal allotments described later (<a href="/bsb/joshua/13.htm">Joshua 13&#8211;21</a>). These men demand immediate possession, dismissing the wilderness season designed for testing and shaping the nation (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Their expectation for &#8220;fields and vineyards&#8221; shows a worldly, material focus. They want the gifts without the Giver, forgetting that God Himself was their portion and leader through the desert (<a href="/numbers/9-15.htm">Numbers 9:15-23</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-26.htm">Psalm 73:26</a>).<p>&#8226; By summer-izing prosperity while ignoring covenant obedience (<a href="/leviticus/26-3.htm">Leviticus 26:3-13</a>), they reveal hearts preferring comfort over consecration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will you gouge out the eyes of these men?</b><p>&#8226; An idiom of the time meaning &#8220;to deceive or blind&#8221; (cf. <a href="/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>). They insinuate Moses plans to keep Israel ignorant, controlling them through false hopes.<p>&#8226; This is a reversal of reality: Moses has repeatedly interceded for the people (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>; <a href="/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13-19</a>), spoken transparently (<a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6-8</a>), and displayed signs authenticating his commission (<a href="/exodus/4-30.htm">Exodus 4:30-31</a>).<p>&#8226; The charge reflects hardened hearts that twist godly leadership into tyranny&#8212;a pattern later seen when Israel accuses Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/8-4.htm">1 Samuel 8:4-5</a>) and ultimately when leaders reject Christ (<a href="/john/19-15.htm">John 19:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>No, we will not come!</b><p>&#8226; Open defiance: they refuse Moses&#8217; summons (<a href="/numbers/16-12.htm">Numbers 16:12</a>).

Yet the delay in entering Canaan stemmed from Israel&#8217;s own disbelief, not divine failure. Their words expose hearts hardened against God&#8217;s plan, reminding us that grumbling and rebellion blind us to His faithfulness and invite judgment, while trust and obedience position us to receive every good inheritance He has promised.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Moreover thou hast</span> <span class= "bld">not brought us . . . --</span>The words which the Lord had spoken to Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm" title="And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good land and a large, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.">Exodus 3:8</a>) concerning the deliverance from Egypt, and the bringing of the people into a land flowing with milk and honey, had been communicated by Aaron to the people (<a href="/exodus/4-30.htm" title="And Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.">Exodus 4:30</a>).
