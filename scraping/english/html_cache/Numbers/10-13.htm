It signifies a new phase in their journey, transitioning from a stationary camp to a mobile community. The phrase highlights the beginning of their journey towards the Promised Land, emphasizing obedience and readiness. This movement is a fulfillment of God's promise to lead them to a land flowing with milk and honey, as initially promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>).<p><b>according to the LORD&#8217;s command</b><br>The Israelites' journey was not arbitrary but directed by divine instruction. This underscores the importance of following God's guidance, a theme prevalent throughout the Pentateuch. The command of the LORD was communicated through the cloud by day and fire by night, symbolizing His presence and guidance (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). This obedience to divine command is a precursor to the New Testament teaching of living by the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>).<p><b>through Moses</b><br>Moses, as the mediator between God and the Israelites, plays a crucial role in conveying God's commands. His leadership is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). Moses' role here emphasizes the importance of godly leadership and the responsibility of leaders to faithfully communicate God's will to His people.
