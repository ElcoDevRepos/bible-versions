Oxen were valuable animals, symbolizing strength and service, and their use in offerings indicated a significant sacrifice. This offering was part of the dedication of the altar, reflecting the Israelites' desire for peace and fellowship with God. The use of two oxen highlights the importance of the occasion and the wealth or status of the giver.<p><b>five rams</b><br>Rams were often used in sacrificial offerings and symbolized leadership and authority. The number five can represent grace or God's goodness in biblical numerology. The inclusion of five rams in the offering underscores the abundance of the sacrifice and the desire for God's favor and blessing.<p><b>five male goats</b><br>Goats were commonly used in sin offerings, symbolizing atonement and purification. The presence of five male goats in the peace offering may indicate a comprehensive approach to seeking God's favor, covering various aspects of life and community. The number five again suggests grace and completeness in the offering.<p><b>and five male lambs a year old</b><br>Lambs, especially those a year old, were considered pure and without blemish, making them suitable for offerings. They often symbolize innocence and sacrifice, pointing forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God. The repetition of the number five emphasizes the thoroughness and sincerity of the offering.<p><b>This was the offering of Eliab son of Helon.</b><br>Eliab, the leader of the tribe of Zebulun, presented this offering. His name means "My God is Father," reflecting a personal relationship with God. Helon, his father, means "strong" or "valiant." The offering by Eliab signifies the tribe's dedication and commitment to God, as well as their participation in the communal worship and dedication of the altar.
