The use of oxen, which were valuable animals, signifies the importance and sincerity of the offering. Oxen were often used in sacrifices due to their size and value, symbolizing strength and service. This offering reflects the communal aspect of worship in Israel, where peace offerings were shared among the priests, the offerer, and God.<p><b>five rams</b><br>Rams were significant in sacrificial rituals, often symbolizing leadership and strength. The number five can represent grace or God's goodness in biblical numerology. Rams were used in various offerings, including burnt offerings, which were entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing complete dedication to God. The inclusion of rams in the peace offering highlights the offerer's desire for a harmonious relationship with God.<p><b>five male goats</b><br>Goats were commonly used in sin offerings, representing the removal of sin and impurity. The male goat, or "he-goat," was often associated with atonement and purification. The number five here again may symbolize grace, suggesting that the offering is made in recognition of God's grace and mercy. Goats were also used in the Day of Atonement rituals, where one goat was sacrificed and another sent into the wilderness as a scapegoat, symbolizing the removal of sin.<p><b>and five male lambs a year old</b><br>Lambs, especially those a year old, were considered pure and without blemish, making them suitable for sacrifice. The lamb is a significant biblical symbol, often representing innocence and sacrifice. This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the "Lamb of God," who takes away the sin of the world. The repetition of the number five continues to emphasize the theme of grace and divine favor.<p><b>This was the offering of Elizur son of Shedeur.</b><br>Elizur, a leader of the tribe of Reuben, presents this offering as part of the dedication of the altar. His name means "God is my rock," reflecting a strong faith and reliance on God. The mention of his father, Shedeur, situates Elizur within the tribal and familial context, emphasizing the importance of lineage and heritage in Israelite society. This offering is part of a larger narrative where each tribal leader presents gifts for the dedication of the altar, symbolizing unity and collective worship among the tribes of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elizur_son_of_shedeur.htm">Elizur son of Shedeur</a></b><br>Elizur was the leader of the tribe of Reuben, the firstborn of Jacob.
