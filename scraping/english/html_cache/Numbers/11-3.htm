"Taberah" means "burning" in Hebrew, indicating the severity of the event that occurred there. Naming places served as a memorial for the Israelites, reminding them of God's actions and their own responses. This practice is seen throughout the Pentateuch, such as in <a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>, where Jacob names Bethel after his vision of the ladder. The naming of Taberah highlights the importance of remembering both God's judgment and mercy.<p><b>because the fire of the LORD</b><br>The "fire of the LORD" signifies divine judgment and presence. Fire is a recurring symbol of God's holiness and power, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a> with the burning bush and in <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a> at Mount Sinai. It represents purification and judgment, as in <a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>, where God is described as a refiner's fire. The fire at Taberah serves as a warning against disobedience and a reminder of God's holiness, which demands reverence and obedience from His people.<p><b>had burned among them</b><br>The burning among the Israelites was a direct response to their complaints and rebellion against God. This event is part of a pattern of Israel's disobedience and God's discipline throughout their wilderness journey. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings follow obedience and curses follow disobedience, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The burning also prefigures the ultimate judgment and purification that Christ brings, as He baptizes with the Holy Spirit and fire (<a href="/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>). This incident underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance and faithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/taberah.htm">Taberah</a></b><br>This is the place where the Israelites experienced the burning wrath of God due to their complaints.

This name does not occur in the list of stations in chapter 33, which mentions nothing between Sinai and Kibroth-Hattaavah. It would seem probable, however, that the conflagration occurred while Israel was encamped, or else there could hardly have been a burning "in the end of the camp." We may therefore suppose either that Tabeerah was some spot in the immediate neighbourhood of Sinai whither the people gathered for their first long march; or that it was one of the halting-places on the "three days' journey" not mentioned in the list, because that journey was considered as all one; or that it was the same place afterwards called Kibroth-Hatta-avah. There is nothing in the narrative to decide a question which is in itself unimportant. It is necessary to remember that where the ancient and local names derived from marked natural features were not available, such names as Tabeerah given to the halting-places of so vast a host must have had a very loose significance. <p> CHAPTER 11:4-35 KIBROTH HATTAAVAH (verses 4-35). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/11-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
