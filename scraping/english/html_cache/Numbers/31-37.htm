In the context of <a href="/numbers/31.htm">Numbers 31</a>, the Israelites had just defeated the Midianites, and God commanded Moses to take a census of the spoils and divide them. The tribute to the LORD was a form of offering, acknowledging God's role in their victory and His sovereignty over Israel.<br><br>The number 675 represents a specific portion of the livestock, which was calculated as one out of every 500, as instructed by God. This act of giving a tribute is consistent with the broader biblical principle of offering the firstfruits or a portion of one's increase to God, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a> and <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>.<br><br>The concept of tribute also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is considered the perfect offering to God for the sins of humanity. Just as the tribute was a portion set apart for God, Christ is set apart as the Lamb of God, fulfilling the law and the prophets.<br><br>In the historical and cultural context, tributes were common in ancient Near Eastern societies, often given to deities or rulers as a sign of allegiance and gratitude. This practice underscores the Israelites' recognition of God's provision and protection.<br><br>Geographically, the campaign against Midian took place in the region east of the Jordan River, an area that held significant strategic and spiritual importance for the Israelites as they prepared to enter the Promised Land. The tribute, therefore, also symbolized their commitment to God as they moved closer to fulfilling His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is overseeing the distribution of the spoils of war, including the tribute to the LORD.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who have just returned from a victorious battle against the Midianites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>The people defeated by the Israelites, whose possessions are being divided.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>God, who commands a tribute from the spoils of war as an acknowledgment of His provision and victory.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep.htm">Sheep</a></b><br>Part of the livestock taken as spoils, with a portion designated as a tribute to the LORD.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledgment_of_god's_sovereignty.htm">Acknowledgment of God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The tribute of 675 sheep signifies the acknowledgment of God's role in the victory over the Midianites.
