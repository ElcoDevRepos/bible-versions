It symbolized God's presence among His people. The entrance was a significant location for various rituals, emphasizing the importance of public worship and accountability. This setting underscores the communal aspect of the Nazirite vow, as the act is performed in a place where the community gathers to meet with God.<p><b>the Nazirite is to shave his consecrated head</b><br>The Nazirite vow, as outlined in <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6</a>, was a voluntary commitment to God, marked by abstaining from wine, avoiding contact with the dead, and not cutting one's hair. Shaving the head at the vow's conclusion symbolized the end of the period of consecration and the fulfillment of the vow. This act of shaving was a public declaration of the Nazirite's dedication and the completion of their time of special separation to the Lord.<p><b>take the hair</b><br>The hair of the Nazirite, which had grown throughout the vow, was a physical representation of their dedication and separation to God. By taking the hair, the Nazirite acknowledges the end of their vow and prepares to offer it as a sacrifice. This act signifies the return of the Nazirite to ordinary life, having completed their period of special devotion.<p><b>and put it on the fire under the peace offering</b><br>The peace offering, or fellowship offering, was a sacrifice that symbolized reconciliation and communion with God. By placing the hair on the fire under the peace offering, the Nazirite integrates their personal vow with the communal worship practices of Israel. This act signifies the Nazirite's reintegration into the community and their restored fellowship with God. The burning of the hair can also be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate sacrifice, where He offered Himself completely for the reconciliation of humanity with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazirite.htm">Nazirite</a></b><br>An individual who has taken a special vow of consecration to the Lord, characterized by abstaining from wine, not cutting their hair, and avoiding contact with the dead.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tent_of_meeting.htm">Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>The sacred place where God met with Moses and the Israelites, serving as a central place of worship and sacrifice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/consecrated_head.htm">Consecrated Head</a></b><br>Refers to the hair of the Nazirite, which symbolizes their vow and dedication to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/peace_offering.htm">Peace Offering</a></b><br>A type of sacrifice in the Old Testament that symbolized fellowship and peace with God, often involving a communal meal.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/shaving_of_the_head.htm">Shaving of the Head</a></b><br>A ritual act signifying the completion of the Nazirite vow, marking the end of a period of special dedication to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/consecration_and_commitment.htm">Consecration and Commitment</a></b><br>The Nazirite vow represents a deep commitment to God, reminding us of the importance of dedicating aspects of our lives to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_hair.htm">Symbolism of Hair</a></b><br>The hair of the Nazirite symbolizes their vow and dedication.

The vow was now at an end; the last solemn act of sacrifice, the peace offering, which completed all, and typified that fearless and thankful communion with God which is the end of all religion, was now going on; it was fitting that the hair which must now be shorn, but could not be disposed of in any ordinary way, should be burnt upon the altar of God.
