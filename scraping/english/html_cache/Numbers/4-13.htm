Removing the ashes was a necessary task to maintain the altar's function and purity, symbolizing the removal of sin and the need for continual cleansing. This act reflects the importance of maintaining holiness and order in worship. The bronze altar itself is a type of Christ, representing His sacrifice for sin. The removal of ashes signifies the completion of the sacrificial process, pointing to the finality of Christ's atonement.<p><b>spread a purple cloth over it</b><br>The use of a purple cloth is significant, as purple was a color associated with royalty and wealth in ancient cultures, often obtained from expensive dyes. Covering the altar with a purple cloth could symbolize the majesty and sovereignty of God, as well as the sacredness of the altar. This act of covering also indicates the care and reverence required in handling holy objects. In a typological sense, the purple cloth can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's kingship and His role as the ultimate High Priest, who covers and intercedes for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kohathites.htm">The Kohathites</a></b><br>A Levitical family responsible for the care of the sanctuary's most sacred objects, including the bronze altar.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bronze_altar.htm">The Bronze Altar</a></b><br>A key piece of the Tabernacle used for burnt offerings, symbolizing atonement and worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, central to their worship and community life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>Leaders of the Israelites, responsible for instructing the Levites in their duties.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_journey.htm">The Wilderness Journey</a></b><br>The context in which these instructions were given, as the Israelites traveled from Egypt to the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_reverence.htm">The Importance of Reverence</a></b><br>The careful handling of the altar and its ashes underscores the need for reverence in worship.

The Hebrew word for "ashes is of somewhat doubtful meaning, being only used here and in <a href="/exodus/27-3.htm">Exodus 27:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/20-3.htm">Psalm 20:3</a> (see margin). Being connected with the word "fat," it may perhaps mean the grease or dripping from the burnt offerings. The Targum of Palestine renders it "cinders." As the altar was hollow, and was filled with earth or stones when used, there would be no need to cleanse it from ashes; if this be the meaning of the word, the command would rather have been to collect the living embers before the altar was removed, in order to keep alive the sacred fire. That this fire was never allowed to go out may be looked upon as certain. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/4-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then they shall remove the ashes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;i&#353;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
