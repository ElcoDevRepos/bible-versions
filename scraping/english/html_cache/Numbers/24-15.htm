An oracle in biblical terms is a divine message or prophecy. Balaam's oracles are significant as they come from a Gentile prophet, yet they align with God's will for Israel. This moment marks a continuation of Balaam's divinely inspired messages, despite his initial intent to curse Israel for Balak's reward.<p><b>&#8220;This is the prophecy of Balaam son of Beor,</b><br>Balaam is identified as the son of Beor, which establishes his lineage and authenticity as a prophet. His name is mentioned in other biblical texts, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/23-4.htm">Deuteronomy 23:4-5</a> and <a href="/joshua/13-22.htm">Joshua 13:22</a>, highlighting his notoriety. The mention of his father, Beor, is a common biblical practice to affirm identity and heritage. Balaam's prophecies are unique as they come from a non-Israelite, yet they are recognized as true revelations from God.<p><b>the prophecy of a man whose eyes are open,</b><br>This phrase indicates that Balaam has received divine insight or revelation. In biblical terms, having "open eyes" suggests spiritual enlightenment or the ability to perceive God's truth. This is significant because it implies that Balaam's message is not from his own understanding but from a divine source. The concept of spiritual sight is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>, where Paul prays for the eyes of believers' hearts to be enlightened. Balaam's open eyes contrast with his earlier spiritual blindness when he failed to see the angel of the Lord (<a href="/numbers/22-31.htm">Numbers 22:31</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet who is hired by Balak, the king of Moab, to curse the Israelites.
