The tribes of Reuben and Gad, along with the half-tribe of Manasseh, had requested to settle on the east side of the Jordan River, as the land was suitable for their livestock. However, they pledged to assist the other tribes in conquering the land west of the Jordan before settling in their own territories. This demonstrates a sense of responsibility and solidarity within the community, emphasizing the importance of collective effort in achieving God's promises. The concept of not returning home until a mission is complete can be seen as a type of Christ's mission on earth, where He did not "return home" until His work of salvation was accomplished.<p><b>until every Israelite has taken possession</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the importance of unity and shared purpose among the Israelites. The conquest of Canaan was a collective mission, and the success of one tribe was tied to the success of all. This reflects the biblical principle of mutual support and accountability within the community of God's people. The idea of taking possession is also significant in the context of God's covenant promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, where the land was promised as an inheritance to their descendants. This phrase can be connected to the New Testament teaching of the body of Christ, where each member works together for the common good (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>of his inheritance</b><br>The term "inheritance" is crucial in understanding the theological and covenantal aspects of the land promise. In the Old Testament, the land of Canaan was not just a physical territory but a divine gift and a sign of God's faithfulness to His covenant. Each tribe's inheritance was a fulfillment of God's promise and a tangible expression of His grace and provision. This concept of inheritance is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as heirs with Christ (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>), receiving a spiritual inheritance that includes eternal life and the kingdom of God. The land inheritance in Numbers foreshadows the greater spiritual inheritance promised to believers through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tribes_of_reuben_and_gad.htm">The Tribes of Reuben and Gad</a></b><br>These tribes requested to settle on the east side of the Jordan River because the land was suitable for their livestock.
