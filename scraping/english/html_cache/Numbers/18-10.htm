In the context of <a href="/numbers/18.htm">Numbers 18</a>, God is instructing Aaron and his sons, the priests, on how to handle the offerings brought by the Israelites. The "most holy" offerings include the sin offerings, guilt offerings, and portions of the grain offerings. These were to be consumed in a sacred space, typically within the tabernacle precincts, emphasizing the sanctity and reverence required in handling what is dedicated to God. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness, where certain items, places, and actions are set apart for divine purposes. The consumption of these offerings by the priests symbolizes their role as mediators between God and the people, foreshadowing the ultimate mediation of Christ.<p><b>and every male may eat it</b><br>This specifies that the consumption of the most holy offerings is restricted to male members of the priestly family. This restriction underscores the patriarchal structure of ancient Israelite society and the specific roles assigned within the Levitical priesthood. The male priests were responsible for performing the sacrificial rituals and maintaining the sanctity of the tabernacle. This exclusivity highlights the seriousness of the priestly duties and the need for ritual purity. In the New Testament, the concept of priesthood is expanded to all believers, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, where the church is described as a "royal priesthood," indicating a shift from the Old Covenant's restrictions.<p><b>You shall regard it as holy</b><br>This command emphasizes the need to treat the offerings with the utmost respect and reverence. The holiness of the offerings is not inherent but is derived from their dedication to God. This reflects the broader biblical principle that holiness is conferred by God's presence and purpose. The priests' responsibility to regard the offerings as holy serves as a reminder of their role in maintaining the covenant relationship between God and Israel. It also points to the necessity of approaching God with reverence and awe, a theme echoed throughout Scripture, including in <a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28-29</a>, which calls believers to worship God "with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and His Sons</a></b><br>The primary recipients of the instructions in <a href="/bsb/numbers/18.htm">Numbers 18</a>, Aaron and his sons were appointed as priests to serve in the tabernacle, responsible for the sacred duties and offerings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The central place of worship for the Israelites, where sacrifices and offerings were made.

This expression is somewhat perplexing, because it stands commonly for the holy of holies (<a href="/exodus/26-33.htm">Exodus 26:33</a>). As it cannot possibly have that meaning here, two interpretations have been proposed. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That it means the court of the tabernacle, called "the holy place" in <a href="/leviticus/6-16.htm">Leviticus 6:16, 26</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-6.htm">Leviticus 7:6</a>, and there specified as the only place in which the meat offerings, the sin offerings, and trespass offerings might be eaten. There is no reason why this court should not be called "must holy," as well as "holy;" if it was "holy" with respect to the camp, or the holy city, it was "most holy" with respect to all without the camp, or without the gate. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> That the expression does not mean "in the most holy place," but "amongst the most holy things," as it does in <a href="/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4</a>, and above in verse 9. A distinction is clearly intended between the "most holy things," which only the priests and their sons might eat, and the "holy things," of which the rest of their families might partake also. It is difficult to decide between these renderings, although there can be no doubt that the "most holy" things were actually to be consumed within the tabernacle precincts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/18-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You are to eat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1499;&#1458;&#1500;&#1462;&#1425;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;&#7733;a&#774;&#183;len&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular &#124;
