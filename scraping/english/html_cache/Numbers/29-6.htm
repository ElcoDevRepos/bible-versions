The monthly offerings, or "new moon" sacrifices, were significant in marking time and seasons (<a href="/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>). Daily burnt offerings, known as the "tamid," were offered every morning and evening (<a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>). This regularity underscores the importance of continual devotion and the need for constant atonement and communion with God. The concept of additional offerings points to the idea that worship and sacrifice are not limited to specific times but are an ongoing commitment.<p><b>with their prescribed grain offerings and drink offerings</b><br>Grain and drink offerings accompanied burnt offerings, symbolizing the dedication of the fruits of labor to God. The grain offering, or "minchah," often consisted of fine flour, oil, and frankincense (<a href="/leviticus/2.htm">Leviticus 2:1-16</a>), representing sustenance and the work of human hands. The drink offering, or "nesek," typically involved wine (<a href="/exodus/29-40.htm">Exodus 29:40</a>), symbolizing joy and celebration. These offerings reflect the holistic nature of worship, involving both the spiritual and material aspects of life. They also prefigure the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, who offered Himself wholly for humanity.<p><b>They are a pleasing aroma</b><br>The phrase "pleasing aroma" is a recurring motif in the sacrificial system (<a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>, <a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). It signifies God's acceptance of the offering and the worshiper's sincere devotion. The aroma metaphorically represents the satisfaction and delight God finds in the obedience and faithfulness of His people. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Christ's sacrifice is described as a "fragrant offering" (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>), indicating divine approval and fulfillment of the sacrificial system.<p><b>a food offering to the LORD</b><br>The term "food offering" underscores the idea of providing sustenance, not in a literal sense for God, but symbolically representing fellowship and communion. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, sharing a meal was a sign of covenant and relationship. This offering signifies the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where the people acknowledge God's provision and sovereignty. It also points to the Eucharistic themes in the New Testament, where believers partake in the body and blood of Christ, symbolizing spiritual nourishment and unity with God (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are given specific instructions on how to worship and offer sacrifices.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who receives and communicates God's laws and instructions to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where sacrifices and offerings are made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who commands the offerings and is the recipient of the sacrifices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sacrifices.htm">The Sacrifices</a></b><br>Specific offerings made by fire, including burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings, which are a pleasing aroma to the LORD.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_sacrificial_system.htm">Understanding the Sacrificial System</a></b><br>The sacrificial system was a means for the Israelites to maintain a right relationship with God.

They are extra, layered on top of the regular pattern He has ordained (see <a href="/numbers/28-2.htm">Numbers 28:2&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-37.htm">Leviticus 23:37</a>). This protects Israel from thinking that spectacular festival worship can substitute for faithful, everyday devotion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the monthly and daily burnt offerings</b><p>God had already established<p>&#8226; a daily burnt offering every morning and evening (<a href="/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3&#8211;4</a>), and<p>&#8226; a monthly, or &#8220;new moon,&#8221; burnt offering (<a href="/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11&#8211;15</a>).<p>By mentioning both, the verse gathers the ordinary rhythm of worship&#8212;the daily cycle and the monthly cycle&#8212;and reminds Israel that consistent, habitual surrender is foundational. Festivals are mountaintops; the daily and monthly offerings are the faithful pathways that lead there.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with their prescribed grain offerings and drink offerings</b><p>Each burnt offering came as a package deal:<p>&#8226; Grain offering&#8212;fine flour mixed with oil and salt, symbolizing work, sustenance, and covenant loyalty (<a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Drink offering&#8212;wine poured out, picturing joy and complete consecration (<a href="/numbers/15-5.htm">Numbers 15:5-10</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a> for the New-Testament echo).<p>God gives exact quantities (<a href="/numbers/28-7.htm">Numbers 28:7-14</a>), showing that worship is not left to human whim. Obedience down to the details matters, because every element points to His provision and to the future, perfect offering of Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-5.htm">Hebrews 10:5-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They are a pleasing aroma</b><p>&#8220;Pleasing&#8221; (or &#8220;soothing&#8221;) aroma is covenant language. When Noah offered burnt offerings after the flood, &#8220;the LORD smelled the soothing aroma&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>). In <a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>, the same phrase underscores divine acceptance. The smoke rising from animal, grain, and wine tells Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;that God welcomes repentant sinners when blood atonement and wholehearted giving are present. Paul later applies this imagery to Jesus&#8217; sacrifice and to believers&#8217; sacrificial love: &#8220;an offering and a sacrifice to God for a fragrant aroma&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a food offering to the LORD</b><p>Though God needs nothing (<a href="/psalms/50-9.htm">Psalm 50:9-12</a>), He graciously receives worship as though it were a meal shared with His people (<a href="/leviticus/3-11.htm">Leviticus 3:11</a>; <a href="/malachi/1-12.htm">Malachi 1:12</a>). Calling it &#8220;food&#8221; emphasizes fellowship: the covenant God &#8220;eats&#8221; with those He redeems. The layers of offerings in <a href="/bsb/numbers/29.htm">Numbers 29</a> culminate in communion&#8212;pointing ahead to the Lord&#8217;s Table where the true Lamb provides the feast (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7-8</a>; 11:23-26).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/29-6.htm">Numbers 29:6</a> teaches that special festival sacrifices never replace the steady rhythm of daily and monthly devotion. God desires both extraordinary celebration and ordinary faithfulness, each offered exactly as He commands. When His people give burnt, grain, and drink offerings together, the result is a &#8220;pleasing aroma&#8221;&#8212;a tangible sign that He accepts and delights in them. Ultimately, every sacrifice in this verse foreshadows Christ, whose once-for-all offering secures unbroken fellowship, making our lives a continual &#8220;food offering to the LORD.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Beside the burnt offering of the month.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">of the new moon. </span>(See <a href="/numbers/28-11.htm" title="And in the beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt offering to the LORD;
