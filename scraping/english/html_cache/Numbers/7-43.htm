The silver platter, weighing 130 shekels, was a significant gift, reflecting the wealth and devotion of the tribe's leader. The use of silver, a precious metal, underscores the value and importance of the offering. In biblical times, silver was often used in religious and ceremonial contexts, symbolizing purity and redemption. The weight of the platter, measured in shekels, aligns with the standard used in the sanctuary, ensuring uniformity and fairness in offerings.<p><b>and one silver bowl weighing seventy shekels</b><br>The silver bowl, weighing 70 shekels, complements the platter, forming a set that was likely used in the rituals associated with the tabernacle. The specific weight indicates a careful adherence to the standards set by God for offerings, emphasizing obedience and reverence.

Fine flour represents the best of the harvest, while oil signifies the Holy Spirit and anointing. This offering was a non-blood sacrifice, emphasizing the worshiper's devotion and gratitude. The mixture of flour and oil also points to the sustenance and richness of God's provision.
