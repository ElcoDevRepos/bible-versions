The cultural context of the time placed significant importance on vows, as they were seen as binding and sacred. Marriage introduced a new authority structure, where the husband had a role in overseeing the household, including spiritual commitments. This reflects the patriarchal society of ancient Israel, where the husband had the authority to confirm or annul vows made by his wife. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where the husband is seen as the head of the wife (<a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>).<p><b>or rash promise by which she has bound herself</b><br>A rash promise indicates a vow made impulsively or without full consideration of the consequences. The Bible often warns against making hasty vows (<a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>). This phrase highlights the importance of thoughtful and deliberate commitments, especially those made to God. The ability of a husband to annul such vows upon marriage underscores the protective role he plays, ensuring that his wife is not bound by unwise or burdensome commitments. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who intercedes on behalf of believers, freeing them from the burdens of sin and rash commitments (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/woman.htm">Woman</a></b><br>The subject of the verse, who has made a vow or promise.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/v/vow_or_rash_promise.htm">Vow or Rash Promise</a></b><br>A solemn pledge or commitment made by the woman, which is the focus of the regulation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage.htm">Marriage</a></b><br>The event that changes the woman's circumstances, bringing her under the authority of her husband.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/husband.htm">Husband</a></b><br>The man who marries the woman, gaining authority over her vows.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_community.htm">Israelite Community</a></b><br>The broader context in which these laws were given, reflecting the societal norms and religious practices of ancient Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_vows.htm">The Seriousness of Vows</a></b><br>Vows are not to be taken lightly.

Case second, of a married or betrothed woman. As far as the legal status of the woman was concerned, there was little difference under Jewish law whether she were married or only betrothed. In either case she was accounted as belonging to her husband, with all that she had (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23, 24</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-19.htm">Matthew 1:19, 20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">When</span> <span class="cmt_word">she vowed.</span> Rather, "and her vows be upon her."
