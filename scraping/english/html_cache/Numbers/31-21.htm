His role was crucial in guiding the Israelites in spiritual and ceremonial matters. The soldiers mentioned here had just returned from a victorious battle against the Midianites, a people who had previously led Israel into sin (Numbers 25). The priest's involvement underscores the importance of maintaining ritual purity and obedience to God's commands even in the aftermath of warfare. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's holiness and the need for His people to remain distinct from surrounding nations.<p><b>&#8220;This is the statute of the law which the LORD has commanded Moses:</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the divine origin of the law, highlighting that it is not merely a human tradition but a command from God Himself. This underscores the authority of the law and the necessity for the Israelites to adhere to it. The reference to Moses connects this statute to the broader Mosaic Law, which was given at Sinai and forms the foundation of Israel's covenant relationship with God. The law often served as a means to set Israel apart, ensuring they lived in a way that reflected God's character. This particular statute likely pertains to purification rituals, which were essential for maintaining the community's holiness after contact with death and warfare.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eleazar_the_priest.htm">Eleazar the Priest</a></b><br>Eleazar was the son of Aaron and served as the high priest after Aaron's death.

This is the earliest instance of the high priest declaring to the people what the law of God as delivered to Moses was, and then applying and enlarging that law to meet the present circumstances. It is no doubt possible that Eleazar referred the matter to Moses, but it would seem on the face of the narrative that he spoke on his own authority as high priest. When we compare the ceremonial of the later Jews, so precisely and minutely ordered for every conceivable contingency, with the Mosaic legislation itself, it is evident that the process of authoritative amplification must have been going on from the first; but it is certainly strange to find that process begun while Moses himself was alive and active. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/31-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Eleazar</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1494;&#1464;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;z&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_499.htm">Strong's 499: </a> </span><span class="str2">Eleazar -- 'God has helped', six Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
