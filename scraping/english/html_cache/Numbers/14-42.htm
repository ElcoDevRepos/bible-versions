The context is the aftermath of the Israelites' refusal to trust God and enter Canaan when initially commanded. Their disobedience led to God's judgment that they would wander in the wilderness for 40 years. The phrase emphasizes the importance of obedience to God's timing and commands.<p><b>lest you be struck down by your enemies</b><br>The Israelites' enemies, the Canaanites and Amalekites, were formidable forces. Without God's protection, the Israelites would be vulnerable to defeat. This highlights the necessity of divine support in overcoming adversaries, a recurring theme in Israel's history. It serves as a reminder of the consequences of acting presumptuously without God's blessing.<p><b>because the LORD is not among you</b><br>This phrase underscores the critical importance of God's presence for success and protection. Throughout the Old Testament, God's presence is associated with victory and blessing. The absence of the LORD signifies a withdrawal of divine favor, often due to disobedience or lack of faith. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as when Samson loses his strength after the LORD departs from him (<a href="/judges/16-20.htm">Judges 16:20</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that apart from Christ, believers can do nothing (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who intercedes for them and warns them against disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are wandering in the wilderness after being delivered from Egypt.
