The high priest played a crucial role in Israelite society, serving as a mediator between God and the people. Standing before Eleazar signifies the divine approval and religious legitimacy of Joshua's leadership. This act also underscores the continuity of the priestly line and the importance of spiritual authority in leadership transitions. The high priest's involvement highlights the theocratic nature of Israel's governance, where religious and civil leadership were intertwined.<p><b>and the whole congregation</b><br>The inclusion of the whole congregation emphasizes the communal aspect of leadership in Israel. It was important for the people to witness the commissioning of Joshua to ensure transparency and public acknowledgment of his new role. This public ceremony would foster unity and collective acceptance of Joshua as Moses' successor. The congregation's presence also reflects the democratic elements within the theocratic system, where the community had a role in affirming leadership. This practice can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament church's communal decision-making processes, as seen in <a href="/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>.<p><b>and commission him in their sight</b><br>Commissioning Joshua in the sight of the congregation was a formal act of transferring authority. This public commissioning served as a visible sign of God's choice and Moses' endorsement of Joshua. It was essential for maintaining order and continuity as Israel prepared to enter the Promised Land. The act of commissioning is reminiscent of the laying on of hands in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/acts/13-3.htm">Acts 13:3</a>, where leaders are set apart for specific tasks.
