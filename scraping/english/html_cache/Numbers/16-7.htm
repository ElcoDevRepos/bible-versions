The use of fire and incense in censers was a priestly duty, signifying worship and intercession before God. The act of placing fire and incense is reminiscent of the duties of the priests as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12-13</a>, where Aaron is instructed to take a censer full of burning coals and incense to create a cloud of smoke, symbolizing the prayers of the people rising to God. The presence of the LORD indicates the sacredness of the act and the seriousness of the challenge. This test was to be conducted the next day, emphasizing the immediacy and urgency of resolving the rebellion.<p><b>Then the man the LORD chooses will be the one who is holy.</b><br>This statement underscores the belief that God alone has the authority to appoint His servants. The term "holy" here refers to being set apart for God's service. In the context of the Old Testament, holiness is often associated with being chosen by God for a specific purpose, as seen in the consecration of Aaron and his sons in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>. The selection by God is a recurring theme, as seen in the anointing of David in <a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12-13</a>, where God chooses based on His criteria, not human judgment. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament concept of Jesus Christ as the chosen one, the ultimate High Priest, as described in <a href="/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4-5</a>.<p><b>It is you sons of Levi who have taken too much upon yourselves!&#8221;</b><br>This rebuke is directed at the Levites, specifically Korah and his followers, who were overstepping their God-given roles. The Levites were set apart for service in the tabernacle, but only the descendants of Aaron were permitted to serve as priests (<a href="/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>). By seeking the priesthood, Korah and his followers were challenging God's established order. This echoes the warning against pride and presumption found in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall." The phrase highlights the importance of recognizing and respecting the roles and responsibilities assigned by God, a principle that is reiterated in the New Testament in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18</a>, where Paul speaks of God arranging the members of the body, each with its own function.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/korah.htm">Korah</a></b><br>A Levite who led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, challenging their leadership and the priesthood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest, appointed by God to serve in the tabernacle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>A tribe set apart for religious duties, but not all were priests.

His first instruction sets up a public test the very next day:<p>&#8226; Only priests were commanded to burn incense before the LORD (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12&#8211;13</a>). By telling the rebels to do so, Moses places them squarely under God&#8217;s scrutiny.<p>&#8226; &#8220;In the presence of the LORD&#8221; highlights the seriousness of their act. Nadab and Abihu had already died for unauthorized fire (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1&#8211;2</a>), a warning still fresh in Israel&#8217;s memory.<p>&#8226; Incense symbolizes prayer and worship that reach God&#8217;s throne (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3&#8211;4</a>). The wrong hands offering it defile the symbol and invite judgment.<p>This opening phrase reminds us that approaching God on our own terms is dangerous; only those He designates may come near (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19&#8211;22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then the man the LORD chooses will be the one who is holy</b><p>Moses shifts from instruction to outcome: God Himself will single out His holy servant.<p>&#8226; Holiness is not self-awarded. Aaron had been chosen and anointed by God (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-12.htm">Leviticus 8:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord&#8217;s choice will be unmistakable, as later proved by fire consuming the rebels&#8217; incense (<a href="/numbers/16-35.htm">Numbers 16:35</a>) and by Aaron&#8217;s rod budding (<a href="/numbers/17-5.htm">Numbers 17:5&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently shows God declaring who is set apart&#8212;whether David over Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1&#8211;13</a>) or Christ as High Priest forever (<a href="/hebrews/5-4.htm">Hebrews 5:4&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;The LORD knows those who are His&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>). Genuine holiness is God-conferred, not self-asserted.<p>The verse underscores that divine election, not popular consensus or personal ambition, settles spiritual authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It is you sons of Levi who have taken too much upon yourselves!</b><p>Moses now rebukes the Levite faction for overstepping.<p>&#8226; Levites already held honored service&#8212;caring for the tabernacle and its furnishings (<a href="/numbers/3-5.htm">Numbers 3:5&#8211;10</a>). Attempting priesthood was a grasp at what was not theirs (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Korah, a Kohathite, was tasked with carrying holy objects but never with offering incense. His complaint twisted privilege into discontent (<a href="/bsb/jude/1.htm">Jude 11</a>).<p>&#8226; The charge &#8220;taken too much upon yourselves&#8221; exposes pride and covetousness&#8212;sins that spawn division in any community (<a href="/james/3-14.htm">James 3:14&#8211;16</a>).<p>By calling them out publicly, Moses warns the entire nation against presuming on God&#8217;s order.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/16-7.htm">Numbers 16:7</a> presents a divine litmus test: unauthorized Levites must offer incense, God will choose His holy servant, and their rebellion will be exposed. The incident teaches that worship is God-defined, holiness is God-conferred, and self-promotion in spiritual matters invites judgment.
