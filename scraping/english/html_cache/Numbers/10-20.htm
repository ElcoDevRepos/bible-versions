The name Eliasaph means "God has added," which reflects the Hebrew tradition of naming as a form of expressing faith or hope. Deuel, his father, is mentioned here, though in some manuscripts and translations, he is referred to as Reuel. This discrepancy may be due to variations in ancient texts or scribal errors. The mention of lineage is significant in the Israelite culture, emphasizing the importance of family heritage and tribal leadership. <p><b>was over the division of the tribe of Gad</b><br>The tribe of Gad was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Gad, the seventh son of Jacob and Zilpah, Leah's maidservant. Gad's tribe was known for its warrior-like characteristics, as seen in Jacob's blessing in <a href="/genesis/49-19.htm">Genesis 49:19</a>, which describes Gad as a troop that will raid and be raided. The tribe settled on the east side of the Jordan River, an area known for its fertile land, which was suitable for their large flocks and herds. In the context of <a href="/numbers/10.htm">Numbers 10</a>, the division of the tribe of Gad refers to their organized military and social structure as they prepared to move through the wilderness. This organization was crucial for maintaining order and ensuring the safety of the Israelites during their journey. The leadership of Eliasaph over this division highlights the structured hierarchy and the role of tribal leaders in guiding and managing their people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elishama.htm">Elishama</a></b><br>He is the son of Ammihud and the leader of the tribe of Ephraim during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness.
