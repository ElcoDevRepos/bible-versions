His lifespan reflects God's blessing and the fulfillment of his role as the first high priest of Israel. Aaron's age also signifies the end of an era, as he was a central figure during the Exodus and the wilderness wanderings. His life spanned the period from slavery in Egypt to the brink of entering the Promised Land.<p><b>when he died</b><br>Aaron's death marks a significant transition for the Israelites. It symbolizes the passing of the older generation that left Egypt, as God had decreed that those who doubted Him would not enter the Promised Land (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-30</a>). Aaron's death also serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience, as he was not allowed to enter Canaan due to his involvement in the incident at Meribah (<a href="/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>).<p><b>on Mount Hor</b><br>Mount Hor is traditionally identified with a mountain in the region of Edom, near the border of modern-day Jordan. It is significant as the place where Aaron was gathered to his people, a phrase often used to describe the death of the patriarchs. The location of Mount Hor underscores the Israelites' journey and the fulfillment of God's promises, as they were nearing the land promised to their ancestors. The mountain's setting also provides a backdrop for the transfer of the high priesthood from Aaron to his son Eleazar, symbolizing continuity and the enduring nature of God's covenant with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.
