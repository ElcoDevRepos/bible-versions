Previously, the Israelites had access to the outer areas of the Tabernacle, but this restriction emphasizes the holiness of God and the need for a mediator. The Levites were appointed to serve in the Tabernacle, acting as intermediaries between God and the people. This separation underscores the concept of holiness and the need for purity when approaching God, a theme that runs throughout the Old Testament. The Tent of Meeting is a precursor to the Temple in Jerusalem and ultimately points to Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate mediator between God and humanity (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><b>or they will incur guilt and die</b><br>This warning highlights the seriousness of approaching God without the proper mediation and sanctification. In the Old Testament, the presence of God was both a source of blessing and a potential source of judgment. The holiness of God required that only those who were consecrated and appointed could come near, reflecting the gravity of sin and the need for atonement. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where the wages of sin is death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>), but through Jesus Christ, believers are granted access to God (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>). The death penalty for unauthorized access to the Tent of Meeting serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of sin and the necessity of respecting divine boundaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were given the Law through Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent_of_meeting.htm">The Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>Also known as the Tabernacle, it was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>A tribe set apart by God to perform duties related to the Tabernacle, including its care and the facilitation of worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the Law from God and communicated His commands to the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest, who was responsible for the priestly duties and the spiritual leadership of the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_holiness_of_god.htm">The Holiness of God</a></b><br>God's holiness requires reverence and obedience.

After the rebellion of Korah and the plague that followed (<a href="/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1-50</a>), God clarifies the boundaries once and for all.<p>- Similar turning-points appear at Sinai, where the people were warned, &#8220;Set limits around the mountain and consecrate it&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-12.htm">Exodus 19:12-13</a>).<p>- The wording underscores God&#8217;s right to set fresh terms for approaching Him; His instructions are never suggestions (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>may the Israelites</b><p>- The restriction applies to every non-Levite, from the tribal leaders down to the youngest child (<a href="/numbers/1-53.htm">Numbers 1:53</a>).<p>- God treats Israel as a covenant community: when one trespasses, the nation suffers (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1-12</a>).<p>- By speaking to the whole people, the Lord reminds them that holiness is communal, not merely individual (<a href="/leviticus/15-31.htm">Leviticus 15:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>come near to the Tent of Meeting</b><p>- The Tent is the earthly place where God&#8217;s glory dwells (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>). Drawing near without invitation invites disaster, as Nadab and Abihu learned when &#8220;fire came out from the presence of the LORD and consumed them&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>).<p>- God assigns the Levites to &#8220;perform the duties of the Tent of Meeting&#8230;so that no wrath will fall on the Israelites&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/18-5.htm">Numbers 18:5</a>).<p>- The boundary protects both the sanctuary&#8217;s holiness and the people&#8217;s lives (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or they will incur guilt</b><p>- Guilt here is legal liability before God. It is not a feeling but a fixed reality, demanding atonement (<a href="/leviticus/22-9.htm">Leviticus 22:9</a>).<p>- Unauthorized approach equals trespass, a sin that transfers defilement onto the offender (<a href="/leviticus/5-17.htm">Leviticus 5:17</a>).<p>- Incurred guilt disrupts fellowship and necessitates sacrifice, pointing ahead to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ (<a href="/hebrews/9-7.htm">Hebrews 9:7-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and die.</b><p>- Death is the stated consequence, not a hypothetical threat (<a href="/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>).<p>- Uzzah&#8217;s fate when he touched the ark illustrates the principle: &#8220;God struck him down there for his irreverence&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/6-7.htm">2 Samuel 6:7</a>).<p>- The penalty reinforces God&#8217;s holiness and the need for a mediator; ultimately Jesus becomes that mediator, giving believers &#8220;confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/18-22.htm">Numbers 18:22</a> draws a clear line: God&#8217;s holiness requires mediation, boundaries, and obedience. By confining tabernacle service to the Levites, the Lord protects Israel from fatal guilt. The verse magnifies both the danger of unchecked access and the grace of divinely appointed mediators&#8212;a theme fulfilled in Christ, who opens the way for every believer while still upholding the unchanging holiness of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Lest they bear sin and die.--</span><span class= "ital">i.e., </span>lest they bring sin upon themselves, the penalty of which they would have to bear.
