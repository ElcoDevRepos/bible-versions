The Hebrew term for jealousy here can also imply a sense of protective zeal. This reflects the cultural importance of marital fidelity and the husband's role as protector of the family unit. Jealousy in this context is not merely an emotional response but a legal and social concern that could affect the entire community.<p><b>and he suspects his wife who has defiled herself</b><br>The suspicion of defilement indicates a breach of the marital covenant, which was considered a serious offense in Israelite society. Adultery was not only a personal betrayal but also a violation of God's commandments, specifically the seventh commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>). The term "defiled" suggests ritual impurity, which had implications for both religious and social standing. This suspicion required a formal process to address the potential sin, reflecting the community's commitment to holiness.<p><b>or if a feeling of jealousy comes over him</b><br>The repetition of the phrase emphasizes the seriousness of the husband's feelings and the potential for misunderstanding or false accusations. It acknowledges human emotions and the complexities of marital relationships. This provision in the law serves to protect both parties by providing a structured means of resolving such suspicions, highlighting the importance of justice and truth in the community.<p><b>and he suspects her even though she has not defiled herself</b><br>This clause introduces the possibility of false suspicion, recognizing that jealousy can arise without cause. It underscores the need for discernment and fairness in dealing with accusations. The law provided a ritual (<a href="/numbers/5-15.htm">Numbers 5:15-31</a>) to determine the truth, ensuring that the innocent were protected and the guilty were held accountable. This reflects God's justice and mercy, as well as the value placed on truth and integrity in relationships. The process also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and discernment of Christ, who knows the hearts of all people (<a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_husband.htm">The Husband</a></b><br>The man who experiences a "spirit of jealousy" regarding his wife.
