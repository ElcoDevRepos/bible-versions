It is where the Israelite spies, sent by Moses, cut down a cluster of grapes so large that it had to be carried on a pole between two men. This valley is located near Hebron in the land of Canaan, a region known for its fertility and abundance. The mention of "your fathers" refers to the previous generation of Israelites who were delivered from Egypt and were on the brink of entering the Promised Land. This historical context highlights the continuity of God's promise to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>and saw the land</b><br>The act of seeing the land was a pivotal moment for the Israelites. The spies' exploration was meant to confirm the richness and promise of Canaan, a land "flowing with milk and honey" as described in <a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>. This phrase underscores the tangible evidence of God's promise, yet it also sets the stage for the subsequent failure of faith. The land was indeed as fruitful as God had promised, but the Israelites' response was not one of trust.<p><b>they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land</b><br>The discouragement came from the negative report given by ten of the twelve spies, as detailed in <a href="/numbers/13-31.htm">Numbers 13:31-33</a>. Despite the land's abundance, the spies focused on the formidable inhabitants and fortified cities, instilling fear among the Israelites. This act of discouragement was a direct challenge to God's promise and command. It reflects a lack of faith and trust in God's power to deliver and protect His people, a recurring theme in the wilderness journey.<p><b>that the LORD had given them</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine gift of the land to the Israelites. It was not merely a territory to be conquered but a fulfillment of God's covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The use of "had given" indicates that the land was already theirs by divine decree, awaiting their possession. This highlights the tension between divine sovereignty and human responsibility. The Israelites' failure to enter the land at that time was not due to God's inability to deliver but their own lack of faith and obedience. This serves as a reminder of the importance of trusting in God's promises, a theme echoed throughout Scripture, including in the New Testament (<a href="/hebrews/3-19.htm">Hebrews 3:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were on their journey to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_valley_of_eshcol.htm">The Valley of Eshcol</a></b><br>A location near Hebron, known for its cluster of grapes, which the spies brought back as evidence of the land's fertility.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spies.htm">The Spies</a></b><br>Representatives from each of the twelve tribes of Israel sent by Moses to scout the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who guided them out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_discouragement.htm">The Consequences of Discouragement</a></b><br>Discouragement can lead to disobedience and a lack of trust in God's promises.
