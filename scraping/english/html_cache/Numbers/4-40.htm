The census was a method to ensure that each clan and family was accounted for, reflecting the tribal system that was central to Israelite identity. This system of organization is seen throughout the Pentateuch, where genealogies and family lines are meticulously recorded (e.g., <a href="/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10, 46</a>). The emphasis on clans and families underscores the communal nature of Israelite society, where identity and responsibility were tied to one's family and tribe. This also foreshadows the New Testament concept of the Church as a family of believers (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19</a>).<p><b>totaled 2,630</b><br>The specific number of 2,630 indicates the precision with which the Levites were counted. This number pertains to the Kohathites, one of the Levitical families responsible for the care of the sanctuary's most sacred objects (<a href="/numbers/4.htm">Numbers 4:1-20</a>). The precision in numbering reflects the orderliness that God required in the service of the tabernacle, emphasizing the holiness and reverence due to His dwelling place. This meticulous attention to detail can be seen as a type of Christ, who fulfills the law with precision and completeness (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17-18</a>). The counting of the Levites also prefigures the New Testament's emphasis on the priesthood of all believers, where each member has a role and responsibility within the body of Christ (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kohathites.htm">The Kohathites</a></b><br>A Levitical clan responsible for the care of the sanctuary's most sacred objects.

Verse 40 falls within the tally of Gershonite males aged thirty to fifty, the years God appointed for heavy tabernacle service (<a href="/numbers/8-24.htm">Numbers 8:24&#8211;25</a>). Their specific duties included transporting the tabernacle&#8217;s curtains, coverings, and ropes (<a href="/numbers/4-24.htm">Numbers 4:24&#8211;26</a>). Parallel passages show that every Israelite camp assignment was deliberate, reflecting God&#8217;s orderly design (<a href="/numbers/2-17.htm">Numbers 2:17</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And those numbered</b><p>This brief clause reminds us that God Himself commanded the counting.<p>&#8226; In Scripture, every census ordered by the Lord underscores responsibility and accountability (<a href="/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12&#8211;16</a>; <a href="/luke/12-7.htm">Luke 12:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The count was limited to men likely to shoulder physical labor, emphasizing a call to active ministry rather than mere affiliation (<a href="/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a>).<p>&#8226; By recording exact figures, God shows His concern for individuals even within large groups, echoing Jesus&#8217; teaching that the Good Shepherd knows His sheep by name (<a href="/john/10-3.htm">John 10:3, 14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>By their clans and families</b><p>Israel&#8217;s social structure flowed from family units, and the Levites were no exception.<p>&#8226; Clanship ensured that skills and responsibilities were passed down generationally (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Working alongside relatives fostered mutual accountability and encouragement, anticipating the New Testament pattern that believers serve together as one body with many members (<a href="/romans/12-4.htm">Romans 12:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; This arrangement affirmed that ministry begins at home; faithful service in the tabernacle was to mirror fidelity within each household (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4&#8211;5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Totaled 2,630</b><p>The exact number testifies to God&#8217;s precision.<p>&#8226; These 2,630 Gershonites joined 2,750 Kohathites and 3,200 Merarites (<a href="/numbers/4-36.htm">Numbers 4:36, 44</a>)&#8212;a combined force of 8,580 Levites prepared for tabernacle duty (<a href="/numbers/4-48.htm">Numbers 4:48</a>).<p>&#8226; Though comparatively fewer than the warriors from the other tribes (<a href="/numbers/2-32.htm">Numbers 2:32</a>), their assignment was equally crucial; worship, not warfare, preserved Israel&#8217;s identity (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The figure also highlights God&#8217;s sufficiency: He supplied just the right workforce for every curtain, rope, and covering. This principle carries forward to the church, where the Lord still &#8220;arranges the parts of the body, every one of them, just as He wills&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Spiritual significance</b><p><a href="/numbers/4-40.htm">Numbers 4:40</a> may seem like simple arithmetic, yet it reveals enduring truths:<p>&#8226; God counts people because people count to God.
