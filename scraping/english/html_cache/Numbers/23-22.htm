This event is foundational in the Old Testament, symbolizing God's power and faithfulness. It is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, emphasizing God's role as a deliverer. The Exodus is also a type of Christ's redemptive work, as Jesus delivers believers from the bondage of sin. The event is celebrated annually in the Jewish Passover, which Jesus reinterpreted at the Last Supper.<p><b>with strength like a wild ox</b><br>The comparison to a wild ox highlights God's immense power and might in delivering Israel. The wild ox, or "reem" in Hebrew, is often associated with strength and untamed power. This imagery underscores the idea that God's intervention was not only powerful but also unstoppable. The wild ox is a symbol of strength and virility, suggesting that God's power is both protective and aggressive against Israel's enemies. This strength is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/92-10.htm">Psalm 92:10</a>, where the psalmist speaks of being exalted like a wild ox, indicating divine empowerment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, God is depicted as the deliverer and source of strength for Israel.

It is evident, however, from <a href="/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a> and other passages that the teem had two hems, and that its horns were its most prominent feature.

The reem may therefore have been the aurochs or urus, now extinct, but which formerly had so large a range in the forests of the old world. There is some doubt, however, whether the urns existed in those days in Syria, and it may have been a wild buffalo, or some kindred animal of the bovine genus, whose size, fierceness, and length of horn made it a wonder and a fear. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/23-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_410.htm">Strong's 410: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strength -- as adjective, mighty, the Almighty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">brought them out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1460;&#1497;&#1488;&#1464;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7779;&#238;&#183;&#8217;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3318.htm">Strong's 3318: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, bring, out, direct and proxim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Egypt</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;mi&#7779;&#183;r&#257;&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4714.htm">Strong's 4714: </a> </span><span class="str2">Egypt -- a son of Ham, also his descendants and their country in Northwest Africa</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with strength</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1458;&#1508;&#1465;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;p&#772;&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8443.htm">Strong's 8443: </a> </span><span class="str2">Weariness, toil, speed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">like a wild ox.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7214.htm">Strong's 7214: </a> </span><span class="str2">A wild bull</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/numbers/23-22.htm">Numbers 23:22 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/numbers/23-22.htm">Numbers 23:22 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/numbers/23-22.htm">Numbers 23:22 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/numbers/23-22.htm">Numbers 23:22 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/numbers/23-22.htm">Numbers 23:22 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/numbers/23-22.htm">Numbers 23:22  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/numbers/23-22.htm">Numbers 23:22 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/numbers/23-22.htm">Numbers 23:22 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/numbers/23-22.htm">Numbers 23:22 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/numbers/23-22.htm">Numbers 23:22 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/numbers/23-22.htm">OT Law: Numbers 23:22 God brings them out of Egypt (Nu Num.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/numbers/23-21.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Numbers 23:21"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 23:21" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/numbers/23-23.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Numbers 23:23"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 23:23" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
