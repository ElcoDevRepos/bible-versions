His sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, were adopted by Jacob as his own, effectively giving Joseph a double portion among the tribes of Israel. This reflects the blessing Jacob gave to Joseph in <a href="/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5</a>. Joseph's legacy is significant, as his life story is a type of Christ, with themes of suffering, redemption, and exaltation.<p><b>From the sons of Ephraim:</b><br>Ephraim, the younger son of Joseph, received a greater blessing from Jacob than his older brother Manasseh (<a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a>). Ephraim's tribe became one of the most prominent in Israel, often representing the northern kingdom in prophetic literature. The tribe's central location in the land of Canaan and its association with key biblical figures like Joshua highlight its importance.<p><b>According to the records of their clans and families:</b><br>The organization of Israel into clans and families underscores the importance of lineage and heritage in maintaining tribal identity. This structure was crucial for land inheritance and fulfilling God's covenant promises. The detailed genealogical records reflect the Israelites' emphasis on order and continuity, as seen in other passages like <a href="/1_chronicles/7-20.htm">1 Chronicles 7:20-27</a>.<p><b>Counting the names of all those twenty years of age or older:</b><br>The age of twenty was significant as it marked the beginning of military service eligibility. This census was not just for administrative purposes but also for preparing the nation for conquest and defense. The age requirement is consistent with other biblical passages, such as <a href="/exodus/30-14.htm">Exodus 30:14</a>, where those twenty and older were required to give an offering.<p><b>Who could serve in the army:</b><br>Military service was a vital aspect of Israelite society, as the nation was often engaged in battles to secure and maintain the Promised Land. The emphasis on those who could serve highlights the need for readiness and strength in fulfilling God's commands to possess the land. This also foreshadows the spiritual battles believers face, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, where the armor of God is necessary for spiritual warfare.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_joseph.htm">Sons of Joseph</a></b><br>Refers to the descendants of Joseph, one of the twelve sons of Jacob, who became two tribes in Israel: Ephraim and Manasseh.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>One of the tribes of Israel, named after Joseph's younger son, Ephraim.
