This event highlights the consequences of disobedience and lack of faith in God's provision. The name itself serves as a reminder of the dangers of succumbing to fleshly desires. This location marks a pivotal moment in Israel's wilderness journey, emphasizing the importance of reliance on God rather than succumbing to worldly temptations.<p><b>the people moved on</b><br>The movement of the Israelites signifies a transition in their journey through the wilderness. It reflects God's guidance and the nomadic lifestyle of the Israelites during this period. This movement is part of the larger narrative of the Exodus, where God leads His people towards the Promised Land. It also underscores the theme of obedience to God's direction, as the Israelites follow the cloud by day and the fire by night (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>).<p><b>to Hazeroth</b><br>Hazeroth is the next significant stop in the Israelites' journey. It is here that Miriam and Aaron speak against Moses, leading to Miriam's leprosy (<a href="/numbers/12.htm">Numbers 12:1-10</a>). This location serves as a backdrop for lessons on leadership, humility, and the consequences of challenging God's chosen leaders. Hazeroth's mention in the journey narrative highlights the ongoing challenges and growth of the Israelite community as they learn to trust and follow God's appointed leaders.<p><b>where they remained for some time</b><br>The phrase indicates a period of rest and possibly reflection for the Israelites. This pause in their journey allows for the resolution of internal conflicts, such as the incident with Miriam and Aaron. It also provides an opportunity for the community to regroup and prepare for the next stage of their journey. The duration of their stay is not specified, but it suggests a time of preparation and learning, reinforcing the idea that God's timing and purposes are paramount in the journey of faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kibroth-hattaavah.htm">Kibroth-hattaavah</a></b><br>This is the place where the Israelites buried the people who craved other food and where God sent a plague as a consequence of their complaints and disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hazeroth.htm">Hazeroth</a></b><br>The next stop for the Israelites after Kibroth-hattaavah.

The name itself memorializes both the sin and the judgment, reminding Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;that unchecked desire can bury a person&#8217;s future. <a href="/psalms/78-30.htm">Psalm 78:30-31</a> echoes the moment: &#8220;They had not yet satisfied their craving&#8230; the anger of God rose against them&#8221;. Paul later points to the scene in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6</a> as a caution to believers. By recording the campsite&#8217;s name, Moses underscores God&#8217;s literal, historical dealing with sin and the importance of learning from it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The people moved on</b><p>Though discipline had just fallen, the cloud still lifted and led the camp forward (<a href="/numbers/10-11.htm">Numbers 10:11-13</a>; <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). Grace propels, not paralyzes.<p>&#8226; Israel could not linger in regret; God&#8217;s agenda required motion.<p>&#8226; Every march reaffirmed that He was still their Guide, just as <a href="/deuteronomy/1-31.htm">Deuteronomy 1:31-33</a> describes Him carrying His people &#8220;as a man carries his son&#8221;.<p>The transition invites believers today to leave failure behind and follow the Shepherd&#8217;s next step.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To Hazeroth</b><p>Hazeroth (&#8220;enclosures&#8221;) becomes the stage for the next heart test&#8212;Miriam and Aaron&#8217;s challenge to Moses (<a href="/numbers/12-1.htm">Numbers 12:1-15</a>). By linking the locations, the narrative shows that victory in one area does not immunize us from fresh trials. <a href="/exodus/40-36.htm">Exodus 40:36-38</a> notes that Israel only pitched where the cloud stopped, highlighting God&#8217;s precise oversight. <a href="/hebrews/11-13.htm">Hebrews 11:13</a> reminds us that these pilgrims &#8220;confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth&#8221;; each campsite, including Hazeroth, was a temporary stop on the way home.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Where they remained for some time</b><p>This pause was not wasted.

The extended stay thus became a classroom where God shaped character before the next march.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/11-35.htm">Numbers 11:35</a> records far more than a travel log. It chronicles a course correction after judgment, affirms God&#8217;s unfailing guidance, foreshadows new challenges at Hazeroth, and highlights the formative power of waiting. The verse invites every follower of Christ to bury past cravings, keep in step with God&#8217;s leading, embrace the lessons of each stop, and trust Him to transform pauses into preparation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And abode at Hazeroth.</span> Or, "were in Hazeroth."

Hazeroth, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to shut in, means "enclosures;" so named perhaps from some ancient stone enclosures erected by wandering tribes for their herds and flocks. It has been identified with Ain el Hadhera, a fountain eighteen hours northeast of Sinai, but on no satisfactory grounds beyond a partial resemblance of name. Assuming that the march lay in a northerly direction through the desert of Paran, the Israelites would naturally follow the road which leads across the southern mountain barrier of et-Tih, and on by the Wady es-Zulakeh into the desert plateau. On this road there is a large fountain, with pasturage, at a place called el Ain, and another somewhat further at Bit ed-Themmed. One or other of these was probably the site of Hazeroth (cf. Stanley, 'Sinai,' page 84). It is, however, entirely a matter of conjecture, and of little real interest. The progress of Israel which is of unfading importance to us is a moral and religious, and not a geographical, progress. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/11-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">From</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1447;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(miq&#183;qi&#7687;&#183;r&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">Kibroth-hattaavah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1469;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1493;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hat&#183;ta&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;w&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
