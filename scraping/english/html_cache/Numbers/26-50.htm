The mention of "clans" indicates the subdivisions within the tribe, which were based on family lines. This tribal structure was crucial for maintaining order and identity among the Israelites. The land allotted to Naphtali was in the northern part of Canaan, a region known for its fertile land and strategic location. This area later became significant in the New Testament as part of the region where Jesus conducted much of His ministry, fulfilling the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a> about a great light shining in Galilee.<p><b>and their registration numbered 45,400</b><br>The census of the Israelites, as recorded in the Book of Numbers, was conducted to determine the number of men eligible for military service. The figure of 45,400 represents the men of fighting age from the tribe of Naphtali. This census was the second one taken during the Israelites' wilderness journey, the first being recorded in <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>. The numbers reflect the growth or decline of each tribe and are significant for understanding the dynamics of Israel's population. The tribe of Naphtali experienced a decrease from the first census, where they numbered 53,400. This decrease could be attributed to various factors, including the challenges faced during the wilderness journey. The census underscores God's faithfulness in preserving His people despite their trials and foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of His promises through Jesus Christ, who would come from the lineage of Israel to bring salvation to all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naphtali.htm">Naphtali</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Naphtali, the sixth son of Jacob and the second son of Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant.

Even so, the tribe remains substantial, testifying both to God&#8217;s ongoing provision during the forty years (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-4.htm">Deuteronomy 8:4</a>) and to the sobering reality of wilderness discipline (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-30</a>).<p>- The precise total underscores that the Promised Land will be apportioned fairly: &#8220;To a larger tribe give a larger inheritance, and to a smaller tribe a smaller one&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/26-54.htm">Numbers 26:54</a>).<p>- Cross-reference: when Deborah later calls Naphtali to battle (<a href="/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6-10</a>), the tribe&#8217;s strength can be traced back to this God-recorded muster roll.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/26-50.htm">Numbers 26:50</a> records more than a statistic; it captures the faithfulness of God to multiply the family of Naphtali, preserve it through wilderness years, and prepare it for its allotted place in Canaan.
