The "covering of fine leather" likely refers to a durable material, possibly from sea cows or another source, used to protect the Ark of the Covenant from the elements and from being seen by unauthorized individuals. This reflects the holiness and sanctity of the Ark, emphasizing the need for reverence and care in handling sacred objects. The use of fine leather signifies the importance and value of the Ark, as it was the most sacred item in the Tabernacle, representing God's presence among His people.<p><b>spread a solid blue cloth over it</b><br>The blue cloth symbolizes the heavenly origin and divine nature of the Ark. Blue is often associated with the heavens and the divine in biblical symbolism, as seen in other parts of the Tabernacle's construction and priestly garments (<a href="/exodus/28-31.htm">Exodus 28:31</a>). This color choice underscores the Ark's role as the earthly throne of God, where His presence dwelt among the Israelites. The use of blue also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty and the heavenly kingdom, pointing forward to the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as the King of Kings.<p><b>and insert its poles</b><br>The insertion of poles into the Ark's rings was a practical measure for transportation, ensuring that the Ark was never touched directly by human hands, which was forbidden (<a href="/exodus/25-14.htm">Exodus 25:14-15</a>). This method of carrying the Ark highlights the holiness of God and the need for separation between the divine and the profane. The poles also allowed the Ark to be moved without being dismantled, preserving its sanctity. This practice is a reminder of the reverence required in approaching God, a theme that runs throughout Scripture and is fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus, who provides believers with access to God while maintaining His holiness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>Leaders of the Israelites, responsible for instructing the Levites on their duties.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kohathites.htm">The Kohathites</a></b><br>A division of the Levites tasked with carrying the most sacred items of the Tabernacle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the presence of God among the Israelites during their journey in the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>The most sacred item in the Tabernacle, representing God's covenant with Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness_journey.htm">The Wilderness Journey</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites traveled from Egypt to the Promised Land, during which the Tabernacle was used.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_the_holy.htm">Reverence for the Holy</a></b><br>The detailed instructions for covering and transporting the Ark remind us of the need to approach God with reverence and respect.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Kohathites' role underscores the importance of following God's specific instructions in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_blue_cloth.htm">Symbolism of the Blue Cloth</a></b><br>The blue cloth represents the heavenly nature of God's presence, reminding us to keep our focus on spiritual matters.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_responsibility.htm">Community and Responsibility</a></b><br>The division of labor among the Levites teaches us about the importance of community and shared responsibility in serving God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_in_our_journey.htm">God's Presence in Our Journey</a></b><br>Just as the Ark accompanied the Israelites, we are reminded that God's presence is with us throughout our life's journey.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_4_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 4:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Num_4_6_show_worship_reverence.htm">How does Numbers 4:6 demonstrate the importance of reverence in worship practices?
