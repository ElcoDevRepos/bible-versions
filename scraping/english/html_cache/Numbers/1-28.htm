Issachar is often associated with wisdom and understanding, as seen in <a href="/1_chronicles/12-32.htm">1 Chronicles 12:32</a>, where the men of Issachar are described as having understanding of the times. This tribe was known for its agricultural prowess, as their territory was fertile and conducive to farming.<p><b>According to the records of their clans and families</b><br>The organization of the tribes into clans and families reflects the patriarchal structure of ancient Israelite society. This system ensured that lineage and inheritance were clearly defined, which was crucial for maintaining tribal identity and land ownership. The records were likely kept meticulously, as seen in other parts of the Pentateuch, to ensure accurate genealogical and census data.<p><b>Counting the names of all those twenty years of age or older</b><br>The age of twenty was significant in Israelite culture as it marked the transition to adulthood and eligibility for military service. This age requirement is consistent throughout the census instructions in the Book of Numbers. It reflects the importance of readiness for battle in a time when the Israelites were preparing to enter and conquer the Promised Land.<p><b>Who could serve in the army</b><br>Military service was a key responsibility for the men of Israel, as they were tasked with defending their people and securing the land promised to them by God. This phrase underscores the necessity of a strong and organized military force. The concept of serving in the army also has spiritual implications, as it symbolizes the readiness and willingness to fight for God's purposes, drawing parallels to the New Testament call for Christians to be soldiers of Christ (<a href="/2_timothy/2-3.htm">2 Timothy 2:3-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_issachar.htm">Sons of Issachar</a></b><br>This refers to the descendants of Issachar, one of the twelve sons of Jacob, whose tribe was known for its wisdom and understanding of the times.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/genealogies.htm">Genealogies</a></b><br>The record of lineage and family history, which was crucial for establishing identity and inheritance among the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/clans_and_families.htm">Clans and Families</a></b><br>The subdivisions within the tribe of Issachar, indicating the importance of family structure and community in Israelite society.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/twenty_years_of_age_or_older.htm">Twenty Years of Age or Older</a></b><br>This age was significant as it marked the eligibility for military service, reflecting the readiness and responsibility expected of young men in Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/army_service.htm">Army Service</a></b><br>The context of this verse is a census for military purposes, highlighting the organization and preparedness of the Israelites as they journeyed towards the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_heritage.htm">Understanding Our Heritage</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites valued genealogies, Christians should understand their spiritual heritage and identity in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparedness_for_spiritual_battle.htm">Preparedness for Spiritual Battle</a></b><br>The census for military service reminds believers of the need to be spiritually prepared and equipped for the battles they face in life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_and_discernment.htm">Wisdom and Discernment</a></b><br>Like the sons of Issachar, Christians are called to understand the times and discern God&#8217;s will in their lives and communities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_accountability.htm">Community and Accountability</a></b><br>The structure of clans and families underscores the importance of community and accountability within the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/age_and_responsibility.htm">Age and Responsibility</a></b><br>The age of military service reflects the transition to responsibility and service, encouraging young believers to step into roles of leadership and service in the church.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_1_28_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 1:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_1_28_Church_leadership_s_role.htm">How does Numbers 1:28 emphasize the importance of organized leadership in the church?
