It is a sign of the covenant between God and Israel, emphasizing rest and holiness (<a href="/exodus/31-16.htm">Exodus 31:16-17</a>). The Sabbath offerings highlight the importance of dedicating this day to the Lord, setting it apart from the regular daily offerings.<p><b>present two unblemished year-old male lambs</b><br>The requirement for the lambs to be unblemished signifies purity and perfection, reflecting the holiness required in offerings to God. The age of one year indicates maturity and prime condition. This foreshadows Christ, the Lamb of God, who is without blemish or defect (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>). The number two may symbolize witness and testimony, reinforcing the importance of the Sabbath.<p><b>accompanied by a grain offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil</b><br>The grain offering, or "minchah," represents the fruits of human labor and dedication to God. Fine flour signifies purity and quality, while oil often symbolizes the Holy Spirit. The specific measure, two-tenths of an ephah, indicates a substantial offering, reflecting generosity and devotion. This offering complements the animal sacrifice, showing a holistic approach to worship involving both animal and agricultural elements.<p><b>as well as a drink offering</b><br>The drink offering, typically wine, is poured out as a libation, symbolizing the pouring out of one's life in service to God. It complements the burnt and grain offerings, completing the sacrificial system. This act of pouring out can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament understanding of Christ's blood being poured out for the forgiveness of sins (<a href="/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>).

This weekly rest was instituted in <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8&#8211;11</a> as a memorial of God&#8217;s completed creation and His covenant with Israel. <a href="/leviticus/23-3.htm">Leviticus 23:3</a> calls it &#8220;a Sabbath of complete rest, a sacred assembly.&#8221; Setting the sacrifice on this day highlights that worship is at the core of Sabbath observance, not merely refraining from labor. The extra offerings in <a href="/bsb/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a> are in addition to the daily morning and evening lambs (<a href="/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3&#8211;4</a>), underscoring that the Sabbath is a day of increased devotion. <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9</a> points forward to a deeper &#8220;Sabbath rest&#8221; fulfilled in Christ, but the pattern of weekly worship and dependence on God remains intact.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>present two unblemished year-old male lambs</b><p>The requirement for &#8220;two unblemished year-old male lambs&#8221; stresses both quality and innocence:<p>&#8226; Unblemished: <a href="/leviticus/22-20.htm">Leviticus 22:20&#8211;22</a> insists that only perfect animals be given to God, prefiguring the sinlessness of Christ (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Year-old: Young, vigorous life is offered, symbolizing the best and first of one&#8217;s resources (<a href="/exodus/12-5.htm">Exodus 12:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Two lambs: Doubling the normal daily lamb offering signals a heightened holiness for the Sabbath (compare <a href="/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3</a> with 28:9).
