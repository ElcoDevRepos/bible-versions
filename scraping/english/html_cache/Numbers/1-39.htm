The tribe's inheritance was located in the northern part of Israel, which later became known for idolatry (<a href="/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30-31</a>). Dan's role in the encampment was on the north side of the tabernacle, alongside Asher and Naphtali, forming the rear guard during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/2-25.htm">Numbers 2:25-31</a>). The tribe of Dan is also mentioned in the context of the judges, with Samson being one of its most famous members (Judges 13-16). In the book of Revelation, the tribe of Dan is notably absent from the list of the sealed tribes (<a href="/revelation/7-4.htm">Revelation 7:4-8</a>), which has led to various interpretations regarding its spiritual significance.<p><b>numbered 62,700</b><br>The census in <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a> was conducted to determine the number of men eligible for military service, specifically those aged twenty and above. The tribe of Dan had a significant number of fighting men, indicating its strength and potential influence among the tribes. The number 62,700 reflects the tribe's growth since the family of Dan originally consisted of only one son, Hushim (<a href="/genesis/46-23.htm">Genesis 46:23</a>). This increase demonstrates God's promise of multiplication to the descendants of Jacob (<a href="/genesis/35-11.htm">Genesis 35:11</a>). The census was crucial for organizing the Israelites for their journey to the Promised Land and for preparing them for the battles they would face. The large number also highlights the fulfillment of God's covenant promises to Abraham regarding the multiplication of his descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_dan.htm">Tribe of Dan</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Dan, the fifth son of Jacob and Bilhah.
