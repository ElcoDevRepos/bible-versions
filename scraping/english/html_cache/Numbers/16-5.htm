This rebellion is significant as it represents a direct challenge to God's appointed order. Korah, a Levite, sought the priesthood, which was reserved for Aaron and his descendants. This reflects a broader theme of rebellion against divine authority, seen throughout Scripture, such as in the rebellion of Satan and the fall of man in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.<p><b>Tomorrow morning the LORD will reveal who belongs to Him and who is holy</b><br>The timing of "tomorrow morning" indicates a period of waiting and reflection, allowing the rebels to consider their actions. The phrase "the LORD will reveal" underscores God's sovereignty and His role as the ultimate judge. The concept of holiness is central, as it denotes being set apart for God's purposes. This echoes the separation of Israel as God's chosen people (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>) and foreshadows the New Testament teaching of the Church as a holy nation (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><b>and He will bring that person near to Himself</b><br>This phrase highlights the privilege of being in God's presence, a theme prevalent in the Old Testament, where only the high priest could enter the Holy of Holies once a year (Leviticus 16). It points to the intimacy and favor associated with being chosen by God. This anticipates the New Covenant, where believers are brought near to God through Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a>).<p><b>The one He chooses He will bring near to Himself</b><br>God's choice is based on His divine will and purpose, not human merit. This principle is seen in God's selection of David over his brothers (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>) and is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing God's sovereignty in election. It also prefigures Christ, the chosen one, who brings believers near to God through His sacrificial death and resurrection (<a href="/john/15-16.htm">John 15:16</a>, <a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/korah.htm">Korah</a></b><br>A Levite who led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, questioning their leadership and authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/followers_of_korah.htm">Followers of Korah</a></b><br>A group of 250 community leaders who joined Korah in his rebellion against Moses and Aaron.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who will demonstrate His choice and authority in this situation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God among His people, where His presence was made known.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_authority_and_order.htm">Divine Authority and Order</a></b><br>God establishes leaders and authority according to His divine will.

This reflects confidence that God will act without delay, much as He did when Moses said, &#8220;Tomorrow the LORD will do this&#8221; in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/9-5.htm">Exodus 9:5</a>).<p>- The timing stresses accountability. A night&#8217;s pause allows reflection, yet it prevents the rebels from claiming coincidence when judgment comes (<a href="/1_kings/18-36.htm">1 Kings 18:36&#8211;39</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The LORD will reveal who belongs to Him</b><p>- Ownership is God&#8217;s prerogative. &#8220;Nevertheless, God&#8217;s firm foundation stands: &#8216;The Lord knows those who are His&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/2-19.htm">2 Timothy 2:19</a>).<p>- True belonging is not shown by titles or loud claims but by God&#8217;s public vindication, as He later vindicated Elijah before the prophets of Baal (<a href="/1_kings/18-37.htm">1 Kings 18:37&#8211;38</a>).<p>- Jesus echoes this certainty: &#8220;I know My own and My own know Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and who is holy</b><p>- Holiness means being set apart by God, not self-appointed distinction.

God&#8217;s choice, not majority vote, determines leadership (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-5.htm">Deuteronomy 18:5</a>).<p>- Jesus affirmed the same principle: &#8220;You did not choose Me, but I chose you&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-16.htm">John 15:16</a>).<p>- For believers today, comfort rests in God&#8217;s selecting grace rather than self-promotion (<a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/16-5.htm">Numbers 16:5</a> declares that God alone identifies His own, sets them apart, and grants them access to serve Him. Moses assures the rebels that by the next morning God will visibly affirm His choice, silencing human contention. The passage reminds every generation that holiness and ministry flow from God&#8217;s sovereign call, and genuine nearness to Him is always His gracious initiative.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">And he spake</span> <span class= "bld">unto Korah and unto all his company.</span>--The words seem to have been addressed only to Korah and his company, not to Dathan and Abiram, who do not appear to have been present on this occasion.

It may well be that his position as a prominent Levite and a relation of Moses gave him great influence with men of other tribes, and earned him a great name for disinterestedness and liberality in advocating the rights of all Israel, and in denouncing the exclusive claims and privileges by which he himself (as a Levite) was benefited. It is often assumed that Korah was secretly aiming at the high-priesthood, but of this, again, there is not a shadow of proof; his error was great enough, and his punishment sore enough, without casting upon him these unfounded accusations. It would be more in accordance with human nature if we supposed that Korah was in his way sincere; that he had really convinced himself, by dint of trying to convince others, that Moses and Aaron were usurpers; that he began his agitation without thought of advantage of himself; that, having gained a considerable following and much popular applause, the pride of leadership and the excitement of conflict led him on to the last extremity. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord</span> will <span class="cmt_word">show who are his.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x5be;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, the meaning of which is defined by the following words, "whom he hath chosen."
