The command not to redeem these animals underscores their dedication to God. This reflects the broader principle of offering the first and best to God, as seen in <a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>, where the firstborn of both man and beast are consecrated to the Lord. The concept of redemption, or buying back, is significant in biblical theology, pointing to the ultimate redemption through Christ, who is referred to as the firstborn over all creation (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>).<p><b>they are holy.</b><br>The term "holy" signifies being set apart for God&#8217;s purposes. In <a href="/leviticus/27-26.htm">Leviticus 27:26</a>, it is stated that the firstborn of animals already belong to the Lord and cannot be consecrated again. This holiness is a reminder of God's ownership and the Israelites' covenant relationship with Him. The holiness of these animals prefigures the holiness required of believers, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/1-16.htm">1 Peter 1:16</a>, "Be holy, because I am holy."<p><b>You are to splatter their blood on the altar</b><br>The act of splattering blood on the altar is a key component of sacrificial rituals, symbolizing atonement and purification. <a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a> explains that the life of the flesh is in the blood, and it is given on the altar to make atonement for souls. This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose blood was shed for the remission of sins (<a href="/hebrews/9-22.htm">Hebrews 9:22</a>).<p><b>and burn their fat as a food offering,</b><br>Burning the fat of the sacrifice was considered the offering of the best part to God, as fat was associated with richness and abundance. <a href="/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a> states that all the fat is the Lord's, emphasizing the idea of giving God the choicest portions. This act of burning the fat symbolizes the complete dedication and surrender to God.<p><b>a pleasing aroma to the LORD.</b><br>The phrase "a pleasing aroma" is frequently used in the Old Testament to describe sacrifices that are acceptable to God (<a href="/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>, <a href="/exodus/29-18.htm">Exodus 29:18</a>). It signifies God's satisfaction with the offering and the worshiper's obedience.
