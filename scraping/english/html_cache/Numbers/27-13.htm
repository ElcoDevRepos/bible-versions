This moment is significant as it fulfills God's promise to show Moses the land, even though he would not enter it due to his disobedience at Meribah (<a href="/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>). The act of seeing the land symbolizes the culmination of Moses' leadership and the journey of the Israelites from Egypt. It also serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises, despite human shortcomings.<p><b>you too will be gathered to your people</b><br>The phrase "gathered to your people" is a common biblical expression for death, indicating a reunion with ancestors in the afterlife. This reflects the belief in an existence beyond death and a continuity of the covenant community. It underscores the idea of a spiritual heritage and the hope of being united with those who have gone before. This concept is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a> regarding Abraham and <a href="/genesis/49-33.htm">Genesis 49:33</a> concerning Jacob.<p><b>as your brother Aaron was</b><br>Aaron's death is recorded in <a href="/numbers/20-22.htm">Numbers 20:22-29</a>, where he ascends Mount Hor and dies there, passing his priestly garments to his son Eleazar. This parallel between Moses and Aaron highlights the end of an era of leadership for the Israelites. Both brothers played crucial roles in leading the people out of Egypt and through the wilderness. Their deaths signify a transition in leadership to the next generation, specifically to Joshua, who will lead the Israelites into the Promised Land. This transition also points to the continuity of God's plan and the importance of faithful leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

The Lord graciously allowed him to view that inheritance from afar (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-1.htm">Deuteronomy 34:1-4</a>), even though Moses&#8217; earlier sin at Meribah (<a href="/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>) meant he would not set foot in it. The wording reminds us that God is both overflowing in grace&#8212;letting Moses see the land&#8212;and unwavering in holiness&#8212;keeping His stated consequence. Much later, Jesus likewise affirmed that God&#8217;s Word never fails, &#8220;not the smallest letter&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>). So, for Moses, sight of the land would be a closing gift, a tangible confirmation that every promise stands firm.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you too will be gathered to your people</b><p>The phrase does more than record a burial notice. Throughout Genesis and onward (<a href="/genesis/25-8.htm">Genesis 25:8</a>; 35:29; 49:33), &#8220;gathered to his people&#8221; points to conscious fellowship beyond the grave. Moses would be reunited with the faithful who had gone before, not lost in oblivion. The wording balances solemnity with hope: death is real, yet it ushers God&#8217;s servants into continued relationship with Him and His covenant family (<a href="/2_samuel/12-23.htm">2 Samuel 12:23</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22-24</a>). For believers today, this line foreshadows the fuller revelation of being &#8220;at home with the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as your brother Aaron was</b><p>God links Moses&#8217; coming death to Aaron&#8217;s recent passing on Mount Hor (<a href="/numbers/20-24.htm">Numbers 20:24-29</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-6.htm">Deuteronomy 10:6</a>). Aaron&#8217;s peaceful departure set a pattern: leadership transferred, mission continued, and the people mourned yet moved forward under God&#8217;s ongoing guidance. By referencing Aaron, the Lord assures Moses that his own exit will be just as orderly&#8212;no chaotic power vacuum, no diminished presence of God among the people. Joshua is already being prepared (<a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18-23</a>), underscoring that God&#8217;s work surpasses any one individual.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/27-13.htm">Numbers 27:13</a> reveals a tender yet uncompromising God. He lets Moses behold the promised land, affirms reunion with the faithful beyond death, and ties Moses&#8217; departure to Aaron&#8217;s to stress continuity in leadership. The verse calls us to trust God&#8217;s promises, submit to His discipline, and rest in the certainty that death for His people is a gathering, not a goodbye.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Gathered unto thy people.--</span>See <a href="/genesis/25-8.htm" title="Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.">Genesis 25:8</a>, and Note.
