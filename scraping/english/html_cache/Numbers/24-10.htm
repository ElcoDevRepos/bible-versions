This anger reflects the tension between the Moabites and Israelites as the latter approached the Promised Land. Balak's reaction underscores the spiritual battle between God's will and human desires. The burning anger signifies a deep-seated frustration when human plans are thwarted by divine intervention.<p><b>and he struck his hands together</b><br>This gesture is a cultural expression of anger and frustration, common in ancient Near Eastern societies. It symbolizes a dramatic display of emotion, emphasizing Balak's exasperation. The act of striking hands together can also be seen as a precursor to taking decisive action, often in a negative context.<p><b>and said to Balaam,</b><br>Balak directly addresses Balaam, indicating a confrontation. This interaction highlights the tension between a political leader and a prophet, showcasing the struggle between earthly authority and divine messages. Balaam, despite being a non-Israelite prophet, is portrayed as a conduit for God's will, which further frustrates Balak.<p><b>&#8220;I summoned you to curse my enemies,</b><br>Balak's intent was clear: he wanted Balaam to curse the Israelites, whom he viewed as a threat. This reflects the ancient belief in the power of spoken blessings and curses, a common practice in the ancient world. The Moabites saw the Israelites as enemies due to their proximity and potential to conquer the land.<p><b>but behold, you have persisted in blessing them</b><br>Despite Balak's intentions, Balaam repeatedly blessed the Israelites, demonstrating God's sovereignty and the futility of opposing His will. This persistence in blessing highlights the theme of divine protection over Israel. It also serves as a reminder of God's promises to Abraham, that those who bless Israel will be blessed.<p><b>these three times.</b><br>The repetition of blessings three times signifies completeness and divine confirmation. In biblical numerology, the number three often represents completeness or perfection. This triadic structure emphasizes the certainty and irrevocability of God's blessing on Israel, despite human attempts to alter it.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak.htm">Balak</a></b><br>The king of Moab who sought to curse the Israelites due to his fear of their growing power and presence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner hired by Balak to curse the Israelites, but who ultimately spoke blessings over them as directed by God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>The region ruled by Balak, located east of the Dead Sea, which was threatened by the advancing Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, journeying to the Promised Land, whom Balak feared and sought to curse.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The overarching theme of God's control and blessing over His people, despite human intentions to harm them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_human_intentions.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Human Intentions</a></b><br>Despite Balak's intentions, God's will prevails.
