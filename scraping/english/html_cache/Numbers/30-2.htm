These vows were considered sacred and binding. The practice of making vows is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the story of Hannah, who vowed to dedicate her son Samuel to the Lord (<a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>). Vows were a way to express devotion and commitment to God, reflecting the seriousness of one's relationship with Him.<p><b>or swears an oath to obligate himself by a pledge</b><br>Oaths and pledges were formal declarations that invoked God's name as a witness to the truth of one's words or the fulfillment of a promise. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, oaths were common in legal and personal agreements. The use of God's name in an oath underscored the gravity of the commitment, as breaking such an oath was seen as a direct offense against God Himself. Jesus later addresses the misuse of oaths in <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>, emphasizing the importance of integrity in speech.<p><b>he must not break his word</b><br>The emphasis on keeping one's word highlights the value placed on truthfulness and reliability. In biblical times, a person's word was a reflection of their character. Breaking a vow or oath was not only a personal failure but also a breach of trust within the community. This principle is echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>, which warns against making hasty vows and stresses the importance of fulfilling them.<p><b>he must do everything he has promised</b><br>The requirement to fulfill promises made to God underscores the seriousness with which vows were regarded. This reflects God's own faithfulness and the expectation that His people would mirror His character. The call to complete what one has vowed is a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and His people, where faithfulness and obedience are central themes. This principle is further reinforced in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to let their "yes" be "yes" and their "no" be "no" (<a href="/james/5-12.htm">James 5:12</a>), emphasizing the importance of integrity and consistency in one's commitments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received and communicated God's laws, including those concerning vows and oaths.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws were given, living in the wilderness during their journey to the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, to whom vows and oaths are made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/vows_and_oaths.htm">Vows and Oaths</a></b><br>Sacred promises made to God, which are binding and must be fulfilled.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_words.htm">The Sanctity of Words</a></b><br>Our words hold power and significance, especially when making commitments to God.

This, however, cannot be strictly maintained, because the Nazarite vow was <span class="accented">neder</span>, and that was essentially a vow of abstinence. To say that the vow of the Nazarite was of a positive character because he had to let his hair grow "unto the Lord" is a mere evasion. It is, however, probable that <span class="accented">neder</span>, when it occurs (as in this passage) in connection with <span class="accented">issar</span>, does take on the narrower signification of a positive vow. <span class="cmt_word">Swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond.</span> Literally, "to bind a bond upon his soul." <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, a bond, which occurs only in this chapter, is considered to be a restrictive obligation, a vow of abstinence. It would appear that the <span class="accented">issar</span> was always undertaken upon oath, whereas the <span class="accented">neder</span> (as in the case of the Nazarite) did not of necessity require it. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">shall not break his word.</span> This was the general principle with respect to vows, and, as here ]aid down, it was in accordance with the universal religious feeling of mankind. Whatever crimes may have claimed the sanction of this sentiment, whatever exceptions and safeguards a clearer revelation and a better knowledge of God may have established, yet the principle remained that whatsoever a man had promised unto the Lord, that he must fulfill. Iphigenia in Aulis, Jephthah's daughter in Gilead, proclaim to what horrid extremities any one religious principle, unchecked by other coordinate principles, may lead; but they also proclaim how deep and true this religious principle must have been which could so over-ride the natural feelings of men not cruel nor depraved. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/30-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">makes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(yid&#183;d&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5087.htm">Strong's 5087: </a> </span><span class="str2">To promise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a vow</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1462;&#1436;&#1491;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ne&#183;&#7695;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5088.htm">Strong's 5088: </a> </span><span class="str2">A promise, a thing promised</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
