Manasseh, along with his brother Ephraim, was adopted by Jacob as his own sons, which gave Joseph a double portion among the tribes of Israel. This adoption is significant as it fulfilled Jacob's blessing and prophecy over Joseph's sons in <a href="/genesis/48.htm">Genesis 48</a>. The tribe of Manasseh was divided into two half-tribes, one settling on the east side of the Jordan River and the other on the west. This division is important in understanding the geographical and political landscape of Israel during the conquest of Canaan.<p><b>and their registration numbered 52,700</b><br>The census recorded in <a href="/numbers/26.htm">Numbers 26</a> was conducted as the Israelites were preparing to enter the Promised Land. This census was the second one taken during the wilderness period, the first being in <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>. The number 52,700 represents the fighting men of the tribe of Manasseh, indicating a significant increase from the first census, where they numbered 32,200. This growth can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham to make his descendants numerous. The increase in numbers also reflects the tribe's strength and readiness for the upcoming conquest of Canaan. The census was crucial for organizing the military and distributing the land among the tribes, as seen in the subsequent chapters of Numbers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>Manasseh was one of the tribes of Israel, named after Joseph's firstborn son.
