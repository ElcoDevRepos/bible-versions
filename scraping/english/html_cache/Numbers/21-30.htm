The overthrowing of the Amorites demonstrates God's faithfulness in delivering His people and fulfilling His promises. This victory is a testament to the divine assistance the Israelites received, as they were often outnumbered or less equipped than their enemies. The language of overthrowing suggests a complete and decisive victory, emphasizing the power and might of God working through His people.<p><b>Heshbon is destroyed as far as Dibon.</b><br>Heshbon was the capital city of King Sihon of the Amorites. Its destruction signifies the fall of a major stronghold, marking a turning point in the Israelites' conquest. Dibon, located near the Arnon River, was another significant city in the region. The mention of these cities highlights the extent of the conquest, indicating that the Israelites' victory was not limited to a single battle but encompassed a broader campaign. This destruction also fulfills the earlier promise that God would give the land of the Amorites into the hands of Israel (<a href="/numbers/21-24.htm">Numbers 21:24</a>).<p><b>We demolished them as far as Nophah,</b><br>The term "demolished" underscores the thoroughness of the Israelites' victory. Nophah is less well-known, and its exact location is uncertain, but it is believed to be in the vicinity of the other cities mentioned. The mention of Nophah suggests that the Israelites' campaign extended even further than the major cities, indicating a comprehensive defeat of the Amorite territories. This thoroughness in conquest is reminiscent of the complete victory God promises to His people when they follow His commands.<p><b>which reaches to Medeba.&#8221;</b><br>Medeba was a city located on the plateau east of the Jordan River. It is mentioned in other biblical texts, such as <a href="/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a> and <a href="/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>, as part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Reuben. The inclusion of Medeba in this passage highlights the strategic importance of the region and the extent of the Israelite conquest. The phrase "which reaches to Medeba" suggests a far-reaching impact of the victory, extending the influence and control of the Israelites over a significant portion of the land. This expansion is part of the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land his descendants would inherit (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/heshbon.htm">Heshbon</a></b><br>A significant Amorite city, previously ruled by King Sihon.

A poetical word of somewhat doubtful meaning. It is generally supposed to be a verbal form (first person plural imperf. Kal), from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, with an unusual suffix (cf. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span> in <a href="/exodus/29-30.htm">Exodus 29:30</a>). <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> has the primary meaning "to shoot at," the secondary, "to overthrow," as in <a href="/exodus/15-4.htm">Exodus 15:4</a>. Others, however, derive the word from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d4;</span>, a root supposed to mean "burn." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Even unto Dibon.</span> See on Numbers 32:34.

Medeba, of which the ruins are still known by the same name, lay five or six miles south-south-east of Heshbon.
