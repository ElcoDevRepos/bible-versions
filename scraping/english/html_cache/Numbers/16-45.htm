The congregation refers to the Israelites, who were in rebellion against Moses and Aaron. This command echoes previous instances where God instructed separation to avoid the consequences of divine judgment, such as in <a href="/genesis/19-12.htm">Genesis 19:12-13</a> with Lot and Sodom. It underscores the holiness of God and the necessity for His people to be set apart from sin.<p><b>so that I may consume them in an instant.</b><br>This reflects God's righteous anger and the immediacy of His judgment. The language of consuming suggests total destruction, reminiscent of the fate of Nadab and Abihu in <a href="/leviticus/10-2.htm">Leviticus 10:2</a>. It highlights the seriousness of rebellion against God's appointed leaders and His covenant. The phrase also serves as a warning of the consequences of sin, aligning with the broader biblical theme of divine retribution.<p><b>And Moses and Aaron fell facedown.</b><br>This act of falling facedown is a posture of intercession and humility before God. It demonstrates Moses and Aaron's role as mediators for the people, akin to Christ's intercessory role as described in <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>. Their immediate response shows their deep concern for the people and their understanding of God's character, balancing justice with mercy. This act of intercession is a recurring theme in Moses' leadership, as seen in <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>, where he pleads for the Israelites after the golden calf incident.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

His command underscores several truths:<p>&#8226; Holiness demands distance from unrepentant sin. As He earlier said, &#8220;Separate yourselves from this congregation so that I may consume them in an instant&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/16-21.htm">Numbers 16:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The call to come out echoes across Scripture&#8212;&#8220;Therefore come out from among them and be separate&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-17.htm">2 Corinthians 6:17</a>) and &#8220;Come out of her, my people&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience protects.
