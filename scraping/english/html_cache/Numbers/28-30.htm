Goats were commonly used in various offerings, including sin offerings, due to their availability and symbolic representation of sin and atonement. The male goat, in particular, was often chosen for its strength and value. In the context of <a href="/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a>, this offering is part of the prescribed sacrifices for the Israelites, emphasizing the importance of obedience to God's commands in worship. The male goat also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is often symbolically associated with the scapegoat, bearing the sins of the people.<p><b>to make atonement for you</b><br>Atonement in the Old Testament involves the covering or removal of sin, allowing for reconciliation between God and His people. The sacrificial system, including the offering of a male goat, was a means by which the Israelites could maintain a right relationship with God. This concept of atonement is central to the biblical narrative, pointing forward to the New Testament where Jesus Christ is described as the ultimate atonement for sin. His sacrifice on the cross fulfills the need for continual animal sacrifices, providing a once-for-all atonement for humanity. The idea of atonement underscores the seriousness of sin and the necessity of a mediator between God and man.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the laws and instructions from God, including the sacrificial system outlined in Numbers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given specific instructions on how to worship and make atonement for their sins.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence, where sacrifices and offerings were made.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_system.htm">Sacrificial System</a></b><br>The divinely instituted method for atonement and worship, involving various offerings and sacrifices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/atonement.htm">Atonement</a></b><br>The process of making amends or reparation for sin, often through the shedding of blood in the Old Testament context.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_atonement.htm">Understanding Atonement</a></b><br>The concept of atonement in the Old Testament is foundational for understanding the work of Christ.
