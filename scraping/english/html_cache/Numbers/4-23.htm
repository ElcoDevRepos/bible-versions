The age of thirty is significant in biblical narratives; it is the age at which Joseph began his service to Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46</a>), David began his reign (<a href="/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4</a>), and Jesus began His public ministry (<a href="/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23</a>). The upper limit of fifty suggests a time when physical vigor might begin to wane, ensuring that those serving are at their peak capability. This age range underscores the importance of readiness and capability in serving God.<p><b>counting everyone</b><br>The census of the Levites was a practical measure to ensure that all eligible men were accounted for and prepared for their duties. This reflects the order and structure God desired for His people, emphasizing accountability and responsibility. The act of counting also signifies the importance of each individual in the community, as each had a specific role to play in the service of the Tabernacle.<p><b>who comes to serve</b><br>Service in the Tabernacle was not merely a duty but a calling. The Levites were set apart for this sacred task, highlighting the concept of divine election and dedication to God's work. This service was a form of worship, requiring both physical labor and spiritual devotion. It prefigures the New Testament concept of believers as a "royal priesthood" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), called to serve God in various capacities.<p><b>in the work at the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, or Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites. The work involved included transporting, assembling, and maintaining the Tabernacle and its furnishings, as well as assisting in the sacrificial system. This service was crucial for the spiritual life of Israel, as it facilitated the people's relationship with God. The Tabernacle itself is a type of Christ, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), serving as the ultimate meeting place between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gershonites.htm">The Gershonites</a></b><br>A Levitical family responsible for the care of the tabernacle's curtains, coverings, and other fabric elements.
