Their specific role was to care for the most sacred objects of the tabernacle. Unlike the Gershonites and Merarites, who received oxen and carts to transport their assigned parts of the tabernacle, the Kohathites were not given any because their task required a different method of transport. This distinction highlights the unique holiness and sanctity of the items they were responsible for, emphasizing the reverence required in handling sacred objects.<p><b>since they were to carry on their shoulders</b><br>The Kohathites were tasked with carrying the most sacred items, such as the Ark of the Covenant, the table of showbread, the lampstand, and the altars. These items were to be carried on their shoulders using poles, as prescribed in <a href="/exodus/25-14.htm">Exodus 25:14</a> and <a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>. This method of transport underscores the sacredness of these objects, as they were not to be treated as common cargo. The act of carrying these items on their shoulders symbolizes the weight of responsibility and the honor of bearing the presence of God.<p><b>the holy objects</b><br>The holy objects refer to the sacred furnishings and instruments used in the tabernacle worship. These items were consecrated and set apart for divine service, representing God's presence among His people. The holiness of these objects required that they be handled with utmost care and respect, reflecting the broader biblical theme of God's holiness and the call for His people to be holy (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>).<p><b>for which they were responsible</b><br>The Kohathites had a divinely appointed responsibility to care for and transport these sacred items. This responsibility was not just a duty but a calling, reflecting the broader biblical principle of stewardship. Each group within the Levites had specific roles, and the Kohathites' role was crucial for maintaining the sanctity and proper function of the tabernacle. This division of labor within the Levites illustrates the importance of each member of the community fulfilling their God-given role, a theme echoed in the New Testament regarding the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received instructions from God regarding the distribution of the offerings from the leaders of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/kohathites.htm">Kohathites</a></b><br>A division of the Levites, descendants of Kohath, who were responsible for carrying the most sacred objects of the tabernacle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence among the Israelites, containing the Ark of the Covenant and other sacred items.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>The tribe set apart for religious duties, including the care and transport of the tabernacle and its furnishings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/offerings_of_the_leaders.htm">Offerings of the Leaders</a></b><br>The leaders of Israel brought offerings to the tabernacle, which included oxen and carts for transporting the tabernacle's components.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sacred_responsibility.htm">Sacred Responsibility</a></b><br>The Kohathites were entrusted with the most sacred objects, emphasizing the importance of reverence and responsibility in serving God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_instructions.htm">Obedience to God's Instructions</a></b><br>The specific instructions given to the Kohathites highlight the necessity of following God's commands precisely, especially in matters of worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/carrying_the_burden.htm">Carrying the Burden</a></b><br>The Kohathites carried the holy things on their shoulders, symbolizing the personal responsibility and dedication required in serving God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/division_of_labor_in_ministry.htm">Division of Labor in Ministry</a></b><br>The distribution of tasks among the Levites illustrates the importance of recognizing and respecting different roles within the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_proximity_to_god.htm">Holiness and Proximity to God</a></b><br>The Kohathites' role underscores the concept of holiness and the privilege of being close to God's presence, which requires purity and dedication.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_7_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 7:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_no_carts_for_Kohathites_in_Num_7_9.htm">Why were the Kohathites not given carts according to Numbers 7:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_7_9_Obedience_to_God.htm">How does Numbers 7:9 emphasize the importance of obedience to God's instructions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Kohathites_duties_in_Numbers_7_9.htm">What does Numbers 7:9 teach about the responsibilities of the Kohathites?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Kohathites_dedication_to_church.htm">How can we apply the Kohathites' dedication to our service in the church?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Num_7_9_link_to_stewardship.htm">In what ways does Numbers 7:9 connect to the broader theme of stewardship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_no_carts_oxen_for_Kohathites.htm">Why were the Kohathites not given carts or oxen in Numbers 7:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_7_9_God_s_tribe_instructions.htm">How does Numbers 7:9 reflect God's specific instructions for different tribes?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_are_the_Kohathites_duties_in_Num_7_9.htm">What does Numbers 7:9 reveal about the responsibilities of the Kohathites?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_numbers_7.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Numbers 7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_do_non-levites_handle_the_ark.htm">In 1 Chronicles 15:2, where David insists only the Levites may carry the Ark, how do we reconcile this claim with any instances where non-Levites handled it or transported it in other texts?

The contrast is intentional: other Levites received wagons, yet this clan is singled out for different treatment. The narrative reminds us that God&#8217;s instructions are precise and varied according to role (compare <a href="/numbers/4-24.htm">Numbers 4:24-28</a> for Gershon and <a href="/numbers/4-31.htm">Numbers 4:31-32</a> for Merari).
