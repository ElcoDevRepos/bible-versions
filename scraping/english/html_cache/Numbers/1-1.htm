The Israelites had been delivered from Egypt, marking the beginning of their journey to the Promised Land. The "second year" indicates that they have been in the wilderness for over a year, having celebrated the first Passover in the wilderness. This timing is significant as it shows the transition from the initial exodus to the organization and preparation for entering Canaan. The use of a specific date underscores the historical nature of the narrative.<p><b>the LORD spoke to Moses</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the direct communication between God and Moses, highlighting Moses' role as a prophet and leader. It reflects the unique relationship Moses had with God, as seen in <a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>, where it is said that the LORD spoke to Moses face to face. This divine communication is foundational for the authority of the instructions and laws given to the Israelites.<p><b>in the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites. It was constructed according to the detailed instructions given in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25-31</a>. The Tent of Meeting served as a portable sanctuary during the Israelites' journey and symbolized God's presence and guidance. It foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>in the Wilderness of Sinai</b><br>The Wilderness of Sinai is a significant location in the biblical narrative. It is where the Israelites camped after leaving Egypt and where they received the Law, including the Ten Commandments, at Mount Sinai. This wilderness experience was a time of testing and preparation for the Israelites, teaching them reliance on God. The wilderness also serves as a metaphor for spiritual testing and growth, as seen in Jesus' temptation in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>).<p><b>He said:</b><br>This introduction to God's speech indicates the beginning of a divine command or instruction. It sets the stage for the census and organization of the tribes of Israel, which is the primary focus of the first chapter of Numbers. The direct speech from God underscores the authority and importance of the instructions that follow, ensuring that the Israelites are prepared for their journey and eventual conquest of the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who speaks directly to Moses, demonstrating His ongoing relationship and guidance for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
