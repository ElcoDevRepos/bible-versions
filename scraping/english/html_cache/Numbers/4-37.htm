Their primary responsibility was the care of the most sacred objects of the Tabernacle, including the Ark of the Covenant, the table of showbread, the lampstand, and the altars. This role highlights the importance of holiness and reverence in worship, as they were entrusted with the most sacred elements of Israel's religious life. The Kohathites' duties underscore the theme of God's holiness and the need for careful observance of His commands.<p><b>everyone who could serve at the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites as they journeyed through the wilderness. The phrase "everyone who could serve" refers to males between the ages of 30 and 50, who were considered to be in the prime of their life and capable of performing the physically demanding tasks required. This age range ensured that those serving were mature and experienced, yet still physically capable. The service at the Tent of Meeting was a sacred duty, emphasizing the importance of dedication and readiness in serving God.<p><b>Moses and Aaron numbered them</b><br>Moses and Aaron, as leaders of the Israelites, were responsible for organizing the Levites for their service. This numbering was not merely a census but a divinely commanded organization of the people for worship and service. It reflects the order and structure that God desires in worship and community life. Moses, as the prophet and leader, and Aaron, as the high priest, worked together to fulfill God's commands, illustrating the cooperation needed between spiritual and administrative leadership.<p><b>according to the command of the LORD through Moses</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine origin of the instructions given to Moses. The numbering and organization of the Levites were not human decisions but were commanded by God. This underscores the authority of God's word and the importance of obedience to His commands. The phrase also highlights Moses' role as God's chosen mediator, through whom God communicated His will to the people. This foreshadows the ultimate mediator, Jesus Christ, who perfectly reveals God's will and provides the way for humanity to approach God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kohathites.htm">Kohathites</a></b><br>A Levitical clan responsible for the care of the most sacred objects in the Tabernacle, including the Ark of the Covenant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who received and communicated God's laws and instructions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel, who assisted in the numbering and organization of the Levites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tent_of_meeting.htm">Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>Also known as the Tabernacle, it was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/command_of_the_lord.htm">Command of the LORD</a></b><br>The divine instructions given to Moses for the organization and duties of the Levites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The Kohathites were numbered and assigned their duties according to God's command.
