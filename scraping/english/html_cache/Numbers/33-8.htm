It is described as being near the sea, opposite Baal-zephon. This site is significant as it marks the miraculous deliverance of the Israelites from the pursuing Egyptian army. The name Pi-hahiroth may mean "mouth of the gorges," suggesting a geographical feature that could have been a narrow pass or valley leading to the sea.<p><b>and crossed through the sea</b><br>This phrase refers to the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea, a pivotal event in the Exodus narrative. The crossing is a demonstration of God's power and faithfulness, as He parts the waters to allow the Israelites to pass on dry ground. This event is often seen as a type of baptism, symbolizing the transition from slavery to freedom, and is referenced in the New Testament (<a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a>) as a foreshadowing of Christian baptism.<p><b>into the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness represents a place of testing and reliance on God. After the crossing, the Israelites enter a period of wandering, where they must depend on God's provision for survival. This journey through the wilderness is a time of spiritual formation and covenant establishment, as God gives the Law at Mount Sinai.<p><b>and they journeyed three days into the Wilderness of Etham</b><br>The three-day journey is significant as it reflects a period of initial travel before reaching a place of rest or testing. The Wilderness of Etham is part of the larger desert region the Israelites traverse. The number three often symbolizes completeness or divine intervention in biblical narratives.<p><b>and camped at Marah</b><br>Marah is the first encampment after crossing the Red Sea, where the Israelites encounter bitter water. This location is a test of faith and obedience, as God instructs Moses to throw a piece of wood into the water to make it drinkable. Marah symbolizes the challenges and trials faced by the Israelites and God's provision in times of need. The transformation of bitter water into sweet can be seen as a type of Christ, who turns the bitterness of sin into the sweetness of salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pi-hahiroth.htm">Pi-hahiroth</a></b><br>This is the location where the Israelites camped before crossing the Red Sea.

God had specifically directed Israel to camp there (<a href="/exodus/14-2.htm">Exodus 14:2</a>), positioning them so His power would be unmistakable when Pharaoh&#8217;s army closed in.<p>&#8226;Israel moved in literal obedience to the pillar of cloud and fire (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226;The departure underlines how salvation always begins by following God&#8217;s clear word, even when it seems strategically foolish.<p>&#8226;Looking back, Moses records, &#8220;Thus the LORD saved Israel that day&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30-31</a>)&#8212;a reminder that every believer can trace deliverance to a definite moment of God&#8217;s intervention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and crossed through the sea</b><p>&#8220;The Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on their right and on their left&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/14-22.htm">Exodus 14:22</a>).<p>&#8226;This was a literal, supernatural opening of the Red Sea&#8212;no mere marsh or myth (<a href="/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-29.htm">Hebrews 11:29</a>).<p>&#8226;Paul later sees it as a picture of baptism, identifying God&#8217;s people with their Deliverer and separating them from slavery (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226;The crossing stands as the Old Testament&#8217;s clearest illustration of salvation by grace alone: nothing Israel did could earn or enhance the miracle (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into the wilderness</b><p>Once safely across, &#8220;Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went out into the Wilderness&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-22.htm">Exodus 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226;The wilderness is not accidental; God chose it as the place to teach dependence (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226;It also highlights that redemption is not the end of the journey; discipleship follows rescue.<p>&#8226;For us, the wilderness season can feel barren, yet it is often where intimacy with the Lord deepens most.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they journeyed three days into the Wilderness of Etham</b><p>Etham lies at the frontier of Egypt and the Sinai deserts (<a href="/exodus/13-20.htm">Exodus 13:20</a>).

From Pi-hahiroth&#8217;s step of obedience, through the Red Sea&#8217;s saving miracle, into the wilderness classroom, across three days of formative faith, and finally to Marah&#8217;s transforming test, the verse reminds us that the God who delivers also guides, proves, and heals His people every mile of the way.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the wilderness of Etham.</span> This is called the wilderness of Shur in <a href="/exodus/15-22.htm">Exodus 15:22</a>, nor is it easy to explain the occurrence of the name Etham in this connection, for the Etham mentioned in verse 6 lay on the other side of the Red Sea. We do not, however, know what physical changes have taken place since that time, and it is quite possible that at Etham there may have been a ford, or some other easy means of communication, so that the strip of desert along the opposite shore came to be known as the wilderness of Etham. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/33-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They set out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yis&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
