Despite his intentions, Balaam is compelled by God to bless Israel instead. The phrase indicates Balaam's departure from the Moabites, returning to his homeland, likely in Mesopotamia. This reflects the transient nature of his mission and the divine intervention that redirected his purpose. Balaam's acknowledgment of returning to his people suggests a separation from the events concerning Israel, highlighting the distinct path God has for His chosen people.<p><b>but come, let me warn you</b><br>Balaam, despite being unable to curse Israel, offers a prophetic warning to Balak. This indicates a shift from his initial role as a hired diviner to a messenger of God's revelation. The use of "warn" suggests an impending danger or significant future event that Balak should heed. This moment underscores the sovereignty of God in using even those outside of Israel to communicate His plans and purposes. It also reflects the biblical theme of God revealing His will through unexpected means and individuals.<p><b>what this people will do to your people</b><br>"This people" refers to the Israelites, while "your people" refers to the Moabites and their allies. Balaam's prophecy is a foretelling of the future dominance and victories of Israel over the surrounding nations. This aligns with God's promises to Abraham regarding his descendants' inheritance of the land and their triumph over adversaries. The phrase foreshadows the eventual conquests during the time of Joshua and the establishment of Israel in the Promised Land. It also serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness to His covenant with Israel.<p><b>in the days to come.</b><br>This phrase points to future events, indicating that the fulfillment of Balaam's prophecy will occur over time. It suggests a long-term perspective, encompassing not only immediate victories but also the eventual establishment of Israel as a significant nation. The "days to come" can be seen as a reference to the unfolding of God's redemptive plan, which includes the coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, from the line of Israel. This prophetic outlook emphasizes the continuity of God's promises and the ultimate realization of His kingdom purposes through Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet who was hired by Balak to curse Israel but ended up blessing them instead, as God directed him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak.htm">Balak</a></b><br>The king of Moab who feared the Israelites and sought Balaam's help to curse them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A nation located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophecy.htm">Prophecy</a></b><br>Balaam's final oracle, which foretells the future of Israel and its impact on other nations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God's plans cannot be thwarted by human intentions.
