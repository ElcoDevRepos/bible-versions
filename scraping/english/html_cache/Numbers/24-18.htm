Historically, Edom was located southeast of Israel, in what is now southern Jordan. The prophecy of Edom becoming a possession reflects the ongoing tension and eventual subjugation of Edom by Israel. This is seen in the reign of King David, who conquered Edom (<a href="/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a>). Theologically, Edom often symbolizes opposition to God's people, and its subjugation represents the triumph of God's purposes.<p><b>as will Seir, his enemy</b><br>Seir is another name for the mountainous region inhabited by the Edomites. The mention of Seir emphasizes the complete domination over Edom. In biblical history, Seir is frequently associated with Esau and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8-9</a>). The reference to Seir as "his enemy" underscores the adversarial relationship between Edom and Israel. This enmity is rooted in the familial conflict between Jacob and Esau, which extended to their descendants.<p><b>but Israel will perform with valor</b><br>This phrase highlights the strength and courage of Israel, often attributed to their reliance on God. The valor of Israel is not merely military might but also spiritual fortitude. Throughout the Old Testament, Israel's victories are often depicted as acts of divine intervention rather than human strength (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>, <a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>). This valor is a foreshadowing of the ultimate victory of God's people, culminating in the messianic hope found in Jesus Christ, who embodies the true Israel and achieves victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother.

Scripture presents Edom as a long-standing adversary of Israel (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>; <a href="/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-21</a>; <a href="/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>). God, through Balaam&#8217;s oracle, foretells that the land and people who opposed His covenant family would come under Israel&#8217;s control.<p>&#8226; Historical snapshots of fulfillment:<p>&#8211; David &#8220;struck down eighteen thousand Edomites&#8221; and &#8220;placed garrisons in Edom&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/8-13.htm">2 Samuel 8:13-14</a>).<p>&#8211; Amaziah &#8220;killed ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>).<p>&#8211; These victories trace directly to God&#8217;s promise that Abraham&#8217;s descendants would &#8220;possess the gate of their enemies&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The lesson is clear: no matter how entrenched opposition seems, God&#8217;s word stands. Edom&#8217;s pride and aggression (<a href="/obadiah/1-3.htm">Obadiah 1:3-4, 10</a>-14) guaranteed a humbling reversal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as will Seir, his enemy</b><p>&#8220;Seir&#8221; is another name for Edom&#8217;s mountainous territory (<a href="/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8-9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4-5</a>). By repeating the promise&#8212;&#8220;Seir, his enemy&#8221;&#8212;the oracle reinforces two truths:<p>&#8226; Same foe, same fate. The physical landscape tied to Esau&#8217;s lineage would be taken just as surely as Edom&#8217;s people. <a href="/bsb/ezekiel/35.htm">Ezekiel 35</a> echoes this, declaring judgment on &#8220;Mount Seir&#8221; for its perpetual hatred.<p>&#8226; God names the enemy to underscore accountability. Edom chose hostility when Israel sought peaceful passage (<a href="/bsb/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20</a>), and that decision carried lasting consequences.<p>&#8226; For believers today, the mention of Seir reminds us that God notices both the people and the systems that oppose His purposes. None escape His reach.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but Israel will perform with valor</b><p>The verse concludes, &#8220;but Israel will perform with valor.&#8221; Two realities shine through:<p>&#8226; Divine empowerment: Israel&#8217;s courage is no self-generated heroism; it flows from the Lord who fights for them (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-22.htm">Deuteronomy 3:22</a>; <a href="/joshua/10-42.htm">Joshua 10:42</a>).<p>&#8226; Ongoing pattern:<p>&#8211; Joshua&#8217;s conquests demonstrated it (<a href="/joshua/21-44.htm">Joshua 21:44-45</a>).<p>&#8211; David&#8217;s campaigns expanded it (<a href="/psalms/60-12.htm">Psalm 60:12</a>).<p>&#8211; Prophets foresee a final, decisive victory when Messiah reigns (<a href="/zechariah/10-5.htm">Zechariah 10:5</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-14.htm">Revelation 19:14-16</a>).<p>In every era, God equips His people to act boldly, whether in military battles of ancient Israel or spiritual warfare today (<a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-11</a>; <a href="/romans/8-37.htm">Romans 8:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/24-18.htm">Numbers 24:18</a> assures that God&#8217;s covenant promises eclipse every obstacle. Edom and its stronghold Seir, symbols of entrenched opposition, would fall into Israel&#8217;s hands, proving the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness. At the same time, Israel is pictured not as passive recipients but as valiant participants, courageously taking hold of what God had already decreed. The verse invites us to trust the unbreakable word of God, recognize that every adversary ultimately serves His purposes, and step forward in the valor He supplies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also . . . --</span>Better, <span class= "ital">And Edom shall be a possession, and Seir shall be a possession, for his enemies </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the enemies of Israel, or, rather, of the Ruler who was to rise out of Israel).
