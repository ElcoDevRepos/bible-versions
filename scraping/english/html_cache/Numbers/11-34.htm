This naming reflects the significant event that took place there, where the Israelites' craving for meat led to their downfall. Naming places after events was a common practice in ancient times, serving as a memorial and a warning for future generations. This location is part of the Israelites' journey through the wilderness, highlighting their struggles with obedience and contentment. The naming of places in the Bible often carries deep spiritual and moral lessons, reminding the Israelites of their relationship with God and the consequences of their actions.<p><b>because there they buried the people</b><br>The act of burial signifies the finality of God's judgment on those who succumbed to their cravings. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, burial was an important ritual, often reflecting one's status and the circumstances of their death. The mass burial at Kibroth-hattaavah underscores the severity of the punishment and serves as a somber reminder of the consequences of disobedience. This event is a pivotal moment in the wilderness journey, illustrating the tension between God's provision and the people's dissatisfaction.<p><b>who had craved other food</b><br>The craving for "other food" refers to the Israelites' desire for the foods they had in Egypt, as opposed to the manna God provided. This craving represents a deeper spiritual issue of ingratitude and lack of trust in God's provision. The Israelites' longing for the past and their failure to appreciate God's miraculous sustenance is a recurring theme in their wilderness journey. This incident is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/78-18.htm">Psalm 78:18-31</a>, which recounts the people's rebellion and God's response. The craving for physical satisfaction over spiritual obedience is a timeless lesson, warning against the dangers of allowing fleshly desires to overshadow faith and trust in God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kibroth-hattaavah.htm">Kibroth-hattaavah</a></b><br>This is the place where the Israelites buried those who craved other food.

Throughout Scripture, naming a location fixes God&#8217;s dealings in the communal memory&#8212;think of Bethel in <a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a> or the Valley of Achor in <a href="/joshua/7-26.htm">Joshua 7:26</a>. Here, the campsite becomes a caution sign: &#8220;Graves of Craving.&#8221; Every time the people later recited their journey (<a href="/numbers/33-16.htm">Numbers 33:16</a>), they had to remember why this stop mattered. The lesson stands beside other memorial names: altars of victory (<a href="/exodus/17-15.htm">Exodus 17:15</a>) and wells of provision (<a href="/genesis/16-14.htm">Genesis 16:14</a>). In contrast, Kibroth-hattaavah memorializes sin and judgment, reminding us that unbelief can leave visible scars on the map of our lives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because there they buried</b><p>God&#8217;s response to the craving was not abstract; it was tangible and terminal. Bodies were laid in fresh graves, echoing earlier warnings that unbelief leads to death (<a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>). The burial makes <a href="/bsb/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11</a> more than an anecdote about food&#8212;it&#8217;s a sobering record much like the judgment on Korah&#8217;s rebels (<a href="/numbers/16-32.htm">Numbers 16:32-33</a>). Moses later recounted the scene alongside other provocations&#8212;Taberah, Massah, even Kadesh (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-22.htm">Deuteronomy 9:22-24</a>)&#8212;to show a pattern of resistance that repeatedly brought loss, not blessing. <a href="/psalms/78-31.htm">Psalm 78:31</a> looks back and says, &#8220;God struck down the strongest among them, subduing the young men of Israel.&#8221; Graves in the sand preach louder than sermons: sin pays wages (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the people who had craved other food</b><p>The issue wasn&#8217;t hunger; it was discontent with God&#8217;s daily manna. <a href="/psalms/106-14.htm">Psalm 106:14-15</a> summarizes: &#8220;They craved intensely in the wilderness&#8230; so He gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease.&#8221; Craving what God withholds is spiritual ingratitude, the same attitude Paul warns against in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6</a>, &#8220;Now these things took place as examples to keep us from craving evil things as they did.&#8221; The craving crowd despised the provision that prefigured Christ, the true Bread from heaven (<a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31-35</a>). God allowed them to taste what they wanted, yet the quail became the very instrument of their discipline (<a href="/numbers/11-33.htm">Numbers 11:33</a>). Craving apart from trust corrupts good gifts into judgments.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Kibroth-hattaavah teaches that God&#8217;s people can turn blessings into curses when they despise His provision. The graves mark a warning: unchecked craving, fueled by ingratitude, invites judgment. Remembering the name keeps the lesson alive&#8212;trust the Lord&#8217;s daily bread, receive it with thanks, and resist the deadly pull of discontent.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Kibroth-hattaavah</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., the graves of lust </span>'or, <span class= "ital">desire</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>In <a href="/numbers/33-16.htm" title="And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at Kibrothhattaavah.">Numbers 33:16</a>, Kibroth-hattaavah is mentioned as the first station after the departure from Sinai, whereas it is obvious that there must have been an encampment at Taberah. Taberah may have been the name given to a part of Kibroth-hattaavah, or the two names may have belonged to the same place.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Kibroth-Hattaavah.</span> The graves of greediness.

This name, like Tabeerah, was given to the place by the Israelites themselves in connection with their own history; the name, therefore, like the sad memory it enshrined, lived only in the sacred record. It is utterly uncertain where it lay, except that it was apparently the terminus of a three days' journey from Sinai, and in the desert of Paran. How long they stayed at Kibroth-Hattaavah is also quite uncertain. If the plague followed hard upon the coming of the quails, a few days would suffice for all the events recorded in this chapter, and we may well believe that the people would be only too glad to receive the signal of departure as soon as they had buried their unhappy brethren. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/11-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So they called</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1435;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
