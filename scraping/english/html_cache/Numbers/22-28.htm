In the ancient Near Eastern context, animals were not considered capable of human speech, making this event particularly striking. It underscores the theme of divine intervention found throughout Scripture, such as when God uses unexpected means to fulfill His purposes (e.g., the burning bush in <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a>). This act also prefigures the New Testament concept of God using the foolish things of the world to shame the wise (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p><b>and she said to Balaam</b><br>Balaam, a non-Israelite prophet, is a complex figure who appears in several biblical texts (Numbers 22-24, <a href="/deuteronomy/23-4.htm">Deuteronomy 23:4-5</a>, <a href="/joshua/13-22.htm">Joshua 13:22</a>). His story illustrates the tension between human free will and divine sovereignty. The donkey speaking to Balaam serves as a rebuke to the prophet, who, despite his spiritual insight, is blind to God's immediate presence and will. This moment foreshadows the New Testament's emphasis on spiritual blindness and the need for divine revelation (<a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39-41</a>).<p><b>&#8220;What have I done to you</b><br>The donkey's question is a rhetorical device that highlights Balaam's unjust treatment of the animal. It serves as a mirror to Balaam's own spiritual blindness and stubbornness. This question can be compared to God's inquiries to humanity throughout Scripture, such as His questions to Adam and Eve in <a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9-13</a>, which are designed to provoke self-reflection and repentance.<p><b>that you have beaten me</b><br>The act of beating the donkey reflects Balaam's frustration and lack of understanding. In the cultural context, animals were often used for labor and transportation, but the ethical treatment of animals was also a concern, as seen in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>). This moment serves as a critique of Balaam's character and foreshadows his eventual downfall due to his greed and disobedience (<a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15-16</a>).<p><b>these three times?&#8221;</b><br>The repetition of "three times" emphasizes the completeness and severity of Balaam's actions. In biblical numerology, the number three often signifies completeness or perfection. This phrase also connects to other instances in Scripture where actions or events occur three times, such as Peter's denial of Christ (<a href="/matthew/26-34.htm">Matthew 26:34</a>) and Jesus' threefold restoration of Peter (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>).

The following remarks may be made in regard to this interpretation:--(1) Consistency requires that the whole of the narrative should be interpreted either objectively or subjectively; and hence, that if the voice of the ass be interpreted as a subjective impression made upon the mind of Balaam, the appearance of the angel must be understood in the same manner. In this case, however, a difficulty arises which is as great, or greater, than that which the subjective theory is thought to remove. If the appearance of the angel to Balaam was subjective, the appearance must have been subjective also to the ass. In this case, moreover, it may be fairly alleged that if the line which divides the intelligent from the brute creation is transgressed by ascribing articulate speech to the ass, much more is that line transgressed by the supposition that an impression was produced in a subjective manner upon the mind of the ass. But (2) the real question at issue is not whether the recorded results might have been accomplished on the supposition that the incidents are to be explained subjectively, but what is the interpretation which the narrative itself suggests, and which the words of St. Peter (<a href="/2_peter/2-16.htm" title="But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man's voice forbade the madness of the prophet.">2Peter 2:16</a>) require? In regard to the narrative itself, there is no intimation given that its respective portions are to be differently interpreted; nor is it possible, without doing violence to its obvious meaning, to interpret some parts of it objectively and other parts subjectively; whilst in regard to the testimony of St. Peter, it would be impossible to conceive of a statement couched in terms more directly suggestive of a literal fact than the following--"The dumb ass, speaking with man's voice, forbad the madness of the prophet." In regard to the objections which have been raised to the literal interpretation, grounded on the absence of any expression of surprise on the part of Balaam, and of any allusion to the effect produced upon the Moabitish princes and Balaam's servants, it will suffice to observe (1) that here, as elsewhere, no just inference can be drawn from the silence of Scripture; and (2) that, as in the case of those who were with St. Paul as he went to Damascus, we have no means of determining, on the assumption of the presence of witnesses throughout the miraculous occurrences described, what amount of those occurrences they may have seen and heard. The angel was visible, in the first instance, only to the ass. In like manner the angel may have been visible only to Balaam, not to those who were with him. So also in regard to the voice: it may have been audible only to him to whom it was addressed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass.</span> On the face of it this expression would seem decisive that an audible human voice proceeded from the ass's mouth, as St. Peter beyond doubt believed: <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b6;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. It is truly said, however, that a passing illusion of this kind, while it testifies that the Apostle understood the words, like all his contemporaries, in their most natural and simple sense, does not oblige us to hold the same view; if he was mistaken in this matter, it does not at all affect the inspired truth of his teaching. Two theories, therefore, have been proposed in order to avoid the difficulties of the ordinary belief, while vindicating the reality of the occurrence. It has been held by some that the whole affair took place in a trance, and resembled St. Peter's vision of the sheet let down from heaven (<a href="/acts/10-10.htm">Acts 10:10</a>), which we rightly conceive to have been purely subjective. This is open to the obvious and apparently fatal objection that no hint is given of any state of trance or ecstasy, and that, on the contrary, the wording of the narrative as given to us is inconsistent with such a thing. In verse 31 Balaam's eyes are said to have been opened so that he saw the angel; but to have the eyes open so that the (ordinarily) invisible became visible, and the (otherwise) inaudible became audible, was precisely the condition of which Balaam speaks (<a href="/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3, 4</a>) as that of trance. According to the narrative, therefore, Balaam was in an ecstasy, if at all, after the speaking of the ass, and not before. By others it has been put forward, somewhat confusedly, that although Balaam was in his ordinary senses, he did not really hear a human voice, but that the "cries" of the ass became intelligible to his mind; and it is noted that as an augur he had been accustomed to assign meanings to the cries of animals. If instead of "cries" we read "brayings," for the ass is endowed by nature with no other capacity of voice, being indeed one of the dumbest of "dumb" animals, we have the matter more fairly before us. To most people it would appear more incredible that the brayings of an ass should convey these rational questions to the mind of its rider than that the beast should have spoken outright with a man's voice. It would indeed seem much more satisfactory to regard the story, if we cannot accept it as literally true, as a parable which Balaam wrote against himself, and which Moses simply incorporated in the narrative; we should at least preserve in this way the immense moral and spiritual value of the story, without the necessity of placing non-natural constructions upon its simple statements. Supposing the miracle to have really occurred, it must always be observed that the words put into the ass's mouth do nothing more than express such feeling's as a docile and intelligent animal of her kind would have actually felt. That domestic animals, and especially such as have been long in the service of man, feel surprise, indignation, and grief in the presence of injustice and ill-treatment is abundantly certain. In many well-authenticated cases they have done things in order to express these feelings which seemed as much beyond their "irrational" nature as if they had spoken. We constantly say of a dog or a horse that he can do everything but speak, and why should it seem incredible that God, who has given the dumb beast so close an approximation to human feeling and reason, should for once have given it human voice? With respect to Balaam's companions, their presence need not cause any difficulty. The princes of Midian and Moab had probably gone on to announce the coming of Beldam; his servants would naturally follow him at some little distance, unless he summoned them to his side. It is very likely too that Balaam was wont to carry on conversations with himself, or with imaginary beings, as he rode along, and this circumstance would account for any sound of voices which reached the ears of others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/22-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">opened</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yip&#772;&#183;ta&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
