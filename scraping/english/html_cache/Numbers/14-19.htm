The term "iniquity" refers to the sin and rebellion of the Israelites, who doubted God's promise and power. This reflects the recurring theme of Israel's disobedience and need for divine mercy. Moses' prayer is reminiscent of Abraham's intercession for Sodom (<a href="/genesis/18-22.htm">Genesis 18:22-33</a>), emphasizing the importance of intercessory prayer in the biblical narrative.<p><b>in keeping with the greatness of Your loving devotion</b><br>The phrase underscores God's steadfast love, often translated as "chesed" in Hebrew, which denotes covenantal loyalty and mercy. This appeal to God's character is a common motif in Scripture, where God's nature is the basis for His actions (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>). It reflects the theological understanding that God's mercy is not earned but is a part of His divine nature.<p><b>just as You have forgiven them ever since they left Egypt.</b><br>This recalls the numerous instances of God's forgiveness since the Exodus, such as the golden calf incident (Exodus 32) and the complaints in the wilderness (Numbers 11). It highlights God's patience and long-suffering with His people, despite their repeated failures. This historical context serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the continuity of His redemptive plan, which ultimately points to the ultimate forgiveness found in Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who intercedes on behalf of the people, asking God to forgive their sins.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who have repeatedly sinned and rebelled against Him, particularly in their lack of faith to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God who is both just and merciful, and who has been guiding the Israelites from Egypt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place of bondage from which God delivered the Israelites, symbolizing their past sins and God's redemptive power.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land (Canaan)</a></b><br>The land promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, representing God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His promises.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_intercession.htm">The Power of Intercession</a></b><br>Moses' prayer demonstrates the importance and power of interceding for others.
