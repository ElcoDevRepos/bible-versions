This encounter emphasizes divine intervention in human affairs. The angel's presence signifies the seriousness of Balaam's actions and God's direct involvement in guiding His people.<p><b>Why have you beaten your donkey these three times?</b><br>The repetition of "three times" underscores the stubbornness and blindness of Balaam to spiritual realities. The donkey, an animal considered lowly, perceives the divine presence that Balaam, a renowned seer, fails to see. This irony highlights the theme of God using the humble to confound the wise, a recurring biblical motif.<p><b>Behold, I have come out to oppose you</b><br>The angel's opposition to Balaam serves as a divine check against Balaam's intentions. This phrase indicates God's active role in thwarting plans that go against His will. It reflects the broader biblical principle that God can intervene to redirect or halt human actions that are contrary to His purposes.<p><b>because your way is perverse before me</b><br>The term "perverse" suggests moral and spiritual deviation. Balaam's path is not aligned with God's righteousness, indicating a heart turned towards greed and self-interest, as later confirmed in <a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a>.

Balaam is not dealing with an ordinary angel; he is facing the Lord&#8217;s immediate representative.<p>&#8226; The encounter reveals that every step Balaam takes is under God&#8217;s surveillance. Nothing is hidden (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; God interrupts Balaam&#8217;s journey much as He later arrests Saul on the road to Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3-4</a>), underscoring that the Lord steps in when His purposes are threatened.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Why have you beaten your donkey these three times?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The question exposes Balaam&#8217;s cruelty and impatience. <a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a> reminds us, &#8220;A righteous man regards the life of his animal.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God notices how we treat even the least of His creatures (<a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29-31</a>).
