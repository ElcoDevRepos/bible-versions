These cities served as a sanctuary where the accused could flee to avoid the avenger of blood, a family member seeking retribution. The requirement for the manslayer to remain in the city underscores the seriousness of taking a life, even unintentionally, and the need for justice tempered with mercy. This reflects the balance between justice and grace found throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/19-4.htm">Deuteronomy 19:4-6</a>.<p><b>until the death of the high priest</b><br>The high priest held a significant role in Israelite society, serving as a mediator between God and the people. His death symbolized a form of atonement, allowing the manslayer to return home without fear of retribution. This provision highlights the importance of the high priest's role in maintaining spiritual and communal order. The death of the high priest can be seen as a type of Christ, who, through His death, provides ultimate atonement and freedom from sin (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>).<p><b>Only after the death of the high priest may he return to the land he owns</b><br>This stipulation emphasizes the sanctity of life and the need for a period of reflection and repentance for the manslayer. The return to one's land signifies restoration and reconciliation with the community. It also points to the concept of Jubilee, a time of release and restoration, as described in <a href="/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25</a>. Theologically, this can be connected to the believer's reconciliation with God through Christ, who restores us to our rightful place as children of God (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manslayer.htm">Manslayer</a></b><br>An individual who has unintentionally killed another person.

This verse sits in a broader passage (<a href="/numbers/35-9.htm">Numbers 35:9-34</a>) where God gives Israel six cities of refuge. These cities offered protection to anyone who killed another unintentionally, shielding the manslayer from the &#8220;avenger of blood&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/35-12.htm">Numbers 35:12</a>). Similar safeguards appear in <a href="/deuteronomy/19-1.htm">Deuteronomy 19:1-13</a> and later in <a href="/bsb/joshua/20.htm">Joshua 20</a>, underscoring how seriously God values both justice and mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Understanding the City of Refuge</b><p>&#8226; The city was a place of detainment, not a permanent escape.<p>&#8226; While inside, the manslayer lived among Levites (<a href="/numbers/35-6.htm">Numbers 35:6-7</a>), remaining under their spiritual influence.<p>&#8226; Protection was conditional: if the manslayer left the city before the high priest died, the avenger could lawfully kill him (<a href="/numbers/35-26.htm">Numbers 35:26-27</a>).
