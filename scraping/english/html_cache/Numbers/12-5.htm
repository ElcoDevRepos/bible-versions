The pillar of cloud was a visible sign of God's guidance and protection for the Israelites during their wilderness journey (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). It symbolizes God's holiness and His desire to dwell among His people. The cloud also represents divine mystery and majesty, as it both reveals and conceals God's glory. This manifestation is consistent with other instances where God uses natural elements to communicate His presence, such as the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>) and the cloud on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>).<p><b>stood at the entrance to the Tent</b><br>The Tent refers to the Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, which was the central place of worship and where God's presence dwelled among the Israelites. The entrance of the Tent was a significant location, as it was where God would meet with Moses and communicate His will (<a href="/exodus/33-9.htm">Exodus 33:9-11</a>). This setting underscores the seriousness of the encounter and the authority of God's judgment. The Tent of Meeting was a precursor to the Temple in Jerusalem and ultimately points to Jesus Christ, who is the true Tabernacle (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), where God dwells with humanity.<p><b>and summoned Aaron and Miriam</b><br>Aaron and Miriam were leaders among the Israelites, with Aaron serving as the high priest and Miriam as a prophetess (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>). Their summoning by God indicates a direct and personal confrontation regarding their actions and attitudes. This moment highlights the accountability of leaders before God and the importance of humility and obedience. The summoning also reflects the biblical principle that God disciplines those He loves (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>) and that leadership carries a higher standard of responsibility (<a href="/james/3.htm">James 3:1</a>).<p><b>When both of them had stepped forward</b><br>This phrase indicates their response to God's call, showing their willingness to come before Him. It sets the stage for the divine rebuke and correction that follows. The act of stepping forward can be seen as an acknowledgment of God's authority and a readiness to hear His judgment. This moment serves as a reminder of the importance of approaching God with reverence and the readiness to accept His correction, as seen in other biblical figures who responded to God's call, such as Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, God Himself, who intervenes directly in the situation involving Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pillar_of_cloud.htm">Pillar of Cloud</a></b><br>A manifestation of God's presence, often used during the Israelites' journey in the wilderness to guide and protect them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and Miriam, serving as the high priest of Israel.

On the other hand, the phrase must certainly be understood to mean the entrance of the court, or sacred enclosure, in <a href="/leviticus/8-3.htm">Leviticus 8:3, 31, 33</a>, and probably in other places. As it is hardly possible that the phrase can have had both meanings, the latter must be preferred. <span class="cmt_word">And they both came forth.</span> Not out of the sanctuary, into which Miriam could not have entered, but out of the enclosure. The wrath which lay upon them both, and the punishment which was about to be inflicted upon one, were sufficient reasons for calling them out of the holy ground. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/12-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1512;&#1462;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;re&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
