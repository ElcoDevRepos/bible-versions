In the context of <a href="/numbers/7.htm">Numbers 7</a>, these gifts were wagons and oxen, which were practical contributions for the transportation needs of the Tabernacle. The act of accepting gifts is significant in the biblical narrative, as it demonstrates the communal responsibility and participation of the Israelites in the worship and service of God. This reflects the broader biblical principle of stewardship and the importance of giving to support God's work, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>, which emphasizes cheerful giving.<p><b>that they may be used in the work of the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the portable sanctuary where God met with Moses and the Israelites during their wilderness journey. The work of the Tent of Meeting involved the daily rituals, sacrifices, and maintenance required to uphold the covenant relationship between God and His people. This phrase underscores the practical aspect of worship, where physical resources are necessary to facilitate spiritual activities. The Tabernacle itself is a type of Christ, as it represents God's dwelling among His people, foreshadowing the incarnation of Jesus, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>And give them to the Levites</b><br>The Levites were the tribe set apart for religious duties and the service of the Tabernacle. This allocation of resources to the Levites highlights their role as mediators between God and the Israelites, a role that prefigures the priesthood of Christ, who is our ultimate mediator (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). The Levites' service was essential for the proper functioning of the Tabernacle, and their support through these gifts ensured that they could fulfill their God-given responsibilities.<p><b>to each man according to his service</b><br>This phrase indicates the distribution of resources based on the specific duties assigned to each Levite. The Levites were divided into clans, each with distinct responsibilities related to the Tabernacle's care and transport. This organized approach reflects the biblical principle of order and the importance of each member of the community contributing according to their gifts and calling, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-7</a>. It also emphasizes the fairness and wisdom in God's provision, ensuring that each person receives what is necessary to perform their role effectively.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /

these gifts from them</b><p>God&#8217;s first instruction to Moses is straightforward: &#8220;Accept these gifts from them&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/7-5.htm">Numbers 7:5</a>a).<p>&#8226; The leaders of the tribes had gathered their offerings&#8212;six covered carts and twelve oxen (<a href="/numbers/7-3.htm">Numbers 7:3</a>). Their generosity mirrors earlier moments when Israel freely gave for the tabernacle&#8217;s construction (<a href="/exodus/35-29.htm">Exodus 35:29</a>).<p>&#8226; By commanding acceptance, the Lord affirms that voluntary gifts offered in faith are welcomed. David voiced the same principle centuries later: &#8220;Everything comes from You, and we have given You only what comes from Your hand&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-14.htm">1 Chronicles 29:14</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, the pattern still holds: &#8220;Each one should give as he has purposed in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>). God delights in cheerful giving that springs from gratitude.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that they may be used in the work of the Tent of Meeting</b><p>The purpose is crystal-clear: the gifts facilitate ministry at the tabernacle&#8212;the earthly meeting place between God and His people (<a href="/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42&#8211;43</a>).<p>&#8226; These carts and oxen eased the transport of heavy tabernacle components across the wilderness, keeping worship central during every stage of Israel&#8217;s journey (<a href="/numbers/4-24.htm">Numbers 4:24&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226; Tools dedicated to sacred service remind us that everything we possess can become an instrument for God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p>&#8226; In the church age, the &#8220;work of ministry&#8221; includes equipping believers &#8220;for the building up of the body of Christ&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-12.htm">Ephesians 4:12</a>). Different context, same principle: resources strengthen worship and witness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And give them to the Levites</b><p>The Levites were set apart &#8220;to perform the service of the tabernacle&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/3-6.htm">Numbers 3:6&#8211;9</a>). By handing the gifts to them, Moses ensures that stewardship matches calling.<p>&#8226; God consistently assigns specific people to specific tasks (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>). Authority and responsibility sit together.<p>&#8226; In the New Testament, the principle persists: the Lord &#8220;gave some to be apostles, some prophets&#8230; some pastors and teachers&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>). Distinct roles, shared mission.<p>&#8226; Delegation also guards against burnout. Just as Moses had learned to share judicial duties (<a href="/exodus/18-17.htm">Exodus 18:17&#8211;23</a>), he now shares logistical burdens with the Levites.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to each man according to his service</b><p>Distribution is not random; it fits the exact job description of each clan:<p>&#8226; Gershonites receive two carts and four oxen for the curtains and hangings (<a href="/numbers/7-7.htm">Numbers 7:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Merarites receive four carts and eight oxen for the heavy frames and bases (<a href="/numbers/7-8.htm">Numbers 7:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Kohathites receive none because they carry the holy objects on their shoulders (<a href="/numbers/7-9.htm">Numbers 7:9</a>).<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8211; God tailors provision to need (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p>&#8211; Diversity of gifts functions in unity of purpose (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8211; Accountability accompanies allocation; each Levite answers for his designated portion (<a href="/numbers/4-19.htm">Numbers 4:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/7-5.htm">Numbers 7:5</a> shows a beautiful chain of grace: willing hearts offer, God commands acceptance, the tabernacle&#8217;s work benefits, and the Levites receive exactly what their tasks require. The verse underscores cheerful giving, purposeful stewardship, defined roles, and personalized provision&#8212;timeless principles that still shape faithful service today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Take it of them.</span> It was the first absolutely voluntary offering made for the service of God, and as such altogether acceptable.
