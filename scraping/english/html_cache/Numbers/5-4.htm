This act of compliance is significant in the context of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience is a key component. The Israelites' actions demonstrate their recognition of God's holiness and the need to maintain purity within the camp. This obedience can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament call for believers to live in holiness and obedience to God's commands (<a href="/1_peter/1-14.htm">1 Peter 1:14-16</a>).<p><b>sending such people outside the camp</b><br>The act of sending individuals outside the camp was a measure to maintain the purity and holiness of the community. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the camp represented the dwelling place of God among His people, and any form of impurity, whether physical or moral, was not tolerated within it. This practice underscores the importance of holiness and separation from sin, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture. It also foreshadows the concept of church discipline in the New Testament, where unrepentant sin is addressed to preserve the purity of the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1-13</a>).<p><b>They did just as the LORD had instructed Moses</b><br>This phrase highlights the role of Moses as the mediator between God and the Israelites. Moses' leadership and the people's adherence to his instructions emphasize the importance of divine authority and guidance. The Israelites' compliance with God's instructions through Moses is a testament to their faith and trust in God's plan. This obedience is mirrored in the New Testament, where Jesus, the greater Moses, instructs His followers to obey His teachings (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). The phrase also reflects the broader biblical theme of God's faithfulness in providing leaders to guide His people according to His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were given the Law through Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, who received the Law from God and communicated His instructions to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_camp.htm">The Camp</a></b><br>The dwelling place of the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness, symbolizing the presence and community of God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who provided the Law and instructions for maintaining holiness among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_separation.htm">Holiness and Separation</a></b><br>God calls His people to be holy and separate from impurity.

The words point back to verses 1&#8211;3, where the LORD told Moses to exclude anyone with a skin disease, a discharge, or defilement from a corpse.<p>&#8226; Their prompt response reflects earlier patterns: &#8220;The Israelites did everything just as the LORD commanded Moses&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/1-54.htm">Numbers 1:54</a>; 2:34).<p>&#8226; Such obedience echoes Noah&#8217;s faithfulness (<a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>) and Israel&#8217;s pledge at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-7.htm">Exodus 24:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The narrative stresses that true faith is proved by action (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17&#8211;18</a>), a truth consistent from Exodus through the epistles.<p>In short, the phrase establishes the people&#8217;s willingness to conform their lives to divine instruction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>sending such people outside the camp</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;sending such people outside the camp.&#8221; Here the focus falls on purity, health, and sacred space.<p>&#8226; The camp symbolized God&#8217;s dwelling (<a href="/numbers/5-3.htm">Numbers 5:3</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/23-14.htm">Deuteronomy 23:14</a>). To keep it holy, anything ceremonially unclean had to remain outside (<a href="/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a>; 14:3; 15:31).<p>&#8226; Physical removal also limited contagion and modeled separation from sin&#8212;an idea later echoed when Paul urges the church to &#8220;remove the wicked man from among yourselves&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-13.htm">1 Corinthians 5:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The instruction preserved community well-being while teaching that the LORD cannot coexist with defilement (<a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>).<p>Thus, the exclusion of the unclean was both practical and theological, guarding life and underscoring holiness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They did just as the LORD had instructed Moses.</b><p>&#8220;They did just as the LORD had instructed Moses.&#8221; The verse closes by spotlighting the chain of authority:<p>&#8226; God speaks &#8594; Moses relays &#8594; Israel obeys (<a href="/exodus/40-16.htm">Exodus 40:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-1.htm">Deuteronomy 4:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience brings blessing (<a href="/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>) and demonstrates love for God (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-3.htm">1 John 5:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reinforces that Scripture&#8217;s directives are not suggestions but commands from the Sovereign Creator.<p>Israel&#8217;s compliance here encourages believers today to submit to God&#8217;s Word wholeheartedly, trusting that His instructions are always for our good (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/5-4.htm">Numbers 5:4</a> records Israel&#8217;s swift obedience to God&#8217;s call for holiness. By sending the unclean outside the camp, they protected physical health, preserved the sanctity of God&#8217;s dwelling, and modeled separation from impurity. Their actions remind us that genuine faith is evidenced by doing exactly what the LORD says, trusting His wisdom and pursuing a life set apart for Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- So did the children of Israel.</span> It is difficult to form any estimate of the numbers thus separated; if we may judge at all from the prevalence of such defilements (especially those under the second head) now, it must have seriously aggravated both the labour and the difficulty of the march.
