Moses is often seen as a mediator between God and the Israelites. This direct communication underscores Moses' unique role as a prophet and leader. The phrase also emphasizes the divine origin of the instructions that follow, highlighting the authority and sacredness of the message. In the broader biblical narrative, this communication is part of the covenant relationship between God and His chosen people, Israel.<p><b>in the Wilderness of Sinai</b><br>The Wilderness of Sinai is a significant location in the biblical narrative, where the Israelites camped after their exodus from Egypt. It is here that they received the Law, including the Ten Commandments, establishing the foundation of their covenant with God. The wilderness represents both a physical and spiritual journey for the Israelites, a place of testing, revelation, and transformation. Geographically, Sinai is a rugged, mountainous region, which adds to the imagery of isolation and divine encounter. The wilderness experience is often seen as a type of the Christian journey, where believers are tested and refined.<p><b>saying,</b><br>This word introduces the specific message or command that God is about to deliver. It sets the stage for the instructions that follow, which in this context, pertain to the census of the Levites. The use of "saying" indicates that what follows is not merely narrative but a directive from God, reinforcing the importance of obedience to His commands.

This small word ties the verse tightly to what came just before.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/bsb/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1&#8211;2</a> the tribes were counted for military service, yet the Levites were set apart (<a href="/numbers/1-47.htm">Numbers 1:47-53</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Then&#8221; signals that God is now moving to the next assignment&#8212;numbering the Levites for sacred service.<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses such transitional words to mark God&#8217;s orderly unfolding of His plan (cf. <a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a> &#8594;

now directs Israel&#8217;s worship structure.<p>&#8226; Divine speech carries absolute authority; Moses and Israel are not brainstorming but receiving revelation (<a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>).<p>&#8226;

Moses is called &#8220;faithful in all My house&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>); therefore the people can trust what he relays.<p>&#8226; His role models how God still uses servants to communicate His word (<a href="/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; By addressing Moses personally, the LORD reinforces relational leadership&#8212;commands flow through a known, trusted shepherd.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the Wilderness of Sinai</b><p>&#8211; Location matters.<p>&#8226;
