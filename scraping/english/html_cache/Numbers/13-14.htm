This tribe was allocated land in the northern part of Canaan, which included the region around the Sea of Galilee. The territory of Naphtali was known for its fertile land and strategic location, which later became significant in the ministry of Jesus Christ, as much of His ministry took place in this area. The tribe is often associated with themes of struggle and triumph, as seen in the blessing of Jacob in <a href="/genesis/49-21.htm">Genesis 49:21</a>, where Naphtali is described as a "doe set free that bears beautiful fawns."<p><b>Nahbi son of Vophsi</b><br>Nahbi, whose name means "hidden" or "concealed," was chosen as a representative from the tribe of Naphtali to spy out the land of Canaan. His father's name, Vophsi, is less well-known, and there is little additional biblical information about him. The selection of Nahbi as a spy indicates his standing and trust within his tribe. The role of the spies was crucial, as they were tasked with assessing the land promised by God to the Israelites. This mission was a test of faith and obedience, as the spies' reports would influence the entire nation's willingness to enter the Promised Land. Nahbi's participation in this mission connects to the broader narrative of Israel's journey and the challenges of trusting in God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naphtali.htm">Naphtali</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Naphtali, the sixth son of Jacob and Bilhah.

Each tribe sent exactly one man, underscoring both equality before God and personal responsibility.<p>&#8226; Naphtali had been blessed centuries earlier: &#8220;Naphtali is a doe let loose; he delivers beautiful words&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/49-21.htm">Genesis 49:21</a>). Moses later added, &#8220;Naphtali is abounding with favor and full of the blessing of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-23.htm">Deuteronomy 33:23</a>). These promises remind readers that God&#8217;s plan for each tribe stretches across generations.<p>&#8226; The tribe&#8217;s allotted land in Galilee (<a href="/joshua/19-32.htm">Joshua 19:32-39</a>) became home to much of Jesus&#8217; early ministry (<a href="/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13-15</a>), showing God&#8217;s long-range faithfulness.<p>&#8226; Including Naphtali in the spy list testifies to Scripture&#8217;s historical accuracy: God knows every tribe, clan, and family line (<a href="/numbers/1-42.htm">Numbers 1:42-43</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nahbi son of Vophsi</b><p>&#8226; Nahbi is one of the ten spies who returned with a fearful report (<a href="/numbers/13-25.htm">Numbers 13:25-33</a>). Though Scripture records no words from him, his silence joins the chorus of unbelief that swayed Israel.<p>&#8226; His failure illustrates how individual choices can steer an entire community. Because the majority report discouraged the people, the nation wandered forty years (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-35</a>).<p>&#8226; Contrast Nahbi with Caleb and Joshua, who urged faith (<a href="/numbers/14-6.htm">Numbers 14:6-9</a>). The comparison invites every believer to stand firm when culture&#8212; even religious culture&#8212;leans toward doubt.<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that Scripture does not gloss over human shortcomings. By naming Nahbi, the text preserves an honest record, calling each reader to self-examination in light of <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12-19</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/13-14.htm">Numbers 13:14</a> is more than a line in a roster. It roots the tribe of Naphtali and its representative Nahbi in God&#8217;s unfolding drama of promise and testing. The tribe&#8217;s history highlights God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness; Nahbi&#8217;s part in the negative report warns against unbelief. Together they urge today&#8217;s reader to trust God&#8217;s Word, remember His past faithfulness, and choose courageous obedience in the present.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/13-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">from the tribe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;ma&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4294.htm">Strong's 4294: </a> </span><span class="str2">A staff, rod, shaft, branch, a tribe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Naphtali,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(nap&#772;&#183;t&#257;&#183;l&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5321.htm">Strong's 5321: </a> </span><span class="str2">Naphtali -- a son of Jacob, also his descendants and the district settled by them</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Nahbi</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(na&#7717;&#183;b&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5147.htm">Strong's 5147: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nahbi -- a Naphtalite</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Vophsi;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1508;&#1456;&#1505;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#601;&#183;s&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2058.htm">Strong's 2058: </a> </span><span class="str2">Vophsi -- a Naphtalite</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/numbers/13-14.htm">Numbers 13:14 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/numbers/13-14.htm">Numbers 13:14 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/numbers/13-14.htm">Numbers 13:14 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/numbers/13-14.htm">Numbers 13:14 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/numbers/13-14.htm">Numbers 13:14 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/numbers/13-14.htm">Numbers 13:14  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/numbers/13-14.htm">Numbers 13:14 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/numbers/13-14.htm">Numbers 13:14 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/numbers/13-14.htm">Numbers 13:14 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/numbers/13-14.htm">Numbers 13:14 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/numbers/13-14.htm">OT Law: Numbers 13:14 Of the tribe of Naphtali Nahbi (Nu Num.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/numbers/13-13.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Numbers 13:13"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 13:13" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/numbers/13-15.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Numbers 13:15"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 13:15" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
