In ancient Near Eastern cultures, clothing often had symbolic meanings, and the addition of tassels was a distinct feature for the Israelites. The tassels were to be placed on the corners of their garments, as instructed in <a href="/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38</a>. This practice set them apart from surrounding nations and served as a constant visual cue to remember their covenant with God. The tassels were a tangible representation of their identity as God's chosen people.<p><b>so that you may remember all the commandments of the LORD</b><br>The purpose of the tassels was to prompt the Israelites to recall the commandments given by God. This reflects the importance of memory in maintaining faithfulness to God's laws. The commandments were central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel, and remembering them was crucial for living a life that honored God. This concept of remembrance is echoed in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>, where the Israelites are instructed to keep God's words in their hearts and teach them diligently to their children.<p><b>that you may obey them</b><br>Obedience to God's commandments was a fundamental expectation for the Israelites. The tassels served as a reminder not just to remember the commandments but to act on them. Obedience was a demonstration of their faith and commitment to God. In the New Testament, Jesus emphasizes the importance of obedience in <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>, where He says, "If you love Me, you will keep My commandments." This continuity underscores the timeless nature of obedience in the life of a believer.<p><b>and not prostitute yourselves by following your own heart and your own eyes</b><br>The phrase warns against spiritual unfaithfulness, likening it to prostitution. In biblical terms, idolatry and turning away from God were often described as acts of unfaithfulness or adultery. The heart and eyes are symbolic of desires and temptations that lead one away from God's path. This warning is consistent with the broader biblical narrative, where the heart is seen as deceitful (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>) and the eyes as gateways to temptation (<a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>). The call is to remain faithful to God, resisting the lure of personal desires that conflict with His commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were given the law and commandments to follow as a covenant with God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tassels.htm">Tassels (Tzitzit)</a></b><br>Fringes or tassels that were to be worn on the corners of garments as a physical reminder of God's commandments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God who gave the commandments to the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where the Israelites received the law and wandered for 40 years.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who conveyed God's laws and instructions to the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_reminders.htm">The Importance of Reminders</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites had physical reminders of God's commandments, we should find ways to keep God's word at the forefront of our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_against_idolatry.htm">Guarding Against Idolatry</a></b><br>The warning against following one's own heart and eyes serves as a reminder to prioritize God's will over personal desires.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commandments.htm">Obedience to God's Commandments</a></b><br>True obedience involves both remembering and acting upon God's commandments, not merely external displays of piety.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_symbols_in_faith.htm">The Role of Symbols in Faith</a></b><br>Symbols like the tassels can serve as powerful tools for spiritual reflection and commitment when used with the right heart.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/heart_and_eyes.htm">Heart and Eyes</a></b><br>The heart and eyes can lead us astray;

<a href="/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1</a>).<p>- God weaves His truth into the visual field so that every glance at a fringe becomes a nudge toward holiness&#8212;similar to placing His words on doorposts and gates (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-9.htm">Deuteronomy 6:9</a>).<p>- The practice teaches intentional focus: look deliberately at what God provides rather than casually absorbing whatever passes before the eyes (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that you may remember all the commandments of the LORD</b><p>- Memory is not left to chance;

It was like the facings on a uniform which recall the fame and exploits of a famous regiment. The tasseled Hebrew was a marked man in other eyes, and in his own; he could not pass himself off as one of the heathen; he was perpetually reminded of the special relation in which he stood to the Lord, whose livery (so to speak) - or, to use another simile, whose colours - he wore. No doubt the sky-blue string or thread which was so prominent was meant to remind him of heaven, and of the God of heaven. <span class="cmt_word">And that ye seek not after your</span> own <span class="cmt_word">heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring.</span> The office of the tassels was to promote a recollected spirit.
