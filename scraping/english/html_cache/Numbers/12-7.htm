While God communicated with prophets through visions and dreams, Moses had a unique relationship with God, speaking to Him face to face (<a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6-8</a>). This sets Moses apart as a central figure in the Old Testament, serving as a mediator between God and Israel. The term "servant" highlights Moses' role as a humble and obedient leader, reminiscent of other key figures like David (<a href="/psalms/89-20.htm">Psalm 89:20</a>) and ultimately pointing to Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the Servant of the Lord in <a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>.<p><b>he is faithful</b><br>Moses' faithfulness is a key theme in his leadership. Despite the challenges and rebellions he faced, Moses remained steadfast in his commitment to God's commands. This faithfulness is echoed in the New Testament, where Moses is compared to Jesus in <a href="/hebrews/3-2.htm">Hebrews 3:2</a>, emphasizing that both were faithful to God. Moses' faithfulness serves as a model for believers, illustrating the importance of perseverance and obedience in one's spiritual journey.<p><b>in all My house.</b><br>The phrase "in all My house" refers to the community of Israel, which Moses led out of Egypt and through the wilderness. The "house" can also symbolize God's covenant people, over whom Moses had authority as a leader and lawgiver. This concept is expanded in the New Testament, where the "house" of God includes all believers, with Jesus as the head (<a href="/hebrews/3-6.htm">Hebrews 3:6</a>). Moses' role in God's house prefigures Christ's ultimate leadership and faithfulness over the spiritual house of God, the Church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>A central figure in the Old Testament, Moses is chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.

It was exactly in "visions" and in "dreams," <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, under the peculiar psychological conditions so-called, that these greatest of prophets received their revelations from heaven.

If words mean anything, the assertion here is that Moses stood on an altogether different footing from the "prophet of the Lord" in respect of the communications which he received from the Lord. It is this essential superiority of position on the part of Moses which alone gives force and meaning to the important declarations of <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>; <a href="/john/1-21.htm">John 1:21</a> b.; John 6:14; 7:40, etc. Moses had <span class="accented">no</span> successor in his relations with God until that Son of man came, who was "in heaven" all the time he walked and spake on earth. <span class="cmt_word">Who is</span> <span class="cmt_word">faithful in all mine house,</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5df;</span> with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;</span> means to be proved, or attested, and so established (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/3-20.htm">1 Samuel 3:20</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/22-14.htm">1 Samuel 22:14</a>).
