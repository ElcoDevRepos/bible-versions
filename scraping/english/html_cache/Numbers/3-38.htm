The east side of the tabernacle was considered the front, symbolizing prominence and authority. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the east was often associated with new beginnings and divine presence, as the sun rises in the east. This placement underscores the centrality of Moses and Aaron in mediating between God and the people.<p><b>toward the sunrise</b><br>The direction of the sunrise is significant in biblical symbolism, often representing hope, renewal, and divine favor. In the context of the tabernacle, it may also signify the light of God's presence and guidance for the Israelites. The orientation toward the east could also be seen as a reminder of Eden, which was placed in the east, symbolizing a return to God's original plan for humanity.<p><b>before the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, or tabernacle, was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites. It served as a mobile sanctuary during their wilderness journey. The phrase "before the Tent of Meeting" indicates a position of service and responsibility, as Moses, Aaron, and his sons were tasked with maintaining the sanctity and order of this sacred space.<p><b>They were to perform the duties of the sanctuary as a service on behalf of the Israelites</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the priestly role of Aaron and his sons, who were set apart to serve God and the community. Their duties included offering sacrifices, maintaining the tabernacle, and interceding for the people. This service was not only a religious obligation but also a means of ensuring the Israelites' covenant relationship with God. The priesthood is a type of Christ, who serves as the ultimate High Priest, mediating between God and humanity.<p><b>but any outsider who approached the sanctuary was to be put to death</b><br>This strict prohibition underscores the holiness of the sanctuary and the seriousness of approaching God's presence without proper consecration. It reflects the broader biblical theme of God's holiness and the need for purity and reverence in worship. The severity of the penalty highlights the distinction between the consecrated priesthood and the rest of the community, reinforcing the idea that access to God requires mediation, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who grants believers access to God through His sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and guide them through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother and the first high priest of Israel, responsible for the priestly duties and the spiritual leadership of the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron's_sons.htm">Aaron&#8217;s Sons</a></b><br>The descendants of Aaron who served as priests, assisting in the duties of the sanctuary.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence of God among the Israelites, central to their worship and community life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent_of_meeting.htm">The Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>Another term for the Tabernacle, emphasizing its role as the place where God met with Moses and the priests.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_order_and_structure_in_worship.htm">The Importance of Order and Structure in Worship</a></b><br>God established a specific order for the Israelites' worship, emphasizing the need for reverence and obedience in approaching Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_leadership_in_spiritual_matters.htm">The Role of Leadership in Spiritual Matters</a></b><br>Moses, Aaron, and his sons were given significant responsibilities, illustrating the importance of godly leadership in guiding and maintaining the spiritual health of a community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_holiness_of_god_and_the_sanctity_of_the_sanctuary.htm">The Holiness of God and the Sanctity of the Sanctuary</a></b><br>The severe consequence for unauthorized access to the sanctuary underscores the holiness of God and the need for purity and respect in worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_symbolism_of_the_east_and_the_sunrise.htm">The Symbolism of the East and the Sunrise</a></b><br>The positioning of the camp toward the east, where the sun rises, can symbolize new beginnings and the hope found in God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_3_38_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 3:38?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_3_38_Sacred_space_protection.htm">How does Numbers 3:38 highlight the importance of protecting sacred spaces today?
