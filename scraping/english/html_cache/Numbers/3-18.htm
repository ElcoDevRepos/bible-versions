This role highlights the importance of maintaining the sacred space where God dwelled among His people. The Levites were set apart for service to God, emphasizing the theme of holiness and dedication. The division into clans underscores the organized structure of Israelite society and the importance of family lineage in fulfilling God-given roles.<p><b>Libni</b><br>Libni, meaning "white" or "whiteness," may symbolize purity or holiness, which is fitting for those serving in the tabernacle. The name Libni appears in other genealogical records, such as <a href="/1_chronicles/6-17.htm">1 Chronicles 6:17</a>, indicating the continuity and preservation of the Levitical line. The emphasis on names in biblical genealogies often reflects the character or destiny of individuals and their descendants, pointing to the broader narrative of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>and Shimei.</b><br>Shimei, meaning "heard" or "hearing," suggests the importance of listening to God's commands and being obedient to His will. This name appears in various contexts throughout the Bible, often associated with individuals who play significant roles in Israel's history. The inclusion of Shimei in the Levitical genealogy highlights the theme of faithfulness and the necessity of heeding God's instructions, especially in the context of worship and service. The Levites' role as mediators between God and the people foreshadows the ultimate mediation of Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the law and established a new covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/kohath.htm">Kohath</a></b><br>Kohath was one of the sons of Levi, making him a grandson of Jacob.
