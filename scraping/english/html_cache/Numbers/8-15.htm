This purification process signifies the importance of holiness and separation for service to God. It reflects the broader biblical theme of purification before approaching God, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10-11</a> when the Israelites prepared to meet God at Mount Sinai. The cleansing also prefigures the spiritual cleansing believers receive through Christ's sacrifice, as mentioned in 1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7</a>.<p><b>and presented them as a wave offering</b><br>The wave offering was a symbolic act of dedication to God, where the Levites were offered to the Lord by the Israelites. This act signifies the Levites' role as representatives of the people before God, similar to how Christ represents believers before the Father (<a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>). The wave offering also highlights the concept of offering one's life in service to God, as seen in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where believers are urged to present their bodies as living sacrifices.<p><b>they may come to serve</b><br>The Levites were set apart for service in the Tabernacle, emphasizing the importance of dedicated service in God's work. This service is a precursor to the New Testament teaching of the priesthood of all believers (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), where every Christian is called to serve God in various capacities. The Levites' service foreshadows the ultimate service of Christ, who came not to be served but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><b>at the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, or Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites. It symbolizes God's desire to dwell with His people, a theme that culminates in the New Testament with the incarnation of Christ (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>) and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>).
