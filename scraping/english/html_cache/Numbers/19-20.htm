The purification process was essential for maintaining holiness and the community's relationship with God. This phrase emphasizes personal responsibility in seeking purification, highlighting the importance of obedience to God's laws. The purification process involved specific rituals, including the use of the water of purification, which was made with the ashes of a red heifer (<a href="/numbers/19-2.htm">Numbers 19:2-10</a>). This ritual underscores the seriousness of maintaining purity before God.<p><b>he will be cut off from the assembly</b><br>Being "cut off" from the assembly meant exclusion from the community of Israel, which was both a social and spiritual consequence. This phrase indicates the severity of remaining in a state of impurity, as it disrupted the communal worship and fellowship. In the broader biblical narrative, being cut off can symbolize spiritual death or separation from God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/17-14.htm">Genesis 17:14</a> and <a href="/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>. This exclusion served as a deterrent against neglecting God's commandments and emphasized the need for communal holiness.<p><b>because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD</b><br>The sanctuary, or tabernacle, was the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. Defiling it through impurity was a grave offense, as it compromised the sanctity of the place where God met with Israel. This phrase highlights the holiness of God and the need for His people to approach Him with reverence and purity. The defilement of the sanctuary can be seen as a type of sin that separates humanity from God, pointing to the need for atonement and cleansing, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who cleanses believers and makes them a holy temple (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16-17</a>).<p><b>The water of purification has not been sprinkled on him</b><br>The water of purification was a specific mixture used for cleansing those who were ritually unclean. It involved the ashes of a red heifer, cedarwood, hyssop, and scarlet yarn, symbolizing purification and atonement (<a href="/numbers/19-6.htm">Numbers 19:6</a>). The act of sprinkling this water was a physical representation of spiritual cleansing. This phrase underscores the necessity of following God's prescribed methods for purification, which foreshadow the cleansing power of Christ's sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/9-13.htm">Hebrews 9:13-14</a>, where the blood of Christ is described as purifying the conscience from dead works.<p><b>he is unclean</b><br>Remaining in a state of uncleanness had significant implications for an individual's relationship with God and the community. This final phrase reiterates the person's unclean status, emphasizing the ongoing separation from God and His people until purification is sought. In a broader theological context, this reflects the human condition of sin and the need for divine intervention for true cleansing. The concept of uncleanness and purification in the Old Testament points forward to the ultimate cleansing provided by Jesus, who makes believers clean and restores their relationship with God (1 <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unclean_man.htm">The Unclean Man</a></b><br>Represents any individual who has become ceremonially unclean and fails to undergo the prescribed purification process.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly.htm">The Assembly</a></b><br>Refers to the community of Israel, the people of God, from whom the unclean person is to be cut off if they do not purify themselves.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctuary_of_the_lord.htm">The Sanctuary of the LORD</a></b><br>The holy place where God's presence dwells among His people, which must remain undefiled.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_water_of_cleansing.htm">The Water of Cleansing</a></b><br>A special mixture used for purification, symbolizing the removal of impurity and sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_act_of_being_cut_off.htm">The Act of Being Cut Off</a></b><br>A severe consequence for failing to adhere to God's commands regarding purity, signifying separation from the community and from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin_and_impurity.htm">The Seriousness of Sin and Impurity</a></b><br>Sin and impurity are not trivial matters; they separate us from God and His people.
