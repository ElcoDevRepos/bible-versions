This practice was rooted in the cultural and legal systems of the time, where family honor and justice were paramount. The "city of refuge" was a divinely instituted place where someone who had accidentally killed another could seek asylum to avoid immediate retribution. These cities were strategically located throughout Israel to be accessible to all, as outlined in <a href="/numbers/35-6.htm">Numbers 35:6-15</a>. The requirement for the manslayer to remain within the city underscores the balance between justice and mercy in God's law. The avenger finding the manslayer outside the city indicates a breach of the protective provision, thus allowing the avenger to act without legal consequence.<p><b>and kills him</b><br>The act of killing the manslayer outside the city of refuge was considered a fulfillment of justice rather than murder. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of justice, where blood vengeance was a recognized means of maintaining social order. The cities of refuge served as a temporary protection until the high priest's death, symbolizing a form of atonement and release from guilt. The manslayer's departure from the city was seen as a forfeiture of divine protection, making the act of killing him a lawful execution of justice rather than an unlawful act of murder.<p><b>then the avenger will not be guilty of bloodshed</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the legal and moral exoneration of the avenger. In the context of the Mosaic Law, the avenger's actions were justified if the manslayer left the city of refuge. This provision highlights the importance of adhering to God's commandments and the consequences of failing to do so. Theologically, it underscores the seriousness of sin and the need for atonement, pointing forward to the ultimate atonement provided by Jesus Christ. In the New Testament, Jesus is seen as our refuge (<a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>), offering protection and forgiveness for those who seek Him. The avenger's lack of guilt also reflects the principle that justice, when carried out according to God's law, is righteous and blameless.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/avenger_of_blood.htm">Avenger of Blood</a></b><br>A family member responsible for avenging the death of a relative.

Scripture portrays the role as:<p>&#8226; A God-given safeguard against unchecked violence (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>).<p>&#8226; A temporary measure until a full trial could be held before the assembly (<a href="/numbers/35-24.htm">Numbers 35:24</a>).<p>By assigning a specific relative to pursue justice, God limited personal vengeance to an orderly process rather than mob retaliation (see also <a href="/2_samuel/14-7.htm">2 Samuel 14:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>finds him outside of his city of refuge</b><p>The manslayer had been told, &#8220;Stay inside the city of refuge until the death of the high priest&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/35-25.htm">Numbers 35:25-28</a>). When he deliberately left that boundary, he stepped back under the normal jurisdiction of blood-justice. Cross references reinforce the principle of staying within God-appointed safety zones:<p>&#8226; <a href="/joshua/20-6.htm">Joshua 20:6</a>&#8212;cities of refuge were a place to &#8220;live there until the death of the high priest.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>&#8212;believers &#8220;have fled for refuge to seize the hope set before us,&#8221; emphasizing that protection is enjoyed only by abiding where God provides it.<p>The verse therefore stresses personal responsibility. God supplied mercy, but the individual had to remain inside it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and kills him</b><p>If the avenger overtook the manslayer outside the city, the killing was viewed as a lawful execution, not private revenge. The passage assumes that:<p>&#8226; The original death was accidental (<a href="/numbers/35-22.htm">Numbers 35:22-23</a>), so the manslayer&#8217;s life could be spared&#8212;if he honored the conditions.<p>&#8226; Leaving the city erased that provisional mercy, reviving the original liability.<p>This clause underscores the seriousness of covenant stipulations; ignoring them had life-and-death consequences (compare <a href="/exodus/21-14.htm">Exodus 21:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the avenger will not be guilty of bloodshed</b><p>The final statement&#8212;&#8220;then the avenger will not be guilty of bloodshed&#8221;&#8212;affirms divine approval of the outcome. God Himself declares:<p>&#8226; Justice remains satisfied; the avenger is innocent (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-10.htm">Deuteronomy 19:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Bloodguilt is avoided, protecting the land from defilement (<a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33-34</a>).<p>In other words, God upholds both mercy and justice simultaneously: mercy for the repentant manslayer who stays put, justice for the victim&#8217;s family if the conditions are broken.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/35-27.htm">Numbers 35:27</a> teaches that God&#8217;s mercy (the city of refuge) never nullifies His justice. The manslayer&#8217;s safety depended on obediently staying within God&#8217;s provided boundary. Stepping outside forfeited protection, and the avenger acted righteously in carrying out justice without incurring guilt. The passage points us to the greater Refuge offered in Christ&#8212;a place of absolute safety, yet one we must remain in through continual faith and obedience (<a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-6</a>;
