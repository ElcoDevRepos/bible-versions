This event highlights the supernatural intervention of God, who opens the donkey's mouth to speak. The dialogue underscores the theme of divine control over creation, as seen in other biblical instances where God uses animals to fulfill His purposes (e.g., the ravens feeding Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/17-4.htm">1 Kings 17:4-6</a>).<p><b>You have made a fool of me!</b><br>Balaam's concern for his reputation and pride is evident here. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, honor and shame were significant social values. Balaam's reaction reflects his embarrassment and the potential loss of face in front of his servants. This phrase also illustrates the human tendency to prioritize personal dignity over spiritual insight, a recurring theme in Scripture (e.g., King Saul's concern for public opinion in <a href="/1_samuel/15-30.htm">1 Samuel 15:30</a>).<p><b>If I had a sword in my hand</b><br>The mention of a sword indicates Balaam's impulsive desire for violence, revealing his frustration and anger. In biblical times, swords were common weapons, symbolizing power and authority. This phrase contrasts with the spiritual authority Balaam should have recognized, as God was orchestrating events beyond his understanding. The sword also serves as a metaphor for the Word of God, which is described as sharper than any two-edged sword in <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>.<p><b>I would kill you right now!</b><br>Balaam's extreme reaction to his donkey's behavior highlights his lack of spiritual discernment. Despite being a prophet, he fails to see the divine message in the situation. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of God using the unexpected to convey His will, as seen in the story of David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17) or the calling of the unlikely apostle Paul (Acts 9). Balaam's intent to kill also foreshadows the spiritual blindness and hardness of heart that can lead to destructive actions, a warning echoed throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet who is known for his interactions with God and the Israelites.

He had a large and unquestioning faith, and a peculiar familiarity with the unseen. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Balaam was a sorcerer. It was part of his profession to show signs and wonders such as even now in those countries confound the most experienced and skeptical beholders. It is likely that he had often made dumb animals speak in order to bewilder others. He must indeed have been conscious to some extent of imposture, but he would not draw any sharp line in his own mind between the marvels which really happened to him and the marvels he displayed to others. Both as prophet and as sorcerer, he must have lived, more than any other even of that age, in an atmosphere of the supernatural. If, therefore, this portent was really given, it was certainly given to the very man of all that ever lived to whom it was most suitable. Just as one cannot imagine the miracle of the stater (<a href="/matthew/17-27.htm">Matthew 17:27</a>) happening to any one of less simple and childlike faith than St. Peter, so one could not think of the ass as speaking to any one in the Bible but the wizard prophet, for whom - both on his good and on his bad side - the boundary lines between the natural and supernatural were almost obliterated. <p><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> Balaam was at this moment intensely angry., and nothing blunts the edge of natural surprise so much as rage.
