In the biblical context, God's anger is often a response to disobedience or rebellion against His chosen leaders or commands. The burning anger signifies a righteous and holy response to sin. This is consistent with other instances in the Old Testament where God's anger is kindled, such as in <a href="/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a> during the golden calf incident. Theologically, it underscores God's holiness and the seriousness of challenging His appointed servants. It also reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience brings blessing, and rebellion brings judgment.<p><b>and He departed.</b><br>The departure of the LORD signifies a withdrawal of His presence, which in the Old Testament often indicates judgment or disfavor. This is a significant action, as God's presence among the Israelites was a source of guidance, protection, and blessing. Theologically, it serves as a warning about the consequences of sin and rebellion. In the broader biblical narrative, God's presence is central to the covenant relationship, as seen in the tabernacle and later the temple. The departure here foreshadows the ultimate separation from God that sin causes, which is reconciled through Jesus Christ, who restores the broken relationship between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Numbers, Moses is God's chosen leader for the Israelites.
