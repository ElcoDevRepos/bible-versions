The wilderness period was a time of testing and reliance on God for provision and guidance. It was also a formative period where God gave the Law through Moses, shaping the identity and faith of the Israelite community. The wilderness represents a place of both physical and spiritual challenges, where the Israelites learned to trust in God's promises.<p><b>a man was found gathering wood</b><br>Gathering wood may seem like a mundane task, but in the context of the Law, it was significant. The act of gathering wood on the Sabbath was a direct violation of the commandment to keep the Sabbath day holy and to rest, as outlined in <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>. This incident highlights the importance of obedience to God's commandments and the seriousness with which the Sabbath was to be observed. The gathering of wood could symbolize human effort and work, which was prohibited on the Sabbath, a day set apart for rest and worship.<p><b>on the Sabbath day</b><br>The Sabbath was instituted by God as a day of rest and remembrance of His creation and deliverance. It was a sign of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13-17</a>). Observing the Sabbath was a way for the Israelites to demonstrate their trust in God's provision and to acknowledge His sovereignty. The Sabbath also foreshadows the rest found in Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>, where believers are invited to enter into God's rest through faith in Jesus. The violation of the Sabbath in this passage underscores the tension between human disobedience and divine law, pointing to the need for a Savior who perfectly fulfills the Law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were journeying through the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt.

In the wilderness, the community upheld the holiness of the Sabbath by addressing one man&#8217;s deliberate gathering of wood. The verse teaches that every believer&#8217;s actions matter, Sabbath rest points to God&#8217;s provision, and neglecting His commands invites serious consequences.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness . . . --</span>Better, <span class= "ital">Now the children of Israel were in the wilderness, and they found, </span>&c. It is probable that the incident which is here recorded is designed to illustrate the presumptuous sins which were to be punished by death. The offence may have been committed shortly after the promulgation of the commandments contained in this chapter, but all that is certain is that it was committed "in the wilderness," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>according to Ibn Ezra, in the wilderness of Sinai, but more probably during the period of the wanderings in the wilderness after the arrival at Kadesh. No inference can be drawn from this verse as to the time at which the account was committed to writing. The observance of the Sabbath was obligatory in the wilderness as well as in the land of Canaan (comp. <a href="/context/exodus/16-27.htm" title="And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.">Exodus 16:27-30</a>), and the punishment of death had already been denounced against those who profaned it by doing any work thereon (see <a href="/exodus/31-15.htm" title="Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whoever does any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.">Exodus 31:15</a>; <a href="/exodus/35-2.htm" title="Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whoever does work therein shall be put to death.">Exodus 35:2</a>)<span class= "ital">, </span>but the manner in which death was to be inflicted does not appear to have been hitherto declared. The same verb which is here rendered "declared" occurs in the parallel case of the blasphemer in <a href="/leviticus/24-12.htm" title="And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be showed them.">Leviticus 24:12</a>, where it is rendered "shewed":--"And they put him in ward, that the mind of the Lord might be shewed them." The punishment of death had already been denounced against those who cursed father or mother (<a href="/leviticus/20-9.htm" title="For every one that curses his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he has cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be on him.">Leviticus 20:9</a>). It could hardly be thought that a lighter punishment was to be inflicted on one who blasphemed the name of Jehovah, but in that case, as in this, the mode of death does not appear to have been previously enjoined.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness. It is maintained by some that these words were intended to mark the contrast between the previous laws, which were only to be observed when the people came into their own land, and the law of the sabbath, which was strictly enforced during the period of wandering. There is no doubt that such a distinction existed in fact, but there is no reason to find the intentional assertion of it in this expression. The simpler and more natural, and therefore more <span class="accented">probable</span>, explanation <span class="accented">is</span>, that the incident was recorded after the people had left the wilderness. At the same time, there is nothing unreasonable in ascribing the narrative to Moses himself if we suppose him to have written it at the end of his life, when the people were encamped in the steppes of Moab. It seems probable that the record of the incident was inserted here as an example of a "presumptuous" sin, and of its punishment. A man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. This was clearly presumptuous, because the prohibition to do any work for oneself on the sabbath had been made so clear, and was so constantly forced upon their attention by the failure of the manna on that day, that ignorance could not possibly be pleaded here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/15-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">While the Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yih&#183;y&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
