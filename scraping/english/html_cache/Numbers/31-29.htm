The spoils were divided into two parts: one for the warriors who fought in the battle and the other for the rest of the congregation. This division underscores the principle of sharing the blessings and responsibilities among the community. It reflects the communal nature of Israelite society, where both those who directly engage in battle and those who support them are considered part of the victory.<p><b>and give it to Eleazar the priest</b><br>Eleazar, the son of Aaron, served as the high priest at this time. The instruction to give a portion of the spoils to Eleazar highlights the role of the priesthood in mediating between God and the people. The priests were responsible for maintaining the spiritual well-being of the nation, and this allocation provided for their sustenance. This act also emphasizes the importance of supporting religious leaders, a principle echoed in the New Testament (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>).<p><b>as an offering to the LORD</b><br>The offering to the LORD signifies the acknowledgment that victory and blessings come from God. By dedicating a portion of the spoils to God, the Israelites recognized His sovereignty and expressed gratitude for His provision and protection. This act of offering is a form of worship and a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. It also prefigures the ultimate offering of Jesus Christ, who gave Himself as a sacrifice for humanity's sins, fulfilling the sacrificial system of the Old Testament (<a href="/hebrews/9-11.htm">Hebrews 9:11-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eleazar_the_priest.htm">Eleazar the Priest</a></b><br>Eleazar was the son of Aaron and served as the high priest after Aaron's death.

The command to &#8220;take&#8221; signifies deliberate, obedient action, echoing the way Moses previously &#8220;did just as the LORD commanded him&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/27-22.htm">Numbers 27:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; God, not Moses, initiates the instruction, reminding us that true stewardship begins with recognizing divine ownership (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The tangible spoils of the Midianite campaign become a test of faithfulness, much like Israel&#8217;s handling of Jericho&#8217;s treasury in <a href="/joshua/6-19.htm">Joshua 6:19</a>.<p>&#8226; By seizing a set portion, Israel acknowledges that victory comes from the LORD (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>), not from their own strength.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from their half</b><p>&#8226; The division of plunder into two halves&#8212;one for the soldiers, one for the congregation (<a href="/numbers/31-26.htm">Numbers 31:26&#8211;27</a>)&#8212;underscores God&#8217;s concern for fairness and community welfare, reminiscent of David&#8217;s later decree that &#8220;the share of the one who stays with the supplies shall be the same as the share of the one who goes down to battle&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/30-24.htm">1 Samuel 30:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Taking the tribute specifically &#8220;from their half&#8221; (the warriors&#8217; portion) protects the community&#8217;s allotment while reminding the fighters that even hard-earned gain belongs first to God (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-12.htm">1 Chronicles 29:12</a>).<p>&#8226; This principle mirrors the tithe drawn from agricultural produce (<a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a>): whatever we receive, a holy fraction is reserved for the LORD.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and give it to Eleazar the priest</b><p>&#8226; Eleazar, as high priest, represents the people before God; delivering the tribute to him ensures it is handled according to sacred protocol (<a href="/numbers/3-9.htm">Numbers 3:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; The priestly mediation highlights that worship is relational, not merely transactional (<a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Handing the offering to a living mediator foreshadows the ultimate Priest&#8212;Christ&#8212;through whom our gifts are accepted (<a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; This act also sustains the priesthood materially, as God earlier decreed that &#8220;the LORD is their inheritance&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20&#8211;21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as an offering to the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The tribute is called &#8220;an offering,&#8221; placing it squarely in the category of worship rather than taxation (<a href="/exodus/25-2.htm">Exodus 25:2</a>).<p>&#8226; By dedicating spoils of war to God, Israel confesses that every victory belongs to Him (<a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase links the battlefield to the sanctuary&#8212;no sphere of life is secular when God is acknowledged (<a href="/colossians/3-17.htm">Colossians 3:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Such offerings keep hearts oriented heavenward, guarding against the pride warned of in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-17.htm">Deuteronomy 8:17&#8211;18</a>: &#8220;My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/31-29.htm">Numbers 31:29</a> teaches that God claims first rights over every gain. The warriors are told to set apart a portion of their own share, deliver it through the ordained priest, and treat it as worship. The verse weaves obedience, equity, mediation, and devotion into one simple instruction, reminding us that all victories and resources ultimately belong to the LORD and are best used when placed back in His hands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An</span> <span class="cmt_word">heave offering unto the Lord.</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>.
