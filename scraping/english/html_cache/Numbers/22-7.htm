Historically, Moab and Midian were neighboring tribes often in conflict with Israel. Their alliance here underscores the perceived threat of the Israelites. The elders' involvement indicates the seriousness of the situation, as elders were respected leaders and decision-makers within their communities.<p><b>with the fees for divination in hand.</b><br>Divination was a common practice in the ancient Near East, used to seek guidance from the gods. The mention of fees suggests a formal transaction, indicating that Balaam was a professional diviner. This practice was condemned in Israelite law (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>), highlighting the contrast between Israel's faith in Yahweh and the pagan practices of surrounding nations. The fees also imply the expectation of a favorable outcome, as diviners were often paid to pronounce blessings or curses.<p><b>They came to Balaam</b><br>Balaam was a well-known figure, likely a non-Israelite prophet or seer, whose reputation extended across the region. His name appears in other ancient texts, suggesting he was a historical figure. Balaam's role in this narrative is complex, as he is both a conduit for God's messages and a participant in pagan practices. His story illustrates the tension between divine sovereignty and human free will.<p><b>and relayed to him the words of Balak.</b><br>Balak, the king of Moab, was deeply concerned about the Israelites' presence and sought supernatural intervention. By sending a message through the elders, Balak demonstrates his desperation and belief in the power of curses. This act of communication sets the stage for the unfolding drama, where God's will ultimately prevails over human schemes. The narrative foreshadows the theme of God's protection over Israel, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/121-7.htm">Psalm 121:7-8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders_of_moab_and_midian.htm">Elders of Moab and Midian</a></b><br>These are the leaders or representatives from the nations of Moab and Midian.

Scripture records this practice as morally corrupt (<a href="/ezekiel/13-19.htm">Ezekiel 13:19</a>; <a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>). By contrast, true prophecy is never for sale (<a href="/2_kings/5-15.htm">2 Kings 5:15&#8211;16</a>; <a href="/acts/8-18.htm">Acts 8:18&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; Balaam&#8217;s later condemnation as one &#8220;who loved the wages of wickedness&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/2-15.htm">2 Peter 2:15</a>; <a href="/bsb/jude/1.htm">Jude 11</a>) roots back to this moment. The silver in their hands foreshadows the moral compromise ahead.<p>&#8226; The verse also sets up the clash between hired divination and God&#8217;s sovereign word; no amount of money can bend the Lord&#8217;s blessing (<a href="/numbers/23-20.htm">Numbers 23:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They came to Balaam and relayed to him the words of Balak.</b><p>&#8226; Balaam lives far from Moab (<a href="/numbers/22-5.htm">Numbers 22:5</a>), yet his reputation as a powerful seer precedes him&#8212;proof that pagan nations acknowledged genuine spiritual power while lacking true knowledge of the Lord (cf. <a href="/joshua/13-22.htm">Joshua 13:22</a>).<p>&#8226; By &#8220;relaying&#8221; Balak&#8217;s exact words, the messengers act as formal envoys, highlighting that Balaam is being contracted like a mercenary prophet.<p>&#8226; Balak&#8217;s message (<a href="/numbers/22-6.htm">Numbers 22:6</a>) is blunt: &#8220;Come and curse this people for me.&#8221; It exposes human attempts to manipulate blessing and curse, ignoring God&#8217;s covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Balaam will soon claim, &#8220;I can speak only what God puts in my mouth&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/22-18.htm">Numbers 22:18, 38</a>), yet his willingness to entertain the offer shows a divided heart&#8212;echoing Jesus&#8217; warning that one cannot serve both God and money (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The narrative prepares readers to witness God overruling pagan plans, much as He later frustrates Ahithophel&#8217;s counsel (<a href="/2_samuel/17-14.htm">2 Samuel 17:14</a>) and Haman&#8217;s plot (<a href="/esther/6-13.htm">Esther 6:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/22-7.htm">Numbers 22:7</a> captures a pivotal first step in a larger drama: influential leaders, clutching payment for sorcery, approach a famed diviner to curse Israel. The verse exposes mankind&#8217;s tendency to buy spiritual outcomes, contrasts mercenary religion with God&#8217;s free and sovereign word, and foreshadows the Lord&#8217;s ultimate refusal to let Balaam speak anything but blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian.</span>--The close alliance which existed between the two nations appears throughout the whole of the narrative.<p><span class= "bld">The rewards of divination.--</span>Literally, <span class= "ital">the divinations. </span>Some think the meaning to be <span class= "ital">instruments of divination; </span>but as <span class= "ital">besorah </span>means not only <span class= "ital">tidings, </span>but also the <span class= "ital">reward for tidings </span>(<a href="/2_samuel/4-10.htm" title="When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for his tidings:">2Samuel 4:10</a>), so <span class= "ital">kesamim </span>may mean not only <span class= "ital">divinations, </span>but also the <span class= "ital">rewards of divination.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With the rewards of divination.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, "soothsayings."

Here the soothsayer's wages, which St. Peter aptly calls the wages of unrighteousness. The ease with which, among ignorant and superstitious people, a prophet might become a hired soothsayer is apparent even from the case of Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/9-6.htm">1 Samuel 9:6-8</a>). That it should be thought proper to resort to the man of God for information about some lost property, and much more that it should be thought necessary to pay him a fee for the exercise of his supernatural powers, shows, not indeed that Samuel was a soothsayer, for he was a man of rare integrity and independence, but, that Samuel was but little distinguished from a soothsayer in the popular estimation. If Samuel had learnt to care more for money than for righteousness, he might very easily have become just what Balaam became. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/22-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The elders</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ziq&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2205.htm">Strong's 2205: </a> </span><span class="str2">Old</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Moab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4124.htm">Strong's 4124: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moab -- a son of Lot,also his descendants and the territory where they settled</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Midian</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1428;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7695;&#183;y&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4080.htm">Strong's 4080: </a> </span><span class="str2">Midian -- a son of Abraham and Keturah, also his descendants and the region where they settled </span><br /><br /><span class="word">departed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
