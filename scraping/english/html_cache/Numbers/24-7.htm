In the arid regions of the Near East, water is a precious resource, often associated with life and blessing. The imagery of water flowing from buckets suggests a plentiful supply, indicating that Israel will experience prosperity and fertility. This can be connected to God's promise to bless Israel and make them a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). The metaphor of water is also used throughout Scripture to signify spiritual blessings and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a>, <a href="/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38-39</a>).<p><b>and his seed will have abundant water</b><br>The term "seed" refers to descendants or offspring, indicating that the future generations of Israel will also experience blessing and prosperity. This promise of abundant water for the seed can be seen as a continuation of the covenantal blessings promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, where their descendants would be numerous and blessed (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>). The abundance of water signifies not only physical prosperity but also spiritual vitality and growth, which is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature (<a href="/ezekiel/47.htm">Ezekiel 47:1-12</a>).<p><b>His king will be greater than Agag</b><br>Agag was a king of the Amalekites, a people who were often in conflict with Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/15-8.htm">1 Samuel 15:8</a>). The mention of Agag here serves as a historical reference point, indicating that Israel's king will surpass even the most formidable of their enemies. This prophecy points to the future monarchy in Israel, particularly the reign of King David, who defeated the Amalekites and established a powerful kingdom (<a href="/1_samuel/30-17.htm">1 Samuel 30:17-20</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate kingship of Jesus Christ, who is greater than all earthly rulers (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).<p><b>and his kingdom will be exalted</b><br>The exaltation of Israel's kingdom suggests a future time of glory and dominance. This can be seen as a prophetic vision of the Davidic kingdom, which reached its zenith under Solomon, and ultimately points to the Messianic kingdom of Jesus Christ. The exaltation of the kingdom is a fulfillment of God's promises to Israel, where they would be a light to the nations and a conduit of God's blessings to the world (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>). The ultimate fulfillment of this exaltation is found in the eternal kingdom of Christ, where He reigns supreme (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet who was hired by Balak, the king of Moab, to curse Israel.

Balaam sees Israel as a people so richly supplied that water is literally pouring out of the containers meant only to carry it.<p>&#8226; In Scripture, water often signals life, refreshment, and the sustaining grace of God. <a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7</a> celebrates a land &#8220;of brooks of water, of fountains and springs that flow,&#8221; and <a href="/psalms/65-9.htm">Psalm 65:9</a> adds that God &#8220;visits the earth and waters it abundantly.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The image is not hypothetical; it promises a tangible, literal abundance once Israel settles in the land. Think of wells that never run dry, crops that never fail, households always quenched.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the same overflowing grace is in view. <a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3</a> links physical water with the outpouring of the Spirit: &#8220;I will pour water on the thirsty land &#8230; I will pour out My Spirit on your offspring.&#8221; The nation&#8217;s life with God is meant to spill over to the world around it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His seed will have abundant water</b><p>Balaam continues: Israel&#8217;s descendants will never lack what they need.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Seed&#8221; points to literal offspring (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>) and the future generations who will inherit covenant blessings.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a> pictures that security: &#8220;Israel dwells securely; the fountain of Jacob lives untroubled in a land of grain and wine, where the heavens drip with dew.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God is committing Himself to ongoing provision. Each new generation can expect the same faithfulness, which is why <a href="/isaiah/44-3.htm">Isaiah 44:3&#8211;4</a> promises that children &#8220;will sprout up like grass in a meadow.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The line &#8220;abundant water&#8221; again grounds the prophecy in real, physical prosperity&#8212;fields irrigated, families healthy, livestock thriving&#8212;because God&#8217;s covenant care is dependable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His king will be greater than Agag</b><p>The prophecy shifts from general blessing to royal authority.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Agag&#8221; was the title carried by Amalekite kings (<a href="/1_samuel/15-8.htm">1 Samuel 15:8</a>). Amalek stood for opposition to God&#8217;s people (<a href="/exodus/17-16.htm">Exodus 17:16</a>). Predicting a king &#8220;greater than Agag&#8221; means Israel&#8217;s future ruler will decisively outclass every hostile monarch.<p>&#8226; At first this was fulfilled in Saul, who defeated Amalek (<a href="/bsb/1_samuel/14.htm">1 Samuel 14&#8211;15</a>), yet Saul&#8217;s disobedience showed he wasn&#8217;t the final answer. The promise stretches forward to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;13</a>) and ultimately to the Messiah, &#8220;King of kings and Lord of lords&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).<p>&#8226; God had already hinted at monarchy in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14&#8211;15</a>, so Balaam&#8217;s words confirm that a divinely appointed king is coming, one whose greatness dwarfs Israel&#8217;s enemies.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His kingdom will be exalted</b><p>The closing line draws the lens even wider.<p>&#8226; Balaam foretells a kingdom raised high. <a href="/numbers/23-24.htm">Numbers 23:24</a> had said Israel &#8220;will rise like a lion,&#8221; and now the picture is a realm lifted above the nations.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/89-27.htm">Psalm 89:27</a> echoes this: &#8220;I will appoint him to be My firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.&#8221; <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a> adds that in the last days the LORD&#8217;s mountain will be &#8220;chief among the mountains.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a> promises a kingdom &#8220;that will never be destroyed,&#8221; and <a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32&#8211;33</a> says Jesus &#8220;will reign over the house of Jacob forever.&#8221; The exaltation begins in David&#8217;s throne but culminates eternally in Christ.<p>&#8226; <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9&#8211;11</a> shows the ultimate fulfillment: every knee bowing to the exalted King. Balaam&#8217;s vision, then, is both immediate and eschatological&#8212;grounded in Israel&#8217;s history yet reaching all the way to the consummation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/24-7.htm">Numbers 24:7</a> layers four promises: overflowing provision, generational abundance, a superior king, and a kingdom lifted high. The prophecy starts with the tangible&#8212;buckets spilling water&#8212;and ends with the universal&#8212;an exalted reign that outshines every rival. In Israel&#8217;s early history we see previews of each line, but the fullest expression comes in the Messiah, whose life-giving Spirit, unrivaled kingship, and everlasting kingdom satisfy the verse in its richest, most literal sense.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">He shall pour the water out of his buckets.--</span>Better, <span class= "ital">Water shall flow from his buckets; </span>or, <span class= "ital">he shall flow with water from his buckets. </span>The nation is personified as a man carrying two buckets full of water, which was the type and leading source of blessing and prosperity in the East. This is a beautiful image, as Bishop Wordsworth has observed, of the true Israel "pouring out the living waters of salvation, the pure streams of the Spirit, and making the wilderness of the world to rejoice and be glad."<p><span class= "bld">His seed shall be in many waters.--</span>This may mean that Israel should inhabit Canaan--"a land of brooks of water" (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm" title="For the LORD your God brings you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;">Deuteronomy 8:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-11.htm" title="But the land, where you go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinks water of the rain of heaven:">Deuteronomy 11:11</a>); or it may mean that, like seed sown and trees planted by the waters (<a href="/isaiah/32-20.htm" title="Blessed are you that sow beside all waters, that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass.">Isaiah 32:20</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/44-4.htm" title="And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses.">Isaiah 44:4, Isa_65:22-23</a>), they should inherit the richest blessings.<p><span class= "bld">His king shall be higher than</span> <span class= "bld">Agag . . .</span>-Agag appears to have been the title (<span class= "ital">nomen dignitatis</span>) of the Amalekite kings, as <span class= "ital">Pharaoh </span>of the Egyptian and <span class= "ital">Abimelech </span>of the Philistine kings. The reference does not seem to be to any particular king, but to the kingdom which should hereafter be established in Israel--to the kings, generally, which should come out of the loins of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-6.htm" title="And I will make you exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of you, and kings shall come out of you.">Genesis 17:6</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-11.htm" title="And God said to him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of you, and kings shall come out of your loins;">Genesis 35:11</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall pour the water,</span> or, "the water shall overflow." <span class="cmt_word">Out of his buckets.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;</span> is the dual, "his two buckets." The image, familiar enough to one who lived in an irrigated land, is of one carrying two buckets on the ends of a pole which are so full as to run over as he goes. <span class="cmt_word">And his seed... in many waters.</span> It is uncertain in what sense the word "seed" issued. It may be an image as simple as the last, of seed sown either by or actually upon many waters (cf. <a href="/ecclesiastes/11-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:1</a>), and so securing a plentiful and safe return; or it may stand for the seed, i.e., the posterity, of Israel, which should grow up amidst many blessings (<a href="/isaiah/44-4.htm">Isaiah 44:4</a>). The former seems most in keeping here. His king shall be higher than Agag. Rather, "let his king be higher than Agag." The name Agag (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d2;</span>, the fiery one) does not occur again except as the name of the king of Amalek whom Saul conquered and Samuel slew (<a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>.); yet it may safely be assumed that it was the official title of all the kings of Amalek, resembling in this "Abimelech" and "Pharaoh." Here it seems to stand for the dynasty and the nation of the Amalekites, and there is no reason to suppose that any reference was intended to any particular individual or event in the distant future. The "king" of Israel here spoken of is certainly not Saul or any other of the kings, but God himself in his character as temporal Ruler of Israel; and the "kingdom" is the kingdom of heaven as set forth by way of anticipation in the polity and order of the chosen race. As a fact, Israel had afterwards a visible king who overthrew Agag, but their having such a king was alien to the mind of God, and due to a distinct falling away from national faith, and therefore could find no place in this prophecy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/24-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Water</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4325.htm">Strong's 4325: </a> </span><span class="str2">Water, juice, urine, semen</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will flow</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1469;&#1494;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(yiz&#183;zal-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5140.htm">Strong's 5140: </a> </span><span class="str2">To flow, trickle, drop, distill</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from his buckets,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1428;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(mid&#183;d&#257;&#183;l&#601;&#183;y&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
