The plague was a direct consequence of the people's grumbling and rebellion against God's appointed leaders. The number 14,700 signifies the severity of the judgment and serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of disobedience to God. In biblical numerology, the number 7 often represents completeness or perfection, which may imply the completeness of God's judgment in this instance. This event underscores the holiness of God and His intolerance for rebellion, echoing the broader biblical theme that sin leads to death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p><b>in addition to those who had died on account of Korah</b><br>This phrase highlights that the 14,700 who died from the plague were separate from those who perished directly due to Korah's rebellion. Earlier in <a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>, the earth opened up and swallowed Korah, Dathan, Abiram, and their households, while fire consumed 250 men offering incense. This distinction emphasizes the widespread impact of the rebellion and the seriousness with which God dealt with it. The rebellion of Korah is a significant event in Israel's history, illustrating the dangers of challenging God's established order. It serves as a warning against pride and self-exaltation, themes that are echoed in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/jude/1-11.htm">Jude 1:11</a>, which warns against following the way of Cain, Balaam, and Korah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/korah.htm">Korah</a></b><br>A Levite who led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, challenging their leadership and the priesthood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel, appointed by God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plague.htm">The Plague</a></b><br>A divine punishment sent by God as a result of the rebellion, which resulted in the death of 14,700 Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were journeying through the wilderness to the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_rebellion.htm">The Consequences of Rebellion</a></b><br>Rebellion against God's appointed leaders and His commands leads to severe consequences.

As Moses quickly directed, Aaron &#8220;ran into the midst of the assembly&#8221; with incense and &#8220;made atonement for the people,&#8221; standing &#8220;between the living and the dead&#8221; until the plague was halted (<a href="/numbers/16-46.htm">Numbers 16:46-48</a>). Much like the angel of death at Passover (<a href="/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>) or the destroying angel stopped at Araunah&#8217;s threshing floor (<a href="/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15-16</a>), this scene underscores that divine wrath is real yet can be stayed by priestly intercession&#8212;a pattern later fulfilled in Christ&#8217;s once-for-all mediation (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Numbered 14,700</b><p>The inspired text does not round off the figure; it records 14,700 precisely, highlighting the gravity of Israel&#8217;s sin. Consider the weight of that number:<p>&#8226; It exceeded the 3,000 lost after the golden calf (<a href="/exodus/32-28.htm">Exodus 32:28</a>) yet fell short of the 24,000 in the Baal-Peor plague (<a href="/numbers/25-9.htm">Numbers 25:9</a>).<p>&#8226; It demonstrates that judgment can be both swift and large-scale when God&#8217;s holiness is mocked (<a href="/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a>).<p>&#8226; It magnifies Aaron&#8217;s courageous act; had he delayed, the count would have soared. His censer, symbolizing acceptable worship, became a life-saving instrument, echoing <a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>: &#8220;The prayer of a righteous man has great power.&#8221;<p>The tally serves as a sober reminder that sin&#8217;s consequences are not abstract; they touch real families, leaving empty tents and silent camps.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In addition to those who had died on account of Korah</b><p>The plague victims were &#8220;in addition&#8221; to Korah&#8217;s company&#8212;an earlier judgment that very day. The earth swallowed Korah, Dathan, and Abiram with their households (<a href="/numbers/16-32.htm">Numbers 16:32-33</a>), and fire consumed the 250 men offering unauthorized incense (16:35). <a href="/bsb/jude/1.htm">Jude 11</a> later warns believers to avoid &#8220;the rebellion of Korah,&#8221; linking it with Cain&#8217;s murder and Balaam&#8217;s greed. Here Scripture shows two layers of rebellion:<p>&#8226; The leaders&#8217; blatant defiance (Korah&#8217;s faction).<p>&#8226; The crowd&#8217;s sympathetic grumbling afterward (the wider congregation).<p>First Corinthians 10:10-11 points back to this episode, urging us not to &#8220;grumble, as some of them did&#8212;and were killed by the destroying angel.&#8221; God differentiates roles yet holds every heart accountable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/16-49.htm">Numbers 16:49</a> records a historical headcount with theological weight. The verse teaches that God&#8217;s holiness demands respect, sin invites real judgment, and fervent intercession can stay God&#8217;s wrath. The 14,700 who perished&#8212;and the earlier deaths tied to Korah&#8212;stand as lasting testimony that rebellion against the Lord is deadly serious, while the priestly work of mediation, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus, is gloriously effective for all who trust Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fourteen thousand and seven hundred.</span> A very large number to have died in the course of a few minutes, as the narrative seems to imply.
