In the context of <a href="/numbers/23.htm">Numbers 23</a>, Balaam is speaking under divine inspiration, and his words reflect God's perspective. The term "disaster" can be understood as calamity or misfortune, which God does not foresee for His chosen people at this time. This aligns with the Abrahamic covenant in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a>, where God promises to bless those who bless Israel and curse those who curse them. Historically, this reflects the period of Israel's journey through the wilderness, where despite their disobedience, God remained committed to His promises.<p><b>He sees no trouble for Israel.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's perception of Israel as being free from trouble, despite their frequent rebellions and complaints during the wilderness journey. It underscores the idea of divine grace, where God chooses to overlook their transgressions because of His covenant. This can be connected to the concept of atonement and forgiveness found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/leviticus/16.htm">Leviticus 16</a> with the Day of Atonement. Theologically, it points to the future work of Christ, who would ultimately bear the sins of humanity, allowing God to see believers as righteous.<p><b>The LORD their God is with them,</b><br>This statement affirms God's presence with Israel, a recurring theme throughout the Pentateuch. The divine presence is symbolized by the tabernacle, which traveled with the Israelites, and the pillar of cloud and fire that guided them. This assurance of God's presence is foundational to Israel's identity and mission. It echoes the promise given to Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a> and later to Joshua in <a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>. In a broader biblical context, this foreshadows the incarnation of Christ, "Immanuel," meaning "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>).<p><b>and the shout of the King is among them.</b><br>This phrase suggests a victorious and celebratory atmosphere, with God being recognized as the sovereign King of Israel. The "shout" can be seen as a war cry or a proclamation of triumph, indicating God's active role in leading and defending His people. This imagery is reminiscent of the victory shouts in battles led by God, such as the fall of Jericho in <a href="/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>. Prophetically, it points to the messianic expectation of a coming King, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is hailed as King in the New Testament (<a href="/john/12-13.htm">John 12:13</a>). The presence of the King among His people is a theme that culminates in the eschatological hope of God's eternal reign with His people in <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet who was hired by Balak, the king of Moab, to curse the Israelites.

God promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob an enduring blessing (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). Because of that promise He refuses to label Israel&#8217;s future as doomed.<p>&#8226; The same pattern shows up later: &#8220;&#8216;For I know the plans I have for you,&#8217; declares the LORD, &#8216;plans to prosper you and not to harm you&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The principle carries forward to believers today. In Christ we are &#8220;not appointed to wrath&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:9</a>). God&#8217;s settled intention toward His own is good, not disaster.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He sees no trouble for Israel</b><p>The next line deepens the thought: &#8220;He sees no trouble for Israel.&#8221; Israel is hardly flawless&#8212;grumblings, golden-calf idolatry, and the recent sin at Shittim all happened before or after this oracle. Yet God declares &#8220;no trouble.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This points to atonement. Sacrifices were already in place (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/4.htm">Leviticus 4-6</a>). God&#8217;s mandated offerings covered the nation so that He could look on them without condemning them (<a href="/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Micah later echoes the same mercy: &#8220;Who is a God like You&#8230; You do not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy&#8221; (<a href="/micah/7-18.htm">Micah 7:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Ultimately, Christ fulfills this picture. By His blood, He presents believers &#8220;holy and blameless and above reproach&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a>). God chooses not to see the trouble our sin deserves because He sees us through substitutionary sacrifice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The LORD their God is with them</b><p>Why can disaster and trouble be dismissed? Because &#8220;The LORD their God is with them.&#8221; Divine presence changes everything.<p>&#8226; From the cloud and fire of <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a> to the Tabernacle in the center of camp (<a href="/bsb/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>), God physically manifested His nearness.<p>&#8226; Moses refused to move without that presence: &#8220;If Your Presence does not go with us, do not send us up from here&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/33-15.htm">Exodus 33:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Joshua heard the same assurance (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>), and Jesus extends it to the church: &#8220;I am with you always, to the very end of the age&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The shout of the King is among them</b><p>The oracle climaxes: &#8220;the shout of the King is among them.&#8221; Israel is not merely protected; they carry the triumphant roar of their Ruler.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Shout&#8221; (a battle cry or trumpet-blast) signals victory before the fight even begins, much like the priests&#8217; trumpets at Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Though Israel has no earthly king yet, God Himself reigns (<a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>). Later, David&#8217;s songs capture the same note: &#8220;God has ascended amid shouts of joy&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/47-5.htm">Psalm 47:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Prophets look forward to an even greater King whose arrival is greeted with loud acclaim (<a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-6.htm">Revelation 19:6-7</a>). That royal shout rests on every assembly of God&#8217;s people, assuring us of ultimate triumph.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/23-21.htm">Numbers 23:21</a> paints a four-part portrait of God&#8217;s covenant care: He refuses to brand His people with disaster, chooses not to count their trouble, dwells in their midst, and leads them with the confident shout of a victorious King.
