Their role was to care for the tabernacle's curtains, coverings, and other fabric elements. This allocation highlights the importance of their duties in the transportation and maintenance of the tabernacle, emphasizing the organized structure of Israelite worship.<p><b>two carts and four oxen</b><br>The provision of two carts and four oxen was practical, reflecting the specific needs of the Gershonites' responsibilities. The carts and oxen were necessary for transporting the heavy and cumbersome materials of the tabernacle. This allocation underscores God's provision and the importance of equipping His people for their assigned tasks. It also illustrates the principle of stewardship, as the resources were to be used for the service of the tabernacle.<p><b>as their service required</b><br>This phrase indicates that the distribution of resources was based on the specific duties and needs of each Levitical family. The Gershonites' service involved transporting the tabernacle's fabric components, which required less equipment compared to the Merarites, who received more carts and oxen due to their responsibility for the heavier structural elements. This allocation reflects God's wisdom in providing according to need and the importance of each role within the community.
