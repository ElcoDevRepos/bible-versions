This opposition highlights a significant challenge to the God-ordained leadership of Moses and Aaron. The gathering against them suggests a coordinated effort, reflecting a deep-seated discontent among certain factions within Israel. Historically, this rebellion occurs during the Israelites' wilderness journey, a time marked by frequent complaints and challenges to leadership (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2</a>, <a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2</a>).<p><b>and told them, &#8220;You have taken too much upon yourselves!</b><br>The accusation implies that Moses and Aaron have overstepped their roles, suggesting an abuse of power or authority. This reflects a misunderstanding or rejection of the divine appointment of Moses and Aaron as leaders. The phrase echoes the human tendency to resist divinely established authority, a theme seen throughout Scripture (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>).<p><b>For everyone in the entire congregation is holy,</b><br>This claim references the idea that all Israelites are set apart as God's chosen people (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). However, it overlooks the specific roles and responsibilities assigned by God, particularly the unique priestly duties given to Aaron and his descendants. The assertion of universal holiness is a distortion of the covenant relationship, ignoring the structure God established for worship and leadership.<p><b>and the LORD is in their midst.</b><br>This acknowledges God's presence among the Israelites, a truth evidenced by the tabernacle and the cloud of glory (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-38</a>). However, the rebels use this truth to justify their challenge, failing to recognize that God's presence does not negate the need for appointed leaders. The presence of the LORD is a central theme in Israel's journey, emphasizing both privilege and responsibility.<p><b>Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?&#8221;</b><br>The question challenges the perceived elevation of Moses and Aaron, accusing them of self-promotion. This reflects a misunderstanding of their roles as servants of God, chosen to lead and intercede for the people (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>). The accusation of self-exaltation is ironic, as it is the rebels who seek to elevate themselves. This mirrors the pride and rebellion seen in other biblical figures who resist God's order (<a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/korah.htm">Korah</a></b><br>A Levite who led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, questioning their leadership and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/dathan_and_abiram.htm">Dathan and Abiram</a></b><br>Reubenites who joined Korah in his rebellion, challenging Moses' leadership.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>Moses' brother and the appointed high priest, serving as a mediator between God and the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_congregation_of_israel.htm">The Congregation of Israel</a></b><br>The assembly of the Israelites, who were influenced by Korah's rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god-ordained_authority.htm">Understanding God-Ordained Authority</a></b><br>God establishes leaders for His purposes.

There was a sanctity which pertained to Israel as a nation, in which all its members shared as distinguished from the nations around (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>); there was a priesthood which was inherent in all the sons of Israel, older and more indelible than that which was conferred on Aaron's line - a priesthood which, apart from special restrictions, or in exceptional circumstances, might and did assert itself in priestly acts (<a href="/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>, and compare the cases of Samuel, Elijah, and others who offered sacrifice during the failure of the appointed priesthood). It Moses had taken the power to himself, or it he had (as they doubtless supposed) restricted active priestly functions to Aaron because he was his brother, and wholly under his influence, their contention would have been quite right. They erred, as most violent men do, not because they asserted what was false, but because they took for granted that the truth which they asserted was really inconsistent with the claims which they assailed. The congregation were all holy; the sons of Israel were all priests; that was true - but it was also true that by Divine command Israel could only exercise his corporate priesthood outwardly through the one family which God had set apart for that purpose. The same God who has lodged in the body certain faculties and powers for the benefit of the body, has decreed that those faculties and powers can only be exercised through certain determinate organs, the very specialization of which is both condition and result of a high organization. <span class="cmt_word">The congregation of the Lord.</span> There are two words for congregation in this verse: <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span> here, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> before. The former seems to be used in the more solemn sense, but they are for the most part indistinguishable, and certainly cannot be assigned to different authors. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/16-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They came together</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1511;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1438;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;q&#257;&#183;ha&#774;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
