Miriam and Aaron, Moses' siblings, question his exclusive prophetic authority. In the broader biblical context, Moses is established as God's chosen leader to deliver Israel from Egypt and to mediate the covenant at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10, 19</a>:3-6). This challenge reflects a misunderstanding of Moses' unique relationship with God, which is later affirmed in <a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6-8</a>, where God clarifies that Moses is unlike any other prophet, speaking with God face to face. The question also highlights the human tendency to question divinely appointed leadership, a theme seen throughout Scripture, such as in Korah's rebellion (Numbers 16).<p><b>they said.</b><br>The plural pronoun "they" refers to Miriam and Aaron, indicating a united front in their challenge against Moses. This familial conflict is significant, as it involves those closest to Moses, suggesting that even within a family, divine roles and callings can be sources of tension. The narrative underscores the importance of recognizing and respecting God's chosen leaders, regardless of personal relationships or ambitions.<p><b>Does He not also speak through us?</b><br>Miriam and Aaron assert their own prophetic roles, which is not entirely unfounded. Aaron, as the high priest, and Miriam, identified as a prophetess (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>), both have significant roles in Israel's spiritual life. However, their roles do not equate to the unique position Moses holds. This statement reflects a broader biblical theme of God using various individuals for His purposes, yet assigning different roles and responsibilities. The New Testament echoes this in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>, which discusses the diversity of spiritual gifts and roles within the body of Christ.<p><b>And the LORD heard this.</b><br>This phrase indicates God's awareness and involvement in the situation. It serves as a reminder of God's omniscience and His active role in the affairs of His people. Theologically, it underscores the principle that God hears and responds to the words and actions of His people, whether in faithfulness or rebellion. This is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/94-9.htm">Psalm 94:9</a>, which affirms that God hears and sees all. The subsequent divine response in <a href="/numbers/12-4.htm">Numbers 12:4-10</a> demonstrates God's defense of His chosen servant and the seriousness with which He regards challenges to His appointed leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in the Book of Numbers, Moses is God's chosen leader for the Israelites.

From the burning bush onward, the LORD had spoken to Moses &#8220;face to face, as one speaks to a friend&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10&#8211;12 and 19</a>:3&#8211;6 show God giving Moses words for the entire nation, underscoring a unique prophetic office.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10</a> affirms, &#8220;No prophet has arisen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5&#8211;6</a> compares Moses&#8217; faithfulness over God&#8217;s house with Christ&#8217;s supremacy, but still treats Moses&#8217; role as unparalleled among Old Testament servants.<p>&#8226; By asking this question, Miriam and Aaron implicitly question God&#8217;s order, not just Moses&#8217; position. It is more than sibling rivalry; it is a challenge to divine appointment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Does He not also speak through us?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Miriam had already prophesied (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>), and Aaron had spoken for Moses before Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/7-1.htm">Exodus 7:1&#8211;2</a>). Their ministries were valid, yet distinct.<p>&#8226; God does speak through others: see <a href="/numbers/11-24.htm">Numbers 11:24&#8211;29</a> where the seventy elders prophesied, and later prophets such as Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; The issue is not whether God can speak through many, but whether anyone may self-promote to equal authority with the one God explicitly placed over Israel.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/12-29.htm">1 Corinthians 12:29&#8211;30</a> reminds believers that different gifts serve one body; not all are apostles or prophets in the same sense or rank.<p>&#8226; Pride and comparison lie beneath the surface (cf. <a href="/james/3-16.htm">James 3:16</a>). <a href="/numbers/12-3.htm">Numbers 12:3</a> highlights Moses&#8217; humility, contrasting sharply with Miriam and Aaron&#8217;s self-assertion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;And the LORD heard this.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Nothing escapes God&#8217;s notice: &#8220;He who planted the ear, does He not hear?&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/94-9.htm">Psalm 94:9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/139-4.htm">Psalm 139:4</a> says, &#8220;Even before a word is on my tongue, You know all about it, O LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s immediate response (<a href="/numbers/12-4.htm">Numbers 12:4&#8211;10</a>) shows He defends His chosen servants and upholds His order. Miriam&#8217;s leprosy underscores the seriousness of challenging divine authority.<p>&#8226; <a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a> assures that God listens both to words of honor and to words of dishonor. Accountability is certain; hidden murmurs are fully exposed before Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Miriam and Aaron&#8217;s questions reveal a deeper heart issue: dissatisfaction with God&#8217;s arrangement and envy of Moses&#8217; unique role. Scripture affirms that while God speaks through many, He sovereignly assigns differing levels of authority. Moses&#8217; prophetic office was singular, divinely authenticated, and not to be rivaled by self-promotion. God heard the complaint, judged it, and thereby reaffirmed His established leadership and the necessity of humility among His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses</span>?--There is probably a reference in these words to the facts related in <a href="/context/exodus/4-10.htm" title="And Moses said to the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since you have spoken to your servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.">Exodus 4:10-16</a>, where Moses speaks of his own slowness of speech (<a href="/numbers/12-10.htm" title="And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked on Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.">Numbers 12:10</a>), and where it is said of Aaron, "And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people" (<a href="/numbers/12-16.htm" title="And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.">Numbers 12:16</a>).

This is their justification of themselves for daring to dispute his judgment and arraign his proceedings; a thing which clearly required justification. Moses himself, or more likely others for him, had remonstrated with them on the language they were using. They retorted that Moses had no monopoly of Divine communications; Aaron also received the revelation of God by Urim and Thummim, and Miriam was a prophetess. They were acknowledged in a general sense as sharing with him the leadership of Israel (see <a href="/micah/6-4.htm">Micah 6:4</a>); upon this they meant to found a claim to coordinate authority. They would have had perhaps all matters settled in a family council in which they should have had an equal voice. It was hard for them both to forget that Moses was only their younger brother: for Miriam that she had saved his <span class="accented">life</span> as an infant; for Aaron that he had been as prominent as Moses in the original commission from God to the people. <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord heard it.</span> In one sense he hears everything; in another sense there are many things which he does not choose to hear, because he does not wish to take judicial notice of them.
