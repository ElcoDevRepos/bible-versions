In the ancient Near Eastern context, morning was often a time for significant decisions and actions, as seen in <a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a> when Abraham rose early to obey God's command. This reflects a sense of urgency and importance in responding to divine instructions.<p><b>and said to Balak&#8217;s princes,</b><br>The mention of "Balak's princes" highlights the political and diplomatic nature of the mission. Balak, the king of Moab, had sent these princes to secure Balaam's services to curse Israel. This reflects the historical context where kings often sought spiritual oracles to gain advantage in conflicts, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/22.htm">1 Kings 22</a> with King Ahab consulting prophets.<p><b>&#8220;Go back to your homeland,</b><br>Balaam's directive for the princes to return home signifies a rejection of their mission. This phrase underscores the geographical distance between Moab and Balaam's location, possibly in Mesopotamia, indicating the seriousness of the journey and the importance of the task they were sent to accomplish.<p><b>because the LORD has refused to let me go with you.&#8221;</b><br>Here, "the LORD" refers to Yahweh, the God of Israel, indicating Balaam's recognition of the true God despite his pagan background. This refusal highlights God's sovereignty and protection over Israel, as seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a> where God promises to bless those who bless Abraham's descendants and curse those who curse them. This also foreshadows the ultimate futility of opposing God's plans, a theme echoed in the New Testament in <a href="/acts/5-39.htm">Acts 5:39</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet or diviner who is approached by Balak to curse the Israelites.
