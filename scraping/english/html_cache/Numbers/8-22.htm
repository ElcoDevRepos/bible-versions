This phrase indicates the completion of their consecration process, which involved purification rituals and offerings (<a href="/numbers/8-5.htm">Numbers 8:5-21</a>). Their service was essential for the functioning of the Tabernacle, as they assisted the priests and maintained the sacred space. This role foreshadows the New Testament concept of believers as a "royal priesthood" (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>), serving God in various capacities.<p><b>at the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, also known as the Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites during their wilderness journey. It was a portable sanctuary, meticulously constructed according to divine specifications (Exodus 25-31). The Levites' service here underscores the importance of maintaining holiness and order in worship, a principle that carries into Christian worship practices today.<p><b>in the presence of Aaron and his sons</b><br>Aaron and his sons were the appointed priests, with Aaron serving as the first high priest. Their presence signifies the oversight and authority they held over the Levites. This hierarchical structure ensured that the worship and sacrifices were conducted according to God's commands. The priesthood of Aaron is a type of Christ, who is our High Priest, mediating between God and humanity (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>Thus they did with the Levites</b><br>This phrase emphasizes obedience to God's instructions. The Levites' consecration and service were carried out precisely as commanded, reflecting the broader biblical theme of obedience as a demonstration of faith. This obedience is mirrored in the New Testament, where believers are called to live according to God's will (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><b>just as the LORD had commanded Moses</b><br>Moses, as the mediator of God's covenant with Israel, received direct instructions from the LORD. The phrase highlights the divine authority behind the Levites' service and the importance of adhering to God's commands. This obedience to divine instruction is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, illustrating the necessity of following God's revealed will for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /
