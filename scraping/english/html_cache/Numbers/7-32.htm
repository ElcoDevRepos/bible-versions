The use of gold in the offerings reflects the value and honor given to God. In the ancient Near East, gold was a sign of wealth and status, and its use in religious contexts signified the importance of the offering. The dish itself would have been crafted with care, indicating the reverence and dedication of the giver.<p><b>weighing ten shekels</b><br>A shekel was a standard unit of weight in ancient Israel, approximately 11 grams or 0.4 ounces. Ten shekels would thus be about 110 grams or 4 ounces. The specific weight indicates a measure of precision and intentionality in the offering. Numbers often have symbolic meanings in the Bible; ten can represent completeness or divine order, suggesting the offering was complete and sufficient.<p><b>filled with incense</b><br>Incense was a significant element in Israelite worship, symbolizing prayer and the presence of God. It was used in the tabernacle and later in the temple, particularly in the Holy Place. The sweet aroma of incense rising was a metaphor for prayers ascending to God. In <a href="/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a>, incense is associated with the prayers of the saints, showing continuity in the symbolism from the Old to the New Testament. The use of incense in offerings highlights the importance of prayer and worship in the relationship between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the offerings from the leaders of the tribes during the dedication of the altar.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_leaders.htm">Israelite Leaders</a></b><br>The heads of the twelve tribes of Israel who brought offerings for the dedication of the altar.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle.htm">Tabernacle</a></b><br>The portable dwelling place for the divine presence among the Israelites, where the altar was located.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar_dedication.htm">Altar Dedication</a></b><br>A significant event where offerings were made by the leaders of each tribe to consecrate the altar for worship.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gold_dish_and_incense.htm">Gold Dish and Incense</a></b><br>Part of the offering, symbolizing purity and the prayers of the people rising to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_incense.htm">Symbolism of Incense</a></b><br>Incense in the Bible often symbolizes prayer and worship.

It signals purity, value, and permanence&#8212;qualities the LORD associates with His presence.<p>- &#8220;Dish&#8221; (or &#8220;pan&#8221;) tells us the item was made for service, not decoration. It would be used at the altar, set in the holy place, and handled by priests (<a href="/leviticus/16-12.htm">Leviticus 16:12</a>).<p>- The singular &#8220;one&#8221; reminds us that each tribal leader&#8217;s gift was identical. No tribe could claim superiority; all stood equal before the LORD (<a href="/numbers/7-10.htm">Numbers 7:10-11</a>).<p>- Think of the gold vessels Solomon later crafted for the temple (<a href="/1_kings/7-48.htm">1 Kings 7:48-50</a>). That continuity underscores how seriously God takes the details of worship.<p>- For believers today, gold pictures faith refined by fire (<a href="/1_peter/1-7.htm">1 Peter 1:7</a>). Our lives, like that little dish, are meant to be valuable instruments in His hands (<a href="/2_timothy/2-20.htm">2 Timothy 2:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>weighing ten shekels</b><p>- A sanctuary shekel weighed about 10&#8211;11 grams. Ten of them equals roughly 4 ounces&#8212;costly but not extravagant. God&#8217;s standards are precise yet attainable (<a href="/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a>; <a href="/leviticus/27-25.htm">Leviticus 27:25</a>).<p>- Ten often marks completeness: the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-1.htm">Exodus 20:1-17</a>), ten plagues (<a href="/exodus/11-1.htm">Exodus 11:1</a>), the ten virgins (<a href="/matthew/25-1.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>). The weight hints at a whole, well-rounded offering.<p>- Bullet points of significance:<p>&#8226; Careful measurement affirms integrity&#8212;&#8220;Honest scales and balances belong to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-11.htm">Proverbs 16:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Equal weight for every tribe kept unity; none could outgive another.<p>&#8226; The fixed standard guards against shortcuts.

Anything else was &#8220;unauthorized fire&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-2</a>).<p>- Incense represents prayer: &#8220;May my prayer be set before You like incense&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>). In <a href="/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8</a> the elders hold &#8220;golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/luke/1-9.htm">Luke 1:9-10</a> shows the priest burning incense while &#8220;the whole multitude of the people were praying outside.&#8221; As smoke rose, so did their petitions.<p>- Practical takeaways:<p>&#8226; A valuable vessel is made meaningful only when it&#8217;s filled; an empty dish is pointless. Our lives must carry the fragrance of prayer and worship.<p>&#8226; Incense had to be continual (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-8</a>). Consistent, daily communion with God pleases Him far more than occasional grand gestures.<p>&#8226; The aroma spread beyond the holy place. Authentic prayer life influences everyone around us (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-14.htm">2 Corinthians 2:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/7-32.htm">Numbers 7:32</a> zooms in on &#8220;one gold dish weighing ten shekels, filled with incense,&#8221; teaching that worship combines value (gold), measured commitment (ten shekels), and fragrant devotion (incense). Every tribe brought the same costly, precisely-weighted, prayer-filled gift, demonstrating equal standing before a holy God. Today He still desires believers who offer lives of proven worth, carefully measured obedience, and continual prayer that rises like sweet fragrance to His throne.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/7-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1435;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">gold</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1430;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#257;&#183;h&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2091.htm">Strong's 2091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gold, something gold-colored, as oil, a clear sky</span><br /><br /><span class="word">dish</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(kap&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3709.htm">Strong's 3709: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hollow or flat of the hand, palm, sole (of the foot), a pan</span><br /><br /><span class="word">weighing ten [shekels],</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6235.htm">Strong's 6235: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ten</span><br /><br /><span class="word">filled with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;l&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4392.htm">Strong's 4392: </a> </span><span class="str2">Full, filling, fulness, fully</span><br /><br /><span class="word">incense;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1456;&#1496;&#1465;&#1469;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;&#8234;&#8236;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#601;&#183;&#7789;&#333;&#183;re&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7004.htm">Strong's 7004: </a> </span><span class="str2">Smoke, odor of (burning) sacrifice, incense</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/numbers/7-32.htm">Numbers 7:32 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/numbers/7-32.htm">Numbers 7:32 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/numbers/7-32.htm">Numbers 7:32 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/numbers/7-32.htm">Numbers 7:32 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/numbers/7-32.htm">Numbers 7:32 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/numbers/7-32.htm">Numbers 7:32  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/numbers/7-32.htm">Numbers 7:32 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/numbers/7-32.htm">Numbers 7:32 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/numbers/7-32.htm">Numbers 7:32 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/numbers/7-32.htm">Numbers 7:32 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/numbers/7-32.htm">OT Law: Numbers 7:32 One golden ladle of ten shekels full (Nu Num.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/numbers/7-31.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Numbers 7:31"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 7:31" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/numbers/7-33.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Numbers 7:33"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 7:33" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
