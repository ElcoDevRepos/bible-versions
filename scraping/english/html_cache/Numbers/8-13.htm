Aaron and his sons were the appointed priests, and the Levites were set apart to assist them. This structure emphasizes the order and hierarchy established by God for worship and service. The Levites' standing before Aaron signifies their dedication and readiness to serve. This mirrors the New Testament concept of the church body, where different roles and gifts are given for the edification of the whole (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-31</a>).<p><b>and then present them before the LORD</b><br>Presenting the Levites before the LORD signifies their consecration and dedication to God's service. This act of presentation is a formal acknowledgment of their role and responsibility. It parallels the New Testament teaching of presenting oneself as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). The Levites' presentation before the LORD also foreshadows the ultimate presentation of believers before God through Christ, who is our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>as a wave offering</b><br>The wave offering was a symbolic act of dedication and consecration. In the context of the Levites, it signifies their being set apart for God's service. The wave offering involved a physical motion of waving, symbolizing the offering being presented to God and then returned for use in His service. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who was offered up for our sins and now serves as our eternal High Priest. The wave offering also connects to the idea of believers being set apart for God's purposes, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, where Christians are described as a royal priesthood.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel set apart for religious duties and service in the Tabernacle.
