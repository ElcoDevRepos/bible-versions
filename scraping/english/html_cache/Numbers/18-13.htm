It signifies the initial yield of the harvest, which is offered to God as an acknowledgment of His provision and sovereignty. This practice is first mentioned in <a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a> and is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament. The offering of firstfruits was a way for the Israelites to express gratitude and trust in God for future harvests. It also served as a reminder of God's deliverance and provision, as seen in the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost), which celebrated the firstfruits of the wheat harvest.<p><b>that they bring to the LORD</b><br>The act of bringing the firstfruits to the LORD was a form of worship and obedience. It was a tangible expression of faith, recognizing that all blessings come from God. This offering was brought to the tabernacle, and later the temple, as a sacred act. The requirement to bring the firstfruits to God underscores the principle of giving the best and the first to Him, a theme that resonates throughout Scripture, including in <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>.<p><b>will belong to you</b><br>This phrase indicates that the firstfruits, once offered to God, were given to the priests as their portion. The tribe of Levi, to which the priests belonged, did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes. Instead, God provided for them through the offerings and tithes of the people (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>). This provision highlights the special role of the priests as mediators between God and the people, and it underscores the principle of supporting those who serve in ministry.<p><b>Every ceremonially clean person in your household may eat them</b><br>The stipulation that only ceremonially clean persons could partake of the firstfruits emphasizes the importance of purity and holiness in approaching the sacred. Ceremonial cleanliness was a significant aspect of the Mosaic Law, with various regulations outlined in Leviticus. This requirement ensured that those who participated in consuming the offerings were in a state of ritual purity, reflecting the holiness of God. The inclusion of the priest's household in this provision illustrates the communal aspect of worship and the shared blessings of serving in God's presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who establishes the laws and ordinances for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron_and_his_sons.htm">Aaron and His Sons (Priests)</a></b><br>The recipients of the firstfruits, representing the priestly class who serve in the tabernacle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who are commanded to bring the firstfruits to the LORD.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tabernacle.htm">The Tabernacle</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God among His people, where the offerings are brought.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/firstfruits.htm">Firstfruits</a></b><br>The initial yield of the harvest, symbolizing the dedication of the whole to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_principle_of_firstfruits.htm">The Principle of Firstfruits</a></b><br>The offering of firstfruits is a tangible expression of faith and trust in God's provision.
