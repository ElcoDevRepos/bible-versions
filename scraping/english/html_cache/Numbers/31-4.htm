In the context of <a href="/numbers/31.htm">Numbers 31</a>, God instructs Moses to take vengeance on the Midianites for their role in leading Israel into idolatry and immorality (Numbers 25). The concept of holy war is present here, where the battle is seen as an act of divine justice. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israel, where God directly governs and commands His people. The battle against the Midianites is not just a physical conflict but a spiritual one, emphasizing the need for purity and obedience to God.<p><b>a thousand men</b><br>The specific number of men, a thousand from each tribe, suggests a well-organized and proportional response. This number indicates a significant force, yet it is not the entire army, showing reliance on God's power rather than sheer numbers. The use of a thousand men from each tribe ensures that the entire nation is involved and shares in the responsibility and outcome of the battle. This can be seen as a precursor to the unity and collective responsibility emphasized in the New Testament, where the body of Christ works together for a common purpose (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<p><b>from each tribe of Israel</b><br>The inclusion of men from each tribe underscores the unity and collective identity of the Israelites as God's chosen people. Each tribe's participation signifies their shared covenant with God and mutual accountability. This reflects the broader biblical theme of unity among God's people, as seen in the New Testament church, where believers from diverse backgrounds are united in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). The tribal system also highlights the organizational structure of ancient Israel, which was both familial and political, with each tribe having its own leaders and land allotments.<div

class="vheading2">What Does Numbers 31:4 Mean</div><b>Send into battle</b><p>&#8226; The word &#8220;Send&#8221; points to a direct, divinely-authorized command. Moses is acting on the LORD&#8217;s explicit instruction given in <a href="/numbers/31-2.htm">Numbers 31:2</a>, &#8220;Avenge the Israelites on the Midianites.&#8221; Obedience is not optional (cf. <a href="/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9-11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/20-1.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Into battle&#8221; underlines that this is holy war, not aggression for personal gain. The campaign avenges Midian&#8217;s seduction of Israel at Peor (<a href="/numbers/25-16.htm">Numbers 25:16-18</a>). God&#8217;s honor and Israel&#8217;s purity are at stake (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-47</a>).<p>&#8226; The LORD Himself guarantees victory. &#8220;For the LORD your God is the One who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies, to give you the victory&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>). Israel&#8217;s soldiers trust God&#8217;s promise more than their own strength (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a thousand men</b><p>&#8226; The figure is literal: 1,000 soldiers from each tribe, totaling 12,000 (<a href="/numbers/31-5.htm">Numbers 31:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Proportionately, this is a small detachment from an army that originally numbered over 600,000 fighting men (<a href="/numbers/26-51.htm">Numbers 26:51</a>). God again shows that deliverance does not depend on superior numbers (cf. <a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2-7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>).<p>&#8226; A fixed quota underscores equity and accountability. Every tribe gives the same costly contribution (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The round number also enables orderly logistics and clear record-keeping, themes seen later when David organizes his army by thousands (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-1.htm">1 Chronicles 27:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from each tribe of Israel</b><p>&#8226; No tribe is exempt; all share both the guilt of Peor and the responsibility for cleansing the nation (cf. <a href="/joshua/22-18.htm">Joshua 22:18-20</a>; <a href="/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Unity: twelve tribes fight as one covenant people, foreshadowing the ideal of corporate solidarity in later calls to national repentance (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-1.htm">2 Chronicles 30:1-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Representation: each tribe&#8217;s participation testifies that the LORD rules the whole nation, not a favored subset (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-4.htm">Deuteronomy 33:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Protection: the equal draft prevents resentment. Partial obedience would have undermined morale and dishonored God (cf. <a href="/numbers/32-6.htm">Numbers 32:6-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/31-4.htm">Numbers 31:4</a> records God&#8217;s orderly, equitable, and decisive call to arms: &#8220;Send into battle a thousand men from each tribe of Israel.&#8221; The verse highlights divine command, measured commitment, and united obedience. Twelve thousand duly appointed soldiers march, confident that the LORD fights for them, assuring both judgment on Midian and preservation of Israel&#8217;s holiness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/31-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Send</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(ti&#353;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7971.htm">Strong's 7971: </a> </span><span class="str2">To send away, for, out</span><br /><br /><span class="word">into battle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#7779;&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124; Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6635.htm">Strong's 6635: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mass of persons, reg, organized for, war, a campaign</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a thousand men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1434;&#1500;&#1462;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;lep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_505.htm">Strong's 505: </a> </span><span class="str2">A thousand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from each</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1465;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">tribe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4294.htm">Strong's 4294: </a> </span><span class="str2">A staff, rod, shaft, branch, a tribe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel.&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1428;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/numbers/31-4.htm">Numbers 31:4 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/numbers/31-4.htm">Numbers 31:4 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/numbers/31-4.htm">Numbers 31:4 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/numbers/31-4.htm">Numbers 31:4 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/numbers/31-4.htm">Numbers 31:4 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/numbers/31-4.htm">Numbers 31:4  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/numbers/31-4.htm">Numbers 31:4 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/numbers/31-4.htm">Numbers 31:4 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/numbers/31-4.htm">Numbers 31:4 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/numbers/31-4.htm">Numbers 31:4 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/numbers/31-4.htm">OT Law: Numbers 31:4 Of every tribe one thousand throughout all (Nu Num.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/numbers/31-3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Numbers 31:3"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Numbers 31:3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/numbers/31-5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Numbers 31:5"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Numbers 31:5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
