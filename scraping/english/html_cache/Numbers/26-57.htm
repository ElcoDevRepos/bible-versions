Unlike other tribes, they were not given a specific territorial inheritance in the Promised Land but were distributed among the other tribes to perform their priestly functions. This census of the Levites, separate from the general census of the Israelites, underscores their unique role and responsibilities. The Levites' duties included maintaining the Tabernacle, assisting the priests, and teaching the Law. Their separation for service is a type of the believer's call to be set apart for God's purposes.<p><b>The Gershonite clan from Gershon:</b><br>The Gershonites were one of the three main divisions of the Levites, descending from Gershon, the eldest son of Levi. Their responsibilities included the care of the Tabernacle's curtains, coverings, and hangings. This role highlights the importance of maintaining the sacred space where God dwelt among His people. The Gershonites' service can be seen as a type of the believer's role in maintaining the purity and sanctity of the Church, the spiritual dwelling place of God.<p><b>The Kohathite clan from Kohath:</b><br>The Kohathites, descendants of Kohath, the second son of Levi, were tasked with the care of the most sacred objects of the Tabernacle, including the Ark of the Covenant, the table, the lampstand, and the altars. Their duties required them to carry these holy items on their shoulders during the Israelites' journeys, emphasizing the reverence and care required in handling sacred things. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who bears the weight of our sins and intercedes for us as our High Priest.<p><b>And the Merarite clan from Merari:</b><br>The Merarites, descendants of Merari, the third son of Levi, were responsible for the structural elements of the Tabernacle, such as the frames, bars, pillars, and bases. Their work was foundational, ensuring the stability and integrity of the Tabernacle. This role can be likened to the foundational teachings of the apostles and prophets, with Christ as the cornerstone, upon which the Church is built. The Merarites' service underscores the importance of a strong foundation in faith and doctrine.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levites.htm">Levites</a></b><br>A tribe set apart for religious duties and service to the Tabernacle, distinct from the other tribes of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gershon.htm">Gershon</a></b><br>The first son of Levi, whose descendants, the Gershonites, were responsible for the care of the tabernacle's curtains and coverings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/kohath.htm">Kohath</a></b><br>The second son of Levi, whose descendants, the Kohathites, were tasked with the care of the sanctuary's most sacred objects.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/merari.htm">Merari</a></b><br>The third son of Levi, whose descendants, the Merarites, were responsible for the framework and structural components of the tabernacle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/clans.htm">Clans</a></b><br>The subdivisions within the tribe of Levi, each with specific roles and responsibilities in the service of the tabernacle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_service.htm">The Importance of Service</a></b><br>The Levites were set apart for service to God, reminding us of the importance of dedicating our lives to serving Him in whatever capacity He calls us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/diversity_of_roles.htm">Diversity of Roles</a></b><br>Just as the Levite clans had different responsibilities, God assigns diverse roles within the body of Christ.
