This interaction highlights the tension between the Moabites and the Israelites, who were encamped nearby. Balaam's reputation as a seer was known, and Balak sought his services to curse Israel. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern belief in the power of spoken blessings and curses.<p><b>&#8220;If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold</b><br>Balaam emphasizes the magnitude of the bribe by mentioning a house full of silver and gold. This hyperbolic statement underscores the wealth Balak was willing to offer, reflecting the high stakes involved. In the ancient world, wealth was often measured in precious metals, and such a statement indicates the seriousness of Balak's request.<p><b>I could not do anything small or great</b><br>Balaam acknowledges his limitations, indicating that his abilities are not autonomous but subject to divine authority. This phrase suggests that Balaam recognizes a higher power governing his actions, which is significant given his role as a pagan prophet. It also implies that no matter the size of the task, he is bound by divine constraints.<p><b>to go beyond the command of the LORD my God</b><br>Here, Balaam refers to the LORD (Yahweh) as "my God," which is notable given his non-Israelite background. This suggests a recognition of Yahweh's supreme authority, even over other deities. The phrase underscores the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and the futility of opposing His will. It also foreshadows the eventual blessing of Israel, despite Balak's intentions. This acknowledgment of divine command aligns with the broader biblical narrative of God's control over all nations and peoples.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam.htm">Balaam</a></b><br>A non-Israelite prophet known for his ability to bless or curse, who is approached by Balak to curse Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/balak.htm">Balak</a></b><br>The king of Moab who fears the Israelites and seeks Balaam's help to curse them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>The region ruled by Balak, located east of the Dead Sea, where the Israelites camped during their journey to the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who communicates His will to Balaam, emphasizing His sovereignty and authority.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servants_of_balak.htm">The Servants of Balak</a></b><br>Messengers sent by Balak to persuade Balaam to curse the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_command.htm">Obedience to God's Command</a></b><br>Balaam's response highlights the importance of adhering strictly to God's commands, regardless of external pressures or temptations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_temptation_of_wealth.htm">The Temptation of Wealth</a></b><br>Balaam's mention of silver and gold serves as a reminder of the seductive power of material wealth and the need to prioritize God's will over financial gain.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The passage underscores God's ultimate authority and control over all situations, including the intentions of those who oppose His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_leadership.htm">Integrity in Leadership</a></b><br>Balaam's initial stance reflects the necessity for leaders to maintain integrity and not be swayed by personal gain or the influence of others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_compromise.htm">The Danger of Compromise</a></b><br>Balaam's account warns against the dangers of compromising one's faith and values for personal benefit or acceptance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Numbers_22_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Numbers 22:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Numbers_22_18_God_s_will_vs_personal_gain.htm">How does Numbers 22:18 teach us to prioritize God's commands over personal gain?

The verse thus exposes the tension between lip service and lasting obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/22-18.htm">Numbers 22:18</a> shows Balaam momentarily articulating a noble truth: no earthly reward justifies disobeying God.
