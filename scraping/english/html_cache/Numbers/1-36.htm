Benjamin's descendants played a significant role in Israel's history, with notable figures such as King Saul and the Apostle Paul. The tribe was known for its warriors and was strategically located between the tribes of Judah and Ephraim.<p><b>according to the records of their clans and families</b><br>The Israelites maintained detailed genealogical records, which were crucial for tribal identity and inheritance rights. These records ensured that each tribe's lineage was preserved, reflecting the importance of family and clan structures in ancient Israelite society. This practice also highlights the meticulous nature of the census described in Numbers.<p><b>counting the names of all those</b><br>The act of counting names signifies the importance of each individual within the community. In biblical times, names held significant meaning and were often reflective of personal or familial characteristics. This enumeration underscores the value placed on each member of the tribe as part of the collective whole.<p><b>twenty years of age or older</b><br>The age of twenty was considered the age of maturity and responsibility in ancient Israel. It was the age at which men were eligible for military service, reflecting the societal expectation for young men to contribute to the defense and welfare of the nation. This age requirement is consistent throughout the Pentateuch for those eligible for warfare.<p><b>who could serve in the army</b><br>Military service was a critical aspect of Israelite society, as the nation often faced threats from surrounding peoples. The ability to serve in the army was not only a duty but also a mark of honor and readiness to protect one's family and land.
