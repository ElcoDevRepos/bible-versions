Instead, Balaam delivers a series of oracles that bless Israel. Here, Balaam turns his attention to Amalek, a perennial enemy of Israel. The act of "lifting up an oracle" signifies a divinely inspired message, often carrying significant weight and authority. Balaam's oracles are unique as they come from a prophet outside of Israel, yet they align with God's purposes for His people.<p><b>&#8220;Amalek was first among the nations,</b><br>The Amalekites were a nomadic tribe, descendants of Esau, and are often considered one of the earliest and most persistent adversaries of Israel. The phrase "first among the nations" can be interpreted as a reference to their early establishment as a formidable people group in the region. Historically, the Amalekites were the first to attack the Israelites after their exodus from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>), marking them as a significant and early enemy.<p><b>but his end is destruction.&#8221;</b><br>This prophecy foretells the ultimate downfall of Amalek. Despite their early prominence, the Amalekites are destined for obliteration. This aligns with God's command to Israel to blot out the memory of Amalek (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>). The fulfillment of this prophecy is seen in the actions of King Saul (1 Samuel 15) and later by King David (1 Samuel 30), culminating in their eventual disappearance from history.

It has been supposed that the Amalekites separated themselves at a very early period from the rest of the Edomites. The word <span class= "ital">reshith, </span>which is here rendered "first," may denote priority in rank, but more frequently denotes priority in time. The corresponding word in the second clause of the verse, aharith (latter end), may be thought to denote that the reference is to time, not to rank. On the other hand, the reference in <a href="/numbers/24-7.htm" title="He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.">Numbers 24:7</a> to the kings of the Amalekites may be urged in favour of the reference to rank. Some understand the allusion to be to the fact that the Amalekites were the first nation which attacked Israel when they had come out of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm" title="Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.">Exodus 17:8</a>). It is possible, however, that there may be a reference both to time and to rank. (Comp. <a href="/amos/6-1.htm" title="Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!">Amos 6:1</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He looked on Amalek.</span> This looking must have been an inward vision, because the haunts of the Amalekites were far away (see on Genesis 36:12; Exodus 17:8; Numbers 14:25, 45). The first of the nations. Amalek was in no sense a leading nation, nor was it a very ancient nation. It was indeed the very first of the nations to attack Israel, but it is a most arbitrary treatment of the words to understand them in that sense. The prophet Amos (<a href="/amos/6-1.htm">Amos 6:1</a>) uses the same expression of the Jewish aristocracy of his day. As it was in no better position than Amalek to claim it in any true sense, we can but suppose that in either case there is a reference to the vainglorious vauntings of the people threatened; it would be quite in keeping with the Bedawin character if Amalek gave himself out be "the first of nations." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/24-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Balaam saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
