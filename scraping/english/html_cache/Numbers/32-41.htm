This connection to Manasseh places Jair within the tribe that settled on the east side of the Jordan River. The tribe of Manasseh was known for its valor and significant role in the conquest of Canaan. Jair's lineage highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the multiplication and settlement of his descendants. The genealogical link to Manasseh also emphasizes the continuity of God's covenant with the patriarchs.<p><b>went and captured their villages</b><br>Jair's military action in capturing the villages demonstrates the ongoing conquest and settlement of the Promised Land by the Israelites. This act of capturing territory is part of the broader narrative of Israel's expansion and establishment in the land God promised to them. The capture of these villages signifies the fulfillment of divine promises and the Israelites' obedience to God's command to take possession of the land. It also reflects the tribal leadership and initiative in securing their inheritance.<p><b>and called them Havvoth-jair</b><br>The naming of the villages as Havvoth-jair, which means "villages of Jair," signifies ownership and the establishment of a legacy. Naming places was a common practice in ancient times, often reflecting personal achievements or divine encounters. This act of naming not only marks the territory as belonging to Jair but also serves as a memorial of his accomplishments. The name Havvoth-jair is mentioned in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a> and <a href="/judges/10-3.htm">Judges 10:3-4</a>, indicating the lasting impact of Jair's actions and the continued recognition of his contribution to Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jair.htm">Jair</a></b><br>A descendant of Manasseh, one of the tribes of Israel.

Jair was, therefore, the great-grandson of Manasseh, and was one of those Israelites who were reckoned as belonging to their maternal tribe.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jair the son of Manasseh.</span> This hero of Manasseh is mentioned here for the first time; in <a href="/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a> his conquests are somewhat more fully described. His genealogy, which is instructive and suggestive, is given here. <p> <p>It will be seen that Segub, the father of Jair, was a Machirite in the female line only. His father Hezron, according to <a href="/1_chronicles/2-21.htm">1 Chronicles 2:21</a>, married the daughter of Manasseh in his old age, when his elder sons were probably already fathers of families. It may probably be conjectured also that Manasseh, who must have inherited exceptional wealth (cf. <a href="/genesis/48-17.htm">Genesis 48:17</a>), and had but one grandson, left a large portion to his grand-daughter, the young wife of Hezron. It was therefore very natural that Segub should have attached himself to the fortunes of his mother's tribe. Is it not also very probable that Machir had other daughters (cf. <a href="/genesis/1-23.htm">Genesis 1:23</a>), who also inherited large portions from their grandfather, and whose husbands were willing enough to enter into a family which had apparently brighter prospects than any others? If so, it would account at once for the existence of a large family of Machirites not descended from Gilead, and not on the most friendly terms with the rest of the tribe. It is quite possible that many of the more adventurous spirits amongst the tribe of Judah joined themselves to a family whose reputation and exploits they might naturally claim as their own (see on Joshua 19:34). <span class="cmt_word">The small towns thereof,</span> or, "their villages."

There does not, however, seem to be anything except the very doubtful analogy of certain German names in favour of the rendering "Jair's lives." It is more likely the corruption of some more ancient name. There is some discrepancy in subsequent references to the Chavvoth-jair. According to <a href="/1_chronicles/2-22.htm">1 Chronicles 2:22</a>, Jair had twenty-three towns in Gilead; from <a href="/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a> it appears that the sons of the later Jair had thirty cities "in the land of Gilead" which went under the name of Chavvoth-jair; while in <a href="/joshua/13-30.htm">Joshua 13:30</a> "all the Chavvoth-jair which are in Bashan" are reckoned at sixty. The plausible, though not wholly satisfactory, explanation is, that the conquests of Nobah came to be subsequently included in those of his more famous contemporary, and the vague name of Chavvoth-jair extended to all the towns in that part of Gilead, and of Bashan too (see notes on the passages cited). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/32-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Jair,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
