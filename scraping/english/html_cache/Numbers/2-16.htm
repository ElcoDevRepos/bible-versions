The tribe of Reuben, along with Simeon and Gad, forms one of the four main divisions of the Israelite encampment. The number 151,450 reflects the census taken in <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>, emphasizing the large size and military capability of this division. This organization highlights the importance of order and structure in the Israelite community, as they prepare for their journey and eventual conquest of the Promised Land. The tribe of Reuben's position in the camp reflects its historical significance as the firstborn, though Reuben lost his birthright due to his transgression (<a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3-4</a>).<p><b>is 151,450;</b><br>The specific number indicates the precision and care with which the Israelites were organized. This figure includes men aged 20 and older who were able to go to war, underscoring the readiness for battle and the importance of each tribe's contribution to the collective strength of Israel. The large number also signifies God's promise to Abraham to make his descendants as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>).<p><b>they shall set out second.</b><br>The order of march is significant, with Reuben's camp following Judah's. This sequence reflects a divinely ordained structure, ensuring that the tribes move in an orderly fashion. The positioning of Reuben second in line may symbolize a restoration of honor despite Reuben's earlier loss of the birthright. This order also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of the first being last and the last being first (<a href="/matthew/19-30.htm">Matthew 19:30</a>), as Reuben, though firstborn, follows Judah, the tribe from which Jesus, the Lion of Judah, would come.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reuben.htm">Reuben</a></b><br>The firstborn son of Jacob and Leah, Reuben is the patriarch of the tribe that bears his name.
