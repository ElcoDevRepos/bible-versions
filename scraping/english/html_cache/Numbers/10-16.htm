The name Eliab means "God is Father," which reflects the theocentric naming conventions of the Israelites. Helon, his father, is not widely mentioned outside of genealogical contexts, indicating that Eliab's prominence is primarily due to his leadership role. The tribe of Zebulun, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Jacob's tenth son with Leah. Eliab's leadership role signifies the importance of family lineage and tribal hierarchy in Israelite society.
