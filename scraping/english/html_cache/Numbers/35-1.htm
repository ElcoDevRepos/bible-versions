Moses is portrayed as a prophet and leader who receives divine instructions, underscoring his unique role in guiding the Israelites. This communication highlights the continuity of God's guidance and the importance of obedience to His commands.<p><b>on the plains of Moab</b><br>The plains of Moab refer to the region east of the Jordan River, opposite Jericho. This area was significant as the final encampment of the Israelites before entering the Promised Land. It was a place of preparation and instruction, where Moses delivered his final teachings and where the Israelites were reminded of their covenant with God.<p><b>by the Jordan</b><br>The Jordan River is a critical geographical marker in the biblical narrative, symbolizing the boundary between the wilderness and the Promised Land. It represents a transition from the period of wandering to the fulfillment of God's promise. The crossing of the Jordan by the Israelites, led by Joshua, is a pivotal event that signifies entering into God's rest and inheritance.<p><b>across from Jericho</b><br>Jericho is one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world and the first city conquered by the Israelites in the Promised Land. Its mention here foreshadows the upcoming conquest and the beginning of the Israelites' settlement in Canaan. Jericho's strategic location made it a key target, and its fall demonstrated God's power and faithfulness in delivering the land to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who is the ultimate authority and lawgiver for the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and guide them through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/plains_of_moab.htm">Plains of Moab</a></b><br>A region east of the Jordan River, where the Israelites camped before entering the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jordan_river.htm">Jordan River</a></b><br>A significant geographical boundary for the Israelites, representing the transition from the wilderness to the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jericho.htm">Jericho</a></b><br>A city located near the Jordan River, known for its fortified walls and the first city conquered by the Israelites in the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_guidance.htm">God's Sovereignty and Guidance</a></b><br>Recognize that God is the ultimate authority in our lives, guiding us through His Word and Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_obedience.htm">Leadership and Obedience</a></b><br>Reflect on Moses' role as a leader who faithfully communicated God's instructions, and consider how we can be obedient to God's calling in our own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_promised_blessings.htm">Preparation for Promised Blessings</a></b><br>Understand that the plains of Moab represent a place of preparation and anticipation for the Israelites, reminding us to prepare our hearts for the blessings God has in store.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/significance_of_boundaries.htm">Significance of Boundaries</a></b><br>The Jordan River symbolizes a boundary between the past and the future.
