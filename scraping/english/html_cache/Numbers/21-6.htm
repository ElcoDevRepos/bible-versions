The sending of venomous snakes, or "fiery serpents," is a direct act of God, demonstrating His sovereignty and justice. The term "fiery" may refer to the burning sensation of the bites or the appearance of the snakes. This event occurs during the Israelites' wilderness journey, a period marked by repeated instances of rebellion and divine discipline. The wilderness itself, likely the region of the Negev or the Arabah, was known for its harsh conditions and dangerous wildlife, including snakes. This incident is a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the seriousness of sin. It also foreshadows the need for a savior, as the Israelites later seek deliverance from the consequences of their actions.<p><b>and many of the Israelites were bitten and died</b><br>The severity of the punishment is highlighted by the fact that many Israelites suffered and perished. This underscores the gravity of their sin and the holiness of God, who cannot tolerate rebellion. The death of many serves as a stark warning to the community about the cost of disobedience. This event is later referenced in the New Testament, specifically in <a href="/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14-15</a>, where Jesus compares His crucifixion to the lifting up of the bronze serpent by Moses, providing a means of salvation for those who believe. The physical death caused by the snake bites symbolizes the spiritual death that results from sin, pointing to the need for redemption and the ultimate sacrifice of Christ for humanity's salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is both just and merciful.

Yet, even here, God is preparing hearts for the saving lift of Christ, proving that His justice and mercy move hand in hand throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And the Lord sent fiery serpents . . . --</span>Hebrew, <span class= "ital">the serpents, the seraphim </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the burning ones). (See <a href="/deuteronomy/8-15.htm" title="Who led you through that great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where there was no water; who brought you forth water out of the rock of flint;">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-29.htm" title="Rejoice not you, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote you is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.">Isaiah 14:29</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-6.htm" title="The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from where come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches on the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures on the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them.">Isaiah 30:6</a>.) The word appears to denote a particular kind of serpent, as in the following verse. Some think that they were so called because of the bright fiery red upon their heads; others because of the blazing sunbeams on their scales; and others because of their inflammatory and poisonous bite. Venomous snakes are said to abound still in the Arabah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fiery serpents,</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. <span class="accented">Nachash</span> is the ordinary word for serpent. The word <span class="accented">saraph</span> which seems to mean "burning one," stands (by itself) for a serpent in verse 8, and also in <a href="/isaiah/14-29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>. In <a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2, 6</a> it stands for one of the symbolic beings (seraphim) of the prophet's vision. The only idea common to the two meanings (otherwise so distinct) must be that of brilliance and metallic luster. It is commonly assumed that the "fiery" serpents were so called because of the burning pain and inflammation caused by the bite, after the analogy of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> of Dioscorus and AElian. But is hardly possible that Isaiah should have used the same word in such wholly dissimilar senses, and it is clear from comparison with Ezekiel's vision of the cherubim (<a href="/ezekiel/1-7.htm">Ezekiel 1:7</a>) that the <span class="accented">saraph</span> of <a href="/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a> was so called from the burnished luster of his appearance. Even our Lord himself is described in the Apocalypse as having in the highest degree this appearance of glowing brass (<a href="/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-18.htm">Revelation 2:18</a>). It is further clear that the <span class="accented">saraph</span> was so named from his colour, not his venom, because when Moses was ordered to make a <span class="accented">saraph</span> he made a serpent of brass (or rather copper), with the evident intent of imitating as closely as possible the appearance of the venomous reptile. We may conclude then with some confidence that these serpents were of a fiery red colour, resembling in this respect certain very deadly snakes in Australia, which are known as "copper snakes." Travelers speak of some such pests as still abounding in the region of the Arabah, but it is quite uncertain whether the fiery serpents of that special visitation can be identified with any existing species. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/21-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#353;al&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
