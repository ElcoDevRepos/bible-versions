Here, he addresses the "heads of the tribes," indicating a structured leadership within the Israelite community. This reflects the organizational system established by God through Moses, as seen in <a href="/exodus/18.htm">Exodus 18</a> when Jethro advised Moses to appoint leaders over groups of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. The heads of the tribes were responsible for conveying God's commands to their respective tribes, ensuring that the entire nation adhered to the covenant. This hierarchical structure is significant in maintaining order and accountability among the Israelites.<p><b>&#8220;This is what the LORD has commanded:</b><br>The phrase underscores the divine origin of the instructions that follow. It emphasizes that the commands are not from Moses himself but from the LORD, the covenant God of Israel. This divine authority is crucial, as it demands obedience from the Israelites. The use of "commanded" indicates a non-negotiable directive, reflecting the covenant relationship where God sets the terms. This is consistent with the broader biblical narrative where God's commands are given for the well-being and holiness of His people, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-24.htm">Deuteronomy 6:24</a>. The emphasis on divine command also prefigures the authority of Christ, who speaks with the authority of God in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/matthew/7-29.htm">Matthew 7:29</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His laws and commandments to the people.

It would appear upon the lace of it that we have in <a href="/leviticus/27.htm">Leviticus 27</a>, and in this chapter two fragments of Mosaic legislation dealing with the same subject, but, for some reason which it is useless to attempt to discover, widely separated in the inspired record. Nor does there seem to be any valid reason for explaining away the apparently fragmentary and dislocated character of these two sections (see the Introduction). The statement, peculiar to this passage, that these instructions were issued to the "heads of the tribes" itself serves to differentiate it from all the rest of the "statutes" given by Moses, and suggests that this chapter was inserted either by some other hand or from a different source. There is no reason whatever for supposing that the "heads of the tribes" were more interested in these particular regulations than in many others which concerned the social life of the people (such as that treated of in <a href="/numbers/5-5.htm">Numbers 5:5-31</a>) which were declared in the ordinary way unto "the children of Israel" at large. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/numbers/30-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
