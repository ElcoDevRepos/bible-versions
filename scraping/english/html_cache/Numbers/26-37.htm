The tribe of Ephraim held a significant position among the tribes of Israel, often representing the northern kingdom in later biblical history. The blessing of Jacob in <a href="/genesis/48-19.htm">Genesis 48:19</a> foretold that Ephraim would become a multitude of nations, indicating the tribe's future prominence. The tribe's land allocation in Canaan was central, which played a crucial role in Israel's history.<p><b>and their registration numbered 32,500.</b><br>This census was conducted in the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, as part of the preparation for entering the Promised Land. The number 32,500 reflects a decrease from the previous census in <a href="/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a>, where Ephraim had 40,500 men. This decrease could be attributed to various factors, including the consequences of disobedience and the wilderness wanderings. The census was essential for military and organizational purposes as Israel prepared to conquer Canaan.<p><b>These clans were the descendants of Joseph.</b><br>Joseph, one of the patriarchs, was sold into slavery by his brothers but rose to power in Egypt, ultimately saving his family during a famine. His sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, were adopted by Jacob and given equal status with Jacob's own sons, effectively granting Joseph a double portion of inheritance. This act fulfilled Jacob's blessing and prophecy in <a href="/genesis/48-5.htm">Genesis 48:5-6</a>. Joseph's life is often seen as a type of Christ, with parallels such as betrayal, suffering, and eventual exaltation, which prefigure the life and mission of Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>One of the tribes of Israel, descended from Joseph's son Ephraim.
