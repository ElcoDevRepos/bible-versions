Moses, chosen by God to lead His people, is a prophet and lawgiver, while Aaron, his brother, serves as the first high priest. Their leadership roles are divinely appointed, emphasizing the importance of obedience to God's commands. This partnership reflects the dual roles of leadership and priesthood, which are later fulfilled in Jesus Christ as both King and High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>took these men</b><br>The act of taking these men signifies the beginning of a formal process of organization among the tribes of Israel. This is a preparatory step for the census, which is crucial for establishing the military and social structure of the nation. The selection of leaders from each tribe underscores the importance of order and governance in the community, reflecting God's desire for structure and accountability among His people.<p><b>who had been designated by name</b><br>The designation by name indicates a personal and specific choice, highlighting the importance of individual responsibility and calling within the community. This mirrors the biblical theme of God knowing His people by name (<a href="/isaiah/43.htm">Isaiah 43:1</a>), emphasizing His intimate knowledge and care for each person. The chosen men represent their respective tribes, ensuring that each tribe has a voice and a role in the collective journey and mission of Israel. This foreshadows the New Testament concept of the body of Christ, where each member has a unique function and purpose (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
