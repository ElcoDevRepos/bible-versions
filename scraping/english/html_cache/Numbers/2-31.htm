The number 157,600 represents the men of military age, twenty years and older, who were able to go to war. This large number indicates the significant size and strength of the tribe, making it the largest of the four camps. The census was a way to organize the Israelites for their journey and battles, reflecting God's order and provision. The tribe of Dan was known for its later idolatry (Judges 18), but here it is part of the organized people of God. The large number also signifies God's promise to Abraham of numerous descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>).<p><b>they shall set out last,</b><br>The positioning of the camp of Dan as the rear guard during the Israelites' journey through the wilderness was strategic. As the last to set out, they protected the rear of the formation, ensuring that no stragglers were left behind and that the camp was secure from attacks from behind. This role highlights the importance of each tribe's position and function within the community. The concept of a rear guard is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/52-12.htm">Isaiah 52:12</a>, where God promises to be Israel's rear guard, symbolizing protection and security.<p><b>under their standards.</b><br>Each tribe had its own standard or banner, which served as a rallying point and symbol of identity. The standards helped maintain order during travel and encampment. The use of standards reflects the military organization of the tribes and their unity under God's leadership. In a broader biblical context, standards can symbolize God's presence and guidance, as seen in the banner of love in <a href="/songs/2-4.htm">Song of Solomon 2:4</a>. The standards also foreshadow the gathering of God's people under the banner of Christ, who is the ultimate leader and protector of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/dan.htm">Dan</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Dan, the fifth son of Jacob and Bilhah.

When combined with Asher&#8217;s 41,500 and Naphtali&#8217;s 53,400 (<a href="/numbers/1-41.htm">Numbers 1:41-43</a>), the grand total emerges.<p>- <a href="/genesis/49-16.htm">Genesis 49:16&#8211;18</a> foretold Dan&#8217;s role among the tribes; now his descendants lead a full division, showing the fulfillment of God&#8217;s promise to Jacob&#8217;s sons.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is 157,600</b><p>- The precision underscores God&#8217;s intimate knowledge of His people.

This &#8220;rear guard&#8221; position protected stragglers, supplies, and the sanctuary furnishings in transition.<p>- God&#8217;s arrangement anticipates dangers: Amalek once attacked Israel&#8217;s rear (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-18</a>).
