In the context of <a href="/numbers/18.htm">Numbers 18</a>, God is instructing the Levites on how their portion of the offerings from the Israelites is to be considered. The Levites, who did not receive a land inheritance like the other tribes, were supported through the tithes and offerings of the people. This reflects the principle of stewardship and the idea that God sees and values the contributions of His people. It also connects to the New Testament teaching in <a href="/philippians/4-17.htm">Philippians 4:17</a>, where Paul speaks of the fruit that increases to the account of the giver.<p><b>as grain from the threshing floor</b><br>The threshing floor was a place where harvested grain was separated from the chaff. This imagery is significant in the agricultural society of ancient Israel, where grain was a staple food and a symbol of sustenance and provision. The offering being likened to grain suggests that it is a necessary and valuable contribution, essential for the sustenance of the Levites. This also foreshadows the spiritual harvest mentioned in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37-38</a>, where Jesus speaks of the plentiful harvest and the need for laborers.<p><b>or juice from the winepress</b><br>The winepress was used to extract juice from grapes, which was then fermented into wine, a common beverage in biblical times. Wine is often associated with joy and celebration in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a> and <a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1-11</a>, where Jesus performs His first miracle at the wedding in Cana. The comparison of the offering to juice from the winepress suggests that the contributions of the Israelites were not only necessary but also a source of joy and blessing. This imagery can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the true vine (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1</a>) and whose blood, symbolized by wine, is poured out for the salvation of many (<a href="/matthew/26-27.htm">Matthew 26:27-28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levites.htm">The Levites</a></b><br>A tribe set apart for religious duties and service in the Tabernacle.
