Oboth is mentioned as a station in the wilderness, and its exact location is uncertain, though it is believed to be in the region east of the Dead Sea. This movement signifies the continued fulfillment of God's promise to lead His people to the Promised Land. The journey from Oboth reflects the transient nature of the Israelites' travels, emphasizing their reliance on God's guidance and provision.<p><b>and camped at Iye-abarim</b><br>Iye-abarim, meaning "ruins of Abarim," is located on the eastern side of the Jordan River. The name suggests a place of desolation or ruins, which may indicate a historical or archaeological significance. This location is part of the Abarim mountain range, which holds importance in Israel's journey as it is near where Moses would later view the Promised Land before his death. The encampment at Iye-abarim represents a step closer to the fulfillment of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>on the border of Moab</b><br>The mention of Moab situates the Israelites geographically and culturally. Moab was a neighboring nation descended from Lot, Abraham's nephew. The relationship between Israel and Moab was complex, involving both conflict and kinship. This border location highlights the Israelites' proximity to the Promised Land and foreshadows future interactions with the Moabites, including the story of Balaam and the eventual conquest of Canaan. The border of Moab also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to fulfill His promises despite external challenges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/oboth.htm">Oboth</a></b><br>A location where the Israelites camped during their wilderness journey.
