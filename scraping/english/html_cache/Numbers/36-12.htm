The daughters of Zelophehad, who were from the tribe of Manasseh, were instructed to marry within their own tribe to ensure that their inheritance would not be transferred to another tribe. This reflects the broader biblical principle of preserving the land allocations given to each tribe as described in <a href="/numbers/27.htm">Numbers 27:1-11</a>. Manasseh, being one of the sons of Joseph, was one of the half-tribes that received a portion of land on both sides of the Jordan River, emphasizing the significance of land inheritance in Israelite society. This also underscores the patriarchal structure of ancient Israel, where lineage and inheritance were passed through the male line.<p><b>and their inheritance remained within the tribe of their father&#8217;s clan</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the legal and cultural mechanisms in place to ensure that land inheritance remained within the original tribal allotments. The preservation of tribal boundaries was crucial for maintaining the identity and stability of the Israelite tribes. This principle is echoed in <a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23-28</a>, where the land is described as belonging to God, and the Israelites are merely stewards. The inheritance laws served to prevent the permanent loss of family land, which was a vital economic resource. This also foreshadows the New Testament concept of spiritual inheritance, where believers are co-heirs with Christ (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>), emphasizing the permanence and security of God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_daughters_of_zelophehad.htm">The Daughters of Zelophehad</a></b><br>These women were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah, daughters of Zelophehad, who belonged to the tribe of Manasseh.
