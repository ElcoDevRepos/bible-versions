The censer, a vessel for burning incense, symbolizes prayer and intercession (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>). This act of taking the censer signifies Aaron's role as high priest, mediating between God and the Israelites. The use of incense in worship was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures, representing the prayers of the people rising to God.<p><b>and ran into the midst of the assembly</b><br>Aaron's urgency in running into the assembly underscores the severity of the situation. The assembly refers to the congregation of Israel, who were gathered and affected by the plague. This action demonstrates Aaron's compassion and dedication to his priestly duties, risking his own life to save others. It also reflects the immediacy required in addressing sin and its consequences.<p><b>And seeing that the plague had begun among the people</b><br>The plague was a direct result of the rebellion against Moses and Aaron, as described earlier in <a href="/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>. This divine judgment served as a warning against disobedience and rebellion against God's chosen leaders. Plagues were often used in the Bible as instruments of God's judgment (Exodus 7-12). The beginning of the plague signifies the swift and serious nature of God's response to sin.<p><b>he offered the incense and made atonement for the people</b><br>Offering incense was an act of intercession, symbolizing the prayers for mercy and forgiveness. Atonement involves reconciliation between God and humanity, often through a sacrificial act. Aaron's actions prefigure the ultimate atonement made by Jesus Christ, who intercedes on behalf of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). This act of atonement highlights the necessity of a mediator to bridge the gap caused by sin, pointing to the sacrificial system that culminates in Christ's sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/aaron.htm">Aaron</a></b><br>The brother of Moses and the first high priest of Israel.
