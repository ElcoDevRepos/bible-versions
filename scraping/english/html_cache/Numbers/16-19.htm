This act of defiance is rooted in pride and a desire for power, reflecting a broader theme of rebellion against God's appointed leaders. The assembly included 250 leaders, indicating significant support and influence. This event highlights the dangers of dissent and the importance of respecting divinely established authority. The rebellion is a reminder of the consequences of challenging God's order, as seen in other biblical accounts such as the rebellion of Absalom against David.<p><b>at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><br>The Tent of Meeting, or Tabernacle, was the central place of worship and the dwelling place of God's presence among the Israelites. It was a sacred space where God communicated with Moses. The choice of this location for the confrontation underscores the gravity of Korah's rebellion, as it was not just a challenge to Moses and Aaron but an affront to God Himself. The Tent of Meeting symbolizes God's covenant and His desire to dwell with His people, making this rebellion a direct challenge to God's authority and presence.<p><b>the glory of the LORD appeared</b><br>The glory of the LORD, often associated with a visible manifestation of God's presence, signifies divine intervention. In the Old Testament, God's glory is frequently depicted as a cloud or fire, representing His holiness and power. This appearance serves as a divine response to the rebellion, emphasizing that God Himself will address the challenge to His appointed leaders. The glory of the LORD is a recurring theme, seen in the Exodus narrative and the dedication of Solomon's Temple, symbolizing God's approval and presence.<p><b>to the whole congregation</b><br>The entire congregation of Israel witnessed the appearance of God's glory, underscoring the public nature of this divine intervention. This event served as a powerful reminder to the Israelites of God's sovereignty and the seriousness of rebellion against His chosen leaders. The collective witness of the congregation reinforces the lesson that God's authority is supreme and that His presence is both a source of guidance and judgment. This public demonstration parallels other instances where God acts decisively in the sight of His people, such as the giving of the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/korah.htm">Korah</a></b><br>A Levite who led a rebellion against Moses and Aaron, challenging their leadership and the priesthood.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_aaron.htm">Moses and Aaron</a></b><br>The appointed leaders of Israel, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tent_of_meeting.htm">The Tent of Meeting</a></b><br>The sacred place where God met with Moses and the Israelites, symbolizing God's presence among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_glory_of_the_lord.htm">The Glory of the LORD</a></b><br>A manifestation of God's presence, often associated with divine approval or judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_whole_assembly.htm">The Whole Assembly</a></b><br>The congregation of Israel, who were witnesses to the events and the divine intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_god's_appointed_leaders.htm">Respect for God&#8217;s Appointed Leaders</a></b><br>Recognize and respect the authority of those whom God has placed in leadership positions.
