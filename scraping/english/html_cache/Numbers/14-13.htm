This phrase highlights his role as a mediator, similar to how Christ intercedes for believers (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). Moses' dialogue with God reflects a deep relationship and trust, emphasizing the importance of prayer and intercession in leadership.<p><b>The Egyptians will hear of it</b><br>The Egyptians, who had witnessed the plagues and the Exodus, were aware of God's power. This phrase underscores the significance of God's reputation among the nations. It reflects the broader biblical theme of God's actions being a testimony to the world, as seen in <a href="/joshua/2-10.htm">Joshua 2:10-11</a>, where Rahab speaks of the fear of the Lord's deeds spreading among the nations.<p><b>For by Your strength</b><br>This acknowledges God's omnipotence and the miraculous nature of the Exodus. The deliverance from Egypt was not by human effort but by divine intervention, a recurring theme in Scripture that points to God's sovereignty and power, as seen in <a href="/psalms/136-12.htm">Psalm 136:12</a>, which praises God for His mighty hand and outstretched arm.<p><b>You brought this people from among them</b><br>This phrase highlights the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The deliverance from Egypt is a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing salvation and redemption. It prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who brings believers out of the bondage of sin (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13-14</a>).

This is not presumption but covenant responsibility; Moses knows God listens to a faithful mediator (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-18.htm">Deuteronomy 9:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern anticipates later biblical intercessors&#8212;Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/12-23.htm">1 Samuel 12:23</a>) and, ultimately, Christ (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>)&#8212;showing that God welcomes earnest advocacy for His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"The Egyptians will hear of it,</b><p>&#8226; Moses anchors his plea in God&#8217;s public reputation: if Israel perishes, Egypt&#8212;already aware of the ten plagues and Red Sea deliverance (<a href="/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>; 15:14-15)&#8212;will interpret the outcome as divine failure, not judgment.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently ties God&#8217;s actions with His name among the nations (<a href="/joshua/2-10.htm">Joshua 2:10-11</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-46.htm">1 Samuel 17:46</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-9.htm">Ezekiel 20:9</a>). Moses shares God&#8217;s passion that His glory be proclaimed, not maligned.<p>&#8226; Concern for testimony is practical: unbelievers watch the fate of God&#8217;s people.

They may be rendered in accordance with the Authorised Version, or they may be rendered as follows:--<span class= "ital">And Moses said unto the </span>LORD, <span class= "ital">The Egyptians have </span>both<span class= "ital"> heard that thou hast brought up this people from among them by thy might, and they have also told </span>(<span class= "ital">it</span>)<span class= "ital"> to the inhabitants of this land </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the land of Canaan, as in <a href="/numbers/14-3.htm" title="And why has the LORD brought us to this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?">Numbers 14:3</a>); <span class= "ital">they </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Egyptians and the Canaanites) <span class= "ital">have heard that thou </span>LORD <span class= "ital">art in the midst of this people, for thou </span>LORD <span class= "ital">art seen face to face, and thy cloud standeth over them, and thou goest before them, &c. </span>&c. Reference may be made to the following passages in illustration of the argument by which Moses enforced his intercessory prayer on behalf of Israel:--<a href="/context/deuteronomy/32-26.htm" title="I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:">Deuteronomy 32:26-27</a>; <a href="/joshua/7-9.htm" title="For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what will you do to your great name?">Joshua 7:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-9.htm" title="For my name's sake will I defer my anger, and for my praise will I refrain for you, that I cut you not off.">Isaiah 48:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-11.htm" title="For my own sake, even for my own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory to another.">Isaiah 48:11</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/36-22.htm" title="Therefore say to the house of Israel, thus said the Lord GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for my holy name's sake, which you have profaned among the heathen, where you went.">Ezekiel 36:22-23</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Moses said unto the Lord.</span> The words which follow are so confused, and the construction so dislocated, that they afford the strongest evidence that we have here the <span class="accented">ipsissima verba</span> of the mediator, disordered as they were in the moment of utterance by passionate earnestness and an agonizing fear. Had Moses been ever so eloquent, a facility of speech at such a moment would have been alike unnatural and unlovely. What we can see in the words is this: that Moses had no thought for himself, and that it never occurred to him to entertain the tempting offer made to him by God; that he knew God too well, and (if we may say so) cared for God too much, to let him so compromise his honour among the nations, and so thwart his own purposes, without making one effort (however audacious) to turn his wrath aside. We can see that it is (as in <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11, 12</a>, only much more boldly and abruptly) the thought of what the heathen would say which he wishes to thrust upon the Almighty; but we cannot be sure of the right translation of the words. The most literal rendering would seem to be, "Both the Egyptians have heard (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>) that thou broughtest out this people from among them with thy might, and they have told it (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>) to the inhabitants of this land;
