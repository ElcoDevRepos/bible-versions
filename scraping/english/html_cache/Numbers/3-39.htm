The Levites were set apart for special service to God, distinct from the other tribes of Israel. This counting was done at God's command, emphasizing divine authority and the importance of obedience. The Levites were not included in the general census of the Israelites because they had a unique role in the religious life of the nation, serving in the tabernacle and later the temple. This separation underscores the holiness required for those who serve directly in God's presence.<p><b>including all the males a month old or more</b><br>The inclusion of males from one month old indicates the dedication of the Levites from a very young age. This early inclusion signifies the lifelong commitment expected of the Levites in their service to God. It also reflects the cultural and historical context of the time, where lineage and family roles were established early. This practice can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament concept of being set apart for God's service from birth, as seen in the lives of figures like John the Baptist and Timothy.<p><b>was 22,000</b><br>The number 22,000 is significant in that it represents the totality of the Levite males dedicated to service. This number is symbolic of completeness and sufficiency for the tasks assigned to them. In biblical numerology, numbers often have deeper meanings, and while 22,000 is not a commonly symbolic number, it does reflect the organized and structured nature of the Israelite community. The Levites' role as substitutes for the firstborn of Israel (<a href="/numbers/3-12.htm">Numbers 3:12-13</a>) points to the concept of redemption and substitution, themes that are fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate substitute and redeemer for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

Throughout the Pentateuch, Levi is singled out to carry the tabernacle, teach the law, and stand between Israel and wrath (<a href="/exodus/32-26.htm">Exodus 32:26-29</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>). <a href="/bsb/numbers/3.htm">Numbers 3</a> reinforces that distinction by providing the census total first, underscoring that every Levite life belongs to the Lord in a special way. While the other tribes total in the hundreds of thousands (<a href="/bsb/numbers/2.htm">Numbers 2</a>), the Levites are set apart, showing that spiritual service is measured by faithfulness, not mass numbers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that Moses and Aaron counted</b><p>Scripture presents Moses as the prophetic leader and Aaron as the high priest, together modeling authority under God (<a href="/exodus/4-30.htm">Exodus 4:30</a>; <a href="/leviticus/8-1.htm">Leviticus 8:1-6</a>). Their joint counting of the Levites highlights:<p>&#8226; Obedience&#8212;leaders submit to divine instruction rather than personal preference.<p>&#8226; Unity&#8212;prophet and priest work side-by-side, an image later echoed when King David and the priests organize temple worship (<a href="/bsb/1_chronicles/24.htm">1 Chronicles 24</a>).<p>This census is therefore not mere administration; it is spiritual leadership in action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by their clans</b><p><a href="/numbers/3-17.htm">Numbers 3:17-20</a> names Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, the three Levitical families. Counting &#8220;by their clans&#8221; safeguards lineage accuracy, ensures task assignment, and preserves covenant promises passed down through fathers (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-2.htm">Numbers 18:2-6</a>). Family structure undergirds ministry, reminding modern readers that spiritual service often flourishes within stable, God-ordained relationships (cf. <a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the LORD&#8217;s command</b><p>The phrase cements the divine origin of the census (<a href="/numbers/3-16.htm">Numbers 3:16</a>; 9:23). Every tally, tent peg, and travel schedule flows from God&#8217;s directive, not human initiative. Such specificity reflects God&#8217;s holiness and order (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>). Israel obeys because the Lord speaks; revelation governs organization.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>including all the males a month old or more</b><p>Most tribal counts start at age twenty for warriors (<a href="/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a>). Levites, however, are numbered from one month, stressing that their calling precedes physical maturity. The entire male population is holy to God from infancy, paralleling the later presentation of Jesus at forty days (<a href="/luke/2-22.htm">Luke 2:22-24</a>). Redeeming firstborn sons at one month (<a href="/numbers/18-16.htm">Numbers 18:16</a>) foreshadows redemption in Christ, who fulfills every requirement on our behalf (<a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was 22,000</b><p>The final figure matters because God uses it to substitute Levites for Israel&#8217;s firstborn sons (<a href="/numbers/3-40.htm">Numbers 3:40-43</a>). Instead of demanding each family&#8217;s firstborn for sanctuary service, the Lord graciously accepts 22,000 Levites as collective representatives (<a href="/numbers/8-16.htm">Numbers 8:16-18</a>). Any excess firstborn are redeemed with silver, symbolizing that salvation is costly yet provided (<a href="/1_peter/1-18.htm">1 Peter 1:18-19</a>). The exact total underscores God&#8217;s precision: every individual counts, and every life is accounted for in His redemptive plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/numbers/3-39.htm">Numbers 3:39</a> records a precise, divinely ordered census that sets the Levites apart for lifelong service. Their total of 22,000 males from one month upward demonstrates God&#8217;s ownership, the value of faithful leadership, and the principle of substitutionary redemption. In counting the Levites, the Lord is ultimately numbering His servants to foreshadow the greater ministry of Christ, our perfect substitute and High Priest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/numbers/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(39) <span class= "bld">And Aaron . . . --</span>In the Hebrew text the word Aaron has certain marks over it, known as <span class= "ital">puncta extraordinaria, </span>denoting that it is to be regarded as spurious or doubtful. It is omitted in the Samaritan and Syriac versions and in a few MSS. There appears. however, to be no sufficient reason for its rejection from the text.<p><span class= "bld">Twenty and two thousand.</span>--The total of the three several items--viz., 7,500, 8,600, and 6,200--amounts to 22,300. It appears, however, from <a href="/numbers/3-46.htm" title="And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and three score and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which are more than the Levites;">Numbers 3:46</a> that the total is correctly given as 22,000, inasmuch as the number of the firstborn, 22,273, exceeded that of the Levites by 273. It has been suggested that in <a href="/numbers/3-28.htm" title="In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary.">Numbers 3:28</a> we should read <span class= "greekheb">???</span> (<span class= "ital">shalosh</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>three, for <span class= "greekheb">??</span> (<span class= "ital">shesh</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>six--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>8,300 instead of 8,600; or, if the numbers were denoted, as it has been commonly supposed, by the letters of the alphabet, it is quite possible that one letter may have been substituted by the scribe for another. Some suppose that the three hundred were themselves firstborn sons, who had been born since the command to sanctify the firstborn, and that it is on this account that they were not included in the census. (See Bishop Wordsworth's Notes <span class= "ital">in loc., </span>where the reasons which may be assigned for the extreme paucity of this tribe, as compared with the other tribes, are discussed.) The later census, which also included the children from a month old and upwards, shows but a very small increase in the number of this tribe, the number on that occasion amounting only to 23,000 (<a href="/numbers/26-62.htm" title="And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand, all males from a month old and upward: for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.">Numbers 26:62</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/numbers/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Twenty and two thousand.</span> It is obvious that there is a discrepancy between this total and its three component numbers, which make 22,300. It is so obvious that it must have been innocent; no one deliberately falsifying or forging would have left so palpable a discrepancy on the face of the narrative. It may, therefore, have arisen from an error in transcription (the alteration of a single letter would suffice); or it may be due <span class="cmt_word">to</span> the fact that, for some reason not stated, 300 were struck off the Levitical total for the purpose of this census. Such a reason was found by the Hebrew expositors, and has been accepted by some moderns, in the fact that the Levites were taken and counted instead of the first-born, and that, therefore, their own first-born would have to he excluded. There is nothing to be said against this explanation, except that no trace of it appears in a narrative otherwise very full and minute.
