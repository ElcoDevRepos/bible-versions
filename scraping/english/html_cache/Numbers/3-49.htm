The redemption money was a form of compensation for the excess number of firstborn Israelites over the Levites. This act of collecting redemption money highlights the principle of substitution and redemption, which is a recurring theme in the Bible. It foreshadows the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who paid the price for humanity's sins. The concept of redemption is deeply rooted in the sacrificial system established in the Old Testament, pointing to the need for a mediator between God and man.<p><b>from those in excess of the number redeemed by the Levites.</b><br>The Levites were counted separately from the rest of the Israelites and were dedicated to God&#8217;s service, replacing the firstborn sons of Israel. The "excess" refers to the number of firstborn Israelites that exceeded the number of Levites. This required a monetary redemption for each additional firstborn, emphasizing the importance of precise obedience to God's commands. This practice underscores the meticulous nature of the law and the need for atonement, which is fulfilled in the New Testament through Christ's sacrifice. The redemption money served as a tangible reminder of God's provision and the Israelites' obligation to follow His statutes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.
