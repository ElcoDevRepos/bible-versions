The carts and oxen were offerings from the leaders of Israel, as described earlier in the chapter. These offerings were practical gifts intended to assist the Levites in their duties related to the tabernacle. The use of carts and oxen highlights the logistical needs of transporting the tabernacle and its furnishings through the wilderness. This reflects the nomadic lifestyle of the Israelites during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. The provision of these resources underscores God's provision and the communal responsibility of the tribes to support the Levites, who had no inheritance of land.<p><b>and gave them to the Levites</b><br>The Levites were set apart for the service of the tabernacle, and their role was crucial in maintaining the spiritual life of the Israelite community. By distributing the carts and oxen to the Levites, Moses ensures that they have the necessary means to fulfill their duties. This act of giving also symbolizes the support and cooperation among the tribes of Israel, as the Levites were dependent on the other tribes for their sustenance and resources. The Levites' service prefigures the role of Christ as the ultimate High Priest, who mediates between God and humanity. The distribution of resources to the Levites can also be seen as a type of the church's support for its ministers and workers, emphasizing the importance of providing for those dedicated to spiritual service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

Compare <a href="/exodus/39-43.htm">Exodus 39:43</a>; &#8220;Moses inspected the work&#8230; just as the LORD had commanded, so Moses blessed them.&#8221;<p>- Obedience always follows revelation in Scripture; hearing without doing is never an option (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Moses took</b><p>- Moses, as covenant mediator, personally receives the gift.
