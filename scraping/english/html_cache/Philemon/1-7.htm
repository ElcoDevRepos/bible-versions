This reflects the Christian principle of mutual edification within the body of Christ, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-12.htm">Romans 1:12</a>, where believers are encouraged to build each other up. The love mentioned here is agape love, a selfless, sacrificial love that is central to Christian teaching, as exemplified by Christ's love for humanity (<a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>).<p><b>because you, brother</b><br>The term "brother" signifies the familial relationship among Christians, transcending social and cultural boundaries. This reflects the early church's practice of viewing fellow believers as family, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-47</a>, where the community of believers shared everything in common. It also emphasizes the equality and unity among believers, regardless of their social status, which is a recurring theme in Paul's letters (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>have refreshed the hearts of the saints</b><br>Philemon's actions have brought spiritual renewal and comfort to fellow believers, akin to providing rest and relief. This mirrors the concept of hospitality and support within the early Christian communities, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>, where believers are encouraged to show hospitality to strangers. The term "saints" refers to all Christians, indicating that Philemon's influence extends beyond his immediate circle, contributing to the broader mission of the church. This aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized serving others as a reflection of one's faith (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philemon.htm">Philemon</a></b><br>A Christian leader in Colossae, likely a wealthy man who hosted a church in his home.

Joy is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>), and here it springs from seeing God&#8217;s grace at work in another believer. Similar rejoicing appears in <a href="/philippians/1-4.htm">Philippians 1:4</a> where Paul prays &#8220;with joy for all of you,&#8221; and in 3 <a href="/bsb/john/4.htm">John 4</a>: &#8220;I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.&#8221; Paul&#8217;s delight is not rooted in circumstances but in the evidence of Christ&#8217;s love flowing through Philemon.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and encouragement</b><p>Paul adds that he is also &#8220;encouraged&#8221; (comforted, strengthened). Encouragement is a gift believers share to build each other up (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:11</a>). In <a href="/2_corinthians/1-4.htm">2 Corinthians 1:4&#8211;7</a> Paul speaks of God &#8220;who comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort those in any trouble.&#8221; Hearing of Philemon&#8217;s faithfulness lifts Paul&#8217;s spirit while he is in chains, reminding him that the gospel is still bearing fruit (<a href="/colossians/1-6.htm">Colossians 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in your love</b><p>Philemon&#8217;s love is the cause of Paul&#8217;s joy and encouragement.

Spiritual kinship cuts across social status; though Paul is an apostle and Philemon a wealthy householder, they stand on equal footing before the Lord (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). Calling him &#8220;brother&#8221; prepares the ground for Paul&#8217;s later appeal to receive Onesimus no longer as a slave but &#8220;more than a slave&#8212;a beloved brother&#8221; (<a href="/bsb/philemon/1.htm">Philemon 16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>have refreshed the hearts of the saints</b><p>&#8220;Refreshed&#8221; pictures rest for weary souls. Jesus invites, &#8220;Come to Me&#8230; and I will give you rest&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>). Philemon becomes the Lord&#8217;s instrument to extend that rest to others. In <a href="/1_corinthians/16-17.htm">1 Corinthians 16:17&#8211;18</a>, Stephanas and his companions &#8220;refreshed my spirit and yours,&#8221; and Paul urges, &#8220;recognize such men.&#8221; Practical ways Philemon likely refreshed believers include:<p>&#8226; Opening his home for worship and fellowship<p>&#8226; Providing food, lodging, or financial help (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44&#8211;45</a>)<p>&#8226; Offering wise counsel and intercession (<a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>)<p>&#8226; Standing with the persecuted (<a href="/hebrews/10-34.htm">Hebrews 10:34</a>)<p>Such care lifted burdens and renewed courage, allowing the saints to press on in faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/philemon/1-7.htm">Philemon 1:7</a> shows Paul overflowing with happiness and strength because Philemon&#8217;s tangible, Christ-like love has brought spiritual rest to fellow believers. The verse celebrates the power of everyday acts of kindness to gladden hearts, encourage gospel workers, and refresh the church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/philemon/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">The bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee.</span>--The same idea is here carried on. St. Paul declares his special joy to have been that "the bowels (<span class= "ital">i.e., the hearts</span>) of the saints, have been refreshed through thee." The word "refresh" is the very word used by our Lord in His gracious promise: "Come unto me all ye that travail and are heavy laden, and I will <span class= "ital">refresh you</span>" (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm" title="Come to me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.">Matthew 11:28</a>). It is ultimately in Him that the hearts of the saints are refreshed. But in this case it was through the instrumentality of Philemon, by "the communion of faith," to which his active love was the means of welcoming them, and in which they had fellowship in Christ, both with the Father and with His children. (Comp. <a href="/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1John 1:3</a>.) St. Paul uses the word "refresh" not unfrequently to express the relief and rest given by Christian fellowship on earth. (See below, <a href="/philemon/1-20.htm" title="Yes, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.">Philemon 1:20</a>; and comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/16-18.htm" title="For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge you them that are such.">1Corinthians 16:18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-13.htm" title="Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yes, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.">2Corinthians 7:13</a>.) We find it in the Apocalypse applied to the rest with Christ in heaven (<a href="/revelation/6-11.htm" title="And white robes were given to every one of them; and it was said to them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellow servants also and their brothers, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.">Revelation 6:11</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-13.htm" title="And I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from now on: Yes, said the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; and their works do follow them.">Revelation 14:13</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philemon/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We have great joy and consolation.</span> The preferable reading is, as in A, C, F, G, N, and Revised Version, <span class="accented">I had much joy and comfort</span> (see Ver. 5).

Either <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> their bodily wants, the cravings of their hunger; or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> their hearts and affections, supplied and satisfied by the good deeds of Philemon. <p>This is another peculiarly Pauline expression (see <a href="/2_corinthians/6-12.htm">2 Corinthians 6:12</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/7-15.htm">2 Corinthians 7:15</a>-these two are very similarly used in Vers. 7, 12, 20 - and three other places). "<span class="accented">To</span> <span class="accented">refresh the bowels</span> is (in Paul) to be taken as meaning a lightening of troubles, so that they may rest with minds free from all sorrow and annoyance" (Calvin). <span class="cmt_word">Brother</span>. How persuasively the sentence is turned! An old commentator remarks, "Paul does not yet come to his request, but prepares and softens beforehand the mind of Philemon" (Scipio Gentilis). This course of proceeding is exactly what Quintilian prescribes to an advocate, "His velut fomentis, si quid erit asperum, praemolliemus, quo facilius aures judicum admittant" ('De Institut.
