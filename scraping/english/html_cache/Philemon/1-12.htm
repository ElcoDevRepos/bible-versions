In the Roman world, a runaway slave like Onesimus could face severe punishment. Paul's decision to send him back highlights the importance of reconciliation and the restoration of relationships within the Christian community. This act also reflects the biblical principle of restitution and making amends, as seen in the story of Zacchaeus (<a href="/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>).<p><b>him who is my very heart</b><br>Paul's use of the term "my very heart" demonstrates his deep affection for Onesimus, indicating a spiritual kinship that transcends social status. This reflects the transformative power of the Gospel, which creates a new identity in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). The phrase also echoes the language of love and unity found in other Pauline letters, such as <a href="/philippians/1-7.htm">Philippians 1:7</a>, where Paul speaks of holding the Philippians in his heart. This expression of love and personal connection is a model of Christ's love for humanity, emphasizing the value and dignity of every individual.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to Philemon.
