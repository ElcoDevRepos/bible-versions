The term "partnership" (Greek: koinonia) suggests a deep, shared participation in the life and mission of the church. This concept is echoed in <a href="/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>, where the early church is described as devoted to fellowship. Historically, the early Christian communities were tightly knit, often meeting in homes, as Philemon's church likely did. This partnership is not merely social but is rooted in a shared commitment to the gospel.<p><b>may become effective</b><br>The effectiveness of faith is a recurring theme in the New Testament, where faith is expected to produce tangible results in the lives of believers. <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a> underscores that faith without works is dead, suggesting that true faith naturally leads to action. The Greek word for "effective" (energes) implies active, powerful, and productive faith. This effectiveness is not self-generated but is empowered by the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>, where believers receive power to be witnesses.<p><b>as you fully acknowledge</b><br>Acknowledgment here involves a deep, personal understanding and recognition of spiritual truths. This is more than intellectual assent; it is an experiential knowledge that transforms the believer. <a href="/colossians/1-9.htm">Colossians 1:9-10</a> speaks of being filled with the knowledge of God's will, leading to a life worthy of the Lord. This acknowledgment is a process of continual growth and maturity in the faith, as believers are called to renew their minds (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).<p><b>every good thing that is ours in Christ</b><br>This phrase points to the spiritual blessings and resources available to believers through their union with Christ. <a href="/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a> states that God has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms in Christ. These "good things" include salvation, grace, peace, and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. The phrase also reflects the idea of inheritance, as believers are co-heirs with Christ (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>). This inheritance is both a present reality and a future hope, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>, which speaks of an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philemon.htm">Philemon</a></b><br>A Christian leader in Colossae, likely a wealthy man who hosted a house church.

This is exactly the prayer which, in different forms and degrees of emphasis, opens all the Epistles of the Captivity. (See <a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>; <a href="/philippians/1-9.htm" title="And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;">Philippians 1:9</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-9.htm" title=" For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;">Colossians 1:9</a>.) It describes the true order of Christian life, so fully and beautifully drawn out in <a href="/context/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17-19</a>, beginning in faith, deepened by love, and so growing to knowledge.<p>But it may be asked, "Why the <span class= "ital">communication of</span> thy faith?" (1) The phrase is unique, but the word rendered "communication" is the well-known word generally rendered "communion," or "fellowship," except where (as in <a href="/romans/15-26.htm" title="For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.">Romans 15:26</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/8-4.htm" title="Praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and take on us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.">2Corinthians 8:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-13.htm" title="Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution to them, and to all men;">2Corinthians 9:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-16.htm" title="But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.">Hebrews 13:16</a>) it is used technically and derivatively of "the communication" of almsgiving. The phrase, therefore, should probably be rendered the "communion of thy faith," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>"thy fellowship in faith." (2) But, again, the question arises, "With whom is this fellowship? With God or man?" The answer probably is, "With both." Perhaps for growth in divine knowledge the communion need only be with God. But we observe that the knowledge is not merely "of every good thing," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of all that is of God, but of "every good thing which is in you (or, better, <span class= "ital">in us</span>) towards Christ Jesus." It is, therefore, the knowledge of good--that is, of God's gift--as dwelling in man by the unity which binds all to Christ Jesus. (3) Now for knowledge of this, fellowship with man is needed, as well as fellowship with God. The soul which dwells alone with God, even in the holiest seclusion, knows what is good in the abstract, but not what is good in man in the concrete reality. But Philemon's house was a centre of Christian life. St. Paul might, therefore, well speak of this his two-fold "fellowship in faith," and pray that it might grow into full knowledge at once of God and of man as in Him. (4) That all such growth must be "towards Christ Jesus," dependent on unity with Him and serving to deepen such unity, is the characteristic doctrine of all this group of Epistles, especially of the Colossian Epistle, of which Onesimus was one of the bearers. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philemon/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - Render thus: <span class="cmt_word">So that the community of thy faith</span> [with other Christians, whom you may be able to serve] <span class="cmt_word">may show itself in act, causing full acknowledgment</span> [from the world without] <span class="cmt_word">of every good work for Jesus Christ that is in you</span> (Revised Version is not clear here); literally, <span class="accented">may become working</span>.
