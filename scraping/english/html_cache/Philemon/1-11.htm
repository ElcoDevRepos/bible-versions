In the cultural context of the Roman Empire, slaves were considered property and their value was often tied to their productivity and loyalty. Onesimus, whose name means "useful" or "profitable," ironically had not lived up to his name in his previous relationship with Philemon. His "uselessness" could have been due to his escape, which would have been seen as a breach of trust and a loss of labor for Philemon. This situation highlights the transformative power of the gospel, as Paul is about to explain how Onesimus's status has changed.<p><b>but now he has become useful</b><br>The transformation of Onesimus is a testament to the redemptive work of Christ. After meeting Paul and converting to Christianity, Onesimus's life took a new direction. This change is emblematic of the new creation mentioned in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, where believers are made new in Christ. Onesimus's newfound usefulness is not just in a practical sense but also in a spiritual one, as he becomes a fellow worker in the ministry. This reflects the biblical theme of redemption and restoration, where God takes what is broken or lost and makes it whole and valuable again.<p><b>both to you and to me</b><br>Paul emphasizes the mutual benefit that Onesimus now provides. To Philemon, Onesimus is no longer just a runaway slave but a brother in Christ, as Paul later appeals for Philemon to accept him as such (<a href="/philemon/1-16.htm">Philemon 1:16</a>). This reflects the early Christian teaching found in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where social distinctions are transcended in the body of Christ. To Paul, Onesimus has become a valuable assistant during his imprisonment, likely helping with the logistics of Paul's ministry and providing companionship. This dual usefulness underscores the unity and equality found in the Christian community, where each member contributes to the well-being of others, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philemon.htm">Philemon</a></b><br>A Christian leader in Colossae, likely a wealthy man who hosted a house church.

Paul lovingly reminds Philemon of this shared starting point so that grace, not resentment, can guide the response.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;but now&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; This brief hinge showcases the power of the gospel to rewrite a person&#8217;s story. Everything before was one way; everything after is different.<p>&#8226; The same contrast appears in <a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4&#8211;5</a>&#8212;&#8220;But because of His great love for us&#8230; God made us alive with Christ.&#8221; &#8220;But now&#8221; marks the moment where God steps in.<p>&#8226; In Onesimus&#8217;s life it happened through Paul&#8217;s ministry in prison; in ours it happens whenever we trust Christ.

It is hardly possible not to see in this passage a play on words, though (curiously enough) this is not noticed by the old Greek commentators. St. Paul seems to say, "He belied his name in days past; he will more than deserve it now."<p><span class= "bld">To thee and to me.</span>--St. Paul says "to thee," for he was sending back Onesimus.

"Useful he is named, but in time past he was (I confess it) not useful, but useless; in future, however, he will be of great use to us both." Compare with this the corresponding passage of Pliny's 'Letter to Sabinianus,' given in the Introduction. "Unprofitable" is a figure of speech, a <span class="accented">euphemism</span>, for "useless and even injurious." St. Paul makes the best of Onesimus's fault that it will in justice allow. But an old commentator says bluntly that Onesimus was "damnosus fuga et furto." How could he have been, in his unconverted state, otherwise than "unprofitable" to his master? "Olim paganus," says a Lapide, "jam Christianus; olim fur, jam fidelis servus; olim profugus, jam redux." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/philemon/1-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Formerly</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#959;&#964;&#941;</span> <span class="translit">(pote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4218.htm">Strong's 4218: </a> </span><span class="str2">At one time or other, at some time, formerly.
