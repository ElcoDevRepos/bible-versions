This reflects the close bond formed between Paul and Onesimus during the latter's conversion and subsequent service. The phrase highlights the personal nature of Paul's letter to Philemon, emphasizing the deep relationships within the early Christian community. It also underscores the theme of Christian fellowship and mutual support, which is a recurring theme in Paul's epistles (e.g., <a href="/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3-5</a>).<p><b>so that on your behalf</b><br>Paul suggests that Onesimus's service to him would be as if Philemon himself were ministering to Paul. This reflects the interconnectedness of the body of Christ, where actions by one member can represent the intentions or desires of another. It also subtly appeals to Philemon's sense of duty and generosity, encouraging him to view Onesimus not merely as a slave but as a brother in Christ. This idea of representation and intercession is seen elsewhere in Paul's writings, such as in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>, where believers are called ambassadors for Christ.<p><b>he could minister to me</b><br>The term "minister" here implies service, which in the context of Paul's imprisonment, would include providing for his physical needs and assisting in his ministry. This reflects the early Christian practice of supporting those in ministry, as seen in the support Paul received from other churches (<a href="/philippians/4-14.htm">Philippians 4:14-18</a>). It also highlights the transformation in Onesimus's life, from a runaway slave to a valued co-worker in the gospel.<p><b>in my chains for the gospel</b><br>Paul's reference to his chains underscores his imprisonment for preaching the gospel, a recurring theme in his letters (<a href="/ephesians/6-20.htm">Ephesians 6:20</a>, <a href="/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>). This phrase serves as a reminder of the cost of discipleship and the reality of persecution faced by early Christians. It also emphasizes the power of the gospel to transcend social and legal boundaries, as Onesimus, a slave, is now seen as a partner in ministry. The imagery of chains also points to the spiritual freedom found in Christ, contrasting physical bondage with spiritual liberation (<a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote the letter to Philemon.

The verb in the first clause is "to wish;" in the second "to will." The tense in the first clause is the imperfect: "I was wishing," or "prepared to wish" (just as in <a href="/acts/25-22.htm" title="Then Agrippa said to Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, you shall hear him.">Acts 25:22</a>; and, in the case of a cognate verb, <a href="/romans/9-3.htm" title="For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh:">Romans 9:3</a>), implying, perhaps, a suppressed condition; in the second it is the past definite: "I willed," or "determined" finally.<p><span class= "bld">In thy stead.</span>--Here, again, there is a certain delicacy of suggestion. A slave was his master's property; he could act only on his master's behalf and by his consent. St. Paul is sure that Philemon's love for him would have gladly given that consent, and so made Onesimus an instrument of willing service to St. Paul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philemon/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I was wishing</span>; <span class="accented">I would fain have kept</span> (Revised Version).
