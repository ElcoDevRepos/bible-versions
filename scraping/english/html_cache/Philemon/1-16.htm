Onesimus, the subject of this letter, was a runaway slave who had become a Christian. Paul is urging Philemon to see Onesimus not in his former status as a slave but in a new light. This reflects the transformative power of the Gospel, which transcends social and economic barriers, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul states that in Christ, there is neither slave nor free.<p><b>but better than a slave</b><br>Paul emphasizes that Onesimus's value has increased beyond his previous status. This suggests a new relationship based on Christian brotherhood rather than societal roles. The idea of being "better than a slave" aligns with the Christian teaching of the inherent worth of every individual, as all are made in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>).<p><b>as a beloved brother</b><br>The term "beloved brother" signifies a deep, familial bond that transcends earthly relationships. In the early church, believers referred to each other as brothers and sisters, indicating a spiritual kinship. This reflects Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/12-50.htm">Matthew 12:50</a>, where He states that whoever does the will of His Father is His brother, sister, and mother.<p><b>He is especially beloved to me</b><br>Paul's personal affection for Onesimus is evident here. Onesimus had ministered to Paul during his imprisonment, creating a strong bond between them. This personal connection underscores the theme of reconciliation and forgiveness, as Paul is willing to vouch for Onesimus's character and transformation.<p><b>but even more so to you</b><br>Paul appeals to Philemon's sense of Christian duty and love, suggesting that Onesimus's return should be met with greater affection and acceptance. This phrase implies that Philemon has a unique opportunity to demonstrate the love of Christ by welcoming Onesimus back not as a slave but as a brother.<p><b>both in person and in the Lord</b><br>This dual relationship highlights the importance of both physical and spiritual reconciliation. "In person" refers to their earthly relationship, while "in the Lord" emphasizes their shared faith and spiritual unity. This mirrors the reconciliation believers have with God through Christ, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-18.htm">2 Corinthians 5:18-19</a>, where Paul speaks of the ministry of reconciliation given to us by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philemon.htm">Philemon</a></b><br>A Christian leader in Colossae, likely a wealthy man who hosted a house church.

(1) The slave--the "living chattel" of inhuman laws and philosophies--is first "a brother," united to his master by natural ties of ultimate equality, having, therefore, both duties and rights. (2) But he is also a "brother beloved." These natural ties are not only strengthened by duty, but made living ties by the love which delights indeed to respect the rights of others, but is not content without willingness to sacrifice even our own rights to them. (3) Above all, this is "in the Lord." The slave is bought by Christ's blood, made a son of God, and therefore a brother to all who are members of the family of God. To reject and to outrage him is a rejection and outrage towards Christ. Compare St. Peter's striking comparison of the sufferings of the slave to the passion of the Divine Sufferer (<a href="/context/1_peter/2-18.htm" title="Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the fraudulent.">1Peter 2:18-24</a>). They suffer with Him, and He suffers in them. It has been proved historically that only by the aid of this last and highest conception has the brotherhood of love too slowly, indeed, but yet surely--assumed reality. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Specially to me, but how much more unto thee?</span>--St. Paul first emphasises his own love for Onesimus, which, indeed, breathes in every line of the Epistle; but then goes on to infer in Philemon a yet greater affection--a natural love towards the nursling of his house, a spiritual love towards the brother "in the Lord," lost and found again.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/philemon/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved.</span> So great a difference had his Christian calling and profession made to him and to others. <span class="cmt_word">Both in the flesh and in the Lord.</span> A <span class="accented">hysteron proteron</span>.
