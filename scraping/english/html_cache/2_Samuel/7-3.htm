His role was significant in guiding the king according to God's will. Prophets in ancient Israel were seen as God's mouthpieces, delivering divine messages. Nathan's relationship with David was one of mutual respect and trust, which is evident in their interactions throughout the biblical narrative.<p><b>Go and do all that is in your heart</b><br>This phrase indicates Nathan's initial approval of David's desire to build a temple for the Lord. It reflects the cultural understanding that kings often undertook grand projects to honor their deities. David's heart was aligned with a desire to glorify God, showing his devotion and commitment. However, this initial approval was based on Nathan's human understanding, not yet a direct revelation from God.<p><b>for the LORD is with you</b><br>This assurance highlights the special relationship between God and David. Throughout David's life, God's presence and favor were evident, from his anointing by Samuel to his victories in battle. The phrase underscores the biblical theme of God's covenant faithfulness. It also foreshadows the Davidic Covenant, where God promises to establish David's throne forever, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the Son of David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan.htm">Nathan</a></b><br>A prophet during the reign of King David, Nathan served as a spiritual advisor and was instrumental in conveying God's messages to David.

His willingness to speak shows:<p>&#8226; Respect for David&#8217;s authority yet confidence that the king wants God&#8217;s counsel (<a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>).<p>&#8226; A relationship in which prophet and king jointly seek God&#8217;s honor (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p>By immediately responding, Nathan affirms that God&#8217;s word is not distant or inaccessible; He provides guidance through His appointed servants (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go and do all that is in your heart</b><p>David longs to build a permanent house for the LORD (<a href="/2_samuel/7-1.htm">2 Samuel 7:1-2</a>).
