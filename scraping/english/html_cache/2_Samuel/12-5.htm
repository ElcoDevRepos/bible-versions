This anger is significant because it reveals David's initial blindness to his own sin. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, a king was expected to uphold justice, and David's response aligns with this expectation. His anger also foreshadows the divine judgment that will be pronounced upon him. This moment is a turning point, as it sets the stage for Nathan's revelation of David's sin with Bathsheba.<p><b>and said to Nathan:</b><br>Nathan, the prophet, plays a crucial role as God's messenger. Prophets in Israel were often tasked with delivering difficult truths to kings and the people. Nathan's approach, using a parable, is strategic and wise, allowing David to pronounce judgment on himself. This interaction highlights the role of prophets as intermediaries between God and His people, often bringing messages of both judgment and hope.<p><b>&#8220;As surely as the LORD lives,</b><br>This phrase is an oath, invoking the name of the LORD, which underscores the seriousness of David's declaration. In ancient Israel, oaths were binding and sacred, reflecting a deep commitment to truth and justice. The invocation of the LORD's name also emphasizes the theocratic nature of Israel, where God is the ultimate authority. This phrase connects to other biblical instances where oaths are made before God, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/14-39.htm">1 Samuel 14:39</a> and <a href="/2_kings/5-16.htm">2 Kings 5:16</a>.<p><b>the man who did this deserves to die!</b><br>David's pronouncement of death is severe, reflecting the gravity of the offense in his eyes. In the context of the parable, the rich man's actions are seen as a gross violation of justice and compassion. This mirrors the Mosaic Law, where certain sins were punishable by death (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>). David's judgment is ironic, as it ultimately applies to himself, revealing the depth of his own transgression. This moment foreshadows the concept of divine justice and mercy, themes that are central to the narrative of redemption throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is confronted by the prophet Nathan regarding his sin with Bathsheba and the murder of Uriah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan.htm">Nathan</a></b><br>A prophet sent by God to rebuke King David for his sin, using a parable to reveal David's wrongdoing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_parable.htm">The Parable</a></b><br>Nathan tells David a account about a rich man who takes a poor man's only lamb, which serves as an allegory for David's sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His justice and righteousness, which David invokes in his judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man</a></b><br>In the parable, the rich man represents David, who has taken what was not his, highlighting the gravity of his sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/righteous_anger_vs._self-righteousness.htm">Righteous Anger vs. Self-Righteousness</a></b><br>David's anger is initially righteous but becomes self-righteous when he fails to see his own sin.

The Revised Version correctly renders, "is worthy to die." The sentence actually passed, of fourfold restitution, is exactly in accordance with the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/22-1.htm">Exodus 22:1</a>), but the moral turpitude of the offence was far greater than could be atoned for by the legal penalty. Rightly, therefore, David expressed his indignation, and regretted that the sentence was so light; but a judge must not strain the law, which necessarily has regard chiefly to the outward offence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/12-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1435;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">burned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#183;&#7717;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
