The "house" signifies the temple, a central place of worship for Israel, where God's presence would dwell among His people. The temple was not just a physical structure but a symbol of God's covenant with Israel. The phrase "for My Name" indicates that the temple would be dedicated to the worship and glory of God, emphasizing His holiness and the importance of His name in Israel's worship practices. This promise also foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who referred to His body as a temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), indicating that He would be the ultimate dwelling place of God's presence.<p><b>and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the Davidic Covenant, where God promises David that his lineage would have an everlasting kingdom. Historically, this was partially fulfilled through Solomon, who reigned after David and built the temple. However, the promise finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, a descendant of David, whose kingdom is eternal. This eternal kingdom is a central theme in biblical prophecy, pointing to the Messiah's reign. The phrase "forever" underscores the perpetual nature of God's promise, which is not limited by time or earthly circumstances. This eternal throne is referenced in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a> and <a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>, affirming Jesus as the rightful heir to David's throne, whose kingdom will have no end.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who desired to build a temple for the Lord.

Jesus, identified as the greater Son in <a href="/matthew/12-42.htm">Matthew 12:42</a>, declares, &#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&#8221; (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19</a>), revealing Himself as the ultimate temple and the one who raises a new, living house&#8212;His church (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-4.htm">1 Peter 2:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;house&#8221; therefore has two layers:<p>&#8211; Physical&#8212;Solomon&#8217;s stone and cedar sanctuary on Mount Moriah.<p>&#8211; Spiritual&#8212;an everlasting dwelling of redeemed people in whom God&#8217;s Spirit resides (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Both aspects honor &#8220;My Name,&#8221; underscoring that the purpose of the house, whether physical or spiritual, is the display of God&#8217;s character and glory (<a href="/psalms/115-1.htm">Psalm 115:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever</b><p>&#8226; God shifts the focus from the temple to the dynasty. The same covenant promise reappears in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>: &#8220;Your throne will be established forever.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Solomon&#8217;s throne was secure as long as he walked in obedience (<a href="/1_kings/9-4.htm">1 Kings 9:4-5</a>). Yet Solomon died, and his kingdom split&#8212;proof that the promise looked further ahead.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;forever&#8221; clause anchors in the Messiah:<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/89-3.htm">Psalm 89:3-4</a> affirms, &#8220;I have made a covenant with My chosen one&#8230; I will establish your offspring forever.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a> foretells a Child who will reign &#8220;from that time on and forever.&#8221;<p>&#8211; Gabriel tells Mary, &#8220;The Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David&#8230; and of His kingdom there will be no end&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<p>&#8211; <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a> crowns the prophecy: &#8220;The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Because Scripture is truthful and literal, the promise assures a future, visible reign of Christ on David&#8217;s throne, climaxing in an eternal kingdom that cannot be shaken (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13</a> unites the temple and the throne in one seamless covenant. Solomon inaugurated the visible house, but Jesus consummates it by forming a living temple and ruling on David&#8217;s throne eternally. The verse guarantees God&#8217;s name will be honored and His king exalted without end, inviting believers to find both their worship and their security in the unbreakable word of the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.</span> The temple which Solomon was to build was the symbol of the new development of Israel, and naturally these words suggest a meaning not unworthy of so great an advance in the accomplishment of the nation's mission. Had we, indeed, only this passage, we might be content to take it in a popular sense, as signifying that, whereas Saul's throne (and subsequently that of the many usurpers in Samaria) had but a brief existence, Solomon's descendants should hold for many centuries undisputed possession of the kingdom of Jerusalem. But in <a href="/psalms/89-29.htm">Psalm 89:29</a> we read, "His (David's) seed will I make to endure forever, and his throne as the days of heaven." And again in vers. 36, 37 a continuance is assured to it as lasting as that of the sun and moon. We can scarcely, therefore, be wrong in the conviction that these promises pointed onwards to the establishment of Christ's kingdom, and that the great importance attached to the building of the temple finds its explanation in its relation to him. This full establishment after so long a delay of the Mosaic typical ritual, the addition to it of psalmody, giving it a spiritual side, and making the worship that of the heart, the bestowal of empire, and the rapid development of the people under David and Solomon, were all steps in that wonderful series of special providences which made the Jews fit to be the progeniters of the Messiah, which surrounded him during his ministry with companions capable of understanding and recording his teaching, and provided for him, after his death, missionaries, not merely with zeal enough, but with intellectual gifts sufficient to enable them to persuade both Greece and Rome to listen to tidings so wonderful and mysterious as that God for our salvation had become man. Keil also well points out that the temple was a symbol of Christ's incarnation; for it meant the dwelling of God on earth. "I have surely," says Solomon, "built thee a house of habitation, a place for thee to dwell in forever" (<a href="/1_kings/8-13.htm">1 Kings 8:13</a>). The same thought was in St. John's mind when he said, "The Word became flesh, and dwelt as in a tabernacle among us" (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>). For the verb used by him, literally "tabernacled," is a comparison between Christ's life on earth, and the dwelling of God in "the tent of meeting." But there is more than this. Christ himself calls his body "the temple" (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19, 21</a>). At the Resurrection he raised up again the temple of his body which the Jews had destroyed, and at the Ascension it was removed from the earth, to be reserved in heaven until his second advent. His reign now is spiritual, and his temple is not a building made with hands, but is the heart of the renewed believer (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>). And this indwelling of Christ in the heart will continue unto the end of the present dispensation. For Christ's indwelling is that also of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>); and the gift of the Spirit continues unto the end of the world. "The Father shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever" (<a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/7-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will build</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#7687;&#183;neh-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1129.htm">Strong's 1129: </a> </span><span class="str2">To build</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a house</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#183;yi&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for My name,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(li&#353;&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
