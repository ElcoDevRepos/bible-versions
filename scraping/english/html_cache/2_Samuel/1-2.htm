In this context, it marks the time elapsed since the battle in which Saul and Jonathan died. The third day is significant in Scripture, often associated with resurrection and revelation, as seen in the resurrection of Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>) and Jonah's deliverance from the fish (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>).<p><b>a man with torn clothes and dust on his head</b><br>Torn clothes and dust on the head are traditional signs of mourning and distress in ancient Near Eastern cultures. This imagery is consistent with expressions of grief found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a> and <a href="/joshua/7-6.htm">Joshua 7:6</a>. The man&#8217;s appearance indicates he is a bearer of bad news, aligning with cultural practices of expressing sorrow and lamentation.<p><b>arrived from Saul&#8217;s camp</b><br>The mention of "Saul&#8217;s camp" situates the narrative in the aftermath of the battle at Mount Gilboa, where Saul and his sons were killed by the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/31.htm">1 Samuel 31:1-6</a>). This geographical reference underscores the transition of power from Saul to David, a pivotal moment in Israel's history. The camp represents the last stronghold of Saul's reign, now fallen.<p><b>When he came to David</b><br>David, at this time, was in Ziklag, a city given to him by the Philistine king Achish (<a href="/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a>). David's location outside of Israelite territory highlights his complex relationship with both the Philistines and the Israelites. This meeting marks a significant turning point, as David is about to receive news that will lead to his ascension as king.<p><b>he fell to the ground to pay him homage</b><br>The act of falling to the ground and paying homage indicates respect and recognition of authority. This gesture foreshadows David's impending kingship, as others begin to acknowledge his God-ordained role. It also reflects the cultural practice of showing deference to those of higher status, as seen in other biblical accounts like Joseph's brothers bowing before him (<a href="/genesis/42-6.htm">Genesis 42:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, currently in Ziklag after fleeing from King Saul.

The messenger, although an Amalekite (<a href="/2_samuel/1-8.htm" title="And he said to me, Who are you? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.">2Samuel 1:8</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/1-13.htm" title="And David said to the young man that told him, From where are you? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.">2Samuel 1:13</a>), had earth upon his head and his clothes rent as marks of sorrow for the defeat of David's people, and the death of their king.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the third day.</span> This means the third day after David's return with the spoil and captives recovered from the Amalekites. If we study the data, we find that David had marched with Achish as far as Aphek in the plain of Jezreel (<a href="/1_samuel/29-1.htm">1 Samuel 29:1</a>), opposite to which, on the rising ground near Gilboa, Saul had posted his army. A march of three days had brought him back to Ziklag (<a href="/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1</a>), and after the shortest possible delay he had started in pursuit of the Amalekites. The rapidity of his movements is proved by so large a proportion of his hardy men falling out of the ranks at the brook Besor; but nevertheless some time must have been lost at Ziklag in discovering the greatness of their disaster, in searching for any who might possibly have escaped, in getting food, and in mustering again together for the pursuit. Near the brook they seem to have found the Egyptian slave who became their guide, and who had been abandoned three days before David found him. It follows, therefore, that the Amalekites were then three days' march in advance, and however rapidly the pursuit was urged on, we cannot allow less than five days for it, and one for the battle (vers. 12, 13, 17). The march homeward would take a longer time, as David was now encumbered with flocks and herds, women and children. If it took eight days, the time occupied in it by the Amalekites, the whole period that had elapsed since David was sent away from Aphek by the Philistine lords would be eighteen or nineteen days; and it is thus evident that the Amalekites were plundering Ziklag at the very time when he was being dismissed, half angry, half rejoicing, at the slight put upon him, but little thinking of the sad need there was for his presence elsewhere. Now, the messenger from Gilboa, if an active runner, weald easily traverse in two days the distance which David and his men had travelled in three. And thus it follows that the battle at Gilboa was fought on the very day of David's happy return from the pursuit, and about nineteen days after the review at Aphek. If the word "tomorrow" in <a href="/1_samuel/28-19.htm">1 Samuel 28:19</a> seems to imply a more rapid march of events, we must remember that the meaning of the word in Hebrew is more indefinite than with us (comp. <a href="/genesis/30-33.htm">Genesis 30:33</a>; <a href="/exodus/13-14.htm">Exodus 13:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With his clothes rent, and earth upon his head.</span> Though the Amalekite came out of the camp, yet we are not to suppose that he had been one of the combatants. Every army is followed by a vast number of vagabonds, intent upon gain, purchasing of the troops their booty, plundering wherever they have the chance, and carrying on a lucrative but illicit trade. He was more probably a sort of gipsy sutler than, as many suppose, the slave of some Israelite. He professes, however, to be upon Israel's side, and appears with the usual marks of sorrow. By so doing he hoped to commend himself to David, whom he knew to be too patriotic to rejoice at the defeat of his countrymen, though he doubted not that he would hear with joy of the death of so inveterate a personal enemy as Saul. On this account, and because the way would now stand open to David's ambition, he evidently felt sure of receiving a large guerdon for his news. There is, moreover, a further interest in his conduct; for it demonstrates the existence of a widespread popular feeling that David was destined to be Israel's king. It was this conviction which made him give David kingly honour; <span class="cmt_word">for he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</span> And all Israel, on the morrow after the defeat, would probably have done the same, but for David's own conduct. Israel was too high-spirited a nation to take at once for a king a man who had marched with their enemies to fight against them, even though they knew that the voice of prophecy had appointed him to inherit Saul's throne. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/1-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On the third</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#238;&#183;&#353;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
