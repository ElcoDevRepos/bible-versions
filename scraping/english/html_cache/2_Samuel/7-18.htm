This signifies a personal and intimate approach to God, highlighting the importance of seeking God's presence. The Ark represented God's throne on earth, and David's approach shows reverence and humility.<p><b>sat before the LORD</b><br>Sitting before the LORD indicates a posture of humility and contemplation. In ancient Near Eastern culture, sitting was a common posture for prayer and reflection. This act demonstrates David's desire to be in God's presence and to communicate with Him directly, emphasizing a personal relationship with God.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Who am I, O Lord GOD</b><br>David's question reflects his humility and amazement at God's favor. Despite being king, David acknowledges his unworthiness. This echoes the sentiment found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/8-4.htm">Psalm 8:4</a>, where the psalmist marvels at God's attention to humanity. It underscores the biblical theme of God's grace and favor being unmerited.<p><b>and what is my house</b><br>David refers to his family lineage, recognizing that his rise to kingship is not due to his own merit or his family's status. This humility is significant, as it contrasts with the pride often seen in rulers. It also foreshadows the promise of an eternal dynasty through David's line, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<p><b>that You have brought me this far?</b><br>David acknowledges God's providence and guidance in his life. This phrase reflects a recognition of God's sovereignty and faithfulness. It connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's covenant promises, such as those made to Abraham, and points forward to the ultimate fulfillment in the coming of the Messiah through David's lineage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his deep relationship with God, his military conquests, and his role in establishing Jerusalem as the nation's capital.

The place to which he went must be the tent he had pitched for the ark. Here he sat to meditate in God's presence upon the communication which had now been made to him, and then to offer his thanksgiving (<a href="/context/2_samuel/7-18.htm" title="Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that you have brought me till now?">2Samuel 7:18-21</a>), praise (<a href="/context/2_samuel/7-22.htm" title="Why you are great, O LORD God: for there is none like you, neither is there any God beside you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.">2Samuel 7:22-24</a>), and prayer (<a href="/context/2_samuel/7-25.htm" title="And now, O LORD God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as you have said.">2Samuel 7:25-29</a>).<p>The Divine Name is here printed with the word GOD in small capitals. This is always done in the Authorised Version wherever it stands for JEHOVAH in the original. The same custom is also followed with the word LORD. Out of reverence for the name, Jehovah never has its own vowels in Hebrew, but is printed with those belonging to <span class= "ital">Lord, </span>or in case this word also is used, then with those belonging to <span class= "ital">God.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David... sat before the Lord.</span> The word "sat" is usually explained by commentators as meaning "tarried." The rabbins give the word its ordinary meaning, and say that it was the privilege of kings to pray in a sitting posture. But we cannot possibly believe that kings at this early stage had established a special etiquette for observance in prayer, and the difficulty is merely imaginary. Because the Jews prayed standing, and we moderns pray kneeling, we both assume that to pray sitting was an irreverent act. It was not so, nor are we to think of David as sitting at ease in a chair. He sat upon the ground, as was the Oriental custom, with his feet doubled under him, and his head bent forward; and in this posture meditated upon Jehovah's message, and then poured out his thoughts. As it is expressly said that "he sat before Jehovah," the place must have been the outer court of the tabernacle. <span class="cmt_word">Who am I, O Lord Jehovah!</span> In the Authorized Version <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> is rendered "God," because it has the vowels of the word <span class="accented">Elohim</span>; usually it is rendered "Lord," because the Masserites attached to it the vowels of <span class="accented">Adonai</span>, "lord," equivalent to <span class="accented">Dominus.</span> As <span class="accented">Adonai</span> here precedes <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, the Massorites were driven from their usual practice, and were so superstitious as to suppose it more reverent to pronounce the name <span class="accented">Elohim</span> than that of <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, to which the Jews attached magical powers. David's words are not so much a prayer as a meditation, full of thanksgiving, and even of wonder at the greatness of God's mercies to him. In it he first acknowledges his own unworthiness and the meanness of his father's house compared with the high dignity which God is bestowing upon him. For not only has he raised him to the kingly office, but promised him the continuance of his house "for a great while to come." Whether David understood as yet that he was now placed in the same position as Abraham of old, in that "in his seed all the families of the earth should be blessed," is uncertain, and depends upon the interpretation put upon the following words. This only we may affirm, that whet he says in this place of his house remaining until a distant future falls far short of the meaning of the passages quoted above from the Psalms. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/7-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then King</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
