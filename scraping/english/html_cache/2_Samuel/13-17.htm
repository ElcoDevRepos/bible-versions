Amnon, as a son of King David, had servants at his command, reflecting the hierarchical structure of ancient Israelite society. The use of an attendant underscores the social norms where servants were expected to obey without question. This moment also foreshadows the isolation and vulnerability of Tamar, as the decision is made without her input or consent.<p><b>&#8220;Throw this woman out</b><br>The phrase "this woman" is impersonal and dismissive, indicating Amnon's complete disregard for Tamar's dignity and humanity. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, a woman's honor was closely tied to her family and her chastity. By referring to her in such a manner, Amnon not only disrespects Tamar but also brings shame upon her, which would have significant social repercussions. This act of expulsion is a stark contrast to the hospitality and protection that should have been afforded to her as a member of the royal family.<p><b>and bolt the door behind her!&#8221;</b><br>Bolting the door signifies a finality and a severing of any relationship or responsibility Amnon had towards Tamar. In the ancient Near East, doors were often symbolic of protection and security. By bolting the door, Amnon not only physically excludes Tamar but also metaphorically shuts her out from any hope of justice or reconciliation. This act of closing the door is reminiscent of other biblical narratives where doors signify separation or judgment, such as the shutting of Noah's ark or the closing of the door in the parable of the ten virgins. The action underscores the theme of rejection and abandonment, which is a recurring motif in the story of Tamar.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amnon.htm">Amnon</a></b><br>The eldest son of King David, who is the central figure in this passage.

Instead of compassion, Amnon immediately shifts to rejection. The word signals a hard pivot away from any righteous response prescribed in <a href="/deuteronomy/22-28.htm">Deuteronomy 22:28-29</a>, which required a man who violated a virgin to marry and never divorce her.

The contrast (&#8220;Instead&#8221;) shows Amnon rejecting both Tamar&#8217;s plea and God&#8217;s law. Calling the attendant and issuing the command reveals calculated misuse of authority. By saying &#8220;Throw this woman out,&#8221; Amnon dehumanizes Tamar, and bolting the door finalizes her shame while attempting to shield himself.
