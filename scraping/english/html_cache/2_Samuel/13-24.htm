The context is a period of tension following the rape of Absalom's sister, Tamar, by their half-brother Amnon. Absalom's approach to the king is significant as it shows his attempt to maintain a semblance of normalcy and respect towards his father, despite the underlying family conflict. This reflects the hierarchical and patriarchal nature of ancient Israelite society, where approaching the king, even as a son, required a formal request.<p><b>&#8220;Your servant has just hired shearers.</b><br>Sheep shearing was a significant event in ancient Israel, often associated with festivity and celebration. It was a time of harvest and abundance, akin to a modern-day harvest festival. The hiring of shearers indicates Absalom's wealth and status, as he had the resources to employ others for this task. This event is reminiscent of the story of Nabal and David in <a href="/1_samuel/25.htm">1 Samuel 25</a>, where sheep shearing also serves as a backdrop for a significant narrative development.<p><b>Will the king and his servants please come with me?&#8221;</b><br>Absalom's invitation to the king and his servants is a strategic move. On the surface, it appears to be a gesture of hospitality and honor, inviting the king to partake in the festivities. However, given the broader narrative, it is a calculated step in Absalom's plan to avenge his sister Tamar by killing Amnon. This request can be seen as a foreshadowing of Absalom's later rebellion against David, highlighting themes of betrayal and familial discord. The invitation also reflects the cultural importance of communal gatherings and the expectation of the king's presence at significant events.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his handsome appearance and later rebellion against his father.

Personal access to the king was a privilege (<a href="/esther/5-1.htm">Esther 5:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Coming face-to-face signals both respect and calculated purpose. Earlier, Absalom had quietly sheltered Tamar (<a href="/2_samuel/13-20.htm">2 Samuel 13:20</a>); now he steps forward publicly.<p>&#8226; The narrative reminds us that even when motives are hidden, God sees every heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said,</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and said&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Absalom&#8217;s speech is deliberate. Like Jonathan speaking carefully to Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/20-32.htm">1 Samuel 20:32</a>), he frames his words to gain royal favor.<p>&#8226; Scripture often highlights that words reveal intent (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>).
