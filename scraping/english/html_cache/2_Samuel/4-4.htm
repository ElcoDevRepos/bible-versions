This relationship is significant as it highlights the covenantal bond between Jonathan and David, which transcended political rivalry. The mention of Jonathan's son being lame in his feet introduces Mephibosheth, whose physical condition symbolizes the fall of Saul's house and the vulnerability of those left behind after Saul's demise. In biblical times, physical disabilities often carried social stigma and could limit one's role in society, reflecting the challenges Mephibosheth would face.<p><b>He was five years old when the report about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel.</b><br>The report from Jezreel refers to the news of the defeat and death of Saul and Jonathan at the hands of the Philistines, as recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/31.htm">1 Samuel 31</a>. Jezreel was a strategic location in the northern kingdom of Israel, and its mention underscores the widespread impact of the battle. The age of Mephibosheth at this time, five years old, emphasizes his innocence and the abrupt change in his life circumstances due to the political upheaval.<p><b>His nurse picked him up and fled, but as she was hurrying to escape, he fell and became lame.</b><br>The nurse's actions reflect the urgency and fear following the news of the royal family's defeat, as the fall of a king often led to the extermination of his descendants to prevent claims to the throne. The accident that left Mephibosheth lame was a result of this hurried escape, illustrating the chaos and danger of the times. This incident also sets the stage for Mephibosheth's later life, where he lives in obscurity and dependency, contrasting with his royal lineage.<p><b>His name was Mephibosheth.</b><br>Mephibosheth's name, which means "dispeller of shame" or "from the mouth of shame," is significant in understanding his story. Despite his physical condition and the loss of his royal status, Mephibosheth's later interactions with King David, particularly in <a href="/2_samuel/9.htm">2 Samuel 9</a>, reveal themes of grace and restoration. David's kindness to Mephibosheth, for the sake of Jonathan, prefigures the grace of Christ extended to humanity, where the undeserving are given a place at the king's table.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul and a close friend of David.

Each phrase roots his disability in real history, illustrating how God weaves personal suffering into His larger redemptive plan. Though physically broken and politically endangered, Mephibosheth will later experience remarkable kindness from King David, foreshadowing the gracious welcome God extends to all who trust His covenant promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">A son that was lame.</span>--The reason for the introduction here of this account of Mephibosheth, Jonathan's son, is to show that, he being physically in capacitated for the throne, the house of Saul became practically extinct with the death of Ish-bosheth. There were other descendants, but either illegitimate or of the female line (<a href="/context/2_samuel/21-8.htm" title="But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:">2Samuel 21:8-9</a>), and hence there was none other of his house to claim the throne.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son.</span> This is mentioned to show that Saul's lineage virtually became extinct on Ishbosheth's death. Mephibosheth, the heir, was a cripple, and physically incapable of reigning. Saul had, indeed, sons by a concubine, and grandchildren by his daughter Merab (<a href="/2_samuel/21-8.htm">2 Samuel 21:8</a>). But throughout the history there is no hint that any of these were regarded as the representatives of Saul's house.
