His presence signifies the religious authority and continuity of the priestly line. Zadok's loyalty to David is significant, as he later becomes a key figure in the establishment of Solomon's reign (<a href="/1_kings/1-39.htm">1 Kings 1:39</a>). His lineage is important, as it is from the line of Zadok that the future priesthood is prophesied to come (<a href="/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15</a>).<p><b>and all the Levites with him</b><br>The Levites were the tribe set apart for religious duties and the care of the tabernacle and later the temple. Their presence underscores the importance of the religious and ceremonial aspects of Israel's life. The Levites' role in carrying the ark highlights their consecrated status and dedication to God's service (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>).<p><b>were carrying the ark of the covenant of God</b><br>The ark of the covenant was the most sacred object in Israel, symbolizing God's presence and covenant with His people. It contained the tablets of the Law, Aaron's rod, and a pot of manna (<a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>). The ark's movement here is significant, as it represents God's presence accompanying David, even in times of crisis. The ark's journey throughout Israel's history often parallels the nation's spiritual state.<p><b>And they set down the ark of God</b><br>Setting down the ark indicates a moment of pause and reverence. It reflects the need to honor God's presence and seek His guidance. This act can be seen as a moment of worship and reflection, acknowledging God's sovereignty and seeking His will in the unfolding events.<p><b>and Abiathar offered sacrifices</b><br>Abiathar, another priest, was a loyal supporter of David. Offering sacrifices was a way to seek God's favor and forgiveness, and to consecrate the people and their actions. Sacrifices were central to Israel's worship and covenant relationship with God, pointing forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>until all the people had passed out of the city</b><br>This phrase indicates a time of transition and movement, as David and his followers leave Jerusalem. It reflects the urgency and gravity of the situation, as David flees from Absalom's rebellion. The people's exodus from the city can be seen as a parallel to Israel's earlier exodus from Egypt, a time of trial and reliance on God's guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zadok.htm">Zadok</a></b><br>A high priest during King David's reign, Zadok was loyal to David and played a crucial role in the religious and political life of Israel.

Together these details affirm that, even when earthly thrones totter, God&#8217;s throne remains central, His priests remain active, and His people remain covered by sacrificial grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Zadok also.</span>--Zadok appears here as in charge of the ark, and David (<a href="/2_samuel/15-27.htm" title="The king said also to Zadok the priest, Are not you a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.">2Samuel 15:27</a>) addresses him exclusively, while Abiathar is merely mentioned. This gives no indication of the relations existing between the two, but merely shows how matters went on this day of hurry and confusion. The language is obscure, but probably means that Zadok and the Levites brought the ark out of the city, and set it down while the multitude were assembling; meantime Abiathar led the multitude forward up the Mount of Olives until they had all come out of the city.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Abiathar went up.</span> This rendering, though confirmed by the versions, is very unintelligible. Whither did Abiathar go up? And moreover it is said that he continued going up until all David's followers had passed out of the city. Another possible rendering is, "And Abiathar offered (sacrifices) until all the people had done passing out of the city." Passages quoted in proof that the verb may be so rendered without the addition of the word "sacrifice" are <a href="/1_samuel/2-28.htm">1 Samuel 2:28</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/24-22.htm">2 Samuel 24:22</a>; but in both these places the context makes the sense plain. Such a sacrifice would, of course, sanctify both king and people in their flight; but as none of the versions support this method of translating the text, it seems unsafe to adopt it, and the passage must remain obscure. On the one hand, it is unlikely that there would be time to offer sacrifices at so hasty a flight; but on the other hand, the removal of the ark was a solemn thing, which probably required some such religious ceremonial, and Cahen and other Jewish authorities translate, "Abiathar offered burnt offerings." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/15-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Zadok</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1464;&#1491;&#1436;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;wq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6659.htm">Strong's 6659: </a> </span><span class="str2">Zadok -- the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was also</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7713;am-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1571.htm">Strong's 1571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assemblage, also, even, yea, though, both, and</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
