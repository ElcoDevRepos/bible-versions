Asahel's pursuit of Abner, the commander of Saul's army, highlights the ongoing conflict between the house of Saul and the house of David following Saul's death. Abner had declared Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, as king over Israel, while David was anointed king over Judah. This pursuit is part of the larger narrative of the struggle for power and the eventual unification of Israel under David. Asahel's determination to chase Abner reflects his loyalty to David and his desire to see David's kingship established over all Israel.<p><b>not turning to the right or to the left</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Asahel's single-minded determination and focus in his pursuit of Abner. It suggests a relentless and unwavering commitment, which is a recurring theme in biblical narratives where individuals are called to follow God's path without deviation. This imagery is also used in <a href="/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32</a> and <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>, where the Israelites are instructed to follow God's commandments without turning aside.

This pursuit ultimately leads to Asahel's death at the hands of Abner, which sets off a chain of events leading to further conflict and bloodshed. The pursuit can be seen as a type of the relentless pursuit of justice and the fulfillment of God's promises, as David's eventual kingship over all Israel is part of God's covenant with him. This pursuit also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's anointed king, a type of Christ, who will establish His kingdom in righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asahel.htm">Asahel</a></b><br>Asahel was one of the sons of Zeruiah, David's sister, making him David's nephew.

His great fleetness enabled him to overtake Abner and, coming behind him, endanger his life. Abner was unwilling to injure him, and only after remonstrating with him, and urging him to seek the spoil of some warrior more nearly his equal (<a href="/context/2_samuel/2-20.htm" title="Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Are you Asahel? And he answered, I am.">2Samuel 2:20-22</a>), did he unwillingly slay him "with the hinder end of his spear." The spears were sharpened at the "hinder end" for the purpose of sticking them into the ground (<a href="/1_samuel/26-7.htm" title="So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.">1Samuel 26:7</a>). Abner's reluctance to kill Asahel may have been partly on account of his extreme youth, but was chiefly through dread of the vengeance of Joab (<a href="/2_samuel/2-22.htm" title="And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn you aside from following me: why should I smite you to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab your brother?">2Samuel 2:22</a>). "The fifth rib" here, and wherever else it occurs (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm" title="And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.">2Samuel 3:27</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/4-6.htm" title="And they came thither into the middle of the house, as though they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.">2Samuel 4:6</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/20-10.htm" title="But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.">2Samuel 20:10</a>), should be translated <span class= "ital">abdomen.</span> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Asahel pursued after Abner.</span> This episode is fully narrated, both because of Asahel's rank as David's nephew, and also because of its tragical consequences to Abner himself. Asahel was a son of Zeruiah, David's sister, and, while his own brothers were of little use to him, his nephews, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel, were the mainstays of David's throne. As their father's name is never mentioned, but only the mother's, Zeruiah was probably a woman of great ability, and her sons inherited it from her. Possibly she had married beneath her station, or her husband had died early; but certainly her sons, thinking more of her than of their father, had soon thrown in their lot with David her brother (but see note on ver. 32). The youngest of the three, Asahel, was remarkable for his personal accomplishments, and especially for swiftness of foot, for which he was compared to the Zebi, the camp name of Jonathan (<a href="/2_samuel/1-19.htm">2 Samuel 1:19</a>). It now caused his death. For conscious that Abner was the sole support of Ishbosheth's party, and indignant at his challenge to useless slaughter, he pursued after him, allowing nothing to divert him from his object, and hoping to end the war by slaying the veteran commander. But though he had the fleetness of an Achilles, he had not his robust strength, and Abner, knowing that the combat was unequal, remonstrated with him, and bade him turn aside, and be content with winning the spoils of some meaner warrior. It is evident from this that Abner saw in this defeat in a battle of his own choosing, the certainty of the near downfall of the house of Saul, and, as he would then be in Joab's power, he was unwilling to have a blood feud with a man of such determined character. "How," he asks, "should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?" It would be his duty, as the avenger of blood, to slay me. Apparently, during this conference, he was standing with the butt end of his lance held towards Asahel, to ward off his blows, but, as the spearhead was turned the other way, Asahel forgot that even so it might be used for offence. For it was pointed, that it might be stuck in the ground at night (<a href="/1_samuel/26-7.htm">1 Samuel 26:7</a>), and possibly shod with iron, though it is more likely that it was only hardened by being thrust into the fire. So when he saw that his words had no avail, and that Asahel was not on his guard, he suddenly struck him with it so violent a blow that it pierced his body right through, and Asahel fell down dead. It is probable, from the merciless force used, that there was a sudden outburst of anger on Abner's part. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/2-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and he</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1492;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;h&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6214.htm">Strong's 6214: </a> </span><span class="str2">Asahel -- 'God has made', four Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">chased</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yir&#183;d&#333;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
