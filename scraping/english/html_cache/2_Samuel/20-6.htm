Abishai is known for his loyalty and bravery, often serving as a key figure in David's military campaigns. This interaction highlights the trust David places in his commanders, reflecting the importance of strong leadership and delegation in times of crisis.<p><b>Now Sheba the son of Bichri</b><br>Sheba is identified as the son of Bichri, a Benjamite. The tribe of Benjamin had historical tensions with the tribe of Judah, from which David hailed. This tension is rooted in the earlier division of the kingdom under Saul, a Benjamite, and David's subsequent rise to power. Sheba's rebellion can be seen as an extension of these tribal conflicts, emphasizing the ongoing struggle for unity within Israel.<p><b>will do us more harm than Absalom</b><br>Absalom, David's son, had previously led a significant rebellion against David, which nearly cost him his throne. By comparing Sheba to Absalom, David acknowledges the serious threat Sheba poses. This comparison underscores the potential for internal strife to destabilize the kingdom, a recurring theme in Israel's history. It also highlights the personal and political challenges David faced during his reign.<p><b>Take your lord&#8217;s servants and pursue him</b><br>David instructs Abishai to take action against Sheba by mobilizing the king's loyal forces. This directive reflects the urgency and seriousness of the threat. The term "lord's servants" indicates the royal troops, emphasizing the need for a swift and decisive military response to prevent further rebellion. This phrase also illustrates the importance of loyalty and obedience in the service of the king.<p><b>or he will find fortified cities and elude us</b><br>David is concerned that if Sheba reaches fortified cities, he will be able to resist capture and continue his rebellion. Fortified cities were strategically important in ancient warfare, providing protection and a base for operations. This concern highlights the tactical considerations of ancient military campaigns and the need for quick action to prevent an enemy from gaining a stronghold. The phrase also reflects the broader biblical theme of seeking refuge and the challenges of overcoming entrenched opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who is dealing with the aftermath of Absalom's rebellion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abishai.htm">Abishai</a></b><br>David's nephew and a loyal military commander, tasked with pursuing Sheba.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheba_son_of_bichri.htm">Sheba son of Bichri</a></b><br>A Benjamite who instigates a rebellion against King David, threatening the unity of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, whose previous rebellion against David serves as a backdrop for the current crisis.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fortified_cities.htm">Fortified Cities</a></b><br>Strategic locations that Sheba might use to strengthen his rebellion and evade capture.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_leadership_and_unity.htm">The Importance of Leadership and Unity</a></b><br>David's quick response to Sheba's rebellion highlights the need for decisive leadership to maintain unity.

The clause "escape us" is difficult, and doubtful in the original, and the English follows the Vulg. Others translate "pluck out our eye," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>do us great harm; others as the LXX., "over shadow our eye," meaning either cause us anxiety, or hide where we cannot find him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David said to Abishai.</span> David thus gives the command to the younger brother, and we find in ver. 7 that even "Joab's men," his own special troop, were placed under Abishai's command. There seems always to have been a firm friendship between the brothers, and at first Joab acquiesces. The king was, in fact, in so grim a humour that he probably felt that he had better keep with his men, who would protect him, instead of remaining at Jerusalem, where he would be in David's power. When Amasa joined them, Abishai would have to resign to him the command; and David probably expected that, after a successful campaign, and with the aid of the men of Judah, who were rebels like himself, Amasa would be able to crush Joab. But Joab did not intend to wait for this; and immediately on meeting his rival he murders him, and assumes the command. <span class="cmt_word">Thy lord's servants.</span> These are the men enumerated in ver. 7, and formed David's usual military attendants. When war broke out, they were reinforced by a levy of the people. <span class="cmt_word">And escape us.</span> The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain. It may signify, "and withdraw himself from our eyes," which gives the sense of the Authorized Version, and is supported by the Vulgate. The Septuagint renders, "and overshadow our eyes," which might have the same meaning, but, as others think, may signify, "and cause us anxiety." Many modern commentators render, "and pluck out our eye;" that is, do us painful damage. Either this or the Authorized Version gives a good sense, and, anyhow, rapid action was necessary, or Sheba's revolt might become dangerous. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/20-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
