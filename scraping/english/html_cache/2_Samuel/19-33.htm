Barzillai is a wealthy Gileadite who supported David during his time of need. The mention of Barzillai highlights the importance of loyalty and support for God's anointed king. Barzillai's actions can be seen as a reflection of the biblical principle of supporting God's chosen leaders, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>, where David himself was anointed by Samuel.<p><b>&#8220;Cross over with me</b><br>David invites Barzillai to cross the Jordan River with him, symbolizing a transition from a time of conflict to a time of restoration and peace. The Jordan River often represents a boundary or a point of significant change in the Bible, such as when the Israelites crossed into the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a>). This invitation signifies a new beginning and the restoration of David's kingship.<p><b>and I will provide for you</b><br>David promises to care for Barzillai, acknowledging his loyalty and support. This reflects the biblical theme of reward for faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/28-20.htm">Proverbs 28:20</a>, which states that a faithful person will be richly blessed. It also mirrors God's provision for His people, as seen throughout the Old Testament, where God provides for the needs of Israel.<p><b>at my side in Jerusalem.&#8221;</b><br>David offers Barzillai a place of honor in Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Israel. Jerusalem holds significant importance as the city of David and the future site of the Temple, symbolizing God's presence among His people. This offer can be seen as a type of Christ, who invites believers to be with Him in the New Jerusalem, as described in <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2-3</a>. David's invitation to Barzillai foreshadows the eternal fellowship believers will have with Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, David is the king of Israel who is returning to Jerusalem after the rebellion of his son Absalom.
