This reflects David's role as a king who seeks to rectify past wrongs and restore justice. The Gibeonites were a group that had made a covenant with Israel during Joshua's leadership (Joshua 9), and David's actions here demonstrate the importance of honoring covenants, even those made under deceptive circumstances. This also highlights David's role as a mediator, a type of Christ who intercedes on behalf of others.<p><b>(Now the Gibeonites were not Israelites, but a remnant of the Amorites.</b><br>The Gibeonites are identified as a remnant of the Amorites, a group that inhabited Canaan before the Israelites. This distinction emphasizes their status as outsiders within Israel. The term "remnant" suggests survival despite adversity, which is a recurring theme in the Bible. The Amorites were one of the peoples God commanded Israel to drive out (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>), yet the Gibeonites' survival and integration into Israelite society through a covenant show God's mercy and the complexity of His plans.<p><b>The Israelites had taken an oath concerning them,</b><br>This refers to the covenant made in <a href="/joshua/9.htm">Joshua 9</a>, where the Israelites, led by Joshua, swore an oath to let the Gibeonites live, despite their deceptive approach. The oath was made in the name of the LORD, making it binding and sacred. This highlights the biblical principle that oaths made before God must be honored (<a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>). The importance of keeping one's word is a theme that runs throughout Scripture, reflecting God's own faithfulness to His promises.<p><b>but in his zeal for Israel and Judah, Saul had sought to kill them.)</b><br>Saul's actions against the Gibeonites were driven by a misguided zeal, which led to the breaking of the covenant. This reflects Saul's pattern of disobedience and impulsive decisions, which ultimately led to his downfall. His actions contrast with David's efforts to uphold justice and righteousness. Saul's zeal, while intended to protect Israel, resulted in sin and consequences for the nation, illustrating the dangers of zeal without knowledge (<a href="/romans/10-2.htm">Romans 10:2</a>). Saul's failure to honor the covenant foreshadows the need for a true and faithful king, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who perfectly upholds God's law and covenants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The king of Israel who seeks to address a famine in the land by consulting the Gibeonites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeonites.htm">Gibeonites</a></b><br>A non-Israelite group, specifically a remnant of the Amorites, who had a covenant with Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The former king of Israel who violated the covenant with the Gibeonites by attempting to annihilate them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel who had sworn an oath to the Gibeonites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/amorites.htm">Amorites</a></b><br>An ancient people, of whom the Gibeonites were a remnant.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_keeping_covenants.htm">The Importance of Keeping Covenants</a></b><br>God expects His people to honor their commitments, even when made under less-than-ideal circumstances.

The story of the Gibeonites and of Joshua's league with them is told in Joshua 9, but Saul's attempt to destroy them is mentioned only here. It is plain, from what is said of them in <a href="/2_samuel/21-8.htm" title="But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:">2Samuel 21:8</a>, that they had never become incorporated with the Israelites by circumcision, but remained a distinct people. Saul's sin consisted in the violation of the solemn oath, in the Lord's name, by which the nation of Israel was bound to the Gibeonites. "His zeal" in that case was of the same ungodly character with many other acts of his reign, in which pride, arrogance, and self-will were cloaked under a zeal for God's honour and His people's welfare.<p><span class= "bld">The Amorites.</span>--More precisely, the Gibeonites were <span class= "ital">Hivites </span>(<a href="/joshua/9-7.htm" title="And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, Peradventure you dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?">Joshua 9:7</a>); but they are called Amorites (=<span class= "ital">mountaineers</span>) as a frequent general name for the old people of Palestine.<p>Two questions are often asked in connection with this narrative: (1) Why the punishment of Saul's sin should have been so long delayed? and (2) why it should at last have fallen upon David and his people, who had no share in the commission of the sin? The answer to both questions is in the fact that Israel both sinned and was punished <span class= "ital">as a nation. </span>Saul slew the Gibeonites, not simply as the son of Kish, but as the king of Israel, and therefore involved all Israel with him in the violation of the national oath; and hence, until the evil should be put away by the execution of the immediate offender or his representatives, all Israel must suffer. The lesson of the continuity of the nation's life, and of its continued responsibility from age to age, was greatly enhanced by the delay. Besides this, there were so many other grievous sins for which Saul was to be punished, that it was hardly possible to bring out during his lifetime the special Divine displeasure at this one.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul sought to slay them in his zeal.</span> We gather from various incidental circumstances that Saul, in some part of his reign, manifested great zeal in an attempt to carry out literally the enactments of the Levitical Law; but he seems to have done so with the same ferocity as that which he displayed in slaughtering the priests at Nob with their wives and children. Thus he had put to death wizards and all who dealt with familiar spirits (<a href="/1_samuel/28-9.htm">1 Samuel 28:9</a>), in accordance with <a href="/exodus/22-18.htm">Exodus 22:18</a> and <a href="/leviticus/20-6.htm">Leviticus 20:6</a>. In the same way he seems to have tried to exterminate the aboriginal inhabitants of Palestine, in accordance with <a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>, and had especially massacred a large number of Gibeonites, in violation of the covenant made with them by Joshua and all Israel (<a href="/joshua/9-3.htm">Joshua 9:3, 15-27</a>). And as he would thus acquire "fields and vineyards" robbed from them to give to his captains, his conduct was probably popular, and the cause of a general system of wrong and oppression practised upon all the natives. It had thus become a national sin, and as such was punished by a national calamity. Amorites; that is highlanders, mountaineers. Strictly they were Hivites (<a href="/joshua/9-7.htm">Joshua 9:7</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/21-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At this, David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1435;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
