Sacrifices were central to Israelite worship, and by participating in them, Absalom could present himself as a pious leader. This act might also have been intended to invoke divine favor for his rebellion. The offering of sacrifices was a common practice in ancient Israel, often associated with covenant-making and seeking divine guidance or blessing.<p><b>he sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David&#8217;s counselor</b><br>Ahithophel was a highly respected advisor to King David, known for his wisdom and insight. His defection to Absalom was a significant blow to David, as Ahithophel's counsel was considered almost as if one were consulting the word of God (<a href="/2_samuel/16-23.htm">2 Samuel 16:23</a>). Ahithophel's hometown, Giloh, was located in the hill country of Judah, indicating his close proximity to the political center of Israel. His betrayal may have been motivated by personal grievances, possibly related to David's sin with Bathsheba, as Ahithophel was Bathsheba's grandfather.<p><b>to come from his hometown of Giloh</b><br>Giloh was a town in the tribal territory of Judah, south of Jerusalem. Its mention highlights the geographical and tribal dynamics at play in Absalom's rebellion. The call for Ahithophel to join Absalom from Giloh signifies the strategic gathering of influential figures to support the coup. This move underscores the political maneuvering and alliances that were crucial in ancient Near Eastern power struggles.<p><b>So the conspiracy gained strength</b><br>The conspiracy refers to Absalom's plot to overthrow his father, King David. The involvement of Ahithophel, a key figure in David's administration, lent credibility and strategic advantage to Absalom's cause. The phrase indicates the growing momentum of the rebellion, as more people were persuaded to join Absalom. This reflects the fragile nature of political power in ancient Israel, where loyalty could shift rapidly.<p><b>and Absalom&#8217;s following kept increasing</b><br>Absalom's growing following suggests widespread discontent with David's rule or admiration for Absalom's charisma and leadership. Absalom had already won the hearts of many Israelites by presenting himself as a just and accessible leader (<a href="/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15:1-6</a>). This increase in support highlights the political and social dynamics of the time, where public opinion and personal loyalty played crucial roles in the success of a ruler. The narrative foreshadows the impending conflict between Absalom and David, a theme that resonates with the broader biblical motif of familial and political strife.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The son of King David, who conspires against his father to take over the throne of Israel.

Absalom leverages sacrifice, Ahithophel&#8217;s reputation, and swelling support to challenge God&#8217;s anointed king. Yet beneath the pageantry lies pride, betrayal, and inevitable judgment. The verse calls readers to discern genuine devotion, choose godly counsel, and remember that success measured by human acclaim can quickly unravel when it opposes the Lord&#8217;s sovereign plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Sent for Ahithophel.</span>--Giloh, the city of Ahithophel, was one of the groups of towns just south of Hebron (<a href="/joshua/15-51.htm" title="And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages:">Joshua 15:51</a>), and Ahithophel may have gone there in readiness to be summoned by Absalom. Why he deserted David does not appear. It has been conjectured that he was aggrieved at David's treatment of Bath-sheba, who is supposed to have been his granddaughter. Bath-sheba's father was Eliam (<a href="/2_samuel/11-3.htm" title="And David sent and inquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?">2Samuel 11:3</a>) and Ahithophel had a son Eliam (<a href="/2_samuel/23-34.htm" title="Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite, Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,">2Samuel 23:34</a>), but there is no evidence that these were the same, and if they had been, Ahithophel probably would have felt honoured rather than aggrieved that his daughter should have been made queen. It is more likely that Ahithophel and many others of the tribe of Judah were alienated because, in the rapidly growing empire of David, their relative importance was of necessity constantly diminishing. It is noteworthy that the rebellion was cradled in Judah, and seems to have found there its chief strength.<p>There is a difference of opinion whether Psalms 41 was written on this occasion; but its ninth verse certainly applies very pointedly to Ahithophel; and his conduct, both in his treachery and his suicide, forms a striking parallel to that of Judas, to whom this verse is applied in <a href="/john/13-18.htm" title="I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.">John 13:18</a>. Many writers also consider that Psalms 55 was composed with reference to Ahithophel.<p><span class= "bld">While he offered sacrifices.</span>--Absalom had arranged these, apparently with pomp and circumstance, to continue through several days. This gave time for the conspiracy to gain strength, and the accompanying feasting allowed Absalom an excellent opportunity for using his popular arts, and with such success that "the people increased continually with Absalom."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ahithophel the Gilonite.</span> The desertion of David by Ahithophel is in every way remarkable, even if he were Bathsheba's grandfather (see note on 2 Samuel 11:3). For he was far too subtle a man to have joined the conspiracy unless he bad felt reasonably sure that it would be successful. Successful it would have been had his advice been followed; but so correctly did he estimate the result if David were allowed time to gather his friends, that, when his counsel was rejected, he withdrew immediately to Giloh, and committed suicide. Still if the revolt had been successful, it would have involved, if not the death of Bathsheba, yet certainly that of her sons, and the exclusion of Ahithophel's great-grandchildren from the throne. In <a href="/psalms/41.htm">Psalm 41</a>, written at this time, we learn what were David's feelings when he heard the news of this conspiracy, and Ahithophel is the familiar friend, in whom he had trusted, and who had eaten at his table, but now raised up his heel to kick at him. In <a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a> the words are quoted of Judas Iscariot, of whom Ahithophel was a type in his treachery and in his death by his own hand. The translation, "sent for Ahithophel," cannot be maintained. The Hebrew is "sent Ahithophel," but for what purpose or on what embassy is not mentioned. As thus something must have dropped out of the Hebrew text, it possibly may be the preposition "for," as this gives a good sense. For Giloh, Ahithophel's town, was situated a few miles to the south of Hebron (<a href="/joshua/15-51.htm">Joshua 15:51</a>), and Ahithophel had probably been working there secretly for Absalom for some time. As David's counsellor, his proper place of residence would have been Jerusalem, but the conspiracy had been kept so secret that he had been able to get away without suspicion. He is now summoned to Absalom's side, and his presence there brings in so many adherents that a rapid march on Jerusalem might have put David into their power. The Revised Version is right in translating, <span class="cmt_word">while he offered the sacrifices;</span> namely, those which he had vowed, and which were the reason given for his visit to Hebron. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/15-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">While [Absalom] was offering</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1494;&#1464;&#1489;&#1456;&#1495;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;z&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
