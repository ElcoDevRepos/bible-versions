This event marks the completion of the judgment pronounced by Nathan the prophet in <a href="/2_samuel/12-14.htm">2 Samuel 12:14</a>. The child&#8217;s death is a direct consequence of David&#8217;s sin with Bathsheba, illustrating the seriousness of sin and its repercussions. The seventh day also holds cultural significance, as it was the day of circumcision for Hebrew male infants, a covenantal sign between God and His people (<a href="/genesis/17-12.htm">Genesis 17:12</a>).<p><b>But David&#8217;s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead,</b><br>The fear of David&#8217;s servants reflects the gravity of the situation and their understanding of David&#8217;s emotional state. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, kings were often seen as powerful and potentially volatile figures. The servants&#8217; fear indicates their concern for David&#8217;s reaction, knowing his deep grief and previous behavior during the child&#8217;s illness. This also highlights the hierarchical nature of ancient societies, where servants had to carefully navigate their interactions with their superiors.<p><b>for they said, &#8220;Look, while the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he would not listen to us.</b><br>This phrase underscores David&#8217;s intense mourning and his refusal to be comforted or distracted from his vigil for the child. It reflects a common human response to impending loss, where individuals may become withdrawn or unresponsive. The servants&#8217; observation also points to David&#8217;s deep remorse and repentance, as he fasted and prayed for the child&#8217;s life, hoping for God&#8217;s mercy despite the prophetic word of judgment.<p><b>So how can we tell him the child is dead?</b><br>The servants&#8217; question reveals their dilemma and the potential consequences of delivering bad news to a grieving king. In the context of ancient Israel, messengers of bad news often faced danger, as seen in other biblical accounts (e.g., <a href="/2_samuel/1-15.htm">2 Samuel 1:15-16</a>). This reflects the broader cultural understanding of the messenger&#8217;s role and the weight of their message.<p><b>He may even harm himself.&#8221;</b><br>The concern that David might harm himself indicates the depth of his despair and the servants&#8217; awareness of his fragile emotional state. This phrase highlights the potential for self-destructive behavior in the face of overwhelming grief and guilt. It also serves as a reminder of the human tendency to react intensely to personal tragedy, especially when compounded by feelings of responsibility and remorse. The servants&#8217; fear for David&#8217;s well-being underscores the communal aspect of grief and the importance of support during times of crisis.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who committed adultery with Bathsheba and orchestrated the death of her husband, Uriah.

Their fear mirrors messengers dreading to relay devastating news to a leader (<a href="/1_samuel/4-17.htm">1 Samuel 4:17&#8211;18</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/18-32.htm">2 Samuel 18:32&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226; They anticipate an uncontrolled response, remembering David&#8217;s earlier explosive anger toward Nathan&#8217;s parable (12:5).<p>&#8226; Scripture shows that intense sorrow can unsettle even the strongest of believers (<a href="/job/3-1.htm">Job 3:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-38.htm">Matthew 26:38</a>), yet the servants overlook that true repentance produces humility, not rage.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Look, while the child was alive, we spoke to him, and he would not listen to us.</b><p>(v. 18c)<p>&#8226; David had turned a deaf ear to every attempt at comfort, choosing concentrated intercession instead (v. 16). This echoes Job&#8217;s friends who sat in silence, sensing words would not penetrate deep anguish (<a href="/job/2-13.htm">Job 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s refusal signals single-minded dependence on God; no human word could replace divine mercy (<a href="/psalms/62-5.htm">Psalm 62:5</a>).<p>&#8226; It also reveals genuine faith: as long as life remained, he believed God might relent, much like Moses interceding for Israel after the golden calf (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So how can we tell him the child is dead? He may even harm himself.</b><p>(v. 18d)<p>&#8226; Ancient culture recognized self-destructive acts in overwhelming grief (<a href="/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-5.htm">Matthew 27:5</a>). The servants fear David could follow such a path.<p>&#8226; They misjudge him; David&#8217;s anguish is deep, yet it is anchored in trust. When he learns the truth, he will rise, worship, and eat (vv. 19&#8211;20), illustrating &#8220;sorrowful, yet always rejoicing&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-10.htm">2 Corinthians 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers&#8217; grief differs from hopeless despair (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>). David&#8217;s later words, &#8220;I will go to him, but he will not return to me&#8221; (v. 23), affirm confidence in God&#8217;s eternal care.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/12-18.htm">2 Samuel 12:18</a> records the precise fulfillment of divine judgment, the servants&#8217; fear of David&#8217;s reaction, and their assumption that his grief might dissolve into self-destruction. Yet the verse sets the stage for David&#8217;s surprising response of worship and acceptance, teaching that true repentance rests in God&#8217;s sovereignty, trusts His justice, and grieves with hope.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/12-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On the seventh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#8216;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
