In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a>, David is expressing his faithfulness to God amidst trials and victories. The "ways of the LORD" refer to the moral and ethical guidelines given by God, as seen in the Torah, particularly the laws given to Moses. David's adherence to these ways is a testament to his devotion and righteousness, which is a recurring theme in his life, despite his known failures. This commitment is echoed in <a href="/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119:1-3</a>, where the psalmist speaks of the blessings of walking in the law of the Lord. David's life, though marked by sin, ultimately points to a heart aligned with God's will, prefiguring the perfect obedience of Jesus Christ, who perfectly kept the ways of the Lord.<p><b>and have not wickedly departed from my God.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the conscious decision to remain faithful to God and not turn away in rebellion or sin. The term "wickedly departed" suggests a deliberate and sinful abandonment of God's path. In the historical context, Israel often struggled with idolatry and turning away from God, as seen in the cycles of sin and repentance in the Book of Judges. David's declaration here is significant because it highlights his resolve to stay true to God, contrasting with the behavior of many of his contemporaries. This steadfastness is a key aspect of David's character, despite his personal failings, such as the incident with Bathsheba. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of covenant faithfulness, where God calls His people to remain loyal to Him, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13-15</a>. David's life foreshadows the ultimate faithfulness of Christ, who never departed from God and fulfilled the law perfectly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this song of praise, David is reflecting on his life and God's faithfulness.

speaks of a well-worn road; David is saying, &#8220;I stayed on God&#8217;s road instead of clearing my own shortcut.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/psalms/119-3.htm">Psalm 119:3</a> echoes this: &#8220;They do no iniquity; they walk in His ways.&#8221;<p>- Joshua urged the same loyalty: &#8220;Walk in all His ways, keep His commandments&#8230; cling to Him&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/22-5.htm">Joshua 22:5</a>).<p>- Practical takeaway: the verse invites us to examine whether the decisions we make&#8212;big and small&#8212;trace the contours of Scripture&#8217;s clear track.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and have not wickedly departed</b><p>- Departure implies turning aside; &#8220;wickedly&#8221; stresses deliberate rebellion, not accidental misstep.<p>- Job was commended for avoiding such a turn: &#8220;He was blameless and upright, fearing God and shunning evil&#8221; (<a href="/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>).<p>- <a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12</a> warns believers: &#8220;See to it&#8230; that none of you has a wicked heart of unbelief that turns away from the living God.&#8221;<p>- Bullet points that mark a heart refusing to depart:<p>&#8226;

God, but &#8220;my&#8221; God. Covenant language frames obedience as relational, not mechanical.<p>- <a href="/psalms/16-8.htm">Psalm 16:8</a>: &#8220;I have set the LORD always before me. Because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.&#8221;<p>- New-covenant believers share the same intimacy: &#8220;Abide in Me, and I in you&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4</a>).<p>- Remaining close to God fuels the resolve described in the first two clauses; devotion drives obedience, and obedience deepens devotion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/22-22.htm">2 Samuel 22:22</a> pictures the heart of a faithful servant. David declares that he deliberately stayed on God&#8217;s path, refused conscious rebellion, and guarded a personal, covenant bond with the Lord. The verse challenges us to walk the same steady road, resist every lure to stray, and cherish the nearness of &#8220;my God,&#8221; knowing He empowers the obedience He commands.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/22-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have kept</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1430;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;mar&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8104.htm">Strong's 8104: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hedge about, guard, to protect, attend to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the ways</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(dar&#183;&#7733;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1870.htm">Strong's 1870: </a> </span><span class="str2">A road, a course of life, mode of action</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and have not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
