His impatience here reflects his pragmatic approach to leadership and warfare. Joab's decision to act swiftly contrasts with David's earlier instructions to deal gently with Absalom, highlighting Joab's prioritization of military strategy over personal loyalty. This moment underscores the tension between Joab and David, which is a recurring theme in their relationship.<p><b>And he took three spears in his hand</b><br>The use of three spears signifies a thorough and determined action. In biblical numerology, the number three often represents completeness or perfection. Joab's choice to use three spears may symbolize his intent to ensure the finality of Absalom's demise. Spears were common weapons in ancient warfare, and their mention here emphasizes the violent and direct nature of Joab's actions.<p><b>and thrust them through the heart of Absalom</b><br>The heart, in biblical terms, is often seen as the center of life and emotion. By targeting Absalom's heart, Joab ensures his death, symbolizing the end of Absalom's rebellion and the threat to David's kingdom. This act of violence fulfills the consequences of Absalom's earlier actions, including his rebellion against his father, David. It also serves as a stark reminder of the brutal realities of ancient Near Eastern politics and warfare.<p><b>while he was still alive in the oak tree.</b><br>Absalom's entanglement in the oak tree is a vivid image of his downfall. The oak tree, a symbol of strength and endurance, ironically becomes the instrument of Absalom's demise. This scene can be seen as a divine intervention, where nature itself plays a role in executing justice. Absalom's predicament in the tree also echoes themes of pride and downfall found throughout scripture, such as in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, known for his military prowess and sometimes ruthless actions.

Each phrase underscores Joab&#8217;s impatience with hesitation, personal accountability for enforcing what he sees as justice, and God&#8217;s overarching judgment on rebellion. The verse teaches that earthly power misused invites divine reckoning, and that God&#8217;s purposes prevail even through flawed human actions.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">I may not tarry thus.</span>--Joab evidently feels the home-thrusts made by the man in the argument, but, determined on his deed of violence, he sees that it is worse than useless to delay. His act was simply murder. In a lawless age it was defensible as the one act which terminated the rebellion and made a renewal of it impossible, and destroyed a traitor and would-be parricide who was likely otherwise to escape punishment; but it was a distinct disobedience of express orders, and Joab's taking the execution into his own hands was wilful and deliberate murder.<p><span class= "bld">Three darts.</span>--The word means a <span class= "ital">rod </span>or <span class= "ital">staff. </span>Also the word <span class= "ital">heart </span>is the same as the following word <span class= "ital">midst, </span>and is not therefore to be taken too literally.

Then (<a href="/2_samuel/18-15.htm" title="And ten young men that bore Joab's armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.">2Samuel 18:15</a>) the ten men who had Joab's armour and weapons came up and finally killed Absalom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Three darts;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">three staves</span> (see <a href="/2_samuel/23-21.htm">2 Samuel 23:21</a>). The weapons of the ancients were of a very inferior kind, and stakes sharpened at the end and hardened in the fire were used by the infantry, until the increasing cheapness of iron made it possible to supply them with pikes. Joab's act was not one of intentional cruelty, but, picking up the first weapons that came to hand, he hurried away to kill his victim. His thrusts with these pointed sticks were brutal, and inflicted mortal wounds; but as they were not immediately fatal, Joab's armour bearers, who had followed him, and who had with them Joab's own better weapons, were called upon to put an end to Absalom's sufferings. <span class="cmt_word">His heart</span> does not mean that organ anatomically, but the middle of his body.
