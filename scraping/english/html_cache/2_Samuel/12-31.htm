The people mentioned are the surviving inhabitants of the city. In the context of ancient warfare, it was common for victors to take captives and utilize them for labor. This action reflects the practices of the time, where conquered peoples were often subjected to forced labor as a means of subjugation and economic benefit.<p><b>and put them to work with saws, iron picks, and axes</b><br>The tools mentioned here&#8212;saws, iron picks, and axes&#8212;indicate the type of labor the captives were forced into, likely involving construction or resource extraction. The use of iron tools suggests a level of technological advancement and the importance of these resources for building and infrastructure. This also highlights the harsh realities of ancient warfare, where the defeated were often put to work in difficult and demanding conditions.<p><b>and he made them work at the brick kilns</b><br>Brick kilns were essential for producing bricks used in construction, indicating that the labor was likely related to building projects, possibly fortifications or other structures. This reflects the strategic importance of Rabbah and other Ammonite cities, as controlling them would have provided economic and military advantages. The use of brick kilns also connects to the broader biblical theme of labor and servitude, reminiscent of the Israelites' own experience in Egypt.<p><b>He did the same to all the Ammonite cities</b><br>This phrase suggests that David's actions in Rabbah were not isolated but part of a broader campaign against the Ammonites. The systematic approach to subjugating and utilizing the conquered peoples underscores the thoroughness of David's military strategy. It also reflects the fulfillment of God's judgment against the Ammonites, as seen in earlier biblical narratives where the Ammonites opposed Israel.<p><b>Then David and all his troops returned to Jerusalem</b><br>The return to Jerusalem signifies the completion of the military campaign and a return to the center of David's kingdom. Jerusalem, as the political and spiritual capital, represents the consolidation of David's rule and the stability of his reign. This return also foreshadows the continued expansion and establishment of Israel under David's leadership, setting the stage for the future reign of Solomon and the building of the Temple.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his military conquests and his heart for God, yet also for his moral failings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A neighboring nation often in conflict with Israel, descendants of Lot.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, the political and spiritual center during David's reign.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/brick_kilns.htm">Brick Kilns</a></b><br>Facilities used for making bricks, indicating forced labor imposed on the conquered Ammonites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/troops.htm">Troops</a></b><br>The military forces of Israel under David's command, involved in the conquest and subjugation of the Ammonites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_justice_and_mercy.htm">Understanding Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>David's actions reflect the harsh realities of ancient warfare.

This literal account highlights (1) the king&#8217;s God-given authority over conquered peoples, (2) the divine judgment on Ammon&#8217;s longstanding hostility, and (3) the practical incorporation of enemy labor into Israel&#8217;s expanding infrastructure. Through it all, the passage affirms God&#8217;s justice, Israel&#8217;s protection, and the forward movement of His covenant purposes under David&#8217;s leadership.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">Put them under saws.</span>--The literal translation of the Hebrew (<span class= "ital">put them with, </span>or <span class= "ital">into, the saw</span>) does not give any good sense, and no doubt a single letter of the text should be changed, bringing it into agreement with <a href="/1_chronicles/20-3.htm" title="And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.">1Chronicles 20:3</a>, "cut them with saws." (Comp. <a href="/hebrews/11-37.htm" title="They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;">Hebrews 11:37</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Harrows of iron.</span>--These are the heavy iron tools, often armed with sharp points on the lower side, which were used for the purposes of threshing the grain and breaking up the straw.<p><span class= "bld">The brick-kiln.</span>--This is the reading of the Hebrew text, and there is no sufficient reason to call it in question. The Hebrew margin, however, has "through Malchan; "and hence some have supposed that David made the Ammonites pass through the same fire by which they were accustomed to consecrate their children to Molech.<p>In the infliction of these cruelties on his enemies David acted in accordance with the customs and the knowledge of his time. Abhorrent as they may be to the spirit of Christianity, David and his contemporaries took them as matters of course, without a suspicion that they were not in accordance with God's will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people that were therein.</span> The cruel treatment described in this verse was inflicted, first of all, upon those who had defended Rabbah, now reduced to a small number by the long siege; but David next proceeded through all the cities, that is, the fortified towns of the Ammonites, inflicting similar barbarities. They were confined probably to the fighting men, and most of these would make their escape as soon as resistance became hopeless. The general population would, of course, scatter themselves in every direction, but the misery caused by such a breaking up of civil life, as well as by the cruel bloodshed, must have been terrible. Instead of "he put them in a saw," we find, in <a href="/1_chronicles/20-3.htm">1 Chronicles 20:3</a>, "he sawed them with a saw." This reading differs from what we have here only in one letter, and is plainly right, as the translation, "under saws," "under harrows of iron," etc., found both in the Authorized and Revised Versions, is simply an expedient, tendered necessary by the corruption of the text. If we restore the passage by the help of the parallel place, it runs on thus: "He sawed with a saw, and with threshing sledges of iron, and with cutting instruments of iron." What exactly the second were we do not know, as the word does not occur elsewhere. The Vulgate renders it "wains shod with iron," meaning, apparently, those driven over the corn for threshing purposes, and now driven over these unfortunate people. The barbarity is not more horrible than that of sawing prisoners asunder. <span class="cmt_word">He made them pass through the brick kiln.</span> Both the Septuagint and Vulgate have "brick kiln," Hebrew, <span class="accented">malban</span>, which the Massorites have adopted, but the Hebrew text has <span class="accented">malchan.</span> No commentator has given any satisfactory explanation of what can be meant by making the Ammonites pass through a brick kiln; but Kimchi gives a very probable interpretation of the word really found in the Hebrew, and which, not being intelligible, has been corrupted. For the Malchan was, he says, the place where the Ammonites made their children pass through the fire to Moloch. He thinks, therefore, that David put some of the people to death in this way. We cannot defend these cruelties, but they unhappily were the rule in Oriental warfare, and would have been inflicted on their enemies by the Ammonites. We have proof in l <a href="/1_samuel/11-2.htm">1 Samuel 11:2</a> and <a href="/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13</a> that they were a barbarous race; but this did not justify barbarous retaliation. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/12-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[David] brought out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7779;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3318.htm">Strong's 3318: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, bring, out, direct and proxim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1448;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
