In ancient Israel, women sometimes played significant roles in diplomacy and conflict resolution, as seen with Abigail in <a href="/1_samuel/25.htm">1 Samuel 25</a>. Her wisdom is highlighted, suggesting she was respected and had influence over the city's inhabitants. This reflects the cultural context where wisdom was highly valued, and elders or wise individuals often mediated disputes. Her actions align with <a href="/proverbs/14.htm">Proverbs 14:1</a>, which speaks of a wise woman building her house.<p><b>and they cut off the head of Sheba son of Bichri and threw it to Joab</b><br>Sheba, a Benjamite, had rebelled against King David, declaring, "We have no share in David" (<a href="/2_samuel/20.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>). His rebellion threatened the unity of Israel. The act of beheading Sheba and throwing his head to Joab was a decisive and brutal method to end the rebellion, common in ancient Near Eastern warfare. This act also fulfilled the woman's promise to Joab, demonstrating the seriousness with which the people of Abel Beth Maacah took her counsel. It reflects the harsh realities of justice and loyalty in the historical context of Israel's monarchy.<p><b>So he blew the ram&#8217;s horn and his men dispersed from the city, each to his own home</b><br>The blowing of the ram's horn, or shofar, was a signal for various purposes, including the end of a battle or assembly (<a href="/joshua/6-5.htm">Joshua 6:5</a>). Here, it signifies the cessation of hostilities and the successful resolution of the conflict. The dispersal of Joab's men indicates the restoration of peace and order. This action underscores the importance of the shofar in Israelite culture as a tool for communication and divine intervention, as seen in the fall of Jericho.<p><b>And Joab returned to the king in Jerusalem</b><br>Joab, the commander of David's army, was a central figure in maintaining the king's power. His return to Jerusalem signifies the restoration of David's authority and the end of the immediate threat to his reign. Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Israel, was where David's throne was established, fulfilling God's promise to David in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>.

Incensed as David must have been at the murder of Amasa following so quickly upon that of Absalom, yet that very act proved Joab's determination, and left the king powerless. He must have felt, too, that Joab was indispensable for the maintenance of peace and order in his dominions, and that he was at the least faithful to himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/20-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the woman</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;i&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
