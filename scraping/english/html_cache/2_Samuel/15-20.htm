The mention of "yesterday" underscores the immediacy and unexpected nature of his loyalty. Gath was a Philistine city, and Ittai's allegiance to David, a former enemy of the Philistines, is significant. It reflects the magnetic leadership of David and foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles into God's plan, as seen in the New Testament.<p><b>should I make you wander around with us today</b><br>David is in the midst of fleeing from his son Absalom, who has usurped the throne. The term "wander" suggests the uncertainty and instability of David's current situation. This mirrors the wilderness wanderings of Israel and the transient nature of life. It also reflects the cost of discipleship, as Jesus later speaks of the Son of Man having no place to lay His head (<a href="/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>).<p><b>while I do not know where I am going?</b><br>David's admission of uncertainty is a rare glimpse into the vulnerability of a king who is often seen as a man after God's own heart. This moment of humility and reliance on God is reminiscent of Abraham's journey by faith, not knowing his destination (<a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8</a>). It underscores the theme of trusting God amidst uncertainty.<p><b>Go back and take your brothers with you.</b><br>David offers Ittai the opportunity to return to safety, showing his concern for the well-being of Ittai and his men. This reflects the biblical principle of caring for others and putting their needs above one's own. It also highlights the theme of free will in choosing to follow God's anointed, paralleling the choice given to followers of Christ.<p><b>May the LORD show you loving devotion and faithfulness.&#8221;</b><br>David invokes a blessing upon Ittai, using terms that are central to God's covenant relationship with His people. "Loving devotion" (chesed) and "faithfulness" (emet) are attributes of God frequently mentioned in the Psalms. This blessing is a prayer for God's covenantal love and reliability to be upon Ittai, reflecting the blessings promised to those who align themselves with God's purposes. It also points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's loving devotion and faithfulness in Jesus Christ, who embodies these attributes perfectly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is fleeing from his son Absalom's rebellion.

Though anointed king, he is presently displaced by Absalom&#8217;s revolt (<a href="/2_samuel/15-14.htm">2 Samuel 15:14</a>).<p>&#8226; His question shows humility; he refuses to drag others into peril merely for his sake (cf. <a href="/psalms/31-15.htm">Psalm 31:15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Wander&#8221; evokes Israel&#8217;s earlier wilderness experience, reminding readers that the Lord, not David, ultimately guides the journey (De 8:2).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go back and take your brothers with you.</b><p>&#8226; David gives Ittai permission to return to Jerusalem, ensuring the safety of his troops and families.<p>&#8226; He models servant leadership:<p>&#8211; Protecting the vulnerable rather than demanding allegiance (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p>&#8211; Valuing those who remain behind as much as those who fight (<a href="/1_samuel/30-23.htm">1 Samuel 30:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; The plural &#8220;brothers&#8221; shows concern for the entire company, not just its leader.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>May the LORD show you loving devotion and faithfulness.</b><p>&#8226; David&#8217;s benediction invokes the Lord&#8217;s &#8220;loving devotion (&#7717;esed) and faithfulness&#8221; &#8212; covenant terms that guarantee steadfast mercy (<a href="/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a>).<p>&#8226; By blessing a foreigner this way, David echoes his covenant mindset with Jonathan (<a href="/1_samuel/20-13.htm">1 Samuel 20:13-14</a>) and foreshadows Christ&#8217;s inclusion of the nations (<a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34-35</a>).<p>&#8226; Though released, Ittai&#8217;s later choice to stay (<a href="/2_samuel/15-21.htm">2 Samuel 15:21-22</a>) illustrates how genuine grace invites, rather than coerces, loyal commitment (2 <a href="/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David&#8217;s words in <a href="/2_samuel/15-20.htm">2 Samuel 15:20</a> reveal a king who honors freedom, practices humility, safeguards others, and trusts God&#8217;s covenant love. He releases a new follower from obligation, acknowledges his own uncertain path, protects the larger group, and entrusts all to the Lord&#8217;s steadfast mercy. The verse therefore teaches that true leadership rests on grace and faith, inviting voluntary loyalty while depending wholly on God&#8217;s unfailing loving-kindness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/15-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In fact, you arrived</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1462;&#1431;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;e&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct &#124;
