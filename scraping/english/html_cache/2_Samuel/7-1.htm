The palace, often referred to as the "House of Cedar," was a symbol of David's established kingship and God's blessing upon him. The construction of the palace was made possible through the alliance with Hiram, king of Tyre, who provided cedar wood and skilled laborers (<a href="/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>). This period marks a time of political stability and consolidation of power for David, who had previously been a fugitive and warrior. The palace signifies a transition from a nomadic lifestyle to a settled monarchy, reflecting God's promise to establish David's kingdom.<p><b>and the LORD had given him rest from all his enemies around him</b><br>This phrase highlights a period of peace and security granted by God to David, following years of conflict with surrounding nations and internal strife. The "rest" from enemies is a fulfillment of God's covenantal promises to Israel, where obedience would lead to peace and prosperity (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10</a>). David's victories over the Philistines, Moabites, Ammonites, and other adversaries (2 Samuel 8) were seen as divine interventions, affirming God's favor and protection. This rest is not just physical but also spiritual, as it allows David to focus on establishing a central place of worship for the nation. Theologically, this rest prefigures the ultimate rest found in Christ, who offers peace and reconciliation with God (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, David is the king of Israel who has established his rule and is experiencing a period of peace.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel who has granted David rest from his enemies, signifying divine favor and fulfillment of His promises.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/palace.htm">Palace</a></b><br>The royal residence of King David in Jerusalem, symbolizing stability and the establishment of his kingdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The surrounding nations and groups that had previously been in conflict with Israel, now subdued under David's leadership.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rest.htm">Rest</a></b><br>A period of peace and security, indicating a time of divine blessing and fulfillment of God's promises to David.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_rest_and_fulfillment.htm">Divine Rest and Fulfillment</a></b><br>God's faithfulness is evident in providing rest to David, fulfilling His promises.

He is no longer running from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>) or fighting for recognition by the tribes (<a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; God had already provided material confirmation of David&#8217;s kingship: &#8220;Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David&#8230; cedar wood, carpenters and stonemasons, and they built a palace for David&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11&#8211;12</a>). The palace therefore represents:<p>&#8211; Fulfillment of God&#8217;s promise to raise David &#8220;from the pasture to rule&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70&#8211;71</a>).<p>&#8211; A visible, permanent base from which David can now focus on spiritual leadership, as he soon will with plans for the temple (<a href="/2_samuel/7-2.htm">2 Samuel 7:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The fact that David is &#8220;settled&#8221; echoes earlier covenant language: God brings His people &#8220;into great and splendid cities they did not build&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10&#8211;11</a>), showing His covenant faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the LORD had given him rest</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;And the LORD had given him rest&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-1.htm">2 Samuel 7:1</a>b) highlights that the peace is God-granted, not self-achieved. Similar wording appears when Joshua&#8217;s conquests pause: &#8220;The LORD gave them rest on every side&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/21-44.htm">Joshua 21:44</a>).<p>&#8226; Rest is God&#8217;s intended blessing for obedient kingship (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10</a>).

The verse sets the stage for God&#8217;s covenant promise that follows, showing that stability and rest are gifts from the LORD, intended to free His servant to pursue deeper fellowship and future kingdom purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Had given him rest.</span>--No intimation is given of how long this may have been after the events narrated in the last chapter; but it is evident that this narrative is placed here, not because it followed chronologically, but because it is closely related in subject, and the historian, after telling of the removal of the ark, wished to record in that connection David's further purposes in the same direction. It must have been after the successful close of David's principal foreign wars--"rest round about from all his enemies"--and the future in <a href="/2_samuel/7-10.htm" title="Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,">2Samuel 7:10</a> does not necessarily imply that it was before the birth of Solomon; yet it is more likely to have been in a time of quiet prosperity, before the troubles of his latter years.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the king sat in his house.</span> The order is not chronological; for the words, <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah had given him rest from all his enemies round about</span> (so the Revised Version, rightly), imply the successful termination, not of all wars necessarily, but certainly of something more than that with the Philistine invaders in the Rephaim valley. A general summary of all David's wars is given in ch. 8, and it was probably after he had subdued the Philistines and Moab, and his throne was now fully established, that in some time of peace, possibly before Hanun forced him into wars which won for him an empire, David sent for Nathan, and told him his full desire. Its position here immediately after the account of the bringing of the ark to Zion has a higher unity than that of chronology. It shows that David had always a larger purpose than the mere placing of the ark in its feint; and, as soon as a period of tranquillity arrived, he confided his thoughts to the prophet. Thus, with only one step taken towards his whole plan, David exercised a wise moderation in leaving the service at Gibeon unmolested. As regards the word "rest," we have to distinguish between the first series of wars, which established David firmly on his throne, and the second series, which gave him widespread dominion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/7-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1429;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
