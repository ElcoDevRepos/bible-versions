David's military prowess and leadership were evident when he defeated Goliath (1 Samuel 17). Despite Saul being the anointed king, David was recognized by the people for his capabilities. This reflects the tension between Saul and David, as Saul became increasingly jealous of David's success and popularity (<a href="/1_samuel/18-7.htm">1 Samuel 18:7-9</a>).<p><b>you were the one who led Israel out and brought them back</b><br>David's leadership in military campaigns is highlighted here. He was a successful commander, leading Israel in battles against the Philistines and other enemies (<a href="/1_samuel/18-13.htm">1 Samuel 18:13-16</a>). This phrase also echoes the role of a shepherd, guiding and protecting the flock, which is a recurring theme in David's life, as he was a shepherd before becoming king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11</a>).<p><b>And to you the LORD said</b><br>This indicates divine selection and anointing. David was chosen by God to be king, as seen when Samuel anointed him (<a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12-13</a>). This divine choice sets David apart from Saul, whose kingship was rejected by God due to disobedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>).<p><b>&#8216;You will shepherd My people Israel</b><br>The metaphor of shepherding is significant, as it implies care, guidance, and protection. David's experience as a literal shepherd prepared him for his role as king. This imagery is also prophetic, pointing to Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>). The shepherd motif underscores the pastoral and kingly responsibilities of leadership.<p><b>and you will be ruler over them.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This confirms David's role as king, fulfilling God's promise. David's kingship is a type of Christ's eternal reign, as Jesus is often referred to as the King of Kings (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).

Captain; Hebrew, <span class="accented">nagid</span>, prince; so the Revised Version (and see note on 1 Samuel 9:16). The word refers not to military matters, but to the civil administration. David had proved himself a competent leader in war when Saul was king. What Jehovah now gives is the government of Israel in time of peace. The Authorized Version renders "captain" from not perceiving that the Divine promise ensured to David far more than a military chieftainship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/5-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Even</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(gam-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1571.htm">Strong's 1571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assemblage, also, even, yea, though, both, and</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in times past,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;il&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8032.htm">Strong's 8032: </a> </span><span class="str2">Three days ago, day before, yesterday</span><br /><br /><span class="word">while Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1448;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(bih&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
