In the context of Absalom's rebellion against King David, the young man represents the ever-present danger of being discovered. The mention of Absalom underscores the tension and division within Israel at this time, as Absalom sought to usurp his father David's throne. This incident reflects the broader theme of loyalty and betrayal that runs throughout the narrative of David's reign. The young man's actions also serve as a reminder of the vigilance required in times of political upheaval.<p><b>So the two left quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim.</b><br>The two men referred to here are Jonathan and Ahimaaz, who were acting as messengers for David. Their quick departure indicates the urgency and danger of their mission. Bahurim is a village in the territory of Benjamin, east of Jerusalem. It is significant as a place of refuge and danger; previously, Shimei cursed David here (<a href="/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5-13</a>). The choice of Bahurim as a hiding place suggests a network of loyal supporters to David, even in areas that might be hostile. This reflects the divided loyalties within the kingdom during Absalom's rebellion.<p><b>He had a well in his courtyard, and they climbed down into it.</b><br>The well in the courtyard serves as a hiding place, illustrating the resourcefulness and quick thinking required in times of crisis. Wells were common features in ancient Near Eastern homes, often used for water storage, but here it becomes a means of concealment. This act of hiding in a well can be seen as a type of Christ, who often withdrew to solitary places for prayer and safety (<a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>). The imagery of descending into a well also evokes themes of death and resurrection, as wells are deep and dark, yet they provide life-sustaining water. This can be seen as a metaphor for the trials and deliverance experienced by God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The son of King David who rebelled against his father, seeking to usurp the throne of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_young_man.htm">The Young Man</a></b><br>An unnamed individual who observed the two messengers and reported their presence to Absalom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_two_messengers.htm">The Two Messengers</a></b><br>Jonathan and Ahimaaz, who were loyal to King David and were carrying a message to him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bahurim.htm">Bahurim</a></b><br>A village in the territory of Benjamin, known for its strategic location and its role in various biblical accounts.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_with_the_well.htm">The Man with the Well</a></b><br>An unnamed ally of David who provided refuge to Jonathan and Ahimaaz by hiding them in his well.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/loyalty_in_times_of_crisis.htm">Loyalty in Times of Crisis</a></b><br>Jonathan and Ahimaaz demonstrate loyalty to David, risking their lives to deliver crucial information.

The word "lad" does not mean a boy; more probably he was one of the young men who formed Absalom's body guard, like the ten "lads," translated "young men," in <a href="/2_samuel/18-15.htm">2 Samuel 18:15</a>, Who bare Joab's armour. It Would be his duty to seize them, but when he tried to approach them, they fled, and made their way at full speed to Bahurim, where they were saved by the shrewdness and fidelity of a woman. Two such fleet runners would have had no difficulty in outstripping a boy, but one of Absalom's young men would have roused the neighbourhood to join in the pursuit. The well in his court really signifies a cistern for storing rainwater; but it was at that time dry, and served as a convenient hiding place for the two messengers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/17-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But a young man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1428;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(na&#183;&#8216;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5288.htm">Strong's 5288: </a> </span><span class="str2">A boy, lad, youth, retainer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did see</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
