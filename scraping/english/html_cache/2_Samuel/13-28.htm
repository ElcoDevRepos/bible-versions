This reflects the deep-seated animosity following Amnon's violation of their sister Tamar. The use of "young men" indicates Absalom's authority and influence, as he commands his servants to carry out his will, a common practice for those of noble status in ancient Israel.<p><b>Watch Amnon until his heart is merry with wine</b><br>The setting is a feast, a common occasion for celebration and drinking in ancient Near Eastern culture. Wine was often used to induce a state of relaxation or vulnerability. This phrase suggests a premeditated plan to catch Amnon off guard, reminiscent of other biblical narratives where wine leads to significant events, such as Noah's drunkenness (<a href="/genesis/9-21.htm">Genesis 9:21</a>) or Lot's daughters (<a href="/genesis/19-32.htm">Genesis 19:32-35</a>).<p><b>and when I order you to strike Amnon down, you are to kill him</b><br>Absalom's command is clear and ruthless, reflecting the law of retribution, "an eye for an eye" (<a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23-25</a>). This act of vengeance is personal and calculated, highlighting the cycle of violence within David's family, a consequence of David's own sins (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>).<p><b>Do not be afraid</b><br>Absalom reassures his men, acknowledging the gravity of the task. This echoes God's frequent encouragement to His people to not fear when undertaking daunting tasks (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>). However, here it is used in a morally complex situation, contrasting divine missions with human vendettas.<p><b>Have I not commanded you?</b><br>Absalom asserts his authority, reminiscent of military leaders in Israel who commanded obedience. This phrase underscores the hierarchical nature of ancient societies, where loyalty to one's superior was paramount, even above moral considerations.<p><b>Be courageous and valiant!</b><br>These words are often associated with battle and heroism in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6</a>). Absalom's use of them in this context is ironic, as he calls for bravery in committing murder, twisting the noble call to courage for a sinister purpose. This reflects the tragic misuse of God-given virtues for personal revenge, contrasting with the righteous courage exemplified by figures like David in his youth (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-47</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his handsome appearance and later rebellion against his father.

Each phrase exposes a heart hardened by bitterness, manipulating circumstances, subordinates, and even godly language to achieve revenge. The verse warns that personal vengeance, cloaked in calculated leadership, breeds greater violence and fractures families, echoing the biblical call to leave justice to the Lord and walk in true courage&#8212;the courage to obey God rather than men.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Smite Amnon.</span> The order was given before the banquet began, and every arrangement made to render the attack successful. Though Tamar's wrong was the mainspring of Absalom's conduct, yet neither he nor his men would forget that Amnon stood between him and the crown; and Amnon, entirely off his guard, never very wise at his best, and with his senses made dull by wine, seems to have fallen an easy prey. And as soon as the murder was committed, the rest of the king's sons, though all had attendants with them, fled in dismay, not knowing what might be the extent of Absalom's purpose. It is said that they fled on mules, this being the first place in which this animal is mentioned, as the word so translated in <a href="/genesis/36-24.htm">Genesis 36:24</a> really means "hot springs," and is so translated in the Revised Version. The breeding of hybrids was forbidden in <a href="/leviticus/19-19.htm">Leviticus 19:19</a>, and probably they were procured, as were horses, by trade. Up to this time the ass had been used for riding; but now David had a favourite mule (<a href="/1_kings/1-33.htm">1 Kings 1:33</a>), and Solomon received mules as tribute (<a href="/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>). Horses seem to have been used chiefly for chariots. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/13-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Absalom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1448;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;l&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_53.htm">Strong's 53: </a> </span><span class="str2">Absalom -- 'my father is peace', two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had ordered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1510;&#1463;&#1493;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7779;aw)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
