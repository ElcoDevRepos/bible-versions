This reflects the historical division between the northern and southern tribes, which later becomes more pronounced in the split of the united monarchy into Israel and Judah. The "ten shares" symbolize their greater stake in the kingdom, suggesting a sense of entitlement and expectation of influence.<p><b>answered the men of Israel</b><br>The men of Israel are responding to the men of Judah, highlighting the ongoing tension and rivalry between the tribes. This tension is rooted in historical and cultural differences, as well as competition for political power and favor with the king.<p><b>so we have more claim to David than you</b><br>The claim to David is based on the idea of shared heritage and loyalty. The men of Israel argue that their larger numbers give them a greater right to influence David's kingship. This reflects the broader theme of tribal identity and loyalty in the Old Testament, where lineage and tribal affiliation often determined one's role and status.<p><b>Why then do you despise us?</b><br>The question reveals a sense of grievance and perceived injustice. The men of Israel feel slighted and undervalued, which is a recurring theme in the relationship between the northern and southern tribes. This sentiment foreshadows the eventual division of the kingdom after Solomon's reign.<p><b>Were we not the first to speak of restoring our king?</b><br>This statement suggests that the men of Israel were initially supportive of David's return to power after Absalom's rebellion. It highlights their early loyalty and initiative, which they feel is being overlooked or dismissed by the men of Judah. This reflects the complex dynamics of loyalty and support in the political landscape of ancient Israel.<p><b>But the men of Judah spoke more fiercely than the men of Israel</b><br>The men of Judah's fierce response indicates their strong loyalty to David, who is from the tribe of Judah. This loyalty is rooted in tribal identity and the historical significance of Judah as the leading tribe. The fierce response also underscores the deep-seated rivalry and competition between the tribes, which is a recurring theme throughout the history of Israel and Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_israel.htm">Men of Israel</a></b><br>Represent the ten northern tribes of Israel who felt slighted in the process of bringing King David back to Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_judah.htm">Men of Judah</a></b><br>Represent the tribe of Judah, David's own tribe, who were more assertive in their claim to David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The central figure in this account, whose return to power is the subject of contention between the tribes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city where David is to be restored as king.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dispute.htm">The Dispute</a></b><br>A conflict arises between the tribes of Israel and Judah over their respective claims to King David.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_the_body_of_christ.htm">Unity in the Body of Christ</a></b><br>Just as the tribes of Israel and Judah were called to unite under King David, Christians are called to unity under Christ.

In <a href="/1_kings/11-31.htm">1 Kings 11:31, 35</a>, again, we have ten tribes given to Jeroboam, and here, also, not only must Benjamin be counted, but be included in the tribes rent from the house of David. The tribe that had disappeared was that of Simeon, partly lost among the desert races south of the Negeb, and partly absorbed by Judah. Its position always made it unimportant, and no trace can be found of its taking any part in the political life of Israel. Some strangers from Simeon are mentioned in <a href="/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">2 Chronicles 15:9</a> as coming to the great gathering of Judah and Benjamin at Jerusalem after Asa had defeated Zerah the Ethiopian; and Josiah carried out his reformation in Simeon as well as in Manasseh, Ephraim, and Naphtali (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6</a>). But it never seems to have emerged from a state of semi-barbarism, and no town can be found within its territories. We must, therefore, omit Simeon, and of course the Levites, who took no part in politics, and thus we have Judah standing alone, and all the rest determined to resist any attempt on its part to establish a hegemony, and restless even at having to endure the more ancient claims of Ephraim to be the leading tribe. By the ten parts which they claim in the king, they meant that, as king, he belonged equally to all, and not to his own tribe only. In this they were expressing a sound view of the royal position. The next words, literally, are, "And also in David I am more than thou;" to which the Septuagint adds, "And I am the firstborn rather than thou." This is in accordance with <a href="/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>, and states an important claim always made by Ephraim; whereas the Hebrew, "I in David am more than thou," is unintelligible. Except upon the score of numbers already stated, the right of each tribe in David was equal. <span class="cmt_word">Why then,</span> etc.? rather, <span class="accented">Why hast thou despised me?
