The men of Israel, representing the ten northern tribes, chose to follow Sheba, a Benjamite, in rebellion against King David. This reflects ongoing tensions between the northern tribes and the tribe of Judah, which had been evident since the time of Saul. The rebellion led by Sheba can be seen as a continuation of the unrest that followed Absalom's revolt. Sheba's actions are reminiscent of the earlier division between Saul and David, where tribal loyalties were often in conflict. This division foreshadows the eventual split of the kingdom after Solomon's reign, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/12.htm">1 Kings 12</a>. The choice to follow Sheba indicates a lack of unity and a susceptibility to charismatic leaders who oppose the Davidic line, which is a recurring theme in Israel's history.<p><b>But the men of Judah stayed by their king all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem.</b><br>In contrast to the northern tribes, the men of Judah remained loyal to David. This loyalty underscores the strong bond between David and his own tribe, which had first anointed him as king in Hebron (<a href="/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>). The phrase "all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem" suggests a steadfast commitment, as they accompanied David from the point of crossing the Jordan River back to his capital. This journey symbolizes a return to stability and order after the chaos of Absalom's rebellion. The loyalty of Judah is significant in the biblical narrative, as it emphasizes the importance of the Davidic covenant, which promised that David's line would endure (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). This covenant is central to the messianic hope, as it is through David's lineage that Jesus Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of the covenant, would come. The faithfulness of Judah to David prefigures the faithfulness of believers to Christ, the true King.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

Israel deserted David</b><p>- Context: After Absalom&#8217;s failed revolt, tensions between the ten northern tribes (&#8220;Israel&#8221;) and David&#8217;s loyalists were still raw (<a href="/2_samuel/19-41.htm">2 Samuel 19:41-43</a>).<p>- The word &#8220;deserted&#8221; is literal; the nation&#8217;s majority physically and decisively turned away from God&#8217;s anointed king.<p>- Scripture consistently treats rejection of the Lord&#8217;s chosen ruler as rebellion against the Lord Himself (<a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-13.htm">2 Samuel 15:13</a>).<p>- Similar mass defection appears later when Israel renounces Rehoboam: &#8220;What share do we have in David?&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>).<p>- Lesson: a nation&#8217;s unity hangs on its obedience to God&#8217;s appointed leadership.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to follow Sheba son of Bichri</b><p>- Sheba, a Benjamite, capitalized on simmering discontent (<a href="/2_samuel/20-1.htm">2 Samuel 20:1</a>).<p>- His cry, &#8220;We have no portion in David,&#8221; mirrors Korah-like rebellion against ordained authority (<a href="/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1-3</a>).<p>- <a href="/proverbs/28-2.htm">Proverbs 28:2</a> observes, &#8220;When a land rebels, it has many rulers&#8221;; Sheba embodies that destructive spirit.<p>- Earlier, Saul&#8217;s kinsmen from Benjamin had opposed David&#8217;s rise (<a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8-9</a>); Sheba revives that tribal grievance.<p>- Takeaway: charismatic agitators can lure hearts away from truth when grievances go unchecked.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But the men of Judah stayed by their king</b><p>- Judah had first anointed David (<a href="/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>) and now clings to him again.<p>- <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a> promises that the scepter will not depart from Judah; Judah&#8217;s loyalty aligns with that prophetic line.<p>- Their steadfastness contrasts starkly with Israel&#8217;s flight, echoing <a href="/psalms/78-68.htm">Psalm 78:68-71</a> where the Lord &#8220;chose the tribe of Judah&#8230; David His servant.&#8221;<p>- Loyalty here is not mere tribal pride; it is faithfulness to God&#8217;s covenant choice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>all the way from the Jordan to Jerusalem</b><p>- The journey spans the full route of David&#8217;s homecoming after Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/19-15.htm">2 Samuel 19:15-40</a>).<p>- Judah&#8217;s accompaniment is continuous&#8212;no wavering, no halfway turns&#8212;until the king is safely enthroned again.<p>- It evokes Israel&#8217;s earlier crossing under Joshua, where the people kept step with the ark &#8220;until all the nation had finished crossing&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/4-1.htm">Joshua 4:1</a>).<p>- This endurance underlines genuine commitment: loyalty proves itself over distance and time, not merely in a moment of enthusiasm.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/20-2.htm">2 Samuel 20:2</a> exposes a sharp divide: most Israelites abandon God&#8217;s chosen king for a rebel, while Judah remains steadfast from riverbank to throne. The verse warns against the ease of drifting from rightful authority and celebrates unwavering fidelity to God&#8217;s ordained leadership.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Men of Judah clave.</span>--David's negotiations with Judah had now resulted in an entire reversal of the position of the tribes towards him; Judah, among whom the rebellion originated, and who had been tardy in returning to their allegiance, were now fierce in their loyalty, while Israel, who had only joined the already organised rebellion, and afterwards had first proposed the return of David, had become alienated and rebellious.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So every man of Israel,</span> etc.; literally, <span class="accented">so all the men of Israel went up from after David after Sheba.</span> They had come down to Jordan to bring the king back in triumph, but, on finding that the men of Judah had forestalled them, they had a quarrel, and as no one endeavoured to allay it and mediate between them, it ended in open revolt, and they transferred their allegiance to the worthless Sheba. Nothing could more clearly prove the want of cohesion among the tribes, and how little Saul and David had done to knit them together. We need not, therefore, seek for any deep reasons of state, or for proofs of failure in David's government, to account for the rapid success of Absalom's rebellion. Israel was a confused mass of discordant elements, kept in a state of repulsion by the sturdy independence of the tribes and their jealousy one of another. Even David's victories had failed to infuse into them any feeling of national unity, nor did the long glory of Solomon's reign and the magnificence of the temple succeed better. The kings were not as yet much more than the judges had been - leaders in war, but with little authority in times of peace. What is so extraordinary is that David had lost the allegiance of his own tribe; and it now, on returning to its duty, spoiled by its violence the whole matter. The day must have been a great disappointment to David. He was to have gone back conducted gloriously by all the tribes of Israel; but he had fancied that Judah was holding back, and grieving over Absalom. He had secret dealing therefore with it, in order that the day might not be marred by its absence. It came, but only to do mischief; and David went home with only its escort, and with all the rest in open rebellion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/20-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">deserted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1436;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
