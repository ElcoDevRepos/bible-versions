The act of standing over someone in battle signifies dominance and finality. In the context of ancient warfare, it was common for a warrior to ensure the death of an opponent to prevent any chance of recovery. The Amalekite's account contrasts with <a href="/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4-5</a>, where Saul takes his own life to avoid capture. This discrepancy raises questions about the Amalekite's truthfulness and motives, possibly seeking favor with David by claiming to have ended Saul's life.<p><b>because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive</b><br>The Amalekite justifies his actions by suggesting mercy killing, a concept not uncommon in ancient warfare where a swift death was sometimes seen as preferable to prolonged suffering or capture. Saul's fall symbolizes the end of his reign and the judgment upon him for disobedience to God (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26-28</a>). The phrase also reflects the harsh realities of battle and the swift decisions made in the heat of conflict.<p><b>And I took the crown that was on his head and the band that was on his arm</b><br>The crown and arm band are symbols of Saul's kingship and authority. In ancient Near Eastern culture, such items were not only royal insignia but also carried significant political and spiritual weight. The removal of these items signifies the transfer of power and the end of Saul's dynasty, as prophesied by Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>). The act of taking these items could be seen as an attempt to curry favor with David, who was anointed as the next king of Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>).<p><b>and I have brought them here to my lord</b><br>The Amalekite presents the crown and arm band to David, acknowledging him as "my lord," which indicates recognition of David's future kingship. This act can be seen as an attempt to gain favor or reward from David, who was known to be Saul's successor. The gesture also highlights the political dynamics at play, as David's rise to power was seen as divinely ordained (<a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>). The Amalekite's actions, however, are met with condemnation by David, who respects Saul as the Lord's anointed (<a href="/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14-16</a>), demonstrating David's reverence for God's chosen leaders and his own integrity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_amalekite_messenger.htm">The Amalekite Messenger</a></b><br>A young man who claims to have killed Saul and brings Saul's crown and bracelet to David, expecting a reward.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who was wounded in battle against the Philistines and ultimately died on Mount Gilboa.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, who receives the news of Saul's death from the Amalekite.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_gilboa.htm">Mount Gilboa</a></b><br>The location where Saul and his sons died in battle against the Philistines.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crown_and_bracelet.htm">The Crown and Bracelet</a></b><br>Symbols of Saul's kingship, brought to David by the Amalekite as proof of Saul's death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_god's_anointed.htm">The Sanctity of God's Anointed</a></b><br>David's reaction underscores the importance of respecting those whom God has chosen and anointed, even when they fall short.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_and_truthfulness.htm">Integrity and Truthfulness</a></b><br>The Amalekite's false claim to have killed Saul for personal gain serves as a warning against deceit and the pursuit of selfish ambition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_leadership.htm">God's Sovereignty in Leadership</a></b><br>Despite Saul's failures, his kingship was ordained by God, reminding us that God is sovereign over leadership and authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Saul's tragic end is a sobering reminder of the consequences of disobedience and turning away from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_providence.htm">The Role of Providence</a></b><br>The events leading to David's kingship illustrate God's providential hand in fulfilling His promises, even through human actions and decisions.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Samuel_1_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Samuel 1:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Sam_1_10_Disobedience_s_consequences.htm">How does 2 Samuel 1:10 illustrate the consequences of disobedience to God's commands?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_respecting_God_s_anointed.htm">What can we learn about respecting God's anointed from 2 Samuel 1:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_does_this_verse_link_to_You_shall_not_murder.htm">How does this verse connect to the commandment "You shall not murder"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Respond_to_others_disrespect_for_God.htm">How should we respond when witnessing others' disrespect for God's authority today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_honor_God_s_chosen_leaders.htm">What actions can we take to honor God's chosen leaders in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_claim_Amalekite_killed_Saul.htm">Why did the Amalekite claim to kill Saul in 2 Samuel 1:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/2_Samuel_1_10_vs_1_Samuel_31_Saul_s_death.htm">How does 2 Samuel 1:10 align with 1 Samuel 31's account of Saul's death?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Amalekite_s_role_in_2_Samuel_1_10.htm">What is the significance of the Amalekite's actions in 2 Samuel 1:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_samuel_1.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Samuel 1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_1_chr_10_4_and_2_sam_1_10.htm">How can 1 Chronicles 10&#8217;s account that Saul died by falling on his own sword (1 Chronicles 10:4) be reconciled with 2 Samuel 1:10, where an Amalekite claims to have killed him? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/who_killed_saul__himself_or_amalekite.htm">Who killed Saul?

Scripture faithfully records the man&#8217;s words, even though <a href="/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4-5</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/10-4.htm">1 Chronicles 10:4-5</a> show Saul took his own life.<p>&#8226; His statement highlights a bold violation of God&#8217;s command, &#8220;You shall not murder&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>), and David&#8217;s own conviction, &#8220;I will not stretch out my hand against the LORD&#8217;s anointed&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>; 26:9).<p>&#8226; David later calls the messenger&#8217;s act &#8220;destroying the LORD&#8217;s anointed&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14-16</a>; 4:10). The contrast teaches that even when kings fall, God alone determines their end (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because I knew that after he had fallen he could not survive</b><p>&#8226; The Amalekite offers a pragmatic excuse: Saul was mortally wounded (<a href="/1_samuel/31-3.htm">1 Samuel 31:3</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/10-3.htm">1 Chronicles 10:3</a>), so ending his life seemed merciful.<p>&#8226; Human reasoning that sets aside God&#8217;s standard always leads to error (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). Mercy never justifies disobedience.<p>&#8226; In claiming compassion, he exposes a self-serving motive&#8212;hoping to secure favor with David&#8212;showing how the heart can deceive itself (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And I took the crown that was on his head</b><p>&#8226; The royal crown symbolized authority transferred by God (<a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>; 16:1, 13). By seizing it, the Amalekite attempts to accelerate what God had already promised to David.<p>&#8226; David will later receive another enemy&#8217;s crown in battle, but only after God grants the victory (<a href="/2_samuel/12-30.htm">2 Samuel 12:30</a>). The passage reminds us that God&#8217;s timing matters as much as His promise (<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the band that was on his arm</b><p>&#8226; The armlet (a royal bracelet) was another emblem of Saul&#8217;s kingship, comparable to signet rings worn by rulers (<a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="/esther/3-10.htm">Esther 3:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Together with the crown, it brands Saul&#8217;s body as belonging to God&#8217;s chosen leader. Touching these items without divine approval parallels Uzzah&#8217;s fatal grasp of the ark (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>); holy things are not to be handled casually.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I have brought them here to my lord.</b><p>&#8226; Calling David &#8220;my lord&#8221; shows calculated flattery. He expects a reward for eliminating Saul (compare <a href="/2_samuel/4-10.htm">2 Samuel 4:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Instead, David rends his clothes and mourns (<a href="/2_samuel/1-11.htm">2 Samuel 1:11-12</a>). Reverence for God&#8217;s appointment outweighs personal advantage (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s swift judgment on the Amalekite (<a href="/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14-16</a>) proclaims that opportunistic violence has no place in God&#8217;s kingdom (<a href="/proverbs/17-15.htm">Proverbs 17:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/1-10.htm">2 Samuel 1:10</a> records the Amalekite&#8217;s self-incriminating story. Every phrase exposes a heart willing to break God&#8217;s law, exploit tragedy, and manipulate symbols of divine authority for personal gain. Scripture&#8217;s faithful record contrasts the man&#8217;s presumptuous act with David&#8217;s unwavering respect for the LORD&#8217;s anointed, underscoring that God alone orders leadership, life, and timing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Slew him.</span>--This story is inconsistent with that given in <a href="/context/1_samuel/31-4.htm" title="Then said Saul to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armor bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell on it.">1Samuel 31:4-5</a>, and was evidently invented by the Amalekite to gain favour with David. At the same time, he is careful not to carry the story too far, and asserts that Saul was only put to death at his own request, and after being mortally wounded. However, he must have been one of the first to find the body of Saul after his death, since he brought his crown and bracelet to David--a <span class= "ital">prima facie </span>evidence of the truth of his whole story.
