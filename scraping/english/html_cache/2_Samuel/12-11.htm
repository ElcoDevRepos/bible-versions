In the biblical narrative, prophetic declarations often begin with such a formula, underscoring that the message is not from the prophet's own mind but from God Himself. This is a common introduction in prophetic literature, seen in books like Isaiah and Jeremiah, where God communicates His will and judgments.<p><b>I will raise up adversity against you from your own house:</b><br>This prophecy foretells internal strife within David's family, a direct consequence of his sin with Bathsheba and the murder of Uriah. The fulfillment of this prophecy is seen in the rebellion of Absalom, David's son, which brought great turmoil and division to David's household. This internal conflict serves as a reminder of the principle of sowing and reaping, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>, where actions have consequences, often within one's own sphere of influence.<p><b>Before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to another:</b><br>This part of the prophecy was fulfilled when Absalom, in his rebellion, took David's concubines and lay with them publicly (<a href="/2_samuel/16-22.htm">2 Samuel 16:22</a>). This act was a cultural and political statement, signifying a transfer of power and a deep humiliation for David. In the ancient Near Eastern context, taking a king's wives was a declaration of assuming his throne and authority.<p><b>and he will lie with them in broad daylight:</b><br>The public nature of this act contrasts with David's secret sin with Bathsheba, highlighting the theme of exposure and judgment. While David's sin was hidden, the consequences were made public, fulfilling the principle found in <a href="/luke/12-2.htm">Luke 12:2-3</a>, where hidden things are brought to light.

The punishment was thus complete. For the murdered Uriah there was fourfold restitution, according to David's own sentence. First there was Bathsheba's child lately born, then Amnon, thirdly Absalom, and lastly Adonijah. For the adultery there was open disgrace wrought upon his royal dignity "before the sun," in open daylight. As he had brought shame and dishonour upon the family relations of his neighbour, so were his own family rights violated by his rebellious son. And, as is often the case, the sins which followed were worse than those which prepared the way. Vice begins as a small stream trickling through the opposing dam. but it quickly breaks down all moral restraints, and rushes along like a destroying flood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/12-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1492;
