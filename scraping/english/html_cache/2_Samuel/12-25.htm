His involvement underscores the importance of prophetic authority in Israel, where prophets often acted as intermediaries between God and the king. Nathan previously confronted David about his sin with Bathsheba (<a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-14</a>), demonstrating his role in holding the king accountable. This phrase highlights the continued communication between God and David through Nathan, emphasizing the prophet's role in delivering God's messages and instructions.<p><b>to name him Jedidiah</b><br>The name "Jedidiah" means "beloved of the LORD." This naming is significant as it reflects God's favor and love towards Solomon, despite the circumstances of his birth. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, names held profound significance, often reflecting one's destiny or divine purpose. The naming by God through Nathan indicates a divine endorsement and a special relationship between Solomon and God. This act can be seen as a foreshadowing of Solomon's future role as king and builder of the temple, a task that David was not permitted to complete (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9-10</a>).<p><b>because the LORD loved him</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's grace and favor towards Solomon, despite the sin associated with his parents' union. It reflects the theme of divine love and election, where God chooses individuals for specific purposes regardless of their background. This love is a precursor to Solomon's future wisdom and prosperity as king (<a href="/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5-14</a>). It also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's covenantal love for His people, which is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is also called "beloved" (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>). Solomon's role as a wise king and temple builder serves as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate King and builder of the spiritual temple, the Church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who had sinned with Bathsheba but repented.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The wife of Uriah, who became David's wife and the mother of Solomon.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of David and Bathsheba, who would later become king and is known for his wisdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan_the_prophet.htm">Nathan the Prophet</a></b><br>A prophet in the court of King David, who conveyed God's messages to David, including the naming of Solomon as Jedidiah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jedidiah.htm">Jedidiah</a></b><br>A name given to Solomon by God through Nathan, meaning "beloved of the LORD."<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_choice.htm">God's Sovereign Choice</a></b><br>Despite human failures, God's plans prevail.

Into that grief &#8220;David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and she bore a son and named him Solomon&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24</a>).

David had already called the child Solomon, and now Jehovah, some years afterwards, gives him an indication of his special favour by naming him Yedidyah. The word is formed from the same root as <span class="accented">David</span>, that is, "lovely," with the addition of the Divine name. As we have already pointed out, this was no slight matter, but the virtual selection of Solomon to be David's successor, and probably, therefore, was delayed until he had given indica of his great intellectual gifts. His elder brothers would not be passed over without valid reasons. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/12-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1431;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
