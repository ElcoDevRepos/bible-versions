Known for his striking appearance and charisma, he often acted with impulsive and rebellious tendencies. His relationship with his father was strained, especially after the incident involving his sister Tamar and his brother Amnon. Absalom's command to his servants reflects his authoritative position and his willingness to use others to achieve his goals.<p><b>&#8220;Look, Joab&#8217;s field is next to mine, and he has barley there.</b><br>Joab, the commander of David's army, played a crucial role in the political and military landscape of Israel. His field being next to Absalom's suggests proximity and perhaps a previous relationship or alliance. Barley was a staple crop in ancient Israel, indicating the field's value. The mention of barley also highlights the agricultural context of the time, where land and crops were significant assets.<p><b>Go and set it on fire!&#8221;</b><br>Setting a field on fire was an act of aggression and a means of drawing attention. In the ancient Near East, such actions were often used to provoke or send a message. Absalom's decision to burn Joab's field was a strategic move to compel Joab to respond, as Joab had been avoiding Absalom. This act of destruction reflects Absalom's desperation and willingness to resort to extreme measures to achieve his objectives.<p><b>And Absalom&#8217;s servants set the field on fire.</b><br>The obedience of Absalom's servants indicates his influence and authority over them. The act of setting the field on fire fulfilled Absalom's intention to force Joab into action. This event is a turning point in the narrative, leading to Joab's intervention and Absalom's eventual reconciliation with David. The burning of the field symbolizes the destructive consequences of unresolved conflict and the lengths to which individuals will go to assert their will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The son of King David, known for his handsome appearance and rebellious nature.
