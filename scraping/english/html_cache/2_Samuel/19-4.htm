King David's action here reflects his profound grief and personal anguish over the death of his son Absalom. This act of covering the face can also symbolize a desire to hide from the reality of the situation or from others, indicating David's internal struggle and sorrow.<p><b>and cried out at the top of his voice</b><br>David's loud lamentation is indicative of the intense emotional pain he is experiencing. In the context of ancient Israel, public expressions of grief were common, and wailing loudly was a way to communicate the depth of one's sorrow. This public display of emotion underscores the personal and national tragedy that Absalom's rebellion and death represent.<p><b>&#8220;O my son Absalom!</b><br>The repetition of Absalom's name highlights David's deep love and attachment to his son, despite Absalom's betrayal. This reflects the complex nature of familial relationships and the pain of losing a child. Absalom's name, meaning "father of peace," is ironically contrasted with his actions, which brought conflict and division.<p><b>O Absalom, my son, my son!&#8221;</b><br>The repetition of "my son" emphasizes David's personal loss and the broken relationship between father and son. This lament can be seen as a type of Christ, as it echoes the sorrow of God the Father over the rebellion and sin of humanity. It also foreshadows the ultimate reconciliation and redemption through Jesus Christ, who restores broken relationships. David's grief is a reminder of the consequences of sin and the hope for restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, mourning the death of his son Absalom.
