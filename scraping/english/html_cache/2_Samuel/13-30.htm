The context is the aftermath of Absalom's revenge against Amnon for the rape of their sister Tamar. The journey of the messengers highlights the urgency and gravity of the situation. In ancient Israel, communication was often slow, and the use of messengers was crucial for conveying important news. This reflects the tension and chaos following the events at Absalom's feast.<p><b>a report reached David</b><br>The report reaching David signifies the spread of information and the impact of rumors. In the ancient Near East, kings relied heavily on reports from messengers to make informed decisions. This moment underscores the vulnerability of David's household and the potential for misinformation to cause panic. The report's arrival marks a pivotal moment in the narrative, as it sets the stage for David's reaction and the unfolding of Absalom's rebellion.<p><b>Absalom has struck down all the sons of the king</b><br>This phrase captures the initial, exaggerated report that Absalom had killed all of David's sons. It reflects the fear and misunderstanding that can arise in times of crisis. Absalom's actions were a calculated move to avenge his sister Tamar, but the report exaggerates the extent of the violence. This moment foreshadows Absalom's future rebellion against David, highlighting the theme of familial strife and the consequences of sin within David's house, as prophesied by Nathan in <a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>.<p><b>not one of them is left!</b><br>The hyperbolic nature of this report emphasizes the chaos and fear that misinformation can cause. In reality, only Amnon was killed, but the report suggests total devastation. This reflects the broader theme of the consequences of David's sin with Bathsheba, as his family experiences turmoil and division. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the fragility of human plans and the ultimate sovereignty of God, who works through even the most dire circumstances to fulfill His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, father of Absalom and Amnon.

The phrase captures four truths: the chaos sowed by unaddressed sin, the speed of rumor over fact, the precision of God&#8217;s judgment in contrast to human exaggeration, and the steadfastness of God&#8217;s covenant with David despite family tragedy. Though David momentarily believes every son is dead, the LORD&#8217;s promise and providence ensure that the royal line&#8212;and His redemptive plan&#8212;endure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">There is not one of them left.</span>--The story of this exaggerated report, so true to the life, indicates contemporaneous authorship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tidings came.</span> Some of the servants seem to have fled immediately that the attack was made, and in their terror reported, not what had really happened, but what they assumed was Absalom's purpose. It shows, however, how thoroughly Absalom had dissembled when thus they entirely forgot that he had a grudge against Amnon. And David, in utter misery, tears his robes, and throws himself prostrate on the ground, while his courtiers, with rent garments, stand speechless round him. But the guilty Jonadab guesses more correctly the truth. He had probably watched Absalom closely, and distrusted his silence. Nothing, perhaps, had happened to justify his suspicions, but as soon as the tidings came he divined the real meaning. And, wicked as he was, he could never have supposed that Amnon would turn upon the woman he had wronged, and insult and disgrace her. He probably imagined that Amnon really loved her, and that the matter would be patched up. But when the wretched youth acted so shamelessly, Jonadab probably felt sure that Absalom would sooner or later take his revenge. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/13-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">While they</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1443;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;m&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1992.htm">Strong's 1992: </a> </span><span class="str2">They</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
