In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, King David is responding to God's covenant promise that his lineage will endure forever, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ. The greatness of God is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/145-3.htm">Psalm 145:3</a>, which declares God's greatness as unsearchable. The use of "O Lord GOD" reflects the Hebrew "Adonai Yahweh," emphasizing both God's sovereignty and His covenantal relationship with Israel.<p><b>For there is none like You,</b><br>This statement underscores the uniqueness and incomparability of God. In the ancient Near Eastern context, polytheism was prevalent, with many cultures worshiping multiple gods. However, Israel's faith was distinct in its monotheism, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, the Shema, which declares, "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one." This phrase affirms that no other being possesses the attributes, power, or holiness of the God of Israel.<p><b>and there is no God but You,</b><br>This phrase reinforces the monotheistic belief central to Israel's identity. It echoes the first commandment in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>, "You shall have no other gods before Me." The exclusivity of God is a foundational truth that sets the stage for the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as the one true God incarnate, as seen in <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-14</a>. This declaration also serves as a polemic against idolatry, a recurring issue for Israel.<p><b>according to everything we have heard with our own ears.</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the importance of testimony and revelation. The Israelites had witnessed God's mighty acts, from the deliverance from Egypt to the establishment of the Davidic kingdom. The phrase suggests a reliance on the oral tradition and the communal experience of God's faithfulness. In <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>, Paul writes, "So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ," emphasizing the role of hearing in the development of faith. This also points to the prophetic tradition, where God's word was spoken and heard, shaping the faith and identity of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, chosen by God, who is expressing his awe and reverence for God's uniqueness and greatness in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan_the_prophet.htm">Nathan the Prophet</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's covenant promise to David, which prompted David's prayer of praise.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where David established his kingdom and where he received God's promise through Nathan.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_davidic_covenant.htm">The Davidic Covenant</a></b><br>The divine promise made by God to David, ensuring that his lineage would endure forever, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who have witnessed God's mighty acts and heard of His greatness through their history.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_uniqueness.htm">God's Uniqueness</a></b><br>Recognize and worship God for His unparalleled nature.

Overwhelmed, he bursts out in praise.<p>&#8226; The greatness he attributes to God is personal: &#8220;How great You are&#8221;&#8212;not an abstract concept but a living relationship.<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly couples God&#8217;s greatness with His mighty acts (<a href="/psalms/145-3.htm">Psalm 145:3-6</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/29-11.htm">1 Chronicles 29:11</a>). The same Lord who delivered Israel from Egypt and guided them through the wilderness has now spoken directly to David.<p>&#8226; By starting with God&#8217;s greatness, David places everything else&#8212;his kingship, Israel&#8217;s future, every blessing&#8212;in its proper perspective (<a href="/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For there is none like You</b><p>David next affirms God&#8217;s uniqueness.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Who is like You among the gods, O LORD?&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>) was Israel&#8217;s song after the Red Sea. David echoes that song, confessing that no created being can compare with the Creator.<p>&#8226; The prophets later pick up the same theme: &#8220;To whom will you liken Me, or who is My equal?&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-25.htm">Isaiah 40:25</a>). David&#8217;s confession stands at the center of all true worship&#8212;God has no rival, no peer, no competitor.<p>&#8226; When life tempts us to magnify our problems, remembering that none is like Him restores rightful awe (<a href="/jeremiah/10-6.htm">Jeremiah 10:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and there is no God but You</b><p>David moves from comparison to exclusivity.<p>&#8226; The Shema had taught Israel, &#8220;Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>). David now personalizes that truth.<p>&#8226; &#8220;There is no Rock like our God&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-2.htm">1 Samuel 2:2</a>); &#8220;I am the LORD, and there is no other&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/45-5.htm">Isaiah 45:5</a>). These declarations stress that every so-called god is a human fabrication, but the LORD alone is real and sovereign.<p>&#8226; In the New Testament, Paul affirms the same reality: &#8220;For us there is but one God, the Father&#8230; and one Lord, Jesus Christ&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4-6</a>). David&#8217;s words anticipate that unbroken biblical witness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>according to everything we have heard with our own ears</b><p>David&#8217;s praise is grounded in revelation, not rumor.<p>&#8226; He has &#8220;heard&#8221; God&#8217;s covenant promises spoken by the prophet Nathan (<a href="/2_samuel/7-17.htm">2 Samuel 7:17</a>). God&#8217;s word creates faith and worship (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s collective memory&#8212;stories of Abraham, the Exodus, the conquest&#8212;had been passed down &#8220;in the hearing of your sons and grandsons&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9</a>). David stands in that stream, adding his own testimony.<p>&#8226; Personal experience plus reliable testimony builds a solid foundation: &#8220;We have heard with our ears, O God; our fathers have told us what You did in their days&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/44-1.htm">Psalm 44:1</a>). David links his praise to that ongoing narrative of God&#8217;s faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>In <a href="/2_samuel/7-22.htm">2 Samuel 7:22</a> David responds to God&#8217;s covenant by celebrating four truths: God&#8217;s incomparable greatness, His unrivaled uniqueness, His exclusive deity, and the reliability of His revealed works. Each phrase draws David&#8212;and us&#8212;into deeper worship, anchoring confidence not in human achievements but in the character and promises of the one true God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">All that we have heard with our ears.</span>--Such expressions are common enough in all languages not only for that which has been communicated orally, but for all that has been made known in any way; the same word is used with reference to written records in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-6.htm" title="Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-14.htm" title="Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God.">2Kings 17:14</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-12.htm" title="Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.">2Kings 18:12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-16.htm" title="LORD, bow down your ear, and hear: open, LORD, your eyes, and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which has sent him to reproach the living God.">2Kings 19:16</a> (in Hezekiah's prayer in reference to Sennacherib's letter); <a href="/nehemiah/9-29.htm" title="And testified against them, that you might bring them again to your law: yet they dealt proudly, and listened not to your commandments, but sinned against your judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.">Nehemiah 9:29</a>; probably <a href="/esther/2-8.htm" title="So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together to Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also to the king's house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.">Esther 2:8</a>; and in many other places. (So also the corresponding Greek word, <a href="/revelation/1-3.htm" title="Blessed is he that reads, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.">Revelation 1:3</a>, &c). It is therefore entirely unnecessary to suppose that David refers here only to oral tradition; he means the history of the Divine dealings with his people as recorded in their sacred books. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore thou art great.</span> God's goodness is to David a proof of his greatness, and he sees it displayed, not only in his dealings with himself, but also in the past history of the Jewish nation. There is in this a depth of evangelic piety. An unconverted heart would see the greatness of God in the majesty of creation, or in severe dealings with the impenitent. David saw it in acts of mercy and kindness.
