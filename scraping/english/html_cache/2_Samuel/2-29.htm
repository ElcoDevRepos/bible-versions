The Arabah refers to the desert region stretching from the Sea of Galilee to the Gulf of Aqaba. This area is characterized by its harsh, arid conditions, making a night march both strategic and grueling. The decision to march at night could have been to avoid the heat and to maintain the element of surprise. This reflects the urgency and determination of Abner to regroup and consolidate power after the battle at Gibeon.<p><b>They crossed the Jordan,</b><br>Crossing the Jordan River was a significant logistical challenge, especially for a large group of men. The Jordan River often symbolizes a boundary or transition in biblical narratives, such as the Israelites entering the Promised Land. Here, it marks a retreat and regrouping for Abner's forces. This crossing signifies a strategic withdrawal to a more defensible position, highlighting the tactical acumen of Abner as a military leader.<p><b>marched all morning,</b><br>The continuous march through the night and into the morning underscores the urgency and desperation of Abner's situation. It reflects the relentless pursuit of survival and the need to reach a safe haven. This relentless march can be seen as a metaphor for perseverance in the face of adversity, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible.<p><b>and arrived at Mahanaim.</b><br>Mahanaim, meaning "two camps," was a fortified city east of the Jordan River. It served as a place of refuge and a strategic military base. Historically, Mahanaim was significant as a Levitical city and a place where Jacob encountered angels (<a href="/genesis/32.htm">Genesis 32:1-2</a>). In the context of 2 Samuel, it becomes a stronghold for Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, and a center of opposition against David's claim to the throne. The arrival at Mahanaim represents a temporary reprieve and a regrouping point for Abner and his men, setting the stage for the ongoing conflict between the house of Saul and the house of David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abner.htm">Abner</a></b><br>The commander of Saul's army, a key figure in the power struggle following Saul's death.

At the end of the chapter we learn that Joab did the same. Each army had about twenty-six miles to march, and the night was less exhausting for a long walk than the day. As soon, then, as Abner saw Joab and his men occupied with the removal of Asahel's body, he withdrew from the hill of Ammah, and, passing through the Arabah, or plain of Jordan, crossed the river by the same ford which he had used when starting on his unfortunate errand, and so returned home. The phrase, all Bithron, shows that this was a district, but nothing more of it is known. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/2-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1425;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
