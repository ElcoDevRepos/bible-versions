His movement through the tribes signifies the widespread discontent and division within Israel following Absalom's rebellion. This reflects the fragile unity of the nation and the ongoing tension between the northern tribes and Judah. The tribes of Israel were often in conflict, as seen in <a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20</a>, where tribal warfare nearly led to the destruction of Benjamin.<p><b>to Abel-beth-maacah</b><br>Abel-beth-maacah was a fortified city in the northern part of Israel, near the border with Aram (modern-day Syria). It was known for its wisdom and counsel, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/20-18.htm">2 Samuel 20:18-19</a>. The city's strategic location made it a significant place for Sheba to seek refuge. Archaeological evidence suggests it was a well-established city during the time of David, and its mention here highlights its importance in the region.<p><b>and through the entire region of the Berites</b><br>The Berites are not widely mentioned in the Bible, indicating they were likely a smaller or less significant group. Their inclusion here suggests that Sheba was attempting to rally support from various factions, possibly exploiting local grievances against David's rule. This reflects the complex social and political landscape of ancient Israel, where tribal and regional loyalties often superseded national unity.<p><b>who gathered together and followed him</b><br>The gathering of followers indicates that Sheba's rebellion had some appeal, likely due to lingering dissatisfaction with David's leadership or the recent turmoil from Absalom's revolt. This mirrors other instances in the Bible where leaders capitalized on discontent, such as Absalom's earlier rebellion (2 Samuel 15). The willingness of people to follow Sheba underscores the challenges David faced in maintaining control and unity over a diverse and often divided nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheba.htm">Sheba</a></b><br>A Benjamite who led a rebellion against King David.

The verse exposes how rebellion capitalizes on unresolved grievances but also how God&#8217;s sovereign hand swiftly limits its reach.

It thus forms part of the name of various places, as Abel-Mizraim (<a href="/genesis/1-11.htm">Genesis 1:11</a>), Abel-Meholah (<a href="/1_kings/4-12.htm">1 Kings 4:12</a>), etc. Abel-beth-Maachah was a fortress in the most northerly part of the tribe of Naphtali, and is identified with the modern village of <span class="accented">Abel</span>, a few miles above Lake Huleh, the ancient "Waters of Merom." And all the Berites. No place or people of this name can be found, but Jerome, when translating the Vulgate, had before him a different reading, which seems clearly right, "And all the chosen men of war were gathered together, and went after him." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/20-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Sheba passed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1465;&#1438;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
