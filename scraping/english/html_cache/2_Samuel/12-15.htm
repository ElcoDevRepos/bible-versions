Nathan's departure signifies the completion of his prophetic duty. This moment underscores the role of prophets as messengers of God, who deliver His word and then leave the outcome to God. It also highlights the gravity of David's sin and the seriousness with which God addresses it.<p><b>the LORD struck the child</b><br>This phrase indicates divine intervention and judgment. The illness of the child is a direct consequence of David's sin, illustrating the principle that sin often has far-reaching consequences beyond the individual. It reflects the justice of God, who holds even His chosen king accountable. This act is not arbitrary but serves as a tangible expression of the moral order God upholds. It also foreshadows the suffering of the innocent for the guilty, a theme that finds its ultimate fulfillment in the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ.<p><b>that Uriah&#8217;s wife had borne to David</b><br>The text refers to Bathsheba as "Uriah&#8217;s wife," emphasizing the adultery and the breach of covenant that occurred. This reminder of her previous marital status highlights the sin's severity and the violation of God's commandments. It also serves as a reminder of the human tendency to try to cover up sin, as David did, and the futility of such attempts before God. The child, born out of this union, becomes a symbol of the consequences of sin.<p><b>and he became ill</b><br>The illness of the child is both a personal tragedy for David and Bathsheba and a public demonstration of God's displeasure. In the ancient Near Eastern context, illness was often seen as a sign of divine disfavor or judgment. This event would have been understood by the people of Israel as a serious matter, reflecting the communal nature of sin and its consequences. The child's illness also sets the stage for David's subsequent repentance and intercession, highlighting the themes of mercy and forgiveness that are central to the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan.htm">Nathan</a></b><br>A prophet who served during the reign of King David.

Once the prophet delivered the message, &#8220;David said to Nathan, &#8216;I have sinned against the LORD&#8217;&#8221; (v. 13), and Nathan departed. His exit signals that the judgment David had just heard was settled; no more debate or negotiation remained (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24&#8211;31</a>, where Samuel likewise turned to leave Saul after pronouncing God&#8217;s verdict). The scene reminds us that when God&#8217;s word is spoken, response is required; procrastination only deepens consequences (<a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3&#8211;5</a>; <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD struck the child</b><p>Scripture states plainly and literally that God Himself acted: &#8220;the LORD struck.&#8221; His holiness demands that sin be judged (<a href="/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Sovereign action: As in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>&#8212;&#8220;I put to death and I bring to life&#8221;&#8212;the Lord controls life&#8217;s boundaries.<p>&#8226; Purposeful discipline: <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a> affirms, &#8220;The Lord disciplines the one He loves,&#8221; showing discipline flows from covenant love, not caprice (see also <a href="/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Public consequence: David&#8217;s private sin produced a public display of God&#8217;s justice, warning Israel that the king is not above God&#8217;s law (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18&#8211;20</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/12-14.htm">1 Samuel 12:14&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that Uriah&#8217;s wife had borne to David</b><p>The Spirit deliberately calls Bathsheba &#8220;Uriah&#8217;s wife&#8221; even after her marriage to David (cf. <a href="/matthew/1-6.htm">Matthew 1:6</a>). The wording keeps David&#8217;s adultery and Uriah&#8217;s murder front-and-center (<a href="/2_samuel/11-14.htm">2 Samuel 11:14&#8211;17, 27</a>).<p>&#8226; Sin remembered: Though forgiven (<a href="/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>), the historical fact remains; forgiveness removes guilt but not necessarily all earthly fallout.<p>&#8226; Covenant accountability: Leaders&#8217; sins carry wider repercussions (<a href="/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>; <a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).<p>&#8226; Grace in the lineage: Remarkably, God will later grant David and Bathsheba another son, Solomon, through whom Messiah comes (<a href="/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24&#8211;25</a>), showing mercy triumphing over judgment for those who repent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he became ill.</b><p>The child&#8217;s sickness unfolds the cost of sin touching the innocent, a sobering reality echoed in <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, where consequences visit succeeding generations.<p>&#8226; Human grief: David&#8217;s fasting and night-long prayers (vv. 16&#8211;17) display a broken father pleading for mercy, modeling genuine repentance (<a href="/psalms/51-1.htm">Psalm 51:1&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; Temporal vs. eternal: God sometimes allows pain now to steer hearts toward eternal priorities (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Hope beyond death: David&#8217;s later words, &#8220;I will go to him, but he will not return to me&#8221; (v. 23), reveal confidence that covenant mercy ultimately gathers the redeemed, encouraging believers that earthly losses are not final (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/12-15.htm">2 Samuel 12:15</a> shows that once Nathan&#8217;s prophetic confrontation ended, God enacted a just and literal judgment: He struck the child born from David&#8217;s adultery with illness. The verse highlights God&#8217;s sovereign right to discipline, reinforces the gravity of sin&#8212;even forgiven sin&#8212;and reminds us that consequences can reach beyond the offender. Yet the broader passage also displays God&#8217;s readiness to restore the repentant and weave His redemptive plan through human failure, pointing ahead to the ultimate Son of David who bears sin&#8217;s penalty and offers eternal hope.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/12-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After Nathan</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5416.htm">Strong's 5416: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nathan -- the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had gone</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
