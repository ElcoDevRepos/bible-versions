The "it" refers to the bloodguilt of Abner's murder. In ancient Israel, bloodguilt was a serious matter, often requiring retribution or divine justice. The "head" symbolizes leadership and responsibility, indicating that Joab, as the head of his family, bears the primary guilt. The mention of "the entire house of his father" extends the curse to Joab's family lineage, reflecting the biblical principle of generational consequences for sin (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>).<p><b>and may the house of Joab never be without one having a discharge or skin disease</b><br>This part of the curse involves physical afflictions that would render a person ceremonially unclean according to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/15-2.htm">Leviticus 15:2</a>, <a href="/leviticus/13-2.htm">Leviticus 13:2</a>). Such conditions would exclude individuals from participating in temple worship and community life, symbolizing a state of perpetual impurity and separation from God. This reflects the severity of Joab's crime in David's eyes, as it not only brought physical consequences but also spiritual and communal alienation.<p><b>or one who leans on a staff</b><br>Leaning on a staff suggests physical weakness or disability, possibly due to age or injury. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, physical strength was highly valued, especially for men who were expected to work and fight. This part of the curse implies a loss of vitality and capability within Joab's family, a perpetual reminder of the consequences of his violent actions.<p><b>or falls by the sword</b><br>This phrase indicates a violent death, often seen as a consequence of living by the sword (<a href="/matthew/26-52.htm">Matthew 26:52</a>). It suggests that Joab's family would be marked by violence and bloodshed, a fitting retribution for Joab's own violent act against Abner. This reflects the biblical principle of sowing and reaping, where one's actions bring about corresponding consequences (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p><b>or lacks food</b><br>Lacking food signifies poverty and deprivation, a stark contrast to the prosperity and provision expected in a blessed household. In the historical context, famine and hunger were often seen as signs of divine displeasure or judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>). This part of the curse underscores the comprehensive nature of the judgment against Joab's house, affecting their physical, social, and economic well-being.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, known for his military prowess and political influence.

Each element echoes covenant warnings elsewhere in Scripture, affirming that God defends the innocent and avenges bloodshed. The passage reminds us that sin&#8217;s stains are real, accountability is certain, and only God&#8217;s grace&#8212;ultimately revealed in Christ&#8212;can break the cycle of guilt and curse.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Let it rest on the head of Joab.</span>--The strong curse here pronounced by David shows that Joab's act could not be justified as that of the "Goel," or lawful avenger of his brother's blood, for Abner had slain Asahel in battle, unwillingly and in self-defence. It is also to be remembered that Hebron was a city of refuge (<a href="/joshua/21-13.htm" title="Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with her suburbs,">Joshua 21:13</a>), and that here not even the "Goel" might slay the murderer without a trial (<a href="/context/numbers/35-22.htm" title="But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast on him any thing without laying of wait,">Numbers 35:22-25</a>). The curse falls "on his father's house," since Abishai also (<a href="/2_samuel/3-30.htm" title="So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.">2Samuel 3:30</a>) had been concerned with him in the murder.<p>The phrase, "that leaneth on a staff," has been understood by many as "holding a distaff," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>a person unfit for war. The word has the sense of "distaff" in <a href="/proverbs/31-19.htm" title="She lays her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.">Proverbs 31:19</a>, and is so rendered here by the Vulgate; but the sense given by the English--which is also that of the LXX. and Targum--is better, and more in accordance with the other particulars.<p>For "<span class= "ital">on </span>the sword" read "<span class= "ital">by </span>the sword," there being no reference to the idea of suicide. On the violent end of Joab see <a href="/context/1_kings/2-31.htm" title="And the king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall on him, and bury him; that you may take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.">1Kings 2:31-34</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let it rest on the head of Joab.</span> The Hebrew word is very strong, "Let it roll itself," or throw itself upon Joab's head. The force of the expression thus indicates the great excitement under which David was labouring; yet even so it was no slight matter to utter so bitter a curse upon a man so powerful, and whose military skill was so essential to the maintenance of his throne. To a man of David's strong sense of justice, it was a small matter that by Abner's murder the kingdom of the ten tribes was lost perhaps forever; what he hated was the wickedness of this mean act of personal revenge. And thus his imprecations are all such as would be humiliating to a family so distinguished for great physical as well as mental gifts, as the house of Zeruiah. Nor was David content with this; for we gather from <a href="/1_chronicles/11-6.htm">1 Chronicles 11:6</a> that during the intervening years Joab was deprived of his office, and that he regained it only by an act of daring bravery. (For the miserable condition of one suffering with an issue, see <a href="/leviticus/15-2.htm">Leviticus 15:2</a>, etc.; and for that of a leper, <a href="/leviticus/13.htm">Leviticus 13, 14</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Instead of one that leaneth on a staff,</span> some translate "a distaff holder," that is, a poor effeminate creature, fit only for woman's work. The true sense is probably a cripple - one who needs a crutch. <span class="cmt_word">That falleth on the sword;</span> more correctly the Revised Version, <span class="accented">that falleth by the sword.</span> The two last imprecations mean that if any of the race of Joab and Abishai escape these personal blemishes, yet that his fate shall be, in war an inglorious death, and in peace a life of poverty. This curse of David is regarded in the Talmud ('Sanhedr.,' 48.2) as very sinful. Undeniably it was uttered in violent anger, and while Joab's act was utterly base and perfidious, yet he had the excuse for it of Asahel's death and David's double-dealing. The latter made him conclude that the man who had killed his brother was also to usurp his place. Possibly this suspicion was not without reason. As David was strong enough to deprive Joab of his command, it is plain that he had nothing to fear from telling him his plans. Joab would have assented, the blood feud have been appeased by a money payment, and all gone well. But David, it seems, wished to hold Joab in check by giving at least a share in the command to the veteran Abner. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/3-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">May it whirl</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1495;&#1467;&#1433;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7717;u&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2342.htm">Strong's 2342: </a> </span><span class="str2">To twist, whirl, to dance, to writhe in pain, fear, to wait, to pervert</span><br /><br /><span class="word">over</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the heads</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#333;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7218.htm">Strong's 7218: </a> </span><span class="str2">The head</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Joab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1428;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3097.htm">Strong's 3097: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joab -- 'the LORD is father', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;el)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
