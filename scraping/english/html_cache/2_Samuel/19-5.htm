This reflects Joab's influential position and his willingness to speak truth to power, a recurring theme in his interactions with David (<a href="/2_samuel/3-24.htm">2 Samuel 3:24-25</a>). The "house" refers to the place where David was mourning, likely a private chamber. Joab's entrance signifies urgency and the need for immediate action.<p><b>Today you have disgraced all your servants</b><br>Joab accuses David of bringing shame upon his loyal followers. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, honor and shame were pivotal societal values. By mourning Absalom excessively, David inadvertently dishonors those who risked their lives for him. This highlights the tension between personal grief and public duty, a common theme in leadership narratives.<p><b>who have saved your life</b><br>Joab reminds David of the immediate threat Absalom posed. The rebellion led by Absalom was not just a familial dispute but a direct challenge to David's kingship (<a href="/2_samuel/15-13.htm">2 Samuel 15:13-14</a>). The phrase underscores the loyalty and bravery of David's men, who fought to preserve his life and reign.<p><b>and the lives of your sons and daughters</b><br>The rebellion endangered not only David but his entire family. In the context of royal succession, the safety of the king's offspring was crucial. Joab's words emphasize the broader implications of Absalom's revolt, which threatened the stability of the Davidic line, a line significant in biblical prophecy (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>of your wives, and of your concubines</b><br>This phrase highlights the comprehensive threat Absalom's rebellion posed to David's household. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the king's household was a symbol of his power and legacy. The mention of wives and concubines also recalls Absalom's public appropriation of David's concubines (<a href="/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21-22</a>), an act meant to assert dominance and humiliate David. Joab's reminder serves to refocus David on the broader consequences of his actions and the need to uphold his kingly responsibilities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, known for his military prowess and sometimes ruthless actions.

Joab's whole character appears strikingly in his conduct on this occasion. With his hand red with the blood of the beloved son, he goes, in the hardest and most unfeeling terms, to reproach the father for giving way to his grief; he treats the king with thorough insolence, and with the air of a superior; yet withal he counsels David for his own welfare and for that of the kingdom as a wise and loyal statesman. It may be doubted whether David yet knew of Joab's part in the death of Absalom.<p><span class= "bld">The lives of thy sons.</span>--Had Absalom succeeded he would no doubt not only have slain his father, but also, after the Oriental custom, have put out of the way all who might possibly have become rival claimants of the throne. (Comp. <a href="/judges/9-5.htm" title="And he went to his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, being three score and ten persons, on one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.">Judges 9:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/15-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:">1Kings 15:29</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one that urinates against a wall, neither of his kinfolks, nor of his friends.">1Kings 16:11</a>; <a href="/context/2_kings/10-6.htm" title="Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If you be mine, and if you will listen to my voice, take you the heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up.">2Kings 10:6-7</a>; <a href="/2_kings/11-1.htm" title="And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.">2Kings 11:1</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Joab... said.</span> Joab's speech puts the alternative in a very incisive and even rude way before the king. But what he says is true, namely, that Absalom's success would inevitably have been followed by the massacre, not only of David himself, but of his sons and daughters, and of the women who had accompanied him in his flight. Nor would it have stopped there. but the officers of his court, the captains of his army, his mighties, and all who had long eared for and loved him would have been put to the sword. It was this horrible certainty, according to Oriental usage, which made Absalom's rebellion so abominable, and which steeled the heart of Joab against him when he saw him hanging in the tree. He regarded him as a fratricide and parricide, who had plotted murder on a large scale; and Joab was not made milder by the thought that this would have included himself and the heroes who had made David's throne so great. With stern good sense he, therefore, bids the king suppress his mere personal feelings, and leave the chamber in which he had concealed himself, to go forth and "speak to the heart of his servants," that is, thank and praise them in a friendly manner. For otherwise they would disperse and leave him; and this would be followed by the uprise of some other claimant of the throne - some relative, perhaps, of Saul, backed by the tribes of Benjamin and Ephraim; and David, abandoned by the nation, would fall an easy victim, with all his family, of this second rebellion. Absalom's rapid success proved that David had many enemies, and without great prudence he might be left at Mahanaim as powerless as Ishbeshoth had been. The long delay between the death of this puppet king and David's appointment to be sovereign of all Israel was probably owing to the same want of enthusiasm for David which had made the nation transfer its allegiance so lightly to the handsome Absalom. But with all his good sense Joab was coarse and rude. He was, moreover, utterly incapable of understanding David's real feelings. He saw only a father giving way to an exaggerated loss for a handsome but worthless son. David really was condemning himself for having brought lust and murder into his own house by abominable sin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/19-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Joab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1435;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3097.htm">Strong's 3097: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joab -- 'the LORD is father', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
