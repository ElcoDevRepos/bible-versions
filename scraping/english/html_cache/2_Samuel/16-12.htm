David, the speaker, is in a period of great distress as he flees from his son Absalom, who has usurped the throne. The term "affliction" here can be understood as both physical and emotional suffering. In the broader biblical context, God is often portrayed as one who sees and responds to the afflictions of His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>, where God acknowledges the suffering of the Israelites in Egypt. David's hope is that God, who is aware of all things, will take notice of his current plight.<p><b>and repay me with good</b><br>David expresses hope that God will transform his current suffering into a blessing. This reflects a common biblical theme where God turns situations of hardship into opportunities for growth and blessing, as seen in the story of Joseph in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>. The idea of divine recompense is also echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to endure suffering with the hope of future reward (<a href="/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>). David's faith in God's justice and goodness is evident, trusting that God will ultimately bring about a positive outcome.<p><b>for the cursing I receive today.</b><br>The "cursing" refers to the verbal abuse David receives from Shimei, a member of Saul's family, as he flees Jerusalem. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, cursing was a serious offense, often believed to invoke divine judgment. However, David's response is one of humility and patience, choosing not to retaliate. This attitude is reminiscent of Jesus Christ, who taught and exemplified love for enemies and non-retaliation (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>). David's acceptance of the cursing can also be seen as an acknowledgment of his own past sins, particularly his actions involving Bathsheba and Uriah, and a submission to God's sovereign will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is fleeing from his son Absalom.

The Syriac has "my subjection," possibly a free translation of the same reading. But the written text (K'tib) has "my wrong," either the wrong I have done, and of which I am bearing the punishment, or, as in the Revised Version, "the wrong done unto me." The correction of the Massorites (K'ri), is literally "my eye," that is, "my team." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/16-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Perhaps</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1463;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#363;&#183;lay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_194.htm">Strong's 194: </a> </span><span class="str2">Perhaps</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will see</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(yir&#183;&#8217;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my affliction</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
