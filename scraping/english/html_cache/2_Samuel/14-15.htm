The context is a carefully crafted parable to persuade David to reconcile with his estranged son Absalom. The phrase reflects the formal approach and respect due to a king, highlighting the hierarchical structure of ancient Israelite society. The use of "my lord the king" underscores the authority and reverence associated with the monarchy, a central institution in Israel's history.<p><b>because the people have made me afraid</b><br>The woman claims fear of the people, which may reflect the societal pressures and potential unrest due to Absalom's banishment. This fear could symbolize the broader anxiety within the kingdom over unresolved familial and national issues. The phrase also illustrates the role of public opinion in royal decisions, a theme seen throughout the biblical narrative, where leaders often face the challenge of balancing divine command with popular sentiment.<p><b>Your servant thought, &#8216;I will speak to the king.</b><br>The term "Your servant" is a common expression of humility and submission in biblical texts, indicating the speaker's lower status and dependence on the king's favor. This approach is strategic, as it positions the woman as a petitioner seeking justice, a recurring motif in the Bible where individuals appeal to those in authority for intervention, reminiscent of Esther's approach to King Xerxes.<p><b>Perhaps he will grant the request of his maidservant.</b><br>The phrase "Perhaps he will grant" suggests hope and uncertainty, reflecting the unpredictable nature of royal decisions. The term "maidservant" further emphasizes humility and the social hierarchy. This plea for mercy and justice is a theme that resonates with other biblical narratives, such as the persistent widow in <a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18</a>, illustrating the power of persistent and humble petitioning before those in authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army who orchestrates the plan to reconcile David with his son Absalom by using a wise woman from Tekoa.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wise_woman_of_tekoa.htm">The Wise Woman of Tekoa</a></b><br>A woman chosen by Joab to present a parable to King David, aiming to convince him to bring Absalom back to Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The ruler of Israel, who is dealing with the estrangement from his son Absalom after Absalom's murder of his brother Amnon.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, who is in exile after killing his brother Amnon in revenge for the rape of their sister Tamar.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tekoa.htm">Tekoa</a></b><br>A town in Judah, known for its wise inhabitants, from which the woman who speaks to David is brought.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_intercession.htm">The Power of Intercession</a></b><br>The wise woman of Tekoa serves as an intercessor, demonstrating the importance of speaking up for reconciliation and peace.

David must rise above such pressure and act on righteousness.<p>&#8226; The phrase also hints that unrest over Absalom is growing; David&#8217;s inaction fuels national anxiety (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/14-1.htm">2 Samuel 14:1</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-6.htm">2 Samuel 15:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Your servant thought, &#8220;I will speak to the king&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The woman models the wisdom of bringing concerns to the highest, rightful authority rather than grumbling in secret (cf. <a href="/esther/4-15.htm">Esther 4:15-5</a>:2; <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Calling herself &#8220;your servant&#8221; reflects humility, reminding David of his own servant-king role before the LORD (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/7-25.htm">2 Samuel 7:25-29</a>).<p>&#8226; Her decision underscores faith that God works through His appointed shepherd to restore wayward sheep (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Perhaps he will grant the request of his maidservant</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Perhaps&#8221; shows hopeful confidence, not presumption&#8212;she trusts David&#8217;s heart of mercy (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/14-21.htm">2 Samuel 14:21</a>; <a href="/psalms/86-15.htm">Psalm 86:15</a>).<p>&#8226; She seeks undeserved favor, illustrating the gospel pattern of sinners appealing to the King&#8217;s grace (cf. <a href="/luke/18-13.htm">Luke 18:13</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>).<p>&#8226; By presenting herself as &#8220;maidservant,&#8221; she invites David to act fatherly toward a vulnerable subject, foreshadowing the mercy he should extend to his estranged son.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/14-15.htm">2 Samuel 14:15</a> records the wise woman&#8217;s respectful, faith-filled approach to King David. Urgency (&#8220;now&#8221;), recognition of authority, honest confession of fear, humble petition, and expectant hope weave together to press David toward merciful justice. The verse reminds believers that God calls His people to bring their concerns reverently to Him-appointed authority&#8212;and ultimately to Christ the perfect King&#8212;trusting that divine compassion triumphs over public pressure and personal hesitation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Because the people have made me afraid.</span>--The woman here seeks to excuse her boldness in addressing the king by the pressure brought to bear upon her from without; but whether she means this in regard to what she has said of Absalom, or of her own. affairs, is very doubtful. In the former case <span class= "ital">the people </span>would mean the nation generally; in the latter, her own family connections. Certainly in the next verse she returns to her own affairs to keep up the pretence of reality; but here there seems to be an intentional and studied ambiguity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore that I am come,</span> etc. The woman now professes to return to her old story as the reason for her importunity, but she repeats it in so eager and indirect a manner as to indicate that it had another meaning. Instead, too, of thanking the king for fully granting her petition, she still flatters and coaxes as one whose purpose was as yet ungained. The king's word is, <span class="cmt_word">for rest</span> (see margin): it puts an end to vexation, and, by deciding matters, sets the disputants at peace. He is as <span class="cmt_word">an angel of God,</span> as God's messenger, whose words have Divine authority; and his office is, not to <span class="cmt_word">discern</span>, but "to hear the good and the evil," unmoved, as the Vulgate renders it, by blessing and cursing. His mission is too high for him to be influenced either by good words or by evil, but having patiently heard both sides, and calmly thought over the reasons for and against, he will decide righteously. Finally, she ends with the prayer, <span class="cmt_word">And may Jehovah thy God be with thee!</span> By such words she hoped to propitiate the king, who now could not fail to see that the errand of the woman was personal to himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/14-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now therefore,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1440;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
