His refusal to turn away from pursuing Abner, despite warnings, demonstrates his determination and perhaps youthful overconfidence. This moment highlights the tension between the house of Saul and the house of David, as Asahel was part of David's forces. His refusal also reflects the personal vendettas and the complexities of loyalty during the period of the divided kingdom.<p><b>So Abner thrust the butt of his spear into his stomach,</b><br>Abner, a seasoned warrior and commander of Saul's army, uses the butt of his spear, indicating his reluctance to kill Asahel but also his need to defend himself. The use of the spear's butt rather than the blade suggests a defensive maneuver rather than an outright attack. This act underscores the brutal realities of ancient warfare and the personal nature of these conflicts, as Abner had previously tried to dissuade Asahel from pursuing him.<p><b>and it came out his back,</b><br>The graphic description of the spear's impact emphasizes the fatal nature of the wound and the inevitability of Asahel's death. This detail serves to highlight the tragic consequences of the civil strife between the factions of Saul and David. It also foreshadows the ongoing bloodshed and the cycle of vengeance that will follow, particularly involving Joab, Asahel's brother.<p><b>and he fell dead on the spot.</b><br>Asahel's immediate death marks a turning point in the narrative, as it sets off a chain of events leading to further bloodshed and retribution. His death is a catalyst for Joab's later actions against Abner, illustrating the theme of justice and revenge that permeates the historical books of the Old Testament. This moment also reflects the harsh realities of leadership and the cost of ambition in the pursuit of power.<p><b>And every man paused when he came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died.</b><br>The pause of the men signifies a moment of reflection and perhaps fear, as they witness the consequences of the conflict. It serves as a sobering reminder of the cost of war and the personal losses incurred. This moment of pause can be seen as a temporary cessation of hostilities, highlighting the respect and recognition of Asahel's bravery and the gravity of the situation. It also foreshadows the eventual reconciliation and unification under David's kingship, as the tribes of Israel come to terms with the need for peace and unity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/asahel.htm">Asahel</a></b><br>The brother of Joab and Abishai, known for his swiftness and part of King David's forces.
