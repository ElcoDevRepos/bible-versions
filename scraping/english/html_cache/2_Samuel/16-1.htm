The "summit" likely refers to the Mount of Olives, a significant location east of Jerusalem. This mountain is often associated with worship and prayer, as seen in David's own life and later in Jesus' ministry (<a href="/luke/22-39.htm">Luke 22:39-46</a>). The summit represents a place of transition and decision, highlighting David's vulnerability and the gravity of his situation.<p><b>Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth was there to meet him</b><br>Ziba was a servant of Saul's household, specifically serving Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan and grandson of Saul. This meeting is significant because it introduces a subplot of loyalty and betrayal. Ziba's actions here are later contrasted with Mephibosheth's account in <a href="/2_samuel/19-24.htm">2 Samuel 19:24-30</a>, raising questions about Ziba's motives and integrity. The encounter underscores themes of loyalty and deception, which are prevalent throughout David's reign.<p><b>He had a pair of saddled donkeys loaded with two hundred loaves of bread</b><br>The provision of donkeys and bread indicates Ziba's intention to support David materially during his flight. Bread, a staple food, symbolizes sustenance and hospitality. This act of provision can be seen as a gesture of allegiance to David, though it also foreshadows the complex dynamics between Ziba and Mephibosheth. The number "two hundred" may suggest abundance, reflecting the urgency and generosity of Ziba's offering.<p><b>a hundred clusters of raisins</b><br>Raisins were a common food in ancient Israel, often used for sustenance during travel. They are mentioned in other biblical contexts as provisions for journeys or offerings (<a href="/1_samuel/25-18.htm">1 Samuel 25:18</a>). The inclusion of raisins highlights the practical needs of David and his followers, emphasizing the importance of preparation and resourcefulness in times of crisis.<p><b>a hundred summer fruits</b><br>Summer fruits, likely figs or other seasonal produce, were valued for their nutritional content and ease of transport. This detail underscores the immediacy of Ziba's support, as summer fruits would have been readily available and suitable for a quick departure. The mention of "a hundred" again suggests a significant quantity, reinforcing the theme of provision.<p><b>and a skin of wine</b><br>Wine was a common beverage in biblical times, often used for refreshment and medicinal purposes. The inclusion of wine in Ziba's provisions indicates care for the well-being of David and his men. Wine also holds symbolic significance in Scripture, representing joy and blessing (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). In this context, it may serve as a reminder of God's provision and favor, even in the midst of adversity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is fleeing from his son Absalom. This event occurs during a time of great personal and political turmoil for David.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziba.htm">Ziba</a></b><br>The steward of Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan and grandson of Saul.

Mephibosheth is the son of Jonathan, David's dear friend, and has been shown kindness by David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_summit.htm">The Summit</a></b><br>Refers to the Mount of Olives, which David crosses as he flees Jerusalem. This location is significant in biblical history and prophecy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/provisions.htm">Provisions</a></b><br>The donkeys, bread, raisins, figs, and wine brought by Ziba symbolize sustenance and support during David's time of need, but also introduce questions of loyalty and deception.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_times_of_crisis.htm">Discernment in Times of Crisis</a></b><br>In moments of crisis, discernment is crucial. David's encounter with Ziba teaches us to seek God's wisdom in evaluating the intentions of others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_complexity_of_human_motives.htm">The Complexity of Human Motives</a></b><br>Ziba's actions remind us that human motives can be complex and self-serving. We must be cautious and prayerful in our judgments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_in_difficult_times.htm">God's Provision in Difficult Times</a></b><br>Despite the uncertainty, God provides for David through Ziba's provisions. Trust in God's provision even when circumstances are challenging.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/loyalty_and_betrayal.htm">Loyalty and Betrayal</a></b><br>The account of Ziba and Mephibosheth highlights themes of loyalty and betrayal.

And Ziba said, I humbly beseech you that I may find grace in your sight, my lord, O king.">2Samuel 16:4</a>) of personal gain. This story was, indeed, almost too improbable to be believed; for, quite independently of his obligations to David, Mephibosheth, a helpless cripple of the house of Saul, could hardly have hoped that Absalom's rebellion would bring the throne to him; yet David, apt to be hasty in his judgments, was in a state to believe in any story of ingratitude, and to be deeply affected by Ziba's large contribution to his necessities. Ziba shows entire want of principle, and could, therefore, have adhered to David's cause only because he had the shrewdness to foresee its ultimate success.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth</span>. It is the misfortune of troubled times like those in which David found himself, that unscrupulous men use them for selfish purposes. For those in danger have no time for careful examination, nor are their minds sufficiently calm for impartial judgment, but they act on first impressions, and catch at every straw. Ziba's present would naturally raise everybody's spirits, and be taken as a good omen; for it showed that David had adherents in unlikely quarters, when thus a servant of the house of Saul of his own accord brought so timely an offering. The asses saddled for riding contradict the idea that Ziba met David by chance as he was bringing the produce of the farm for the use of Mephibosheth's household. More probably the asses had been saddled for Mephibosheth's own use (comp. <a href="/2_samuel/19-26.htm">2 Samuel 19:26</a>), and the provisions had been prepared as a contribution to the king's needs: but at the last moment the cunning Ziba managed to hurry away with his men, leaving his master in the lurch, and unable to get anything to ride upon in the short interval between David's escape and Absalom's entry. Moreover, possibly from being a cripple, and from the distressing circumStances of his early life, Mephibosheth always seems deficient in energy, and perhaps David's conduct in mulcting him of half his property may not really have been so unjust as it looks, supposing that it was his dilatoriness which gave Ziba the chance of going away with the whole convoy while he was wasting time. It was this apparent desertion of him by one whom he had so befriended which may have made David say, "All men are liars" (<a href="/psalms/116-11.htm">Psalm 116:11</a>), though subsequently he learned that the lie was Ziba's. The food consisted of two hundred leaves, or rather fiat cakes of bread, a hundred bunches of dried grapes, a hundred cakes of pressed dates, and a skin of wine. Instead of "date cakes," some of the versions render "fig cakes;" but for this there is a special Hebrew word (see <a href="/1_samuel/30-12.htm">1 Samuel 30:12</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/16-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1431;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
