In the context of ancient Israel, leaders often sought to verify the truth of reports, especially concerning matters of national importance. This moment follows the death of Saul and Jonathan, a pivotal event in Israel's history. David's question shows his careful approach to understanding the situation fully before taking action. This aligns with his character as a man after God's own heart, who often sought divine guidance.<p><b>&#8220;Where are you from?&#8221;</b><br>David's question is not merely about geographical origin but also about the young man's identity and allegiance. In the ancient Near East, one's origin often determined their social status, rights, and responsibilities. By asking this, David seeks to understand the young man's background and potential motives. This question also reflects the importance of tribal and national identity in Israelite society, where lineage and heritage were crucial.<p><b>&#8220;I am the son of a foreigner,&#8221; he answered.</b><br>The young man's response indicates his status as an outsider. In Israel, foreigners had different rights and were often viewed with suspicion. The term "foreigner" suggests he was not part of the covenant community of Israel, which could affect his credibility and the reception of his report. This status might also imply a lack of understanding of Israelite customs and laws, which could be significant in the unfolding narrative.<p><b>&#8220;I am an Amalekite.&#8221;</b><br>The identification as an Amalekite is significant due to the historical enmity between Israel and the Amalekites. The Amalekites were descendants of Esau and were long-standing enemies of Israel, first attacking them during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>). God commanded Israel to blot out the memory of Amalek (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>), and Saul's failure to fully carry out this command led to his rejection as king (1 Samuel 15). The presence of an Amalekite in this narrative highlights the ongoing conflict and the complexities of David's rise to power. This also foreshadows the judgment that David will pronounce on the young man, as his identity as an Amalekite carries significant historical and theological weight.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, known for his heart after God.

Before acting, he pauses to examine the facts&#8212;he wants more than hearsay (compare <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>).<p>&#8226; By questioning, David models the discernment expected of a future king: &#8220;Then David said to the young man who had brought him the report, &#8216;How do you know that Saul and Jonathan are dead?&#8217; &#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/1-5.htm">2 Samuel 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; His careful inquiry reflects the habit he showed at Keilah and Ziklag&#8212;always seeking confirmation before deciding (<a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2-4</a>; 30:7-8).<p>&#8226; The episode reminds us that grief does not suspend the need for truth or justice. Even in lament (<a href="/2_samuel/1-11.htm">2 Samuel 1:11-12</a>) David&#8217;s first response is accountability.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Where are you from?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Identity is crucial. If the messenger were an Israelite, the legal and covenant implications would differ from those for a foreigner (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-3.htm">Deuteronomy 23:3</a>; <a href="/numbers/35-30.htm">Numbers 35:30-31</a>).<p>&#8226; The question also tests motive. David has encountered opportunists before&#8212;Doeg the Edomite boasted of aiding Saul to slaughter the priests (<a href="/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9-10</a>). David will not repeat that tragedy by accepting unverified claims.<p>&#8226; Asking &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; guards Israel&#8217;s throne from manipulation (<a href="/2_samuel/4-10.htm">2 Samuel 4:10</a>). A true shepherd safeguards both flock and crown.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I am the son of a foreigner,&#8221; he answered.</b><p>&#8226; The phrase indicates a resident alien&#8212;one living among Israel without full covenant status (<a href="/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48</a>; <a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a>).<p>&#8226; By stressing he is &#8220;the son&#8221; of such a man, the messenger distances himself from tribal loyalties. Perhaps he expects David to reward an outsider who aided him.<p>&#8226; Yet this self-designation quietly signals vulnerability. Foreigners enjoyed limited protections but could also be judged for capital offenses (<a href="/leviticus/24-22.htm">Leviticus 24:22</a>). David hears that the man claims no covenant allegiance, so any plea for special mercy is weakened.<p>&#8226; The line also exposes the messenger&#8217;s miscalculation: David&#8217;s loyalty to God&#8217;s order outweighs any political gain a foreign mercenary might offer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I am an Amalekite.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Now the identity is complete&#8212;and disastrous. God had declared perpetual enmity with Amalek (<a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14-16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s great failure had been sparing Amalek&#8217;s king (<a href="/1_samuel/15-2.htm">1 Samuel 15:2-9</a>). An Amalekite boasting of finishing Saul&#8217;s life only magnifies the irony: the very enemy Saul failed to destroy claims to have destroyed Saul.<p>&#8226; David had just rescued Ziklag from an Amalekite raid (<a href="/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1, 17</a>-20). Hearing the name stirs fresh memories of plunder and grief.<p>&#8226; By admitting Amalekite status, the young man unwittingly signs his own sentence. David will soon declare, &#8220;Your own mouth has testified against you, saying, &#8216;I killed the LORD&#8217;s anointed&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/1-16.htm">2 Samuel 1:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The episode underscores God&#8217;s consistent standard: neither nationality nor opportunism excuses lifting a hand against His anointed (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>; 26:9).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/1-13.htm">2 Samuel 1:13</a> shows David pausing amid sorrow to interrogate a messenger whose self-disclosure seals his fate. Each question peels back a layer: Who is this man? What allegiance does he hold? When the answer proves he is an Amalekite&#8212;people under divine judgment&#8212;David sees the gravity. The verse teaches that God&#8217;s king must prize truth, uphold covenant principles, and judge impartially, even when information arrives wrapped in apparent benefit. David&#8217;s discernment foreshadows the flawless justice of the greater Son of David, who always judges &#8220;with righteousness&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/11-3.htm">Isaiah 11:3-5</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/1-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1431;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">inquired</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
