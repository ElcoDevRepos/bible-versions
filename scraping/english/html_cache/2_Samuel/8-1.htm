It suggests a continuation of David's military campaigns to secure Israel's borders and fulfill God's promises to the nation. The timing is significant as it shows David's ongoing commitment to securing the land promised to Israel.<p><b>David defeated the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were long-standing enemies of Israel, often depicted as a formidable military threat. David's victory over them is a fulfillment of God's promise to deliver Israel from its enemies. This victory is part of a series of military successes that establish David's reputation as a warrior king. The defeat of the Philistines also symbolizes the triumph of God's chosen king over pagan nations, reflecting the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty.<p><b>subdued them</b><br>Subduing the Philistines implies not only a military victory but also the imposition of Israelite control over them. This subjugation is significant as it marks a shift in power dynamics in the region, with Israel emerging as a dominant force. It also fulfills the divine mandate given to Israel to conquer and possess the land. The subjugation of enemies is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often seen as a sign of God's favor and blessing.<p><b>and took Metheg-ammah from the hand of the Philistines</b><br>Metheg-ammah is a term that is often interpreted as referring to a strategic location or city, possibly Gath, one of the principal Philistine cities. The capture of such a location would have been a significant military and political achievement, further consolidating David's control over the region. This action demonstrates David's strategic acumen and God's providence in granting victory to Israel. The taking of Metheg-ammah can also be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, as David's victories foreshadow the ultimate triumph of the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, anointed by God, known for his military prowess and deep faith.

We have in this chapter a brief summary of the wars which raised Israel from the position of a struggling and oppressed race to the possession of widespread empire. With this narrative the first history of David ends, and in the subsequent narratives many of the events referred to here are more fully detailed, and given with additional incidents. <span class="cmt_word">David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines.</span> Metheg-ammah means "the bridle of the mother city." We learn from the parallel place (<a href="/1_chronicles/18-1.htm">1 Chronicles 18:1</a>) that the city of Gath is meant by this phrase. Gath was at this time the metropolis of Philistia, and had reduced the other four chief towns to a state of vassalage. Thus by taking Gath, his old city of refuge (<a href="/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>), David acquired also the supremacy which she had previously exercised over the whole country, and by placing a strong garrison there, as previously the Philistines had done in the towns of Israel, he kept that martial race in awe. It denotes great progress in the arts of war that David could besiege and capture a town so strong as Gath. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/8-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Some time later,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
