The abandonment of their idols signifies a significant defeat and humiliation, as these idols represented their gods' presence and power. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the loss of idols in battle was seen as a sign of divine disfavor and a loss of spiritual protection. This event highlights the superiority of the God of Israel over the gods of the Philistines, echoing earlier biblical narratives such as the capture of the Ark of the Covenant in <a href="/1_samuel/5.htm">1 Samuel 5</a>, where the idol Dagon fell before the Ark.<p><b>and David and his men carried them away</b><br>David, anointed as king over all Israel, leads his men in a victorious campaign against the Philistines. The act of carrying away the idols can be seen as a symbolic gesture of triumph and the subjugation of the Philistine gods under the God of Israel. This action also reflects the practice of taking spoils of war, which was common in ancient times. The removal of the idols could be seen as a fulfillment of the commandment against idolatry, as found in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>, and a demonstration of David's commitment to purging the land of foreign gods. This event foreshadows the ultimate victory of Christ over all spiritual powers and authorities, as described in <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>, where He disarms the rulers and authorities, triumphing over them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, known for his leadership and devotion to God.

Just a few lines earlier &#8220;the Philistines came and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/5-18.htm">2 Samuel 5:18</a>). David named the spot &#8220;Baal-perazim,&#8221; saying, &#8220;The LORD has broken out against my enemies before me, like a bursting flood&#8221; (v. 20).<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;there&#8221; reminds us the victory was not abstract; it unfolded at an identifiable location, proving God&#8217;s real-time intervention (<a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12-14</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/14-11.htm">1 Chronicles 14:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Every believer has a &#8220;there&#8221;&#8212;a moment when the Lord unmistakably breaks through. Remembering those places fuels present faith (<a href="/psalms/77-11.htm">Psalm 77:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Philistines abandoned their idols</b><p>Pagan warriors carried their gods into combat, hoping to secure favor, yet &#8220;the idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of human hands&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/135-15.htm">Psalm 135:15</a>). When the tide turned, the Philistines dropped what they once trusted.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s superiority is again on display, much as when the statue of Dagon toppled before the ark (<a href="/1_samuel/5-2.htm">1 Samuel 5:2-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah pictures the same futility: &#8220;Bel bows down, Nebo stoops low; their idols weigh down beasts of burden&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1</a>). Idols can&#8217;t even save themselves, let alone their worshipers.<p>&#8226; The moment exposes a timeless truth: whatever displaces the Lord in the human heart will ultimately fail (<a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10-11</a>; <a href="/1_john/5-21.htm">1 John 5:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and David and his men carried them away</b><p><a href="/1_chronicles/14-12.htm">1 Chronicles 14:12</a> clarifies the action: &#8220;The Philistines abandoned their gods there, and David ordered that they be burned in the fire.&#8221; David obeys God&#8217;s earlier command, &#8220;You are to burn the carved images of their gods&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Removing the idols prevented Israel from stumbling into syncretism (<a href="/exodus/23-24.htm">Exodus 23:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The soldiers likely saw monetary value in the gold or silver plating, but David refused to let gain override obedience&#8212;an echo of Joshua&#8217;s stance against the plunder of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-18.htm">Joshua 6:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; The incident foreshadows Christ&#8217;s triumph: at the cross &#8220;He disarmed the rulers and authorities and made a public spectacle of them&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>). Victory in the Lord always includes the stripping away of counterfeit powers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/5-21.htm">2 Samuel 5:21</a> shows a tangible, historical victory that magnifies the living God. On that battlefield, useless idols lay scattered, their owners in retreat, while David&#8212;true to God&#8217;s Word&#8212;removed and destroyed every false god. The verse urges us to remember our own &#8220;there,&#8221; renounce all competitors to Christ&#8217;s throne, and walk in wholehearted obedience that leaves no idol standing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Their images.</span>--The Philistines took their idols with them to battle, as the Israelites had formerly taken the ark, and the suddenness and completeness of their defeat is shown by their leaving them on the field. The statement that David "burned" them is taken from <a href="/1_chronicles/14-12.htm" title="And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.">1Chronicles 14:12</a>, the Hebrew here being simply "took them away." (See <a href="/deuteronomy/7-5.htm" title="But thus shall you deal with them; you shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They left their images.</span> This is a further proof of the suddenness of the attack, and the completeness of the Philistine discomfiture. For <span class="accented">images</span> we find "gods" in the parallel place in <a href="/1_chronicles/14-12.htm">1 Chronicles 14:12</a>, and the word used here is rendered "idols" in <a href="/1_samuel/31-9.htm">1 Samuel 31:9</a>. As the Philistines supposed that these images of their deities would ensure their victory, they would set great store by them, as the Israelites did by the ark (<a href="/1_samuel/4-4.htm">1 Samuel 4:4</a>), and the French by the oriflamme. Their capture, therefore, was a feat as great as the winning of the eagle of a Roman legion. <span class="cmt_word">David and his men burned them;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">took them away.</span> This translation of the Authorized Version, made to force the words into verbal agreement with <a href="/1_chronicles/14-12.htm">1 Chronicles 14:12</a>, is utterly indefensible; and, like most wrong things, it is absurd. The Bible cannot be improved by frauds, and really the two narratives complete one another. David and his men carried off these images as trophies, just as the Philistines carried off the ark (<a href="/1_samuel/4-11.htm">1 Samuel 4:11</a>). But the ark proved mightier than the Philistine gods, and in terror the people restored it to Israel. But no avenging hand interfered to rescue these gods, and, after being paraded in triumph, they were made into a bonfire. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/5-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">There</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8033.htm">Strong's 8033: </a> </span><span class="str2">There, then, thither</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Philistines abandoned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1494;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;az&#183;&#7687;&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
