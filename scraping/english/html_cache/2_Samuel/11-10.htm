Uriah, a Hittite and one of David's mighty men, was loyal to the king and the Israelite army. His refusal to go home underscores his commitment to his fellow soldiers, who were still in battle. This sets the stage for David's subsequent actions, which are driven by his desire to cover up his sin with Bathsheba. The phrase also reflects the cultural expectation of hospitality and rest after a journey, which Uriah defies due to his sense of duty.<p><b>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you just arrived from a journey?&#8221;</b><br>David's question to Uriah reflects the normal expectation that a soldier returning from battle would seek comfort and rest at home. This was a common practice in ancient times, where returning warriors were often given time to recuperate. David's question is rhetorical, emphasizing the unusual nature of Uriah's decision. It also reveals David's attempt to manipulate the situation to his advantage, as he seeks to cover up his adultery with Bathsheba by encouraging Uriah to go home to his wife.<p><b>David asked Uriah.</b><br>David's direct engagement with Uriah shows his personal involvement in the situation. This interaction is significant because it demonstrates David's initial attempt to resolve the issue discreetly. The king's personal inquiry also highlights the gravity of the situation, as David is not delegating this matter to others. This personal involvement foreshadows the lengths to which David will go to conceal his sin, ultimately leading to further moral compromise.<p><b>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you go home?&#8221;</b><br>David's question underscores his surprise and frustration at Uriah's actions. It reveals David's internal conflict and desperation to maintain his public image. The question also highlights the contrast between Uriah's integrity and David's moral failure. Uriah's decision not to go home is rooted in his solidarity with his fellow soldiers and his adherence to the wartime code of conduct, which prohibited personal indulgence while the Ark and Israel's army were in tents. This integrity serves as a stark contrast to David's behavior and sets the stage for the tragic events that follow.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is central to this account.
