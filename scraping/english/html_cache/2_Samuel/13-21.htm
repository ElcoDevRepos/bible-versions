The events leading up to this moment involved the rape of his daughter Tamar by her half-brother Amnon. This incident would have been particularly distressing for David, not only as a father but also as a ruler who was expected to uphold the law. The phrase "heard all this" indicates that David was informed of the entire situation, likely by multiple sources, which would have included the details of Amnon's actions and Tamar's distress. This reflects the communication methods of the time, where news would spread through messengers and witnesses.<p><b>he was furious</b><br>David's anger is a natural human response to the grievous sin committed by Amnon. However, the text does not indicate that David took any action against Amnon, which has been a point of discussion among scholars. This inaction could be seen as a failure of leadership and justice, reflecting the complexities of familial and political dynamics in ancient Israel. David's fury might also be connected to his own past sins, such as his affair with Bathsheba and the murder of Uriah, which could have influenced his hesitance to punish Amnon. This moment foreshadows the ongoing turmoil within David's family, fulfilling Nathan's prophecy in <a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a> about the sword never departing from David's house.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart for God but also for his personal failings.

The remembrance of his own sin also tended to withhold his hand from the administration of justice. David's criminal weakness towards his children was the source of much trouble from this time to the end of his life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David... was very wroth.</span> The legal punishment for Amnon's crime was "the being cut off in the sight of the people" (<a href="/leviticus/20-17.htm">Leviticus 20:17</a>). But how could David, who had himself committed crimes for which death was the appointed penalty, carry out the law against his firstborn for following his example? Still, he might have done more than merely give Amnon words of reproof. Eli had done as much, and been punished with the death of his sons for his neglect of duty (<a href="/1_samuel/2-34.htm">1 Samuel 2:34</a>). The sin of David's son had been even more heartless than theirs; and could David hope to escape the like penalty? It would have been wise to have given proof that his repentance included the suppression of the crime to which his previous conduct had given encouragement. But David was a man whose conduct was generally governed by his feelings. He was a creature of warm and often generous impulse, but his character lacked the steadiness of thoughtful and consistent purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/13-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When King</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1428;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">heard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1429;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;ma&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he was furious.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#183;&#7717;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2734.htm">Strong's 2734: </a> </span><span class="str2">To glow, grow warm, to blaze up, of anger, zeal, jealousy</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/2_samuel/13-21.htm">2 Samuel 13:21 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/2_samuel/13-21.htm">2 Samuel 13:21 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/2_samuel/13-21.htm">2 Samuel 13:21 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/2_samuel/13-21.htm">2 Samuel 13:21 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/2_samuel/13-21.htm">2 Samuel 13:21 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/2_samuel/13-21.htm">2 Samuel 13:21  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/2_samuel/13-21.htm">2 Samuel 13:21 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/2_samuel/13-21.htm">2 Samuel 13:21 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/2_samuel/13-21.htm">2 Samuel 13:21 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/2_samuel/13-21.htm">2 Samuel 13:21 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/2_samuel/13-21.htm">OT History: 2 Samuel 13:21 But when king David heard of all (2Sa iiSam 2 Sam ii sam) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/2_samuel/13-20.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="2 Samuel 13:20"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 13:20" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/2_samuel/13-22.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="2 Samuel 13:22"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="2 Samuel 13:22" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
