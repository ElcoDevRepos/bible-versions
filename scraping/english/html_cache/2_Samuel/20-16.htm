In biblical narratives, wise women are sometimes depicted as having significant influence, such as the wise woman of Tekoa in <a href="/2_samuel/14.htm">2 Samuel 14</a>. The city in question is Abel Beth Maacah, a fortified city in northern Israel, known for its strategic importance. The presence of a wise woman suggests a society that values wisdom and counsel, even from women, which was notable in the patriarchal context of ancient Israel.<p><b>&#8220;Listen! Listen!</b><br>The repetition of "Listen!" emphasizes urgency and the need for immediate attention. In Hebrew culture, repetition is a common rhetorical device used to stress the importance of a message. This call for attention indicates the seriousness of the situation and the woman's determination to be heard amidst the chaos of Joab's siege.<p><b>Please tell Joab to come here</b><br>Joab was the commander of King David's army, known for his military prowess and sometimes ruthless tactics. The request for Joab to come indicates the woman's understanding of the chain of command and her strategic approach to resolving the conflict. By asking for Joab directly, she bypasses intermediaries, showing her confidence and authority.<p><b>so that I may speak with him.&#8221;</b><br>The desire to speak directly with Joab highlights the woman's role as a mediator and peacemaker. In the biblical context, direct communication was often necessary to resolve disputes and prevent bloodshed. This encounter foreshadows the resolution of the conflict, as the woman's wisdom and negotiation skills ultimately lead to the preservation of her city. This act of mediation can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate mediator between God and humanity, bringing peace and reconciliation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wise_woman.htm">Wise Woman</a></b><br>An unnamed woman from the city of Abel Beth Maacah, known for her wisdom and diplomacy.

By calling her &#8220;wise,&#8221; the text assures us that what follows is sound, God-honoring counsel (<a href="/proverbs/14-1.htm">Proverbs 14:1</a>; 31:26). God does not limit His rescue to military might; He often works through humble, perceptive servants willing to step forward (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Called out from the city</b><p>She stands within the besieged walls of Abel Beth-maacah yet makes her appeal outward. This echoes the unnamed woman of Thebez who, from a city wall, routed Abimelech (<a href="/judges/9-53.htm">Judges 9:53</a>). Cities in Scripture symbolize both security and community responsibility (<a href="/psalms/48-12.htm">Psalm 48:12-14</a>). By &#8220;calling out,&#8221; she takes ownership for her town&#8217;s survival, embodying <a href="/proverbs/11-11.htm">Proverbs 11:11</a>: &#8220;By the blessing of the upright a city is exalted.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Listen! Listen!</b><p>The double imperative intensifies urgency. Repetition is a Hebrew way of waving a flag&#8212;&#8220;pay close attention!&#8221; Similar twin calls appear in <a href="/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11</a> (&#8220;Abraham, Abraham!&#8221;) and <a href="/luke/10-41.htm">Luke 10:41</a> (&#8220;Martha, Martha!&#8221;). The woman knows that salvation often hinges on whether people heed God-sent warnings (<a href="/proverbs/8-4.htm">Proverbs 8:4-6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>). Her shout is both a plea and a warning&#8212;act now, before swords swing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Please tell Joab to come here</b><p>Joab, commander of David&#8217;s army (<a href="/2_samuel/2-13.htm">2 Samuel 2:13</a>; 19:13), is the human decision-maker holding life or death in his hands. Rather than yelling general protests, she seeks the responsible authority directly&#8212;an application of <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a>&#8217;s principle to speak first to the one who can resolve the matter. Note her respect: &#8220;please.&#8221; True wisdom pairs courage with courtesy (<a href="/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>; <a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So that I may speak with him</b><p>Her aim isn&#8217;t confrontation but conversation&#8212;persuasion grounded in truth (<a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1, 23</a>). God often averts destruction through words of intercession (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>; <a href="/esther/7-3.htm">Esther 7:3-4</a>). Like Abigail before David, she offers herself as mediator, foreshadowing the perfect Mediator who would reconcile enemies through the cross (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-20.htm">Colossians 1:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>&#8226;
