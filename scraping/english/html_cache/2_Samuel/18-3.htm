This reflects the high regard and value they place on David's life, recognizing his role as king and leader. Historically, kings often led their troops into battle, but David's men understand the strategic importance of preserving his life. This plea highlights the loyalty and protective instincts of David's followers, reminiscent of the Israelites' earlier insistence on having a king to lead them (<a href="/1_samuel/8-19.htm">1 Samuel 8:19-20</a>).<p><b>For if we have to flee, they will not care about us.</b><br>The soldiers express a pragmatic view of the battle's dynamics. They acknowledge that their enemies, led by Absalom, are primarily focused on David. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern warfare practice where the capture or death of a king could determine the outcome of a conflict. The statement underscores the personal nature of Absalom's rebellion, which is not just a political coup but a familial betrayal.<p><b>Even if half of us die, they will not care.</b><br>This hyperbolic statement emphasizes the singular focus of Absalom's forces on David. It reflects the soldiers' understanding that their lives are secondary to the primary objective of capturing or killing the king. This sentiment echoes the sacrificial nature of military service, where soldiers often risk their lives for the greater good or for the protection of their leader.<p><b>But you are worth ten thousand of us.</b><br>This phrase highlights the immense value placed on David's life and leadership. It reflects the belief that David's presence and guidance are crucial for the morale and success of the army. The number "ten thousand" is likely symbolic, representing a vast multitude, and underscores the king's irreplaceable worth. This can be seen as a type of Christ, where Jesus is considered of infinite worth and central to the spiritual battle against sin and death.<p><b>It is better now if you support us from the city.&#8221;</b><br>The suggestion for David to remain in the city indicates a strategic decision to protect the king while allowing him to provide support and command from a secure location. This reflects the ancient practice of safeguarding key leaders during critical times. The city, likely Mahanaim, serves as a stronghold and a place of refuge, similar to how God is often described as a refuge and fortress in the Psalms (<a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>). This decision also allows David to maintain communication and control over the battle, ensuring that his leadership continues to guide his people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is advised by his people not to go into battle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The soldiers and followers of David who express their concern for his safety.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_battle.htm">The Battle</a></b><br>The context is the battle against Absalom, David's son, who has rebelled against him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>The place from which David is advised to support his troops, indicating a strategic position of safety and leadership.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>Though not directly mentioned in this verse, he is the opposing force and David's son, leading the rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_leadership.htm">The Value of Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders hold significant value and influence, and their safety and well-being are crucial for the morale and success of their followers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_wise_counsel.htm">The Importance of Wise Counsel</a></b><br>Seeking and heeding wise counsel is vital, especially in times of crisis.

The people urge truly that David is the very centre of their whole cause, and suggest that, even while avoiding unnecessary exposure, he may yet be equally helpful by keeping a reserve in the city to help them in case of need.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is better that thou succour us out of the city.</span> David thought it to be his duty to go out with the men who were risking their lives in his cause, but they felt not only how painful it would be for a father to fight against his son; but also that there would certainly be a picked body of men who would try to bring the battle to a rapid end by slaying David. But while they partly urge personal considerations, their chief argument is that David would be of more use if, posted with a body of troops at the city, he held himself in reserve to succour any division that might be in danger. And David, seeing how earnest their wish was, yielded to this representation, feeling that it would give steadiness to his men if they knew that so experienced a general was watching the fight, and was ready to succour them if they needed aid. As the people say that it would not matter "if half of us die," and that David "is worth ten thousand of us," Ewald draws the reasonable conclusion that their whole number was about twenty thousand men. The Hebrew literally is, "For now (<span class="accented">attah</span>) as us are ten thousand," which might mean, "There are ten thousand such as we are, but no one like thee." But the Septuagint and Vulgate read, "But thou (<span class="accented">attah</span>) art as ten thousand of us." The Syriac, however, like the Hebrew, reads "now." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/18-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1436;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
