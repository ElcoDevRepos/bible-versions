His servants, likely including military leaders and household staff, are present. This setting highlights the gravity of the situation, as David is addressing those closest to him in the heart of his kingdom. Jerusalem, known as the City of David, is significant as it was established as the capital after David conquered it from the Jebusites (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-9</a>). The mention of Jerusalem underscores the threat to the very heart of Israel's governance and worship.<p><b>Arise and let us flee</b><br>David's command to flee indicates the urgency and seriousness of the threat posed by Absalom, his son. This moment reflects a reversal of David's previous triumphs, such as his victory over Goliath and his successful military campaigns. The call to flee is reminiscent of David's earlier life when he fled from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/19-10.htm">1 Samuel 19:10</a>). It shows David's wisdom in recognizing when to fight and when to retreat, a strategic decision to preserve life and the kingdom.<p><b>or we will not escape from Absalom!</b><br>Absalom, David's third son, has initiated a rebellion against his father. This phrase highlights the immediate danger posed by Absalom's insurrection. Absalom's actions fulfill Nathan's prophecy of turmoil within David's house (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>). The familial betrayal echoes the broader theme of sin's consequences, as David's past sins with Bathsheba and Uriah have led to turmoil within his family.<p><b>We must leave quickly</b><br>The urgency in David's words emphasizes the imminent threat. The need for haste suggests that Absalom's forces are well-organized and capable of swift action. This urgency reflects the broader biblical theme of vigilance and readiness, as seen in Jesus' teachings about being prepared for the unexpected (<a href="/matthew/24-44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a>).<p><b>or he will soon overtake us</b><br>David acknowledges Absalom's capability and determination. This recognition of Absalom's strength and resolve is a testament to Absalom's charisma and leadership, which had won the hearts of many Israelites (<a href="/2_samuel/15-6.htm">2 Samuel 15:6</a>). The phrase also highlights the potential for rapid change in political fortunes, a common theme in the historical books of the Old Testament.<p><b>heap disaster on us</b><br>David foresees the potential devastation that Absalom could bring. This phrase suggests not only physical destruction but also the moral and spiritual consequences of civil war. The disaster could include loss of life, destruction of property, and a fracturing of the nation. It reflects the biblical principle that rebellion and sin lead to chaos and suffering (<a href="/proverbs/17-11.htm">Proverbs 17:11</a>).<p><b>and put the city to the sword.</b><br>The phrase indicates the potential for violent conflict and the destruction of Jerusalem. The imagery of the sword is a common biblical metaphor for judgment and warfare (<a href="/ezekiel/21-9.htm">Ezekiel 21:9-10</a>). This potential destruction of Jerusalem foreshadows later sieges and captures, such as by the Babylonians (<a href="/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8-10</a>). It also serves as a type of Christ's own experience, where He wept over Jerusalem, foreseeing its future destruction (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41-44</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who is facing a rebellion led by his son Absalom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, who has conspired to overthrow his father and take the throne of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, where David and his servants are residing at the time of Absalom's rebellion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david's_servants.htm">David's Servants</a></b><br>Loyal followers and officials who are with David in Jerusalem, ready to follow his lead.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flight_from_jerusalem.htm">The Flight from Jerusalem</a></b><br>The event where David decides to flee Jerusalem to avoid confrontation with Absalom and to protect the city from destruction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>David's past sins, including his actions with Bathsheba and Uriah, have long-lasting consequences that affect his family and kingdom.

By this course also much of the horror of civil war was averted, and Jerusalem saved from "the edge of the sword."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Arise, and let us flee.</span> The rebellion of Absalom, and David's humiliating flight, bring out all the better parts of the king's character, and set him once again before us as a man after God's own heart. For this period is richly illustrated by the psalms which were written under the pressure of this great affliction, and which are marked by firm confidence in God, and an assured sense of the Divine nearness and protection. <a href="/psalms/41.htm">Psalm 41</a>. shows how poignant was his anguish at Ahithophel's treachery, but it inspired no fear: "As for me, thou up. holdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face forever" (<a href="/psalms/41-12.htm">Psalm 41:12</a>). It was a firm faith which prompted such words. In <a href="/psalms/63.htm">Psalm 63</a>, written "in the wilderness of Judah," before David had reached the Jordan, he gives utterance to his grief at the loss of his religious privileges at Jerusalem; but Jehovah is still his strong Tower, and his dwelling will be in God's tabernacle forever. <a href="/psalms/3.htm">Psalm 3</a>. and 4. are his morning and evening hymns written "when he fled from Absalom his son." <a href="/psalms/55.htm">Psalm 55</a> is one more sad even than <a href="/psalms/41.htm">Psalm 41</a>. He describes in it his panic stricken feelings when the news reached him, his longing to escape from the turmoil of life, and flee into the wilderness and be at rest; and his grief at his desertion by men in whose company he had worshipped in the house of God. Upon this follows an outburst of vehement indignation, made the more bitter by the sense of the treachery whereby he had been duped into connivance with Absalom's plans (ver. 21); but amidst it all his confidence was unshaken that if he cast his burden upon God, "he would sustain him, and never suffer the righteous to be moved." Finally, in <a href="/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27</a>, we have the contrast between Jehovah's abiding goodness and the inconstancy of men; while <a href="/psalms/61.htm">Psalm 61</a>. and 62. were probably written at Mahanaim, when David s anguish of mind was being assuaged, and a calm confidence was taking its place. Everywhere in all of them David speaks as one who had now given all his heart to God. As regards his terror and flight (<a href="/psalms/55-5.htm">Psalm 55:5-8</a>), it may seem strange that David should have withdrawn so hurriedly from a city so strong as Jerusalem. But we must not suppose that he had a standing army, and his few Cherethites and Pelethites could have made no head against the nation. Probably, too, the fortifications of the city were incomplete (<a href="/psalms/51-18.htm">Psalm 51:18</a>); and even if in good order, yet, cooped up in Jerusalem, David would have left the whole country in Absalom's power, and finally, after a long blockade, he must have been driven by famine to surrender. Away from Jerusalem he was the centre whither all who disliked Absalom's attempt would gather, and every day as it passed would make men reflect more and more upon what David had done for them, and the more steady and thoughtful of them would finally decide in his favour. There would be, moreover, the secret conviction that David, with such men round him as Joab and Abishai, if free to take his own course, would be more than a match for Absalom and his larger numbers. This was what Ahithophel foresaw, and was so convinced that, if David were not crushed at once, he would gain the day, that he did not even wait to see, but destroyed himself. Abarbanel thinks that the wish of the people had never been for more than the association of Absalom with David on the throne, according to what he had himself suggested (ver. 4); and that there was a great revulsion of feeling when they saw that they must choose absolutely between father and son, and that whoever lost the crown must lose his life as well. Some commentators consider that <a href="/psalms/31.htm">Psalm 31</a>. also belongs to this period, though others ascribe it to Jeremiah. Parts of it are singularly applicable to the circumstances of David's flight, as where the psalmist speaks of Jehovah as being his Fortress in contrast with Jerusalem, and adds, "Thou hast not shut me up into the hands of the enemy, but hast set my feet in a large space," as though "the net which the conspirators had privily laid for him" had been the design to coop him up within the walls of the city, There are touching words, too, of distress at the slander and reproach breaking forth on every side, and at the completeness of his fall, so that whereas but a few days before he had been a king, now "he was clean forgotten, as a dead man out of mind; and east aside as though he were now of no more account than the shards of a broken vessel." But, with the calm strength of faith he adds, "My times are in thy hand;" "Thou shalt hide all who trust in thee in the secret of thy presence;" "Oh, then, love Jehovah, and be of good courage! for he shall strengthen the heart of all whose hope is fixed on him." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/15-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1440;&#1493;&#1460;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
