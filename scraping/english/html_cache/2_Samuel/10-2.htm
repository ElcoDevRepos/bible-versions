The Hebrew word for "kindness" here is "chesed," which often denotes covenantal love and faithfulness. Nahash, the father of Hanun, was the king of the Ammonites, a people often in conflict with Israel. However, Nahash had previously shown favor to David, possibly during David's time of fleeing from Saul. This act of kindness by David is reminiscent of the biblical theme of honoring past alliances and friendships, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14-15</a>, where David promises to show kindness to Jonathan's family.<p><b>So David sent some of his servants to console Hanun concerning his father.</b><br>Sending servants to console Hanun was a diplomatic gesture, common in ancient Near Eastern cultures, to express sympathy and maintain peaceful relations. This act of sending envoys is similar to other biblical instances where leaders send representatives to convey messages or condolences, such as in <a href="/genesis/50-10.htm">Genesis 50:10-11</a>, where Joseph mourns his father Jacob. The act of consolation also reflects the importance of honoring the dead and supporting the bereaved, a value deeply embedded in the cultural and religious practices of the time.<p><b>But when they arrived in the land of the Ammonites,</b><br>The land of the Ammonites was located east of the Jordan River, in present-day Jordan. The Ammonites were descendants of Lot, Abraham's nephew, and often had contentious relations with Israel. The arrival of David's servants in Ammonite territory sets the stage for the unfolding events, highlighting the tension between political intentions and misinterpretations. This geographical context is crucial, as it underscores the challenges of maintaining peace and understanding between neighboring nations with a history of conflict. The narrative foreshadows the potential for misunderstanding and conflict, a recurring theme in the interactions between Israel and its neighbors.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his heart after God and his leadership.
