Their role was crucial for the safety and security of the city. The watchman in this passage is performing his duty by observing another runner approaching. This reflects the vigilance required in spiritual life, as believers are called to be watchful and alert (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). The act of running alone suggests urgency and the importance of the message being delivered, reminiscent of the swift messengers in <a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a> who bring good news.<p><b>and he called out to the gatekeeper</b><br>The gatekeeper was responsible for controlling access to the city, ensuring that only those with legitimate business could enter. This collaboration between the watchman and the gatekeeper highlights the importance of communication and teamwork in maintaining security. Spiritually, it can be seen as a metaphor for the church's role in discerning and safeguarding the truth, as seen in <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>, where leaders are urged to keep watch over the flock.<p><b>&#8220;Look! Another man is running alone!&#8221;</b><br>The repetition of the observation emphasizes the significance of the event. In biblical narratives, running often indicates the delivery of important news or the urgency of a mission, as seen in the story of the prodigal son (<a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>) where the father runs to meet his returning son. The solitary nature of the runner may symbolize the personal responsibility of carrying God's message, akin to the prophets who often stood alone in their proclamations.<p><b>&#8220;This one also brings good news,&#8221; said the king.</b><br>King David's expectation of good news reflects his hope for a favorable outcome in the battle against Absalom. The phrase "good news" is significant in biblical literature, often associated with the gospel message of salvation and peace (<a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10-11</a>). In this context, it underscores the anticipation of victory and restoration. The king's response can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate bearer of good news, bringing reconciliation and hope to humanity (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/watchman.htm">Watchman</a></b><br>A sentinel stationed to observe and report any approaching individuals or events.

David&#8217;s watchman, already alert after spotting Ahimaaz, now sees a second figure sprinting toward Mahanaim.<p>&#8226; In Scripture a lone runner frequently signals a battlefield messenger (<a href="/2_kings/9-18.htm">2 Kings 9:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-31.htm">Jeremiah 51:31</a>). The watchman&#8217;s sharp eye underscores vigilance&#8212;a quality prized in God&#8217;s servants (<a href="/ezekiel/33-6.htm">Ezekiel 33:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, two separate runners hint that two distinct reports are coming, preparing David for layered news.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he called out to the gatekeeper</b><p>&#8226; Communication moves quickly from the watchman to the man stationed at the gate. This orderly relay shows the importance of structure and readiness within the kingdom (<a href="/nehemiah/12-25.htm">Nehemiah 12:25</a>).<p>&#8226; The gatekeeper&#8217;s role parallels spiritual gatekeeping&#8212;guarding truth and alerting leaders to approaching tidings (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-17.htm">1 Chronicles 9:17&#8211;27</a>).<p>&#8226; David benefits from a chain of trustworthy observers, reminding believers of the value of faithful witnesses in the body of Christ (<a href="/proverbs/27-17.htm">Proverbs 27:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Look! Another man is running alone!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The watchman&#8217;s excitement is evident. A solitary runner again implies an official envoy, not a fleeing soldier (<a href="/2_samuel/18-22.htm">2 Samuel 18:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Being &#8220;alone&#8221; signals that the message is intact and authoritative, not muddled by crowds. Paul later echoes this clarity in delivering the gospel &#8220;not as one running aimlessly&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-26.htm">1 Corinthians 9:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Repetition&#8212;first runner, second runner&#8212;heightens anticipation. God often prepares hearts through progressive revelation (<a href="/1_samuel/3-8.htm">1 Samuel 3:8&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;This one also brings good news,&#8221; said the king</b><p>&#8226; David interprets the lone runner as heralding victory, just as the first did (<a href="/2_samuel/18-25.htm">2 Samuel 18:25</a>). The Hebrew phrase behind &#8220;good news&#8221; is used for announcements of God&#8217;s saving acts (<a href="/1_samuel/31-9.htm">1 Samuel 31:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Though the ultimate report will mix triumph with tragedy (the death of Absalom, <a href="/2_samuel/18-32.htm">2 Samuel 18:32&#8211;33</a>), David&#8217;s expectation shows his trust in the Lord&#8217;s deliverance promised earlier (<a href="/2_samuel/17-14.htm">2 Samuel 17:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse thereby illustrates a vital tension: good news from God may still arrive wrapped in hard realities, yet remains &#8220;good&#8221; because His purposes stand (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/18-26.htm">2 Samuel 18:26</a> captures a moment of heightened anticipation: vigilant watchmen, an orderly relay of information, and a king ready to receive word of God&#8217;s intervention.
