His report to King David follows a census that David ordered, which was against God's will. This act of counting the troops reflects a reliance on military strength rather than on God. Joab's reluctance to carry out the census (as seen earlier in the chapter) indicates his awareness of its potential consequences. The act of reporting the numbers signifies the completion of a task that was both politically and spiritually significant, highlighting the tension between human authority and divine command.<p><b>In Israel there were 800,000 men of valor who drew the sword,</b><br>The mention of "men of valor" emphasizes the military capability and readiness of the troops. The number 800,000 represents the fighting men from the northern tribes of Israel. This large number indicates the strength and potential of Israel's army, yet it also serves as a reminder of the temptation to trust in human power rather than in God. The phrase "who drew the sword" underscores their preparedness for battle, a common biblical metaphor for military readiness. This census contrasts with earlier biblical narratives where God delivered Israel with far fewer numbers, such as Gideon's 300 men in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>.<p><b>and in Judah there were 500,000.</b><br>Judah, the southern kingdom, is counted separately, reflecting the division that would later become more pronounced in Israel's history. The 500,000 men of Judah highlight the significant military force of David's own tribe and region. This separation of numbers between Israel and Judah foreshadows the eventual split of the united monarchy after Solomon's reign. The emphasis on Judah also points to the Messianic lineage, as Jesus Christ is prophesied to come from the tribe of Judah, fulfilling the promise of a ruler from David's line. The census, while demonstrating human strength, ultimately sets the stage for God's judgment and mercy, as seen in the subsequent verses.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, tasked with conducting the census of Israel and Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The ruler of Israel who ordered the census, an action that later brought consequences.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, consisting of ten tribes, where 800,000 valiant men were counted.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom, consisting of two tribes, where 500,000 valiant men were counted.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_census.htm">The Census</a></b><br>An event initiated by King David, which was seen as an act of pride and lack of trust in God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>David's census reflects a reliance on human strength rather than God's provision.

And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred three score and ten thousand men that drew sword.">1Chronicles 21:5-6</a>; but there is no reason to suppose any corruption of the text in either case. Joab undertook the work unwillingly, and performed it imperfectly. According to <a href="/1_chronicles/21-6.htm" title="But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king's word was abominable to Joab.">1Chronicles 21:6</a> he refused altogether to number Levi and Benjamin; and according to <a href="/1_chronicles/27-24.htm" title="Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David.">1Chronicles 27:24</a> "he finished not," and no official record was made of the result; "neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David." The numbers were, therefore, in part mere estimates. Here Israel is said to be 800,000, in Chronicles 1,100,000; but the latter probably includes an estimate of the omitted tribes of Benjamin and Levi, and perhaps of portions of other tribes. On the other hand, Judah is here 500,000 (a round number like all the rest), and in Chronicles 470,000. The difference is due perhaps to an estimate of the officiating priests and Levities reckoned to Judah. Another supposition is that the regular army of 288,000 (twelve divisions of 24,000 each) is included in Israel in one case and excluded in the other, and that in the same way in regard to Judah "the thirty" may have had command of a special body of 30,000. Possibly in one case the descendants of the old Canaanites were reckoned (since it appears from <a href="/2_chronicles/2-17.htm" title="And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his father had numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred.">2Chronicles 2:17</a> that David "had numbered them"), and in the other were excluded. There is no reason to doubt the general reliability of the numbers, which would give a probable total population of five or six millions, or from 415 to 500 to a geographical square mile--a number not at all impossible in so fertile a country. (Robinson's estimate of the area of the country is about 12,000 geographical square miles.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men</span>. In Chronicles the numbers are, "of Israel eleven hundred thousand men, and of Judah four hundred and sixty-five thousand men." These discrepancies are a remarkable confirmation of the truth of what is said in <a href="/1_chronicles/27-24.htm">1 Chronicles 27:24</a> that because of the outbreak of the Divine wrath, "the number was not put in the account of the Chronicles of King David." Neither the writer of the Books of Samuel nor of Chronicles had any official document to refer to; and as the numbers are lump sums, and derived probably from what was said by the enumerators, the more exact four hundred and sixty-five thousand men of the Chronicles might easily in round numbers be called a half million. The other is a much larger discrepancy, and no satisfactory explanation of it has been given. It is, however, quite possible that the additional three hundred thousand men were made up of the thirty-eight thousand Levites, as numbered on a later occasion by David, of the Benjamites, and of the aborigines, who belonged to the northern part of the kingdom, and might be included among "all they of Israel" (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-5.htm">1 Chronicles 21:5</a>). The numbers are further attacked on the ground of exaggeration. A million and a half of fighting men means a general population of six or seven millions. Now, Palestine at most does not contain more than eleven thousand square miles, and a population of six millions means five hundred and forty-five persons to every square mile, or one to every acre. The country was undoubtedly very fertile in ancient times, and the ruins of populous cities are found where now there is a waste. But there were vast forests and pasture lands and downs, where there were the means of subsistence for only a few. But we must remember that the enumerators went as far north as Tyre, and counted the inhabitants, therefore, of the seaboard between it and Sidon. Probably they also acted in the same way in the south, where the limits of Simeon were very uncertain. Besides this, there is a very remarkable undesigned coincidence. We read in <a href="/1_chronicles/27.htm">1 Chronicles 27</a>. that David had a force of two hundred and eighty-eight thousand men, who formed his regular army, and of whom twenty-four thousand were called up for training every month. But there are reasons for believing that David took for this purpose each fifth man of those of the military age (see Sime, 'Kingdom of All Israel,' p. 389); and thus the whole number of such men would be one million four hundred and forty thousand. This, as Mr. Sime has shown (ibid., p. 378), holds a middle place between the one million three hundred thousand of the Book of Samuel, and the one million five hundred and seventy thousand of Chronicles, and shows that these numbers are not to be rejected on the score of exaggeration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/24-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Joab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1435;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3097.htm">Strong's 3097: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joab -- 'the LORD is father', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">reported</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yit&#183;t&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
