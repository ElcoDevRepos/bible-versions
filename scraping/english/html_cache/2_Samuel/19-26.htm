The use of "lord" indicates a recognition of authority and a plea for favor. This respect is consistent with the biblical principle of honoring those in authority (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><b>&#8220;because I am lame,</b><br>The speaker, Mephibosheth, was the son of Jonathan and grandson of Saul. His lameness is a result of an accident when he was a child (<a href="/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>). In the cultural context, physical disabilities often led to marginalization, yet David showed kindness to Mephibosheth, reflecting God's compassion for the marginalized (<a href="/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>).<p><b>I said, &#8216;I will have my donkey saddled so that I may ride on it and go with the king.&#8217;</b><br>This statement indicates Mephibosheth's intention to accompany David during his flight from Absalom. The donkey was a common mode of transport for those who could not walk, and his desire to join David shows loyalty. This loyalty is reminiscent of the devotion expected of followers of Christ, who are called to take up their cross and follow Him (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>).<p><b>But my servant Ziba deceived me,</b><br>Ziba, Mephibosheth's servant, had previously misrepresented Mephibosheth to David, claiming that Mephibosheth was disloyal (<a href="/2_samuel/16-3.htm">2 Samuel 16:3</a>). This deception highlights themes of betrayal and false witness, which are condemned in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>).

The verse demonstrates that covenant faithfulness is not hindered by physical weakness but can be sabotaged by deceit.

When Ziba had stolen away with these, Mephibosheth was left helpless in his lameness. Most of the ancient versions read "said to him, Saddle," &c., but the sense is plain enough as the text stands.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass.</span> This would mean, "Thy servant purposed, said within himself, that he would saddle an ass, not by his own hands, but by those of his servants." All the versions, however, except the Chaldee, read, "Thy servant said to him, Saddle me an ass." With this agrees the narrative in <a href="/2_samuel/16-1.htm">2 Samuel 16:1</a>. Mephibosheth ordered Ziba to saddle for him an ass, and one for an attendant, and to put hastily together a supply of food for the journey. And Ziba does so; but when everything is ready, he leaves his master in the lurch, and carries all away to David, to whom he falsely represents Mephibosheth as a traitor. In the words that follow, he unreservedly submits himself to David, on the ground that, though innocent in this affair, yet that, as a member of a dethroned dynasty, his life was forfeit (comp. <a href="/2_samuel/21-7.htm">2 Samuel 21:7</a>), and that, in permitting him to live, and placing him among his friends, the king had done him an act of grace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/19-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;My lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
