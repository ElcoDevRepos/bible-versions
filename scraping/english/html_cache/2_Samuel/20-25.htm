Sheva, also known as Shavsha or Seraiah in other biblical passages, served as the royal scribe under King David. This position was one of significant authority and responsibility, as scribes were often involved in the administration of the kingdom and the communication of royal decrees. The role of a scribe is seen throughout the Bible, with Ezra being a notable example (<a href="/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>). Scribes were instrumental in the transmission of the Scriptures, ensuring the accuracy and preservation of God's Word.<p><b>Zadok and Abiathar were priests;</b><br>Zadok and Abiathar served as priests during King David's reign, representing the religious leadership of Israel. Zadok, a descendant of Aaron through Eleazar, was a faithful priest who supported David during Absalom's rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24-29</a>). Abiathar, from the line of Eli, initially served alongside Zadok but later supported Adonijah's claim to the throne, leading to his eventual removal by Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26-27</a>). The dual priesthood of Zadok and Abiathar reflects the complex religious and political dynamics of the time. The priesthood was central to Israel's worship and sacrificial system, as outlined in the Mosaic Law (Leviticus 8-9). The mention of these priests highlights the continuity of the Levitical priesthood and its importance in maintaining the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheva.htm">Sheva</a></b><br>Sheva is identified as the scribe, a significant administrative role in King David's court.
