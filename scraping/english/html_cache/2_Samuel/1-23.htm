Saul, as the first king of Israel, was initially chosen by God and anointed by the prophet Samuel. His reign began with promise, and he was beloved for his leadership in uniting the tribes of Israel. Jonathan, Saul's son, was known for his loyalty, bravery, and deep friendship with David, which is a profound example of covenantal love. Their lives were marked by moments of valor and leadership, making them beloved figures in Israel's history.<p><b>were not divided in death</b><br>Despite the tensions and conflicts that arose during their lives, particularly between Saul and David, Saul and Jonathan remained united in their deaths. They died together in battle against the Philistines on Mount Gilboa. This unity in death symbolizes the enduring bond between father and son, and it highlights the tragedy of their demise. Their deaths also marked a significant turning point in Israel's history, paving the way for David's eventual kingship.<p><b>They were swifter than eagles</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the agility and speed of Saul and Jonathan, qualities that were highly valued in ancient warfare. Eagles are often used in biblical literature to symbolize swiftness and strength. This metaphor highlights their prowess in battle and their ability to lead and protect Israel with great skill. It also reflects the high regard in which they were held as warriors.<p><b>they were stronger than lions</b><br>Lions are a symbol of strength and courage in the Bible. By comparing Saul and Jonathan to lions, the text underscores their bravery and might in battle. This imagery conveys their formidable presence on the battlefield and their role as protectors of Israel. The comparison to lions also connects to the broader biblical theme of God empowering leaders with strength and courage to fulfill His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.
