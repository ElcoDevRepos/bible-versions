The turning around signifies a moment of recognition and desperation. Saul, wounded and in distress, seeks help. This reflects the broader biblical theme of seeking assistance in times of need, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/121.htm">Psalm 121:1-2</a>, where the psalmist looks to the hills for help. The act of turning around can also symbolize repentance or a change of direction, though in this case, it is more about seeking aid in a dire situation.<p><b>he called out to me</b><br>The act of calling out indicates urgency and a plea for help. In the ancient Near Eastern context, calling out was a common way to seek attention or assistance. This moment is significant as it shows Saul's vulnerability and the breakdown of his kingship, contrasting with earlier times when he was the one giving commands. It also highlights the theme of divine providence, as God often uses unexpected people to fulfill His purposes, similar to how He used unlikely individuals throughout biblical history, such as David, a shepherd boy, to become king.<p><b>and I answered, &#8216;Here I am!&#8217;</b><br>The response "Here I am" is a phrase of readiness and willingness to serve, echoing the responses of other biblical figures like Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>) and Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-4.htm">1 Samuel 3:4</a>). It signifies availability and attentiveness to the call, a theme that runs throughout scripture as God calls individuals to His service. This phrase also underscores the importance of being present and responsive to God's call, a principle that is central to the life of faith. The Amalekite's response, however, is complex, as his motives are later revealed to be self-serving, contrasting with the genuine obedience seen in other biblical narratives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, who is mourning the death of Saul and Jonathan at this point in the account.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who has died in battle against the Philistines.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>Saul's son and David's close friend, also killed in the battle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/amalekite_messenger.htm">Amalekite Messenger</a></b><br>The young man who brings news of Saul's death to David, claiming to have killed Saul at Saul's request.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_gilboa.htm">Mount Gilboa</a></b><br>The location where Saul and his sons died in battle against the Philistines.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/readiness_to_respond.htm">Readiness to Respond</a></b><br>The phrase "Here I am" signifies a readiness to respond to a call.

The irony is unmistakable: the disobedience that cost him his throne now places his life in Amalekite hands.<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s gaze settling on this foreigner highlights how isolated he has become; his armor-bearer had already refused his request (<a href="/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s earlier word that Amalek would be at war &#8220;from generation to generation&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14-16</a>) reverberates in the background.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he called out to me</b><p>&#8226; Even in his final moments Saul still seeks a human solution instead of turning to the Lord, echoing his earlier dependence on mediums and earthly resources (<a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6-7, 15</a>).<p>&#8226; The call reveals desperation, not faith. Contrast this with David&#8217;s instinct to cry out to God when overwhelmed (<a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Samson&#8217;s plea to his armor-bearer (<a href="/judges/16-28.htm">Judges 16:28-30</a>), Saul&#8217;s request underscores the weight of personal responsibility at the end of life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I answered, &#8216;Here I am!&#8217;</b><p>&#8226; The Amalekite&#8217;s response echoes the willing availability heard in Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>), Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-4.htm">1 Samuel 3:4</a>), and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>), but here it is tragically twisted toward an act condemned by God (<a href="/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; His &#8220;Here I am!&#8221; signals readiness to serve&#8212;yet it serves rebellion, not righteousness.<p>&#8226; The contrast teaches that availability alone is not virtue; it must be aligned with God&#8217;s will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/1-7.htm">2 Samuel 1:7</a> records the literal, climactic moment when wounded King Saul spots an Amalekite and calls for aid, only to receive a willing answer that will seal his fate.
