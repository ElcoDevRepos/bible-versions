Joab was the commander of David's army, known for his military prowess and strategic mind. Abishai, also a warrior, often accompanied Joab in battles. Their familial connection to David placed them in positions of influence and power within his kingdom. The brothers were fiercely loyal to David but often acted independently, sometimes contrary to David's wishes.<p><b>murdered Abner</b><br>Abner was the commander of Saul's army and a significant figure in the power struggle following Saul's death. He initially supported Saul's son, Ish-bosheth, as king over Israel but later sought to transfer his allegiance to David. Joab's murder of Abner was a personal vendetta disguised as a political act. This act of murder was against the cultural norms of hospitality and peace negotiations, as Abner had come to Hebron under the pretense of peace.<p><b>because he had killed their brother Asahel</b><br>Asahel, the younger brother of Joab and Abishai, was known for his speed and agility. During the battle at Gibeon, Asahel pursued Abner with the intent to kill him. Despite Abner's warnings to turn aside, Asahel persisted, leading Abner to kill him in self-defense. This event set the stage for Joab and Abishai's desire for revenge, highlighting the cultural importance of blood vengeance in ancient Israelite society.<p><b>in the battle at Gibeon</b><br>The battle at Gibeon was part of the ongoing conflict between the house of Saul and the house of David. Gibeon was a significant city located northwest of Jerusalem, known for its large pool where the battle began. This conflict was a microcosm of the larger struggle for power in Israel, as David sought to consolidate his rule over all the tribes. The battle and its aftermath illustrate the turbulent and violent nature of the period, as well as the personal vendettas that often influenced political actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army and a key military leader in Israel.

Scripture distinguishes wartime killing from personal revenge; Joab crossed that line, defying God&#8217;s prohibition of murder and undermining the fragile unity of Israel. The verse warns believers against taking justice into their own hands, reminding us that vengeance belongs to the Lord and that personal anger, when indulged, can obstruct God&#8217;s larger purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">Slew . . . had slain.</span>--The words are different in Hebrew, the former denoting violence.

He still remains at fault, however, for continuing Joab in his high and responsible position; but this seems to have been the result of inability to inflict proper punishment upon so powerful a subject, an inability which David on his death-bed sought to remedy by his charge to Solomon.
