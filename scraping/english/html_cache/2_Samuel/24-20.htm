This site is traditionally associated with Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac and later becomes the location of Solomon's Temple. The presence of King David signifies a moment of divine intervention, as David seeks to purchase the threshing floor to build an altar to the Lord, halting a plague on Israel. The king's approach indicates a moment of significant importance, as David's actions are directed by God to atone for his earlier sin of conducting a census of Israel.<p><b>he went out and bowed facedown before the king</b><br>Araunah's response reflects the cultural norms of the time, showing deep respect and submission to authority. Bowing facedown was a common gesture of reverence and acknowledgment of the king's sovereignty. This act of humility is significant, as it demonstrates Araunah's recognition of David's authority and possibly his understanding of the spiritual significance of the moment. This encounter foreshadows the ultimate submission to Christ, the King of Kings, who would later fulfill the law and the prophets. Araunah's willingness to offer his threshing floor and oxen for sacrifice without cost also prefigures the sacrificial system that points to Jesus' ultimate sacrifice for humanity's sins.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/araunah.htm">Araunah</a></b><br>A Jebusite who owned a threshing floor in Jerusalem.

Like <a href="/psalms/34-5.htm">Psalm 34:5</a>, &#8220;Those who look to Him are radiant,&#8221; Araunah&#8217;s first glimpse begins a story of grace that many will witness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and saw the king and his servants coming toward him</b><p>&#8226; Araunah recognizes David not alone but surrounded by servants, underscoring David&#8217;s royal authority (<a href="/1_samuel/18-16.htm">1 Samuel 18:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the sight also reminds us that authority carries responsibility; David comes to atone for sin that has brought judgment on the people (<a href="/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; Compare the respectful approach in <a href="/1_kings/1-43.htm">1 Kings 1:43&#8211;48</a> when royalty appears and servants attend; the entourage signals a serious, official matter.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty is highlighted: He directs both king and commoner for His redemptive purpose, as <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a> affirms, &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is a watercourse in the hand of the LORD.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he went out</b><p>&#8226; Araunah acts immediately; he doesn&#8217;t wait for the king to summon him.

Araunah&#8217;s submission paves the way for the sacrificial offering that will stop the plague, pointing ahead to Christ, the ultimate King whose sacrifice halts judgment for all who bow before Him (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Araunah&#8217;s quick glance, recognition, approach, and humble bow reveal a heart ready to honor God&#8217;s chosen king. Each movement underscores divine orchestration, the seriousness of sin, and the necessity of humble submission. In this single verse the threshing floor is transformed into a stage for God&#8217;s mercy: a willing subject meets a repentant king, and together they participate in the gracious plan that points forward to the ultimate sacrifice of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Saw the king.</span>--Not <span class= "ital">the angel, </span>as in Chronicles, the words in Hebrew being much alike.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Araunah... saw the king.</span> In <a href="/1_chronicles/21-20.htm">1 Chronicles 21:20</a>, "saw the angel;" but the text there is apparently corrupt, the difference, moreover, in Hebrew between "king" and "angel" being very slight.
