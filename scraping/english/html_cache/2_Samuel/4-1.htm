Abner's death in Hebron, a city of refuge and a significant location in Judah, marked a turning point in the power dynamics of Israel. Hebron was also where David was anointed king over Judah, highlighting the contrast between David's divine appointment and Ish-bosheth's reliance on human support. Abner's death removed the main support for Ish-bosheth's reign, indicating the fragility of his kingship.<p><b>he lost courage</b><br>Ish-bosheth's loss of courage reflects his dependence on Abner for leadership and strength. Without Abner, Ish-bosheth lacked the political and military acumen to maintain his rule. This phrase underscores the theme of human weakness and the futility of relying on human power rather than divine guidance. It contrasts with David, who often sought the Lord's counsel and strength.<p><b>and all Israel was dismayed</b><br>The dismay of all Israel indicates the widespread uncertainty and instability following Abner's death. This dismay can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy that the kingdom would be torn from Saul's house and given to David (<a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>). The people's reaction also foreshadows the eventual unification of Israel under David's rule, as they recognize the need for a strong, divinely appointed leader. This moment of dismay sets the stage for David's eventual acceptance as king over all Israel, aligning with God's covenant promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/ish-bosheth.htm">Ish-bosheth</a></b><br>The son of Saul, who was made king over Israel after Saul's death.

Compare this fragile setup to David&#8217;s anointing by God in <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>.<p>&#8226; The text reminds us again that Saul&#8217;s dynasty is on borrowed time; God had already judged it in <a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26-28</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>heard that Abner had died in Hebron</b><p>&#8226; Abner, commander of Saul&#8217;s army, had defected to David (<a href="/2_samuel/3-12.htm">2 Samuel 3:12-21</a>) and then been murdered by Joab in Hebron (3:27).<p>&#8226; Abner&#8217;s death removed the one strong figure holding Ish-bosheth&#8217;s kingdom together.
