Cherubim are often depicted in the Bible as angelic beings associated with the presence and glory of God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/10.htm">Ezekiel 10</a>. The cherubim are guardians of sacred spaces, such as the Garden of Eden and the Ark of the Covenant. This imagery emphasizes God's sovereignty and His ability to transcend the natural world. The act of flying suggests swiftness and the ability to act beyond human limitations, highlighting God's omnipresence and omnipotence. This can be connected to other scriptures where God is described as riding on the clouds or the heavens, such as <a href="/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/19.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>, reinforcing His role as the divine warrior and protector.<p><b>He soared on the wings of the wind.</b><br>The phrase "soared on the wings of the wind" further illustrates God's supreme authority over creation. Wind in the Bible often symbolizes the Spirit of God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a> and <a href="/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>. This metaphor suggests that God moves with the power and freedom of the wind, unhindered by earthly constraints. It also conveys the idea of God's swift intervention in the affairs of humanity, as He comes to the aid of His people. The imagery of soaring on the wind can be seen as a type of Christ, who, in the New Testament, is described as having authority over the natural elements, such as calming the storm in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a>. This connection underscores the continuity of God's power and presence from the Old Testament to the New Testament, revealing His unchanging nature and His active involvement in the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this song of praise, David is reflecting on God's deliverance and protection throughout his life.

In this psalm the cherub is his chariot, on which he rides forth to judgment. <span class="cmt_word">He was seen.</span> There can be little doubt that the right reading is preserved in <a href="/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10</a>, where we find a verb signifying the swooping down of a bird of prey upon its quarry (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-40.htm">Jeremiah 48:40</a>).
