His name means "my Lord is Yahweh," which reflects the theistic culture of Israel. Adonijah's mother, Haggith, is one of David's wives, indicating the polygamous practices of the time, which were common among kings for political alliances and progeny. Adonijah's later attempt to claim the throne (1 Kings 1) parallels the earlier rebellion of his brother Absalom, highlighting the recurring theme of familial strife within David's house, as prophesied in <a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10</a>. This foreshadows the internal conflicts that would plague David's lineage, ultimately leading to the division of the kingdom.<p><b>his fifth was Shephatiah, the son of Abital;</b><br>Shephatiah, whose name means "Yahweh has judged," is less prominent in the biblical narrative, with no significant actions recorded. His mother, Abital, is another of David's wives, further illustrating the king's numerous marriages. The mention of Shephatiah and his mother serves to document the lineage and the complexity of David's family, which is crucial for understanding the succession issues that arise later. The listing of David's sons in this passage underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to David regarding his descendants (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>), while also setting the stage for the eventual rise of Solomon, who is not mentioned here but becomes the central figure in the continuation of David's dynasty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adonijah.htm">Adonijah</a></b><br>The fourth son of King David, born to Haggith.

In <a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5&#8211;10</a> Adonijah proclaims himself king while David is still alive, mirroring Absalom&#8217;s earlier rebellion (<a href="/bsb/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15</a>).<p>&#8226; The placement of Adonijah in the birth order&#8212;fourth&#8212;matters. With Amnon dead (<a href="/2_samuel/13-28.htm">2 Samuel 13:28&#8211;29</a>), Chileab apparently absent from the record (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1</a>), and Absalom slain (<a href="/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14&#8211;15</a>), Adonijah sees himself as next in line by human calculation. God, however, had already chosen Solomon (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;13</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse shows that God&#8217;s purposes are not determined by birth order or human ambition (<a href="/romans/9-10.htm">Romans 9:10&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the son of Haggith</b><p>&#8226; Naming Adonijah&#8217;s mother reminds us that David had multiple wives (<a href="/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2&#8211;5</a>). The family fractures that unfold later stem in part from this polygamy, even though the narrative presents it matter-of-factly (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a> warns that multiplying wives leads hearts astray).<p>&#8226; Haggith&#8217;s anonymity elsewhere underscores that prominence in Scripture comes from God&#8217;s calling, not social standing (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">1 Corinthians 1:26-29</a>).<p>&#8226; By mentioning Haggith, the text signals that each child&#8217;s maternal line could influence palace alliances and rivalries, a theme that surfaces when Bathsheba defends Solomon&#8217;s right to the throne against Adonijah (<a href="/1_kings/1-15.htm">1 Kings 1:15-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his fifth was Shephatiah</b><p>&#8226; The verse continues: &#8220;his fifth was Shephatiah, the son of Abital.&#8221; Shephatiah never reappears in the narrative. His silence highlights that not every royal son pursued power.<p>&#8226; The name Shephatiah means &#8220;Yahweh judges,&#8221; echoing the truth that ultimate authority rests with God (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>). Though absent from later events, his inclusion in the list affirms that God knows every individual (<a href="/luke/12-7.htm">Luke 12:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the son of Abital</b><p>&#8226; Abital&#8217;s mention parallels Haggith&#8217;s: another wife, another potential faction. Yet Scripture offers no further story line, suggesting that peaceful obscurity can be a blessing amid palace intrigue (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Her name, recorded only here and in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-3.htm">1 Chronicles 3:3</a>, preserves her place in covenant history. Even seemingly minor figures contribute to the unfolding lineage that leads ultimately to Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-6.htm">Matthew 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/3-4.htm">2 Samuel 3:4</a> is more than a genealogical footnote. By naming Adonijah and Shephatiah alongside their mothers, the Spirit-inspired text foreshadows future conflict, exposes the complexity introduced by multiple wives, and teaches that God&#8217;s sovereign choice&#8212;not birth order, ambition, or obscurity&#8212;determines destiny.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/3-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">his fourth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#8216;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
