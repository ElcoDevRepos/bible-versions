"All Israel from Dan to Beersheba" is a common biblical expression denoting the entire nation of Israel, from its northernmost city, Dan, to its southernmost city, Beersheba. This phrase emphasizes the unity and totality of the nation. Historically, Dan and Beersheba were significant locations in Israel, marking the traditional boundaries of the land. This expression is used throughout the Old Testament to describe the full extent of the Israelite territory (e.g., <a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20:1</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/3-20.htm">1 Samuel 3:20</a>). The advice to gather all Israel suggests a comprehensive mobilization, reflecting the gravity of the situation and the need for a unified front.<p><b>a multitude like the sand on the seashore&#8212;</b><br>This simile is a hyperbolic expression used to describe an exceedingly large number of people. It echoes the promise given to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>, where God promised to multiply his descendants as the stars of the sky and the sand on the seashore. This phrase underscores the vastness of the proposed army, suggesting overwhelming strength and numbers. It also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham, as Israel had indeed become a populous nation. The imagery of sand on the seashore is used elsewhere in Scripture to convey innumerable quantities (e.g., <a href="/joshua/11-4.htm">Joshua 11:4</a>, <a href="/1_kings/4-20.htm">1 Kings 4:20</a>).<p><b>be gathered to you,</b><br>The gathering of all Israel to Absalom signifies a consolidation of power and support. In the context of the narrative, Absalom is attempting to usurp the throne from his father, King David. The call for a national assembly under Absalom's leadership is a strategic move to legitimize his claim to the throne and to demonstrate his authority. This gathering is not just a military maneuver but also a political statement, aiming to unify the people under Absalom's leadership. The concept of gathering is significant in biblical history, often associated with assembling for battle or worship (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/31-12.htm">Deuteronomy 31:12</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5</a>).<p><b>and that you yourself lead them into battle.</b><br>Hushai's advice for Absalom to personally lead the army into battle is a direct appeal to Absalom's ambition and desire for recognition. In ancient Near Eastern culture, kings often led their armies into battle, symbolizing their role as both political and military leaders. This counsel is designed to flatter Absalom and to contrast with Ahithophel's earlier advice, which suggested a more covert operation. By leading the army himself, Absalom would be seen as a strong and capable leader, potentially rallying more support. This phrase also foreshadows the eventual downfall of Absalom, as his personal involvement in the battle leads to his demise (<a href="/2_samuel/18-9.htm">2 Samuel 18:9-15</a>). The idea of a leader going before his people is a theme seen in the life of Jesus Christ, who leads His followers by example and sacrifice (<a href="/john/10-4.htm">John 10:4</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The son of King David who rebelled against his father, seeking to usurp the throne of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahithophel.htm">Ahithophel</a></b><br>A counselor to Absalom, known for his wise advice, who suggested a swift attack on David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hushai_the_archite.htm">Hushai the Archite</a></b><br>A friend of David who infiltrated Absalom's court to counter Ahithophel's counsel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/dan_to_beersheba.htm">Dan to Beersheba</a></b><br>A phrase denoting the entire nation of Israel, from its northernmost to southernmost points.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_battle.htm">The Battle</a></b><br>The context of the advice given by Hushai, suggesting a large-scale mobilization of Israel against David.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_wisdom_of_god_vs._human_counsel.htm">The Wisdom of God vs. Human Counsel</a></b><br>Hushai's advice, though seemingly less strategic, was used by God to protect David.

The plan sounds unifying and powerful, but it serves God&#8217;s purpose of buying David time and exposing Absalom to danger. Scripture shows that trusting in numbers and human glory, rather than in the Lord, leads to downfall&#8212;yet God remains in control, turning even deceptive counsel to fulfill His righteous plan (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">I counsel that all Israel.</span>--Hushai had before him a difficult task. He had not only to "make the worse appear the better reason," but to do this in face of the counsel of a man very famous for his wisdom and devoted to the interests of Absalom, while his own fidelity had but just now been called in question. He accomplishes his task successfully by emphasising all the possible hazards and contingencies of the plan recommended by Ahithophel, and by proposing, on the other hand, a plan attended with no risk, on the supposition that the great mass of Israel already were, and would continue to be, on Absalom's side, a supposition which; with delicate flattery, he assumes as true.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And that thou go to battle in thine own person;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and that thy presence go to the battle.</span> The versions have preserved a much better reading, "And that thy presence go in the midst of them." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/17-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Instead,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I advise</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1506;&#1463;&#1431;&#1510;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#8216;a&#7779;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3289.htm">Strong's 3289: </a> </span><span class="str2">To advise, to deliberate, resolve</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from Dan</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(mid&#183;d&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
