This moment occurs during Absalom's rebellion, a time of great personal and political turmoil for David. Abishai, known for his bravery and loyalty, often appears in the narrative as a protector of David, highlighting the king's reliance on his close circle during crises.<p><b>Behold, my own son, my own flesh and blood, seeks my life</b><br>David refers to Absalom, his third son, who has initiated a coup against him. This betrayal is deeply personal, emphasizing the familial strife and the fulfillment of Nathan's prophecy in <a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>, where God foretold that calamity would arise from within David's own house as a consequence of his sin with Bathsheba. The phrase underscores the pain of betrayal from one's own family, a theme that resonates throughout the biblical narrative.<p><b>How much more, then, this Benjamite!</b><br>The Benjamite in question is Shimei, who is cursing David as he flees Jerusalem. The tribe of Benjamin was the tribe of Saul, Israel's first king, and there was lingering tension between Saul's supporters and David. Shimei's actions can be seen as an expression of this tribal animosity. The mention of Shimei as a Benjamite highlights the ongoing political and tribal divisions within Israel.<p><b>Leave him alone and let him curse me</b><br>David's response to Shimei's cursing is one of humility and resignation. Instead of retaliating, David chooses to endure the insults, possibly reflecting his awareness of his own failings and the belief that God may be using Shimei to deliver a message. This attitude of submission to God's will is reminiscent of Jesus Christ's teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39</a> about turning the other cheek.<p><b>for the LORD has told him so</b><br>David interprets Shimei's cursing as being allowed by God, suggesting a belief in divine sovereignty over human affairs. This perspective aligns with the biblical theme that God can use even the actions of adversaries to fulfill His purposes. David's acceptance of this situation reflects a deep trust in God's ultimate plan, paralleling the submission of Christ to the Father's will, even in suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is fleeing from his son Absalom.
