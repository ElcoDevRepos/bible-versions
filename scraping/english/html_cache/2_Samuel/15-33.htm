In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15</a>, David is speaking to Hushai the Arkite. Hushai is a loyal friend and advisor to David. This moment occurs during Absalom's rebellion, when David is fleeing Jerusalem. The personal nature of the address highlights the trust and relationship between David and Hushai. David's leadership is evident as he makes strategic decisions during a time of crisis.<p><b>If you go on with me</b><br>David is considering the practical implications of Hushai accompanying him. The phrase suggests a journey or escape, as David is leaving Jerusalem to avoid confrontation with Absalom. The context is one of urgency and danger, as David seeks to protect his life and the lives of those loyal to him. This decision reflects David's awareness of the challenges ahead and his need for a strategic plan.<p><b>you will be a burden to me</b><br>David expresses concern that Hushai's presence might hinder rather than help. This is not a reflection on Hushai's character but rather on the practicalities of the situation. David is likely considering the speed and stealth required for his escape, and how additional people might slow them down or attract attention. This phrase also shows David's selflessness, as he prioritizes the success of his mission over personal comfort or companionship. In a broader sense, it reflects the burdens of leadership and the difficult decisions leaders must make.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is fleeing from his son Absalom's rebellion.

David loves that loyalty, yet he knows the road ahead is harsh&#8212;steep climbs, uncertain shelter, and constant danger, as when he fled from Saul in the wilderness (<a href="/1_samuel/23-13.htm">1 Samuel 23:13-14</a>). By telling Hushai &#8220;If you go&#8230;,&#8221; David weighs the cost of discipleship in real time, echoing Jesus&#8217; later reminder to count the cost before following Him (<a href="/luke/14-27.htm">Luke 14:27-33</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine commitment is precious, but wise leadership asks, &#8220;Is this the best place for you right now?&#8221;<p>&#8226; God often redirects willing servants to roles that maximize their usefulness (<a href="/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;on with me</b><p>&#8220;On with me&#8221; points to the urgent, perilous trek east across the Kidron Valley, a march where every extra person means slower progress (<a href="/2_samuel/15-22.htm">2 Samuel 15:22-23</a>). David must keep his group lean, much like Gideon trimming his army to those who could keep pace (<a href="/judges/7-4.htm">Judges 7:4-7</a>).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s mission required speed and stealth; extra baggage could jeopardize everyone.<p>&#8226; The New Testament mirrors this principle: traveling light for kingdom work (<a href="/mark/6-8.htm">Mark 6:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;you will be a burden</b><p>Calling a dear friend a &#8220;burden&#8221; sounds harsh, yet David speaks of practical reality, not personal value. At this stage Hushai is likely older (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/27-33.htm">1 Chronicles 27:33</a>), and the rugged escape would sap his strength. David later uses identical reasoning with the aged Barzillai (<a href="/2_samuel/19-35.htm">2 Samuel 19:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Sometimes love says &#8220;no&#8221; to protect both mission and friend (<a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture teaches believers to consider one another&#8217;s limitations (<a href="/romans/15-1.htm">Romans 15:1-2</a>) while still bearing one another&#8217;s burdens in appropriate ways (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;to me</b><p>David&#8217;s phrase &#8220;to me&#8221; shows personal accountability: extra weight would slow him, but also endanger the whole covenant community under his care. Yet David immediately assigns Hushai a strategic role back in Jerusalem&#8212;countering Ahithophel&#8217;s counsel and preserving the throne (<a href="/2_samuel/15-34.htm">2 Samuel 15:34</a>; 17:5-14). This mirrors Joseph placed in Pharaoh&#8217;s court (<a href="/genesis/41-39.htm">Genesis 41:39-41</a>) and Esther in the palace (<a href="/esther/4-14.htm">Esther 4:14</a>): God positions faithful people where their influence matters most.<p>&#8226; Wisdom discerns not just willingness but placement.<p>&#8226; Obedient service can mean staying behind rather than tagging along.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/15-33.htm">2 Samuel 15:33</a> captures a moment when David balances affection with mission. He values Hushai&#8217;s loyalty yet redirects him for the kingdom&#8217;s good. The verse teaches that godly leadership recognizes limitations, assigns roles wisely, and trusts God to use each believer where he or she can best advance His sovereign plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A burden unto me.</span> Host likely because Hushai was old and infirm.
