The term "foreigners" refers to the non-Israelite nations that David encountered. In the ancient Near East, it was common for conquered peoples to show submission to their conquerors. This cowering can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel victory over its enemies (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>). Theologically, it underscores God's sovereignty and the divine mandate given to Israel to be a light to the nations. This submission of foreigners can also be seen as a type of the ultimate submission of all nations to Christ, as prophesied in <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>, where every knee will bow to Jesus.<p><b>when they hear me,</b><br>The phrase "when they hear me" suggests the authority and respect that David commanded as a king. In the cultural context of the time, a king's word was law, and his voice carried the weight of authority. This can be connected to the biblical theme of the power of the spoken word, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, where God speaks creation into existence. David's ability to command obedience through his voice can be seen as a reflection of God's authority working through him. This also prefigures the authority of Jesus Christ, whose words commanded power and obedience, as seen in the Gospels (e.g., <a href="/mark/1-27.htm">Mark 1:27</a>).<p><b>they obey me.</b><br>The obedience of the foreigners highlights the effectiveness of David's leadership and the fulfillment of God's promises to him. This obedience is not just a result of military might but also of the divine favor that rested upon David. In a broader biblical context, this obedience can be seen as a foreshadowing of the messianic kingdom, where Christ will rule with perfect justice and all nations will submit to His authority (<a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>). The concept of obedience is central to the biblical narrative, emphasizing the importance of aligning with God's will, as seen throughout the Old and New Testaments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this song of praise, David is reflecting on God's deliverance and the victories he has experienced over his enemies.
