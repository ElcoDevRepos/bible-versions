In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15</a>, King David is fleeing Jerusalem due to Absalom's rebellion. David's use of "He" refers to God, showing his deep reliance on divine will. This reflects the biblical theme of seeking God's guidance and accepting His sovereignty, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which emphasizes trusting in the Lord with all one's heart.<p><b>&#8216;I do not delight in you,&#8217;</b><br>David acknowledges the possibility that God might not be pleased with him. This reflects a humble and repentant heart, aware of his past sins, such as the incident with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11). The concept of God delighting in someone is seen throughout scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/147-11.htm">Psalm 147:11</a>, where God delights in those who fear Him and hope in His mercy. David's awareness of God's potential displeasure shows his understanding of divine justice and mercy.<p><b>then here I am;</b><br>David's response is one of submission and readiness to accept God's judgment. This echoes the attitude of other biblical figures like Samuel, who said, "Here I am" when called by God (<a href="/1_samuel/3-4.htm">1 Samuel 3:4</a>). It signifies a willingness to be present and obedient to God's will, regardless of personal cost.<p><b>let Him do to me whatever seems good to Him.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase demonstrates David's complete surrender to God's will, trusting in His wisdom and justice. It parallels Jesus' prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane, "Not my will, but Yours be done" (<a href="/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>), highlighting a type of Christ in David's submission. David's trust in God's goodness, even in potential judgment, reflects a deep faith that God works all things for good (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>). This attitude of surrender is a central theme in the life of believers, encouraging trust in God's perfect plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, King David is fleeing from his son Absalom, who has declared himself king.

David&#8217;s attitude foreshadows the perfect submission of Christ.<p>&#8226; Job voiced the same trust under suffering: &#8220;Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him&#8221; (<a href="/job/13-15.htm">Job 13:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>In <a href="/2_samuel/15-26.htm">2 Samuel 15:26</a> David hands his destiny back to God.

(Comp. <a href="/2_samuel/24-14.htm" title="And David said to Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and let me not fall into the hand of man.">2Samuel 24:14</a>.) He is, therefore, unwilling to have the ark carried with him lest he should seem to undertake to compel the Divine presence and blessing. He feels sure that if God so will, he shall be brought again in peace; but if not, yet he will perfectly submit himself to God's ordering.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.</span> David's answer is full, not only of devout resignation and trust in God, but is remarkable also for the absence of superstition. He feels that God will not judge him by any mere outward sign or privilege, but in truth and equity. If he deserves condemnation, he will not escape it by carrying the ark about with him. If, on the contrary, God accepts him, he will restore him to the enjoyment of his spiritual privileges, and bring him back to worship at the place which he has chosen for his dwelling. We must notice that he addresses these words to Zadok, who had remained with the ark. This was natural if Abiathar was occupied in offering, but hard to understand if he had gone up, that is, in advance of the ark, to acquaint David with their purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/15-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He should say,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1463;&#1428;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;I do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">delight</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1430;&#1510;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;p&#772;a&#7779;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2654.htm">Strong's 2654: </a> </span><span class="str2">To incline to, to bend, to be pleased with, desire</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in you,&#8217;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">then here I am;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1429;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2005.htm">Strong's 2005: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
