It signifies a deep, enduring commitment that God has towards His people, particularly in the context of His covenant with David. This loving devotion is a central theme throughout the Old Testament, highlighting God's unwavering loyalty and mercy.<p><b>will never be removed from him</b><br>This promise indicates the permanence of God's covenant with David and his descendants. Unlike Saul, whose kingship was conditional and ultimately rejected due to disobedience, David's line is assured of God's enduring favor. This assurance is foundational to the Davidic Covenant, which is pivotal in the biblical narrative, pointing towards the eternal kingdom established through Jesus Christ, a descendant of David.<p><b>as I removed it from Saul</b><br>Saul, the first king of Israel, was chosen by God but later rejected due to his disobedience and failure to follow God's commands (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>). This contrast between Saul and David underscores the importance of obedience and faithfulness to God. Saul's removal serves as a historical lesson on the consequences of turning away from God's will.<p><b>whom I removed from before you</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's active role in the transition of kingship from Saul to David. It highlights God's sovereignty in establishing and removing leaders according to His divine plan. The removal of Saul paved the way for David's anointed kingship, which was part of God's redemptive history leading to the establishment of an everlasting kingdom through Jesus Christ, fulfilling the messianic prophecies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, chosen by God to lead His people and establish a lasting dynasty.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, whose disobedience led to God removing His favor from him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan_the_prophet.htm">Nathan the Prophet</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's covenant promise to David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where David established his kingdom and where God made His covenant with David.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_davidic_covenant.htm">The Davidic Covenant</a></b><br>The promise God made to David, ensuring that his lineage would endure forever.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_unfailing_love.htm">God's Unfailing Love</a></b><br>God's promise to David highlights His steadfast love and faithfulness.

Discipline may come, but rejection will never come.

There is a strong contrast between the fate of Saul's house and this eternal endurance promised to that of David. The lineage of Saul might have made a new start in Jonathan, and even when he died at Gilboa, he left a son behind him. Still, no one ever locked upon Mephibosheth as having any title to the throne; and though Shimei (<a href="/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5</a>) may have conceived the hope that, if David were overthrown, the kingdom might return to Saul's family, yet, as a matter of fact, among the many vicissitudes of the ten tribes, the attempt never was made to search for a descendant of Saul to be Israel's king. Saul's was a royalty for one generation; David's throne was to be established forever. Not because David was sinless. His character is sullied by crimes of the darkest hue. But he never sank into a mere tyrant, such as Saul was towards David and towards the priests at Nob. Nor did David ever become an irreligious man (<a href="/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18, 19</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/28-15.htm">1 Samuel 28:15</a>), though there is in him a strange and painful mixture of great good and great evil. The salt that preserves his character is his genuine sincerity and earnestness both towards God and man; and these qualities make him not unworthy of the high place he holds among God s people. Still, the premise was not because of David's deserts, but because from him was to come the Christ, who is blessed. forevermore. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/7-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But My loving devotion</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7717;as&#183;d&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
