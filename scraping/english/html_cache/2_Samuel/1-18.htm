David "bade them teach the children of Judah the bow": i.e., the following dirge called "the bow," not merely from the allusion to Jonathan's bow in <a href="/2_samuel/1-22.htm" title="From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.">2Samuel 1:22</a>, but because it is a martial ode, and the bow was one of the chief weapons of the time with which the Benjamites were particularly skilful (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-2.htm" title="They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul's brothers of Benjamin.">1Chronicles 12:2</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/14-8.htm" title="And Asa had an army of men that bore targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.">2Chronicles 14:8</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/17-17.htm" title="And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.">2Chronicles 17:17</a>). The word is omitted in the Vatican LXX. He taught this song to "the children of Judah" rather than to all Israel, because for the following seven and a half years, while the memory of Saul was fresh, he reigned only over Judah and Benjamin.<p><span class= "bld">In the book of Jasher.</span>--This book is also referred to in <a href="/joshua/10-13.htm" title="And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves on their enemies.

So the sun stood still in the middle of heaven, and hurried not to go down about a whole day.">Joshua 10:13</a>, and nothing more is really known about it, although it has been the subject of <span class= "ital">endless </span>discussion and speculation. It is supposed to have been a collection of songs relating to memorable events and men in the early history of Israel, and it appears that this elegy was included among them. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also he bade them teach the children of Judah</span> [the use of] <span class="cmt_word">the bow.</span> The old view is that given by the inserted words, and is well put by Ephrem Syrus in his commentary upon the passage. He says that, as Israel's defeat at Gilboa was the presage of a long struggle, and as the Philistines had gained the victory there by their skill in archery, David used his utmost authority with his own tribe to get them to practise this art for their protection in future wars. This explanation would be plausible were it not that we have reason for believing that the Israelites were already skilful in the use both of the sling and the bow, in both of which the Benjamites especially excelled (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-2.htm">1 Chronicles 12:2</a>). The modern view is that given in the Revised Version, where the inserted words are "the song of" the bow. "The Bow" is thus the name of the elegy, taken from the allusion to Jonathan's skill in the use of that weapon (ver. 22; comp. <a href="/1_samuel/18-4.htm">1 Samuel 18:4</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/20-36.htm">1 Samuel 20:36</a>); and the meaning is that David made his own tribesmen, who were probably ill disposed to Saul and his family, learn this dirge, not so much for its preservation, as to make them give the fallen king due honour. Similarly <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a>. is called "The Bush" in <a href="/mark/12-26.htm">Mark 12:26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The book of Jasher.</span> See on this book <a href="/joshua/10-13.htm">Joshua 10:13</a>, where the Syriac Version calls it "The Book of Canticles," and understands by it a collection of national ballads commemorative of the brave deeds of Israelite heroes. Jasher literally means "upright," and the Book of Jasher would be equivalent to "Hero book," the Hebrews always looking to the moral rather than the physical prowess of their great men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/1-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and he ordered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1429;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
