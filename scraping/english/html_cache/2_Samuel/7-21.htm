In the biblical context, God's word is a binding commitment, as seen in His covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) and later with David. The reliability of God's word is a central theme throughout Scripture, underscoring His unchanging nature (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). This assurance is foundational for the believer's trust in God's promises.<p><b>and according to Your own heart</b><br>This highlights God's sovereign will and His personal involvement in His plans. The "heart" of God refers to His desires and purposes, which are always good and perfect (<a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>). This phrase indicates that God's actions are not arbitrary but are deeply rooted in His character and divine intentions. It reflects the intimate relationship between God and His people, as seen in His covenantal dealings with Israel.<p><b>You have accomplished this great thing</b><br>The "great thing" refers to God's establishment of David's dynasty, which is a pivotal moment in biblical history. This accomplishment is not just a political or national event but a fulfillment of divine prophecy and a step towards the coming of the Messiah. The Davidic Covenant (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>) is a key element in the unfolding of God's redemptive plan, pointing forward to Jesus Christ, the ultimate King from David's line (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p><b>and revealed it to Your servant</b><br>The revelation to "Your servant" underscores the personal relationship between God and David. David is often referred to as God's servant, highlighting his role as a chosen leader and a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). This revelation is a divine communication, showing that God actively engages with His people, guiding them according to His purposes.

The phrase seemed, perhaps, to the Chronicler difficult, but it does not mean "because of thy previous promise," for no such promise had been given, but "because thou hast now said it." Nor does it imply pre-existing merit in David, but that God had now chosen to declare his will, and what was according to his own heart. It thus makes God's own good will and pleasure the cause of the great honours bestowed upon David.
