This reflects a heart of true worship, prioritizing God's glory over personal dignity. In biblical context, humility is a valued trait, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/22-4.htm">Proverbs 22:4</a>, which links humility with the fear of the Lord. David's actions prefigure Christ's humility, as described in <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>, where Jesus humbles Himself by taking on human form and submitting to death on a cross. David's willingness to be undignified for God contrasts with Saul's concern for public image, illustrating a key difference between the two kings.<p><b>Yet I will be honored by the maidservants of whom you have spoken.&#8221;</b><br>David's statement indicates that true honor comes from God and those who recognize His presence, rather than from societal status or approval. The maidservants, representing the humble and lowly, are often more attuned to God's work, as seen in the Magnificat (<a href="/luke/1-46.htm">Luke 1:46-55</a>), where Mary, a humble servant, is honored by God. This reflects the biblical theme that God exalts the humble (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>). David's confidence in being honored by the maidservants underscores the idea that God's perspective on honor differs from human perspectives, aligning with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/23-12.htm">Matthew 23:12</a> that those who humble themselves will be exalted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his heart for God and his role in bringing the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/michal.htm">Michal</a></b><br>Daughter of Saul and wife of David, who criticized David for his exuberant worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_the_covenant.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence with His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where David brought the Ark, establishing it as the religious and political center of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/slave_girls.htm">Slave Girls</a></b><br>Referenced by David in response to Michal's criticism, representing those who would honor him despite his humble actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_worship.htm">Humility in Worship</a></b><br>David's willingness to be humiliated for God challenges us to prioritize genuine worship over personal dignity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_perspective_vs._human_perspective.htm">God's Perspective vs. Human Perspective</a></b><br>Michal's criticism reflects a worldly view, while David's actions align with God's values.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_honor_of_humility.htm">The Honor of Humility</a></b><br>True honor comes from God and often through unexpected sources, as seen in David's reference to the slave girls.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/joyful_expression_in_worship.htm">Joyful Expression in Worship</a></b><br>David's exuberance in worship encourages believers to express their joy and gratitude to God freely.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/criticism_and_faithfulness.htm">Criticism and Faithfulness</a></b><br>David's response to Michal teaches us to remain faithful to God despite criticism from others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Samuel_6_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Samuel 6:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/David_s_humility_impact_on_worship.htm">How does David's humility in 2 Samuel 6:22 inspire your worship practices?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/David_s_lesson_on_valuing_God_s_approval.htm">What does David's response in 2 Samuel 6:22 teach about prioritizing God's approval?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/David_s_humility_in_2_Sam_6_22_guide.htm">How can David's example in 2 Samuel 6:22 guide your daily humility?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/David_s_humility_vs_Philippians_2_3-4.htm">Compare David's humility in 2 Samuel 6:22 with Philippians 2:3-4.

But the meaning is, that while Michal had charged him with making himself base in the eyes of the maidservants (who were no fit judges of such matters), he was ready to abase himself in his own eyes, to do anything, however humbling it might seem even to himself, which should be for the honour and glory of God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.</span> These words have been variously interpreted, but their simplest meaning is also the best;
