This righteousness is not self-proclaimed but is seen in the light of David's covenant relationship with God. The concept of righteousness in the Old Testament often involves adherence to God's laws and commands, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-25.htm">Deuteronomy 6:25</a>. David's life, despite its flaws, is marked by a heart that seeks after God, as noted in <a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate righteousness found in Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfilled the law and offers His righteousness to believers (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p><b>He has repaid me according to the cleanness of my hands.</b><br>The "cleanness of my hands" symbolizes innocence and purity in actions. In ancient Israel, clean hands were a metaphor for moral integrity and blamelessness, as seen in <a href="/psalms/24-4.htm">Psalm 24:4</a>. David's claim here is not of sinless perfection but of a life generally characterized by faithfulness to God. This phrase can be connected to the cultural practice of ritual purification, which was essential for worship and community life in Israel (Leviticus 15). Theologically, it points to the idea that God sees and judges the heart and actions of individuals, rewarding them accordingly. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to live pure and blameless lives (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>). The ultimate fulfillment of this purity is found in Christ, who cleanses believers and presents them spotless before God (<a href="/ephesians/5-27.htm">Ephesians 5:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this song of praise, David is reflecting on his life and God's deliverance.

For while be acknowledges in them a tendency to sin, he affirms that he had been on his guard against it, and that he had ever kept God's statutes present before his view. However complete may be the penitent's recovery, yet can he never again be "perfect," the word applied to an animal without blemish, and therefore fit for sacrifice. The crime remains a blemish, even though the intense sorrow for the sin may make it the means of even attaining to a higher stage of spirituality and devotion. In ver. 22 the words literally are, "I have not sinned away from God," sin necessarily removing the sinner away from that nearness to God which is the privilege of the saint. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/22-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has rewarded me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1502;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1445;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#7713;&#183;m&#601;&#183;l&#234;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124;
