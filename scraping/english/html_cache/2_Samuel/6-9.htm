This fear was prompted by the death of Uzzah, who was struck down by God for touching the Ark of the Covenant (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>). The incident underscores the importance of approaching God with the utmost respect and following His commandments precisely. This fear is not merely terror but a recognition of God's majesty and righteousness, similar to the fear of the LORD described in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, which is the beginning of knowledge.<p><b>and asked,</b><br>David's inquiry indicates a moment of introspection and humility. It shows his willingness to seek understanding and guidance from God. This is a common theme in David's life, as seen in his many psalms where he often seeks God's wisdom and direction (e.g., <a href="/psalms/25-4.htm">Psalm 25:4-5</a>). It also reflects the biblical principle of seeking God's will in all matters, as encouraged in <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>.<p><b>&#8220;How can the ark of the LORD ever come to me?&#8221;</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant was the most sacred object in Israel, representing God's presence among His people. David's question reveals his concern about how to properly bring the Ark to Jerusalem, acknowledging the need for holiness and obedience in handling sacred things. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's presence being both a blessing and a responsibility. The Ark's journey to Jerusalem is a type of Christ's coming to dwell among His people, as seen in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>. David's question also echoes the sentiment of <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>, where Isaiah recognizes his own unworthiness in the presence of a holy God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who is leading the transportation of the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence and covenant with Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whose holiness and power are central to the events surrounding the Ark.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/uzzah.htm">Uzzah</a></b><br>A man who was struck dead by God for touching the Ark, prompting David's fear and reverence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/obed-edom.htm">Obed-edom</a></b><br>The Gittite in whose house the Ark was placed temporarily after Uzzah's death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_holiness.htm">Reverence for God's Holiness</a></b><br>David's fear highlights the importance of approaching God with the utmost respect and reverence.

What follows is David&#8217;s immediate, heartfelt reaction to that precise moment&#8212;not a parable, but an actual event recorded for our instruction (<a href="/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The narrative underscores that God&#8217;s holiness is instantaneous in its response to disobedience; there is no delay or gradual penalty. Just as in <a href="/leviticus/10-1.htm">Leviticus 10:1-3</a> with Nadab and Abihu, judgment comes &#8220;that day.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>David feared the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Fear here is not mere terror but a reverent awareness of God&#8217;s unapproachable holiness. After witnessing a man struck down for irreverence, David cannot shrug it off. <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a> reminds us, &#8220;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Notice the shift from exuberant worship to sobering awe. Celebration is still fitting (<a href="/bsb/psalms/100.htm">Psalm 100</a>), but only when grounded in obedience. <a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28-29</a> balances these twin truths: &#8220;Let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Personal takeaway: authentic worship never treats the sacred casually. David&#8217;s fear shows that even a man after God&#8217;s own heart (<a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22</a>) must submit to God&#8217;s standards, not his own enthusiasm.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and asked</b><p>&#8226; David&#8217;s first instinct is to seek understanding. <a href="/psalms/119-71.htm">Psalm 119:71</a> says, &#8220;It was good for me to be afflicted, that I might learn Your statutes.&#8221;<p>&#8226; His question is humble&#8212;he does not blame God; he examines himself. <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a> encourages this posture: &#8220;If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The narrative moves from reaction to reflection, modeling how to turn crisis into a teachable moment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>How can the ark of the LORD ever come to me?</b><p>&#8226; The ark represents God&#8217;s throne on earth (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>). David&#8217;s question wrestles with the tension between God&#8217;s desire to dwell among His people and His demand for holiness.<p>&#8226; He is echoing Moses&#8217; plea in <a href="/exodus/33-15.htm">Exodus 33:15-16</a>, &#8220;If Your presence does not go with us, do not lead us up from here.&#8221; Both leaders know that the presence of God is indispensable yet dangerous if mishandled.<p>&#8226; The answer eventually comes in <a href="/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2, 13</a>: only the Levites, properly prepared, may carry the ark on poles. David will later say, &#8220;Because you did not carry it the first time, the LORD our God broke out against us.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The broader biblical theme: humanity cannot approach God on its own terms. <a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a> balances transcendence and immanence&#8212;God dwells &#8220;in a high and holy place, and also with the contrite and lowly of spirit.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Practical implication: true intimacy with God requires both invitation (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>) and submission to His revealed way (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The ark&#8217;s movement would continue, but only after thorough alignment with God&#8217;s instructions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/6-9.htm">2 Samuel 6:9</a> records an historical pivot point. In one day David&#8217;s jubilant procession is halted by holy judgment, producing reverent fear that drives him to seek God&#8217;s prescribed way of approach. The verse teaches that God&#8217;s presence is both priceless and perilous: we are invited to draw near, yet only by the route He sets forth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">David was afraid.</span>--The immediate effect of the judgment was to produce in David, and doubtless in all the people, that awe of the majesty of God in which they had shown themselves deficient. If this was at first excessive, it was soon moderated.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David was afraid</span>. This was his next feeling. Neither he nor Uzzah had offended wilfully, and so severe a punishment for an "error" made him dread the presence of so dangerous a thing as the ark seemed to be. Instead, therefore, of taking it into "the city of David," he turns aside and leaves it in the house of the nearest Levite. In both his anger and his dread David manifests himself to us as one whose ideas about God were somewhat childish. He regards Jehovah as a powerful and capricious Being, who must be appeased. He had attained to juster views in <a href="/psalms/16.htm">Psalm 16</a>. and other such trustful hymns. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/6-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">That</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1425;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
