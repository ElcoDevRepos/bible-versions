His counsel was considered as if one had inquired of the word of God. David's strategy to counteract Ahithophel's advice highlights the importance of divine intervention and human agency in thwarting plans against God's anointed. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using unexpected means to protect His chosen ones, as seen in stories like Joseph's rise in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p><b>if you return to the city and say to Absalom:</b><br>The city referred to is Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Israel. Absalom's rebellion against David, his father, represents a significant moment of political upheaval. Returning to the city signifies a strategic move to influence the heart of the rebellion. This mirrors the biblical theme of God&#8217;s sovereignty over political affairs, as seen in the rise and fall of kingdoms throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>&#8216;I will be your servant, my king;</b><br>This phrase indicates a feigned allegiance to Absalom, who has declared himself king. The act of becoming a servant is a strategic deception, reminiscent of other biblical instances where God&#8217;s people use cunning to achieve divine purposes, such as Rahab hiding the spies (Joshua 2). It also foreshadows the ultimate servanthood of Christ, who came not to be served but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><b>in the past I was your father&#8217;s servant,</b><br>This acknowledges the previous loyalty to King David, Absalom's father. It underscores the theme of loyalty and betrayal, a recurring motif in the narrative of David's reign. The shift in allegiance is a tactical move to gain Absalom's trust, reflecting the complex dynamics of political power and personal relationships in the biblical narrative.<p><b>but now I will be your servant.&#8217;</b><br>The repetition of servanthood emphasizes the role of humility and submission in achieving God's purposes. It also highlights the theme of divine providence, where God uses human actions, even those that seem deceitful, to fulfill His plans. This echoes the New Testament teaching of being wise as serpents and innocent as doves (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>), illustrating the balance between shrewdness and integrity in the life of faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is fleeing from his son Absalom's rebellion.

David knew that if Absalom followed this counselor, the rebellion could succeed. By sending Hushai to undermine that counsel, David trusted God to &#8220;turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/15-31.htm">2 Samuel 15:31</a>). The scene echoes <a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>, where many plans exist &#8220;but it is the purpose of the LORD that prevails,&#8221; and anticipates <a href="/2_samuel/17-14.htm">2 Samuel 17:14</a>, where the Lord indeed causes Absalom to reject Ahithophel&#8217;s plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>if you return to the city</b><p>Hushai&#8217;s effectiveness depended on proximity.

Scripture often records servants declaring loyalty to monarchs (<a href="/1_kings/1-31.htm">1 Kings 1:31</a>), so the phrase rang true to Absalom&#8217;s ears. Yet God would use this apparent allegiance to save David, illustrating Jesus&#8217; teaching to be &#8220;shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the past I was your father&#8217;s servant,</b><p>Hushai&#8217;s past loyalty to David (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-33.htm">1 Chronicles 27:33</a>) added credibility. Absalom could reason, &#8220;If he served my father well, why shouldn&#8217;t he serve me?&#8221; At the same time, mentioning David highlighted the relational bridge Hushai still cherished, much like Paul retained affection for the churches that deserted him (<a href="/2_timothy/4-16.htm">2 Timothy 4:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but now I will be your servant.&#8217;</b><p>The shift from past to present sounded decisive. Yet beneath the words lay a higher allegiance: Hushai remained David&#8217;s friend and, more importantly, God&#8217;s instrument. By persuading Absalom to adopt a slower pursuit strategy (<a href="/2_samuel/17-11.htm">2 Samuel 17:11&#8211;12</a>), he bought David time to cross the Jordan safely (<a href="/2_samuel/17-22.htm">2 Samuel 17:22</a>). Ahithophel&#8217;s subsequent despair and suicide (<a href="/2_samuel/17-23.htm">2 Samuel 17:23</a>) underline <a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10</a>&#8212;&#8220;The LORD frustrates the plans of the nations; He thwarts the devices of the peoples.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/15-34.htm">2 Samuel 15:34</a> records David&#8217;s Spirit-led plan to place Hushai inside Absalom&#8217;s court. Each phrase reveals:<p>&#8226; a trust that God can overturn even the wisest worldly counsel,<p>&#8226; a practical step of sending a loyal friend back into danger,<p>&#8226; a legitimate yet strategic declaration of service that masks deeper fidelity,<p>&#8226; and, ultimately, the providence that saved David&#8217;s life and preserved the messianic line. The verse reminds believers that God sovereignly works through human actions&#8212;both bold faith and careful strategy&#8212;to fulfill His unbreakable promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Say unto Absalom.</span>--David here counsels fraud and treachery, and Hushai willingly accepts the part assigned to him, in order to thwart Ahithophel's counsel and weaken Absalom's rebellion. The narrative simply states the facts without justifying them. But while we cannot too strongly condemn such a stratagem, two things are to be remembered: first, that like frauds in time of war and rebellion have been practised in all ages, and still continue; and, secondly, that David and Hushai had but slender knowledge of the Divine revelation of truth and righteousness which enables us to condemn them, and, therefore, did with a clear conscience many things which we see to be wrong.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</span> David was thus meeting treachery by treachery, and we cannot approve of it, even granting that Ahithophel's conduct was base and selfish, while Hushai was risking his life for his master. Still, he was sent back to tell a falsehood, and his excuse was necessity; for Ahithophel was so sagacious that, if his counsel were not upset, David's cause was lost. It was not Christian morality, but yet it has a sort of nobleness about it in Hushai's devotion to his king. And even now, in war and diplomacy, such acts are not uncommon, and a distinction is unhappily drawn between political and social morality. Even in common life immoral doings are often sanctioned by use. Thus many customs of trade are frauds, considered legitimate because generally practised. Even among ourselves Christian morality is far below the level of our Master's teaching; and the Old Testament must not be taken as approving all that it records. Similar blame does not attach to Zadok and Abiathar. They were known to be David's friends, and had even tried to go with him, bearing with them the ark. They professed no friendship for Absalom, and returned for no covert purpose, looking for protection, not to guile, but to their sacred office. And Absalom would be glad to have them in his power, and would make them continue the customary sacrifices, and, if his rebellion proved successful, would force them to anoint him, and so give his usurpation a religious sanction. But he would tell them none of his plans, nor would they try to insinuate themselves into his confidence. They would have a perfect right to be useful in any way they could to their true master, but would do so at the risk of severe punishment. Hushai's way of defeating Ahithophel was treacherous; but there was no deceit in the young men carrying a message from him, for they were openly David's friends. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/15-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">but if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
