They often held positions of authority and were responsible for providing guidance and support. In this context, the elders of David's household were likely senior servants or officials who had the responsibility to care for the king during his time of distress. Their presence indicates the seriousness of the situation and the communal concern for David's well-being.<p><b>to help him up from the ground</b><br>David was in a state of deep mourning and repentance, lying prostrate on the ground. This posture was a common expression of intense grief and supplication in the ancient Near East. It reflects David's profound sorrow over his sin with Bathsheba and the resulting illness of their child. The elders' attempt to help him up signifies their desire to comfort and restore him, both physically and emotionally, to a state of normalcy.<p><b>but he was unwilling</b><br>David's unwillingness to rise demonstrates the depth of his penitence and his focus on seeking God's mercy. It highlights his recognition of the gravity of his sin and his dependence on divine intervention. This act of refusal can be seen as an expression of humility and submission to God's will, reminiscent of other biblical figures who fasted and prayed in times of crisis, such as Esther and Daniel.<p><b>and would not eat anything with them</b><br>Fasting was a common practice in the Bible, often associated with mourning, repentance, and seeking God's favor. By refusing to eat, David was engaging in a spiritual discipline intended to demonstrate his earnestness in prayer and his desire for God's forgiveness and healing for his child. This act of fasting connects to other scriptural instances where individuals or communities sought divine intervention through abstaining from food, such as in the book of Jonah with the people of Nineveh.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is in deep mourning and repentance after the prophet Nathan confronts him about his sin with Bathsheba.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders_of_david's_household.htm">Elders of David's Household</a></b><br>These are the senior officials or advisors in David's court, who attempt to comfort and assist him during his time of distress.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ground.htm">The Ground</a></b><br>Symbolic of David's humility and repentance, as he lays prostrate in prayer and fasting.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fasting.htm">Fasting</a></b><br>David's refusal to eat is an expression of his deep sorrow and plea for God's mercy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan's_confrontation.htm">Nathan's Confrontation</a></b><br>The event preceding this verse, where the prophet Nathan reveals God's judgment on David for his sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_weight_of_sin_and_repentance.htm">The Weight of Sin and Repentance</a></b><br>David's actions demonstrate the seriousness of sin and the depth of true repentance.

David&#8217;s grief over the child affects the nation&#8217;s leadership as well (see <a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>).<p>&#8226; God often places wise counselors around us for moments of crisis. <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a> reminds us, &#8220;Where there is no guidance, a people fall, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Stood beside him</b><p>&#8226; The elders &#8220;stood beside&#8221; David&#8212;literal, physical proximity that mirrors the spiritual support believers are called to provide (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-10</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>).<p>&#8226; They do not preach at him; they simply remain present, reflecting Job&#8217;s friends before they spoke (<a href="/job/2-13.htm">Job 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Presence can be ministry. Sometimes the best help is to &#8220;weep with those who weep&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To help him up from the ground</b><p>&#8226; David has been lying on the ground in fasting and prayer for seven days (<a href="/2_samuel/12-16.htm">2 Samuel 12:16</a>). The elders attempt to lift him&#8212;literally and figuratively.<p>&#8226; Their action echoes Joshua&#8217;s command to a grieving Israel: &#8220;Get up! Why have you fallen on your face?&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/7-10.htm">Joshua 7:10</a>). God uses others to call us back to everyday responsibilities after intense spiritual struggle.<p>&#8226; Yet lifting is gentle, not forceful. <a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a> urges restoration &#8220;in a spirit of gentleness.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But he was unwilling</b><p>&#8226; David&#8217;s refusal shows the depth of his sorrow. Like Jacob refusing comfort when he thought Joseph dead (<a href="/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a>), grief can resist even well-meant help.<p>&#8226; His persistence in prayer resembles Moses&#8217; intercession for Israel (<a href="/exodus/32-30.htm">Exodus 32:30-32</a>). David clings to hope that God might yet spare the child until God&#8217;s answer is final.<p>&#8226; Waiting on God sometimes means staying in the place of lament longer than others understand (<a href="/psalms/62-5.htm">Psalm 62:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And would not eat anything with them</b><p>&#8226; Fasting is David&#8217;s tangible expression of repentance and petition (<a href="/psalms/35-13.htm">Psalm 35:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar scenes: Hannah &#8220;wept and would not eat&#8221; while pleading for a child (<a href="/1_samuel/1-7.htm">1 Samuel 1:7</a>); Ahab refused food in selfish sulking (<a href="/1_kings/21-4.htm">1 Kings 21:4</a>). David&#8217;s motive is righteous sorrow, not petulance.<p>&#8226; The refusal underscores total focus on God. Jesus later affirms that some breakthroughs come only by prayer and fasting (<a href="/matthew/17-21.htm">Matthew 17:21</a> in many manuscripts).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/12-17.htm">2 Samuel 12:17</a> pictures a king laid low by sin-borne grief, surrounded by faithful servants who try to raise him. Their presence models compassionate support, yet David&#8217;s continued fasting reveals a heart still wrestling before God. The verse teaches that:<p>&#8226; Sin&#8217;s consequences ripple outward, affecting community leadership.<p>&#8226; Believers are called to stand beside the broken, offering presence and gentle assistance.<p>&#8226; Genuine repentance may include prolonged fasting and prayer until the Lord&#8217;s answer is clear.<p>When God finally speaks (v. 19-20), David rises, worships, and eats&#8212;demonstrating that surrendered hearts move from mourning to obedient acceptance when the Lord&#8217;s will is revealed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/12-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The elders</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ziq&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2205.htm">Strong's 2205: </a> </span><span class="str2">Old</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of his household</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
