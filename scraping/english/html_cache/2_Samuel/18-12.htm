The context is a conversation during the battle in which Absalom, David's son, is involved. The soldier's reply reflects the tension between duty to the king and personal gain.<p><b>Even if a thousand shekels of silver were weighed out into my hands</b><br>A thousand shekels of silver represents a significant sum, indicating the magnitude of the bribe or reward that could be offered. In ancient Israel, silver was a common medium of exchange, and this amount underscores the soldier's integrity and commitment to the king's command over personal enrichment. This echoes the biblical principle of valuing righteousness over wealth, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>.<p><b>I would not raise my hand against the son of the king</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the soldier's respect for the king's family and the sanctity of the royal lineage. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, the king's family was considered sacred, and harming them was seen as a grave offense. This respect for the king's son, despite Absalom's rebellion, reflects the broader biblical theme of honoring authority, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>.<p><b>For we heard the king command you and Abishai and Ittai</b><br>The mention of Abishai and Ittai, two of David's commanders, highlights the chain of command and the importance of following orders in military contexts. Abishai was David's nephew and a loyal supporter, while Ittai the Gittite was a foreigner who had pledged allegiance to David. Their inclusion signifies the unity and diversity within David's forces, as well as the widespread dissemination of the king's orders.<p><b>&#8216;Protect the young man Absalom for my sake.&#8217;</b><br>David's command to protect Absalom, despite his rebellion, reveals the deep paternal love and mercy he holds for his son. This reflects the biblical theme of forgiveness and grace, akin to God's love for His children. The plea to protect Absalom can be seen as a type of Christ, who intercedes for humanity despite their transgressions, as seen in <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>. David's desire to spare Absalom also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, who came to save rather than condemn.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

18:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; His immediate response shows clarity of conscience and strong conviction, echoing David&#8217;s earlier honor toward Saul: &#8220;Far be it from me to stretch out my hand against the LORD&#8217;s anointed&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>; cf. 26:9).<p>&#8226; By speaking up, he risks Joab&#8217;s wrath, yet his words set a moral contrast
