In the ancient Near East, a "name" was synonymous with fame and honor. David's victories contributed to his legacy as a king chosen by God, fulfilling the promise that God would make his name great (<a href="/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>). This also prefigures the greater name of Jesus Christ, whose name is above every name (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>).<p><b>when he returned from striking down</b><br>The phrase suggests a successful military campaign. David's return signifies not only victory but also the consolidation of his rule and the expansion of Israel's territory. This reflects God's promise to give Israel rest from their enemies (<a href="/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11</a>). It also highlights David's role as a type of Christ, who defeats spiritual enemies and brings peace to His people.<p><b>eighteen thousand Edomites</b><br>The Edomites were descendants of Esau and often in conflict with Israel. This victory over Edom is significant as it fulfills the prophecy given to Rebekah that the older (Esau) would serve the younger (Jacob) (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>). The number eighteen thousand emphasizes the scale of the victory and God's favor upon David. It also foreshadows Christ's ultimate victory over all nations and spiritual powers.<p><b>in the Valley of Salt</b><br>The Valley of Salt is located near the Dead Sea, a region known for its harsh and barren landscape. This geographical detail underscores the difficulty of the campaign and the strategic importance of the victory. The Valley of Salt is also mentioned in other biblical accounts of military victories (<a href="/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/18-12.htm">1 Chronicles 18:12</a>), reinforcing the theme of God's deliverance and the establishment of His kingdom through His chosen leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his military prowess, leadership, and heart for God.

The course of affairs appears to have been as follows:--the war was originally undertaken against the Ammonites (<a href="/context/2_samuel/10-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.">2Samuel 10:1-12</a>), who had obtained the aid of the Syrians. In the first campaign their combined armies were defeated (<a href="/context/2_samuel/10-13.htm" title="And Joab drew near, and the people that were with him, to the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.">2Samuel 10:13-14</a>), and they sought aid from every quarter, from the tribes beyond the Euphrates, on the north (<a href="/2_samuel/10-16.htm" title="And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.">2Samuel 10:16</a>), and from the Edomites on the south. David first inflicted a crushing defeat upon the allies near Hamath, and then "returned" to the south, where he again met them in "the valley of salt"--the <span class= "ital">Arabalt </span>south of the Dead Sea, this latter army being naturally chiefly composed of Edomites, and so called in <a href="/1_chronicles/18-12.htm" title="Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.">1Chronicles 18:12</a>, and in the title of Psalms 60, but here spoken of as Syrians because the whole confederacy is called by the name of its most powerful member. David himself returned from the southern campaign; but what was done by his general, Abishai, under his orders, is naturally said to have been done by him. Meantime, when this first battle, attended with the slaughter of 18,000 men, had been won by Abishai, Joab, the general-in-chief, being set free by the victories in the north, gained another battle in the same locality, killing 12,000 (Psalms 60, title). The power of Edom was now completely broken, and the whole forces of Israel were mustered under Joab to overrun their country and destroy all its male inhabitants (<a href="/context/1_kings/11-15.htm" title="For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;">1Kings 11:15-16</a>), certain of them, however, excepted (<a href="/1_kings/11-17.htm" title="That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.">1Kings 11:17</a>), and their descendants in after ages were relentless foes of Israel. (Comp. the prophecy of Isaac, <a href="/genesis/27-40.htm" title="And by your sword shall you live, and shall serve your brother; and it shall come to pass when you shall have the dominion, that you shall break his yoke from off your neck.">Genesis 27:40</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From smiting of the Syrians;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">of Aram.</span> Here "Edom" is certainly right (see <a href="/1_chronicles/18-12.htm">1 Chronicles 18:12</a>), unless we accept Keil's conjecture, and suppose that "he smote Edom" has dropped out of the text, and must be inserted. In the superscription of Psalm we find the wars with Aram-Naharaim (Mesopotamia) and Aram-Zobah coupled with this smiting of Edom in the valley of salt, which lay to the south of the Dead Sea, and was a fatal place to the Edomitos in their war subsequently with Amaziah (<a href="/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>). Such a double victory over the Arameans first, and immediately afterwards over Edom, would account for the "name," that is, the reputation, which David gained. The course of events seems to have been as follows. The Edomites, believing that David was engaged in a struggle beyond his powers with the Syrians, took the opportunity to invade Israel. But the campaign in Aram was quickly decided, and David was able to send Abishai with a detachment of his forces to repel the Edomites. On hearing of his approach, they retired before him, and, making a stand in their own territories, were defeated in the valley of salt, with the loss of eighteen thousand men (<a href="/1_chronicles/18-12.htm">1 Chronicles 18:12</a>). In this place the victory is ascribed to David, because it was won by his general acting under his orders. For some unexplained reason, the feelings of the Israelites against Edom were very vindictive, and Joab followed with larger forces, and not only slew twelve thousand in a second battle (<a href="/psalms/60.htm">Psalm 60</a>, title), but remained six months in the country, ruthlessly putting every male to death (<a href="/1_kings/11-15.htm">1 Kings 11:15, 16</a>). From this time the Edomites and Israelites were implacable foes, and in later Jewish literature the Jews gave vent to their intense hatred of the Roman empire by giving it the name of Edom. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/8-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">made</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
