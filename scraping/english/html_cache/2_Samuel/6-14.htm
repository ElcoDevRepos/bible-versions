The ephod was a priestly garment, typically worn by those serving in the temple (<a href="/1_samuel/2-18.htm">1 Samuel 2:18</a>). By wearing it, David demonstrates humility and a desire to worship God in a manner that transcends his royal status. This act symbolizes his role as a servant leader, aligning himself with the priestly function of worship. The linen material signifies purity and holiness, often associated with priestly duties (<a href="/exodus/28-6.htm">Exodus 28:6-8</a>). David's actions foreshadow the priestly role of Jesus Christ, who is both King and Priest (<a href="/hebrews/7-17.htm">Hebrews 7:17</a>).<p><b>danced with all his might</b><br>David's dance is an expression of exuberant worship and joy. His uninhibited celebration reflects a heart fully devoted to God, emphasizing the importance of worship that engages the whole being. This act of dancing is a physical manifestation of spiritual joy, reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/150-4.htm">Psalm 150:4</a>, which encourages praising God with dance. David's wholehearted worship serves as a model for believers, illustrating that worship should be passionate and sincere. His dance also contrasts with the more reserved and formal worship practices of the time, highlighting the personal and intimate relationship he has with God.<p><b>before the LORD,</b><br>David's dance is directed towards the LORD, indicating that his actions are an act of worship and reverence. The phrase "before the LORD" underscores the presence of God as the central focus of the celebration. This moment occurs during the transportation of the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, a significant event symbolizing God's presence among His people (<a href="/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2-3</a>). The Ark represents God's throne on earth, and David's dance before it signifies his acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and his submission to divine authority. This act of worship parallels the reverence shown by Jesus, who consistently sought to honor and glorify the Father (<a href="/john/17-4.htm">John 17:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his deep devotion to God.

The king, by now taking part in them himself, marked his strong sense of the importance of the occasion, and his readiness to do his utmost in God's honour.<p><span class= "bld">Girded with a linen ephod.</span>--This is usually spoken of as if David were arrayed in a distinctively priestly dress; but it is remarkable that the ephod was not prescribed as a part of the priestly dress--the ephod of the <span class= "ital">high-priest </span>(<a href="/exodus/25-7.htm" title="Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate.">Exodus 25:7</a>, &c.) being quite a different thing--and was worn by others, as Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/2-18.htm" title="But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.">1Samuel 2:18</a>). The wearing of the ephod, however, is spoken of in <a href="/1_samuel/22-18.htm" title="And the king said to Doeg, Turn you, and fall on the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell on the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.">1Samuel 22:18</a> as characteristic of the priests, and in <a href="/judges/8-27.htm" title="And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.">Judges 8:27</a>; <a href="/judges/17-5.htm" title="And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.">Judges 17:5</a>; <a href="/context/judges/18-14.htm" title="Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of Laish, and said to their brothers, Do you know that there is in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image? now therefore consider what you have to do.">Judges 18:14-20</a>, it is connected with idolatrous worship.

And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell on the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.">1Samuel 22:18</a> to describe the priests, because such service constituted their ordinary life. It was not, therefore, a peculiarly priestly dress, though naturally more worn by them than by any one else. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And David danced.</span> The word used means the springing round in half circles to the sound of music. Conder has given a very interesting account of the dancing of the Malawiyeh, which consisted in turning round in whole circles, resting on the heel of the left foot ('Herb and Moab,' p. 65, etc.). As David danced with all his might, he was evidently strongly excited with religious fervour. We have the expression of his feelings in the psalm composed for this occasion (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-7.htm">1 Chronicles 16:7-36</a>); subsequently it seems to have been rearranged for the temple service, as it is broken up into <a href="/psalms/96.htm">Psalm 96</a>. and Psalms 105:1-15. Dancing was usually the office of the women (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>; <a href="/judges/11-35.htm">Judges 11:35</a>; <a href="/judges/21-21.htm">Judges 21:21</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a>); but men may also have often taken part in it, as Michal's objection was that it was unbefitting a king. <span class="cmt_word">David was girded with a linen ephod.</span> David wore this as a tightly fitting garment, which left him free to exert himself in the dance. So far from the use of it being an assumption of the priestly office, it was regarded by Michal as an act of humiliation, as it was a dress worn even by a child when admitted to service in a priest's family (<a href="/1_samuel/2-18.htm">1 Samuel 2:18</a>). Probably David did mean to rank himself for the time among the inferior servitors of the ark. He might have claimed more. In the theocracy he was the representative of Jehovah, and his anointing was a solemn consecration to a religious office. To have burned incense or offered sacrifice would have been to invade the priestly office, an office parallel to "the administration of the Word and the sacraments," denied, in the Thirty-Seventh Article of the Church of England, to princes. To wear the garb of a servitor was to do honour both to Jehovah and to his priests. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/6-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And David,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1435;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
