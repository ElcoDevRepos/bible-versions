The context is a strategic discussion on how to capture David. Cities in ancient Israel were often fortified, providing refuge and protection. The idea of retreating to a city suggests seeking safety behind walls, a common military tactic. This reflects the historical context of warfare in the ancient Near East, where cities served as strongholds.<p><b>all Israel will bring ropes to that city</b><br>The phrase "all Israel" indicates a united effort, emphasizing the collective action of the nation against David. This hyperbolic expression suggests overwhelming force and determination. Ropes were used in siege warfare to pull down walls or gates, symbolizing the complete destruction of the city&#8217;s defenses. This imagery underscores the seriousness of the threat against David and the extent of Absalom's rebellion.<p><b>and we will drag it down to the valley</b><br>The valley represents a place of defeat and humiliation. In biblical symbolism, valleys often denote low points or places of judgment. The act of dragging a city down to the valley signifies total conquest and subjugation. This reflects the cultural understanding of victory in battle, where the defeated are brought low. It also foreshadows the ultimate failure of Absalom&#8217;s rebellion, as God&#8217;s plans for David prevail.<p><b>until not even a pebble can be found there.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes complete and utter destruction, leaving no trace of the city. It reflects the thoroughness of the intended siege and the finality of the judgment against David&#8217;s refuge. Biblically, such total destruction is reminiscent of divine judgment, as seen in the destruction of cities like Jericho. It also serves as a reminder of God&#8217;s sovereignty, as human plans are ultimately subject to His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who is fleeing from his son Absalom's rebellion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, who has declared himself king and is seeking to overthrow David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hushai_the_archite.htm">Hushai the Archite</a></b><br>A friend of David who acts as a spy and counselor to Absalom, providing advice to counter Ahithophel's counsel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahithophel.htm">Ahithophel</a></b><br>A former counselor of David who has defected to Absalom and is known for his wise counsel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation, which is divided in its loyalty between David and Absalom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_human_affairs.htm">God's Sovereignty in Human Affairs</a></b><br>Despite human plans and schemes, God's purposes will prevail.
