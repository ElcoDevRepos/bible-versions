David is referred to as "My servant," indicating his chosen status and special relationship with God. This reflects the biblical theme of God choosing leaders to fulfill His purposes, as seen with figures like Moses and Abraham. The use of a prophet to convey God's message underscores the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces in Israel.<p><b>that this is what the LORD says:</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the authority of the message, coming directly from the LORD, the covenant name of God, Yahweh. This divine communication is a hallmark of the prophetic tradition, where God's will is revealed to His people. It underscores the importance of obedience to God's word, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>Are you the one to build for Me a house to dwell in?</b><br>This rhetorical question addresses David's desire to build a temple for God, contrasting with God's plan. The "house" refers to a temple, a permanent dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant, which until then resided in a tent. This question sets the stage for God's covenant with David, where God promises to establish David's dynasty rather than having David build a physical structure. This passage foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic covenant, who establishes a spiritual house, the Church. The question also reflects the biblical theme that God does not dwell in houses made by human hands, as seen in Solomon's later acknowledgment in <a href="/1_kings/8-27.htm">1 Kings 8:27</a> and Stephen's speech in <a href="/acts/7-48.htm">Acts 7:48-50</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who desires to build a temple for the Lord.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan.htm">Nathan</a></b><br>The prophet who receives God's message to deliver to David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who communicates His will through Nathan.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/house.htm">House</a></b><br>Refers to the temple David desires to build for God, symbolizing a permanent dwelling place for the Ark of the Covenant.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where David reigns and where he plans to build the temple.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_plans.htm">God's Sovereignty in Plans</a></b><br>God has a divine plan that may differ from our own desires.

By addressing His servant through Nathan, the Lord reaffirms relationship, asserts His sovereign authority, redirects David&#8217;s role, and clarifies that any house built for Him must serve His purpose, not human ambition. The verse invites believers to listen first, obey completely, and trust that God&#8217;s design surpasses even our most heartfelt dreams.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Shalt thou build?</span>--The question implies the negative, as it is expressed in <a href="/1_chronicles/17-5.htm" title="For I have not dwelled in an house since the day that I brought up Israel to this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.">1Chronicles 17:5</a>, and as it is here translated in the LXX. and Syriac.<p>After David was told that he should not be allowed to build a temple for God as he desired, he is promised that God will make for him a sure house, and will accept the building of the temple from his son. David is called "my servant," an expression used only of those eminent and faithful in the service of God, as Moses and Joshua, thus showing--as in fact the whole message does--that the prohibition conveyed nothing of Divine displeasure; but no reason for it is here expressed.<span class= "note">[33]</span> But in, David's parting charge to Solomon (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-8.htm" title="But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, You have shed blood abundantly, and have made great wars: you shall not build an house to my name, because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight.">1Chronicles 22:8</a>), and to the heads of the nation (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="But God said to me, You shall not build an house for my name, because you have been a man of war, and have shed blood.">1Chronicles 28:3</a>), he says, "the word of the Lord came unto" him, giving as the reason, "because thou hast shed much blood on the earth," and "hast been a man of war." Those wars had been necessary, under the circumstances in which he was placed, and had never been disapproved of God; still the mere fact that he had been a man of blood unfitted him for this sacred office.<p><span class= "note">[33] Two reasons for the prohibition are found by nearly all commentators in this message itself. (1) That God must first build "a house "for David before he could properly build a temple for God; and (2) that the kingdom was not yet sufficiently established and peaceful for a temple to be built. But neither of these are assigned as reasons m the Divine word, and it is better to keep only to that which is assigned, however these other facts may convince us of the fitness and propriety of the postponement of David's purpose.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shalt thou, etc.?</span> The question implies an answer in the negative; but there is no disapproval of David's purpose as such; but only the deferring of its full execution unto the days of his son. There is more than this. The idea which runs through the Divine message is that the dwelling of Jehovah in a tent was a fitting symbol of Israel's unquiet possession of the laud. It was David's mission to give them tranquillity and security in the region which they had conquered long ago, but wherein they had never hitherto been able to maintain their liberty unimpaired. Then, upon the accomplishment of David's special duty, his son, Shelomo, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the peaceful, was to build the solid temple, as the proof that Jehovah had now taken permanent possession of the land. We find also a further thought, namely, that the building of the temple signified "the making for David of a house." In its full significance this means that the tribe of Judah and the lineage of David were now chosen by God as the ancestors of the Messiah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/7-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Go</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1461;&#1444;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and tell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1469;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
