The context here is the rebellion of Sheba, a Benjamite who sought to divide Israel after Absalom's rebellion. Abel-beth-maacah was a fortified city in the northern part of Israel, near the borders of modern-day Lebanon. This city was significant as a place of wisdom and counsel, as seen later in the chapter when a wise woman negotiates with Joab. The act of besieging indicates a military strategy to cut off supplies and force surrender, a common practice in ancient warfare.<p><b>and built a siege ramp against the outer rampart of the city</b><br>Siege ramps were crucial in ancient warfare, allowing attackers to breach city walls. The construction of such ramps required significant manpower and resources, indicating Joab's determination to capture Sheba. The outer rampart refers to the defensive walls protecting the city, which were often formidable. This phrase highlights the intensity of the conflict and the lengths to which Joab was willing to go to maintain the unity of Israel under David's rule.<p><b>As all the troops with Joab were battering the wall to topple it</b><br>The battering of the wall suggests the use of siege engines or battering rams, tools designed to break through fortifications. This action underscores the urgency and aggression of Joab's campaign against Sheba. The collective effort of "all the troops" emphasizes the unity and discipline of David's forces, contrasting with the division Sheba sought to create. This scene can be seen as a type of spiritual warfare, where unity and perseverance are necessary to overcome rebellion and division, themes echoed throughout scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, known for his military prowess and sometimes ruthless actions.

Earlier squabbles between Judah and the other tribes (19:41-43) are set aside for the larger mission.<p>&#8226; Compare how Abram &#8220;mobilized 318 trained men&#8221; to rescue Lot (<a href="/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14</a>). God&#8217;s people have often had to move promptly to stop a threat before it grows.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and besieged Sheba in Abel-beth-maacah</b><p>Abel-beth-maacah sat in Israel&#8217;s northernmost reaches, near modern-day Lebanon.<p>&#8226; Sheba likely chose it because its distance from Jerusalem and its fortified nature offered refuge (cf. <a href="/1_kings/15-20.htm">1 Kings 15:20</a>, where Ben-hadad later seized the same area).<p>&#8226; A siege rather than an immediate assault gives the city a chance to surrender&#8212;a principle seen when Israel was later told to &#8220;offer terms of peace&#8221; before attacking (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s army is protecting covenant unity; rebellion is never a mere political nuisance but a rupture of God-ordained order (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and built a siege ramp against the outer rampart of the city</b><p>A siege ramp (literally &#8220;a mound&#8221;) let troops approach and breach higher walls, a tactic also pictured when Nebuchadnezzar attacked Jerusalem (<a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Building such a structure demanded teamwork, persistence, and exposure to enemy missiles&#8212;reminding us that dealing with entrenched sin often calls for sustained, costly effort (<a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;outer rampart&#8221; hints the city had multiple defenses; Joab begins with the first barrier. God&#8217;s people, too, may have to dismantle layers of resistance in a person&#8217;s heart before truth prevails (2 <a href="/bsb/colossians/1.htm">Colossians 10</a>:4-5).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As all the troops with Joab were battering the wall to topple it</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;All the troops&#8221; signals total engagement; no one hangs back.

Joab will not leave until rebellion ends, foreshadowing the cross where Christ dealt fully with sin rather than partially (<a href="/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet just a few verses later, wise negotiation stops the destruction (20:16-22). God delights in justice but also in mercy when repentance appears.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/20-15.htm">2 Samuel 20:15</a> captures the moment Joab&#8217;s forces surround Abel-beth-maacah, construct a siege ramp, and pound its walls, determined to arrest Sheba and end his rebellion. The verse highlights rapid obedience, unified purpose, strategic persistence, and wholehearted effort. Taken together with the surrounding context, it teaches that God&#8217;s people must confront rebellion decisively, employ wise strategy, and remain open to mercy when repentance emerges&#8212;all while recognizing that sustained unity under God-given authority safeguards the peace and witness of His covenant community.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15)<span class= "bld">Abel of Beth-maachah.</span>--Omit the preposition "of."

The Hebrew "stood" means "rose up to," "stood level with;" and the "trench" is what in modern fortifications is called "the glacis," and includes the outer wall of defence. The Revised Version renders, "it stood against the rampart." The usual way of capturing cities in ancient times was to cast up a bank or mound of earth against them (<a href="/isaiah/29-3.htm">Isaiah 29:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-33.htm">Isaiah 37:33</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-6.htm">Jeremiah 6:6</a>); and Joab's work had advanced so far as to be level with the outer line of defence. The name of the city in the Hebrew is not <span class="cmt_word">Abel of Beth-Maachah,</span> but <span class="accented">Abel-beth-Maachah. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Battered</span>. This is a word taken from Roman warfare. The Hebrew says, "And all the people that were with Joab were destroying the wall to make it fall," most probably by undermining it. Ewald even asserts that this is the meaning of the verb, and translates, "were digging pits under the wall." The Revised Version adopts this for the margin, where it gives "undermined." The Septuagint and Chaldee have a different and probable reading, "And all Joab's people were devising (contriving) means to throw down the wall." This would be the next operation after the mound had been carried up to a level with it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/20-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Joab&#8217;s troops came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1436;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
