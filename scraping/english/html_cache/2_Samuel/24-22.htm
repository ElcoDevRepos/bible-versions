His willingness to speak directly to King David reflects the peaceful coexistence and respect between the Jebusites and Israelites at this time. This interaction highlights the importance of Jerusalem as a central location for Israel's worship and governance.<p><b>May my lord the king take whatever seems good to him and offer it up</b><br>Araunah's offer to give David whatever he needs for the sacrifice demonstrates a spirit of generosity and submission to the king. This reflects the cultural norm of showing deference to royalty and the recognition of David's authority. It also underscores the importance of sacrificial offerings in maintaining a right relationship with God, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>Here are the oxen for a burnt offering</b><br>The oxen were valuable animals, often used in agriculture, and their use as a burnt offering signifies a significant sacrifice. Burnt offerings were a common form of worship in Israel, symbolizing atonement and dedication to God. This act foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is often typified as the Lamb of God, taking away the sins of the world.<p><b>and the threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood</b><br>Threshing sledges and ox yokes were essential tools for agriculture, indicating Araunah's willingness to give up his livelihood for the sake of the king's offering. The use of these items as wood for the sacrifice highlights the theme of total surrender and devotion to God. This act of using everyday items for worship can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament teaching that all aspects of life should be offered to God as a living sacrifice (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who seeks to build an altar to the Lord to stop a plague on Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/araunah.htm">Araunah</a></b><br>A Jebusite who owns the threshing floor where David intends to build the altar.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/threshing_floor.htm">Threshing Floor</a></b><br>The location owned by Araunah, which David desires to purchase for the altar.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offering.htm">Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A sacrificial offering to God, symbolizing atonement and dedication.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/plague.htm">Plague</a></b><br>A divine punishment on Israel, which David seeks to halt through sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_giving.htm">Sacrificial Giving</a></b><br>Araunah&#8217;s willingness to give freely to the king exemplifies a heart of generosity.
