The lengthy period suggests the extensive nature of the task, covering a vast territory. The number nine in biblical numerology often symbolizes divine completeness or finality, while twenty can represent a period of waiting or testing. The census itself was a test of David's reliance on military strength rather than God's provision, which later led to divine judgment.<p><b>having gone through the whole land</b><br>The phrase highlights the comprehensive nature of the census, covering all the tribes of Israel. This reflects the unity and extent of David's kingdom at the time. The land of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, was diverse in geography and culture, encompassing various tribes with distinct identities. The act of counting the people was significant, as it demonstrated the reach of David's rule but also his shift in focus from spiritual dependence to human resources.<p><b>they returned to Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Israel, was where the results of the census were reported. The city held great significance as the location of the Ark of the Covenant and the future site of the Temple. Returning to Jerusalem symbolizes a return to the heart of Israel's worship and governance. This phrase also foreshadows the impending judgment that would come upon the nation due to the census, as Jerusalem would be the focal point of God's dealings with David and his people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who ordered the census of the people, which was against God's will.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of David's army, tasked with carrying out the census despite his reservations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel_and_judah.htm">Israel and Judah</a></b><br>The territories that were counted during the census, representing the united kingdom under David's rule.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city where Joab and his men returned after completing the census.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_census.htm">The Census</a></b><br>An event initiated by David that led to God's displeasure and subsequent judgment on Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>David's decision to conduct a census without God's command highlights the importance of aligning our actions with God's will.

Joab&#8217;s mission came to a definite close, just as &#8220;at the end of the year, at the time when kings go out to war&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>) marked another finished season.<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses similar phrasing to highlight a turning point&#8212;<a href="/numbers/13-25.htm">Numbers 13:25</a>, &#8220;At the end of forty days they returned from spying out the land.&#8221; The census phase is now over; judgment is about to begin (<a href="/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of nine months and twenty days</b><p>&#8226; The Spirit records the exact length, underscoring the literal historicity of the account (cf. <a href="/genesis/7-24.htm">Genesis 7:24</a>, &#8220;The waters prevailed on the earth for 150 days&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Nine months and twenty days shows the task&#8217;s enormity. Israel was extensive; Joab&#8217;s travel mirrored the nationwide sweep God earlier ordered in <a href="/numbers/1-1.htm">Numbers 1:1-46</a>.<p>&#8226; The long delay also magnifies David&#8217;s sin. For nearly ten months the king had time to repent, yet he let the project run its course&#8212;similar to Saul delaying obedience in <a href="/1_samuel/15-13.htm">1 Samuel 15:13-23</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>having gone through the whole land</b><p>&#8226; Joab&#8217;s team did not sample; they canvassed &#8220;the whole land.&#8221; This fulfills David&#8217;s command in <a href="/2_samuel/24-2.htm">2 Samuel 24:2</a>, but contrasts with God&#8217;s prior promise that Israel would be &#8220;as the sand&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>). Counting what God meant to remain immeasurable was a breach of trust.<p>&#8226; Parallels: <a href="/joshua/18-9.htm">Joshua 18:9</a> describes surveyors who &#8220;traced the land and described it in a book.&#8221; Here the description is numbers, not boundaries&#8212;yet both missions emphasize thoroughness.<p>&#8226; The phrase also hints at human pride. <a href="/1_chronicles/21-1.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1-5</a>, the parallel passage, shows Satan inciting the count. Going &#8220;through the whole land&#8221; exposes every tribe to a pride-driven tally rather than to covenant faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they returned to Jerusalem</b><p>&#8226; Jerusalem, David&#8217;s capital (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-9</a>), is where military and administrative reports were presented. Returning here readies the stage for the divine response.<p>&#8226; The city is the center of worship; bringing the census totals there confuses military might with spiritual dependence, something later prophets decry (<a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross reference <a href="/luke/2-41.htm">Luke 2:41</a>&#8212;families went up yearly to Jerusalem. Just as worshipers returned to honor God, Joab returns with numbers that will provoke God, highlighting the tension of the scene.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/24-8.htm">2 Samuel 24:8</a> records the precise completion of Joab&#8217;s nationwide census: after nine months and twenty days of exhaustive travel, the officers came back to Jerusalem. Every phrase underlines the literal, historical scope of the undertaking, the extended opportunity for David to repent, and the comprehensive nature of the people&#8217;s exposure to his prideful command. The verse sets the hinge between human self-reliance and the impending divine judgment that follows.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nine months and twenty days.</span> This long period seems excessive, if nothing more was intended than merely counting the heads of the people, especially as the census was left unfinished. But there might very probably be difficulties with the aliens dwelling in Israel; and it is still more probable that there was a complete examination of all the military resources of the land. The result showed a very different state of things from that described in <a href="/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19-22</a>, and we can well understand the existence of much elation and war lust among the Israelites on the first flush of pride in their new empire. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/24-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At the end</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1510;&#1461;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(miq&#183;&#7779;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
