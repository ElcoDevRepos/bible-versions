Damascus, a significant city in ancient Syria, was a vital trade and military hub. By establishing garrisons, David ensured a continued Israelite presence and influence, preventing rebellion and securing trade routes. This action reflects the broader biblical theme of God's people establishing dominion over the Promised Land and its surrounding territories, as seen in the conquest narratives of Joshua.<p><b>and the Arameans became subject to David</b><br>The subjugation of the Arameans under David's rule highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel victory over its enemies. Historically, the Arameans were a powerful group in the Near East, often in conflict with Israel. Their subjection indicates a significant shift in regional power dynamics, with Israel emerging as a dominant force. This aligns with the covenantal promises made to Abraham about his descendants possessing the gates of their enemies (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>).<p><b>and brought him tribute</b><br>The tribute brought by the Arameans symbolizes their acknowledgment of David's authority and Israel's supremacy. In the ancient Near East, tribute was a common practice, signifying submission and alliance. This act of bringing tribute not only enriched Israel but also reinforced David's status as a powerful and respected king. It echoes the prophetic vision of nations bringing wealth to God's people, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5-6</a>.<p><b>So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine favor and providence that accompanied David's reign. The victories attributed to the LORD's intervention highlight the theological theme of God as the ultimate source of success and protection for Israel. This divine assistance is reminiscent of God's promise to Joshua that He would be with him wherever he went (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>). It also prefigures the ultimate victory of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, who triumphs over sin and death, establishing an eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, anointed by God, who led Israel to military victories and expanded its territory.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aram_of_damascus.htm">Aram of Damascus</a></b><br>A region in modern-day Syria, which was a significant power in the ancient Near East.

Establishing garrisons means he stations Israelite troops there, maintaining a permanent presence and securing the area (cf. 1 Chron 18:6, <a href="/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a>).<p>&#8226; This move protects Israel&#8217;s northern border and the lucrative trade routes that ran through Damascus toward Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean.<p>&#8226; It also fulfills God&#8217;s promise that David would subdue surrounding nations (<a href="/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>). Like earlier victories over the Philistines (<a href="/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17-25</a>), the success here stands as another milestone in consolidating the kingdom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the Arameans became subject to David and brought him tribute</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Subject&#8221; points to political submission; &#8220;tribute&#8221; points to economic submission. The Arameans now pay regular taxes to David&#8212;silver, gold, livestock&#8212;strengthening Israel&#8217;s treasury (<a href="/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7-8</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Their willingness to send tribute without further revolt shows God&#8217;s restraining hand on potential enemies (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/10-19.htm">2 Samuel 10:19</a>).<p>&#8226; This international respect for David&#8217;s throne foreshadows the greater rule of David&#8217;s promised descendant, the Messiah, over all nations (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>; <a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went</b><p>&#8226; The verse pivots from David&#8217;s actions to God&#8217;s agency. Victory is explicitly attributed to &#8220;the LORD,&#8221; highlighting divine sovereignty (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7-8</a>; <a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s success is consistent and comprehensive&#8212;&#8220;wherever he went.&#8221; Whether north to Aram, east to Moab, south to Edom, or west to Philistia, God grants triumph (<a href="/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1-14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The clause also answers the unspoken question: Why does David prosper? Not merely military genius, but covenant faithfulness&#8212;God&#8217;s promise in <a href="/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11-12</a> is already coming to pass.<p>&#8226; The pattern teaches that obedience partnered with divine favor yields lasting success (<a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7-9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David stations troops in Damascus, securing Israel&#8217;s northern frontier; the defeated Arameans submit and enrich Israel with tribute; and every step is underwritten by the LORD&#8217;s unfailing support. The verse captures a theme woven through David&#8217;s life&#8212;and through Scripture: when God&#8217;s chosen king walks in faith, God grants victory, fulfills His promises, and extends blessing beyond Israel to the nations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Garrisons.</span>--The primary meaning of this word in the original is something <span class= "ital">placed, </span>and then <span class= "ital">placed over. </span>Hence it comes to have the different derived meanings of <span class= "ital">officer </span>in <a href="/1_kings/4-5.htm" title="And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend:">1Kings 4:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-19.htm" title="Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.">1Kings 4:19</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/8-10.htm" title="And these were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two hundred and fifty, that bore rule over the people.">2Chronicles 8:10</a>, and <span class= "ital">garrison </span>(<a href="/1_samuel/10-5.htm" title="After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when you are come thither to the city, that you shall meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:">1Samuel 10:5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/13-3.htm" title="And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it.
