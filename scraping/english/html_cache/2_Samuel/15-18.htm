The term "servants" here refers to those who were devoted to David, including his personal bodyguards and military leaders. This loyalty is significant, as it demonstrates the strong bonds David had formed with his men, despite the political turmoil. The act of marching past David symbolizes their readiness to support and protect him, even in times of crisis.<p><b>all the Cherethites and Pelethites</b><br>The Cherethites and Pelethites were elite mercenary groups serving as David's personal bodyguards. They were likely of Philistine origin, which highlights David's ability to form alliances beyond Israel. Their presence underscores David's strategic acumen in surrounding himself with skilled warriors who were loyal to him. This also reflects the diverse nature of David's kingdom, where foreigners played crucial roles in his administration and military.<p><b>and six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath</b><br>The Gittites were Philistines from the city of Gath, one of the five major Philistine cities. The fact that six hundred Gittites followed David from Gath indicates the deep loyalty and respect he commanded, even among former enemies. This group likely joined David during his time of refuge in Philistine territory when he fled from Saul. Their allegiance to David is a testament to his leadership qualities and ability to inspire devotion. This also prefigures the inclusion of Gentiles into the people of God, a theme that finds fulfillment in the New Testament with the spread of the Gospel to all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is fleeing from his son Absalom's rebellion.

And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred stayed by the stuff.">1Samuel 25:13</a>), and at Gath (<a href="/1_samuel/27-3.htm" title="And David dwelled with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.">1Samuel 27:3</a>), "came after him from Gath" to Ziklag, and shared with him in his life and exploits there (<a href="/1_samuel/27-8.htm" title="And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as you go to Shur, even to the land of Egypt.">1Samuel 27:8</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/29-2.htm" title="And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rear guard with Achish.">1Samuel 29:2</a>; <a href="/context/1_samuel/30-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with fire;">1Samuel 30:1-9</a>), and went up with him to Hebron (2 Samuel 23), and thence to Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm" title="And the king and his men went to Jerusalem to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spoke to David, saying, Except you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not come in here: thinking, David cannot come in here.">2Samuel 5:6</a>). They are generally supposed to have afterwards constituted the body of "heroes" or "mighty men," to whom frequent reference is made (<a href="/2_samuel/10-7.htm" title="And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.">2Samuel 10:7</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/16-6.htm" title="And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.">2Samuel 16:6</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/20-7.htm" title="And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.">2Samuel 20:7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/1-8.htm" title="But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.">1Kings 1:8</a>). The Vatican LXX. here, as often, adds considerably to the text. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the Gittites, air hundred men which came after him from Gath.</span> The Septuagint reads "Gibborim," and without doubt these are the persons meant; but while they were styled Gibborim, the "mighties," for honour's sake, because of their prowess, they probably were popularly called David's Gittites, because they were the six hundred men who had formed his little army when he sought refuge with Achish, King of Gath (l <a href="/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-9.htm">1 Samuel 30:9</a>). They were not Philistines, but Israelites of desperate fortune (<a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>); and it is a proof of David's great ability, and of the moral influence of his character, that he was successful, not only in controlling them and maintaining discipline, but also in forming them into as noble a set of heroes as ever existed, and who were faithful to him in all his fortunes. To their number belonged the thirty-seven champions end-merated in ch. 23, and possibly the title "Gibborim" strictly belonged to them only. As they are still called "the six hundred," it is probable that the corps was maintained at this number by new appointments, and that they had special privileges which made their position very desirable. Certainly David would never forget men who had shared all his fortunes, and been so true and so useful to him; and it is evident, from Hushai's counsel (<a href="/2_samuel/17-8.htm">2 Samuel 17:8</a>), that Absalom feared their resolute valour, and hesitated to attack without overwhelming numbers. Thenius compares these veterans to Napoleon's Old Guard. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/15-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
