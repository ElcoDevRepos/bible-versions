The context is the aftermath of Absalom's rebellion, where David is returning to Jerusalem. The men of Israel feel slighted and are seeking an explanation. This reflects the ongoing tension between the northern tribes (Israel) and the southern tribe (Judah), which would later lead to the division of the kingdom after Solomon's reign.<p><b>&#8220;Why did our brothers, the men of Judah,</b><br>The men of Israel refer to the tribe of Judah as "our brothers," highlighting the familial relationship among the tribes of Israel. However, there is an underlying tension and rivalry, as Judah is David's tribe and often receives preferential treatment. This tension foreshadows the eventual split into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah.<p><b>take you away secretly</b><br>The men of Israel accuse the men of Judah of acting secretly, suggesting a lack of transparency and possible favoritism. This accusation points to the political maneuvering and distrust that existed among the tribes. The secrecy implies that the men of Judah acted without consulting the other tribes, which would have been seen as a breach of unity.<p><b>and bring the king and his household across the Jordan,</b><br>The crossing of the Jordan River is significant, as it symbolizes a return to the Promised Land and a restoration of David's kingship. The Jordan River often serves as a boundary and a place of transition in biblical narratives.

As they were discussing the matter, their decision should have been awaited, and David should not have crossed until formally invited so to do. The half of Israel consisted, probably, of the trans-Jordanic tribes, upon whom those on the west of the river looked contemptuously, and of Shimei and his Benjamites, and a few more in the immediate neighbourhood. The trans-Jordanie tribes are probably those described in ver. 39 as "the people who went with David over Jordan;" for certainly a powerful body of the men who had defeated Absalom would escort David back to Jerusalem to overawe the malcontents and prevent any opposition to his return. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/19-41.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Soon</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
