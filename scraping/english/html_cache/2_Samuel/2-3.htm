These men were likely his mighty warriors and those who had been with him during his time fleeing from Saul. This reflects the importance of community and loyalty in biblical narratives.

The verse reassures believers that when God opens the door to new territory, He provides for both leaders and their households, grounding every step in His unbreakable word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</span>--David's whole force of 600 men, with their families, accompanied him, and made their permanent settlement in the towns of the district to which Hebron gave its name<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</span> Not only had David wives, whom he took with him to Hebron, but many of his warriors were married, and thus they and their households formed a numerous body of people, for whom Hebron could scarcely find accommodation. Moreover they had flocks and herds captured from the Amalekites, for which they needed pasturage. And therefore David dispersed them in the towns and villages of which Hebron was the capital, posting them in such a manner as to render it easy for him to summon them together, while taking care that they did not injure his tribesmen, or dispossess them of their lauds. We may feel sure that he consulted the chief men of Hebron as to these arrangements, and obtained their approval. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/2-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">David also</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1462;&#1506;&#1457;&#1500;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#183;&#8216;&#277;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5927.htm">Strong's 5927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ascend, in, actively</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1447;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
