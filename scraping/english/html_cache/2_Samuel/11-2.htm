David, as king, had the luxury of rising from his bed at this time, indicating a period of leisure. The context here is significant because it was during the spring, a time when kings typically went to war (<a href="/2_samuel/11.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>), yet David remained in Jerusalem. This decision marks the beginning of a series of events leading to his moral failure. The evening can symbolize a time of vulnerability, as darkness often represents temptation and sin in biblical literature (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>).<p><b>and strolled around on the roof of the palace.</b><br>The roof of the palace was a place of privacy and vantage, common in ancient Near Eastern architecture. It provided a view over the city, symbolizing David's elevated status and authority. However, this physical elevation also foreshadows his moral descent. The act of strolling suggests idleness, which can lead to temptation, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-27.htm">Proverbs 16:27</a>, where idle hands are described as the devil's workshop. The palace roof, a place of potential reflection and prayer, becomes instead a place of temptation.<p><b>And from the roof he saw a woman bathing</b><br>The act of seeing here is pivotal. In biblical narratives, seeing often precedes desire and sin, as with Eve in <a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a>. The woman bathing indicates a private act, suggesting David's intrusion into a personal space. Bathing was a ritual act of purification, possibly linked to Levitical laws (<a href="/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19-24</a>), highlighting the woman's innocence and the gravity of David's gaze. This moment marks the beginning of David's moral failure, as he allows his gaze to linger, leading to covetousness.<p><b>a very beautiful woman.</b><br>The description of the woman as "very beautiful" emphasizes the temptation David faced. Beauty in the Bible is often noted, as with Sarah (<a href="/genesis/12-11.htm">Genesis 12:11</a>) and Rachel (<a href="/genesis/29-17.htm">Genesis 29:17</a>), and can be both a blessing and a source of temptation. This beauty becomes a test of David's character, revealing his susceptibility to lust. The narrative does not name Bathsheba here, focusing instead on David's perspective and the objectification inherent in his gaze. This sets the stage for the ensuing sin, contrasting with the biblical ideal of inner beauty and godly character (<a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who is at a pivotal moment in his life where he faces temptation and moral failure.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The woman whom David sees bathing.

Scripture records each movement to warn that temptation often enters through ordinary doors. Guard the moments, guard the eyes, guard the heart (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>), for the God who sees evening shadows also empowers faithful living in His light (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-13.htm">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">In an eveningtide.</span>--Late in the afternoon, when David had taken the <span class= "ital">siesta </span>customary in Oriental countries, he rose from his couch and walked on the roof of his palace, which in the cool of the day was the pleasantest part of an eastern house. This palace was on the height of Mount Zion, and looked down upon the open courts of the houses in the lower city. In one of these he saw a beautiful woman bathing. In the courts of the houses it was common to have a basin of water, and the place was probably entirely concealed from every other point of observation than the roof of the palace, from which no harm was suspected.<p>David's grievous fall was consequent upon his long course of uninterrupted prosperity and power, which had somewhat intoxicated him and thrown him off his guard. It is no part of the plan of Scripture to cover up or excuse the sins of even its greatest heroes and saints. This sin was followed by the deepest repentance and by the Divine forgiveness; nevertheless its punishment overclouded all the remaining years of David's life. His fall, as St. Augustine has said, should put upon their guard those who have not fallen, and save from despair those who have.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David arose from off his bed.</span> It was usual in Palestine, and remains so in all hot countries, to take a siesta in the heat of the day (<a href="/2_samuel/4-5.htm">2 Samuel 4:5</a>); and, on awaking, David walked backward and forward on the fiat roof of his house (<a href="/1_samuel/9-25.htm">1 Samuel 9:25</a>), to enjoy the cool breezes of the evening. In so doing he was probably following his usual habits; but temptation came upon him, as so often is the case, unexpectedly. We are told that it is regarded in the East as improper for one neighbour to look over the battlement of his house into the inner court of the next dwelling (Philippson). Considering the jealousy with which Orientals guard the female members of their family from intrusion, it was a wrong act on the king's part to spy into what was going on in the recesses of the adjoining house. But he did so, and suffered for it years of disgrace and misery. For he saw a beautiful woman, the wife of one of his high officers, bathing, probably to purify herself from some legal uncleanness, such as those mentioned in <a href="/leviticus/15.htm">Leviticus 15</a>. No blame, so far, must be attached to her. The place was regarded as perfectly secluded, and probably neither she nor Uriah had ever suspected that what went on there could be observed from the roof of the king's palace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/11-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">One evening</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1462;&#1431;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;e&#183;re&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
