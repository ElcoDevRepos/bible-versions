This situation highlights the tactical difficulties in ancient warfare, where armies often relied on visual assessments of the battlefield. The presence of enemies on multiple fronts suggests a coordinated effort by the Arameans and their allies, the Ammonites, to encircle and overwhelm the Israelites. This scenario is reminiscent of other biblical battles where God's people faced overwhelming odds, such as Gideon's battle against the Midianites (Judges 7).<p><b>he selected some of the best men of Israel</b><br>Joab's choice to select the best men indicates the importance of skilled and valiant warriors in ancient Israelite military strategy. This selection process reflects the need for experienced and courageous soldiers to face formidable opponents. The emphasis on "the best men" parallels the biblical theme of God using a faithful remnant to achieve His purposes, as seen in the stories of David's mighty men (2 Samuel 23) and the selection of the 300 men with Gideon.<p><b>and arrayed them against the Arameans</b><br>The Arameans, a significant power in the region, were often in conflict with Israel. Joab's decision to array his best men against them demonstrates his strategic acumen in prioritizing the most immediate threat. The Arameans' involvement in this conflict underscores the geopolitical tensions of the time, as they were known for their military prowess and alliances with other nations. This confrontation is part of the broader narrative of Israel's struggles with surrounding nations, which often served as a backdrop for God's deliverance and judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, known for his military prowess and strategic mind.

He threw his whole force between their two divisions, organising his own army in two parts, one facing the Ammonites and the other the Syrians, but each capable of supporting the other in case of need. The enemy was thus cut in two, while the Israelites formed one compact body. He himself took command of the wing facing the Syrians with the choice troops of Israel, as having the stronger enemy to meet, while he gave the rest of the forces opposing the Ammonites into the hand of his brother Abishai.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The front of the battle.</span> The object of Joab was to prevent at all hazards the junction of the Syrians with the Ammonites, and he was only just in time to throw himself between them. This was resolute but dangerous policy, as, in case of defeat, he would have a powerful enemy in his rear. Apparently, however, he was aware that his real work lay with the Syrian mercenaries, who were dangerous enough by themselves, and would become more than a match for him if they were reinforced by the men of Rabbah. He therefore leaves Abishai with such troops as he could spare to watch the Ammonites, feeling sure that they would not hazard an attack unless they saw matters going ill with him; and, taking with him all his bravest men, "the choice man of Israel," he prepares with them to give battle to the Syrians. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/10-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Joab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1431;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3097.htm">Strong's 3097: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joab -- 'the LORD is father', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
