In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/6.htm">2 Samuel 6</a>, David had just brought the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, a significant religious and national event. The act of blessing his household reflects the patriarchal role of the head of the family in ancient Israel, responsible for the spiritual well-being of his family. This mirrors the priestly blessing found in <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>, emphasizing the importance of God's presence and favor in the home.<p><b>Saul&#8217;s daughter Michal came out to meet him</b><br>Michal, as Saul's daughter, represents a connection to the previous dynasty. Her actions and words are often seen as a reflection of her loyalty to her father's house rather than to David. This meeting outside the home suggests a confrontation, as it was customary for women to remain inside. Michal's lineage and her relationship with David are complex, marked by political alliances and personal strife, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/18-20.htm">1 Samuel 18:20-29</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/19-11.htm">1 Samuel 19:11-17</a>.<p><b>&#8220;How the king of Israel has distinguished himself today!&#8221; she said</b><br>Michal's words are laden with sarcasm. The term "distinguished" is used ironically, as she criticizes David's behavior during the procession of the Ark. This highlights the tension between royal dignity and religious fervor. The king's role was to uphold the honor of the nation, and Michal's critique suggests that David's actions were unbecoming of a king. This tension between royal protocol and spiritual expression is a recurring theme in the narratives of Israel's monarchy.<p><b>&#8220;He has uncovered himself today in the sight of the maidservants of his subjects&#8221;</b><br>Michal accuses David of exposing himself, which can be understood both literally and figuratively. The literal interpretation suggests a breach of decorum, while the figurative interpretation points to a loss of royal dignity. The mention of "maidservants" emphasizes the perceived inappropriateness of David's actions, as it was considered shameful for a king to appear undignified before the lower classes. This incident contrasts with the humility and vulnerability that David often displayed before God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>.<p><b>like a vulgar person would do&#8221;</b><br>The term "vulgar" implies a lack of refinement or propriety, often associated with commoners or those outside the covenant community. Michal's comparison of David to a "vulgar person" underscores her disdain for his behavior, which she views as unbecoming of a king. This critique highlights the cultural expectations of kingship in ancient Israel, where the king was expected to embody the nation's ideals and maintain a certain level of decorum. David's actions, however, reflect a different understanding of kingship, one that prioritizes devotion to God over societal norms. This foreshadows the New Testament portrayal of Jesus, who often challenged social conventions in favor of spiritual truths.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his heart for God and his leadership.

The Levites were to occupy a humble social position (see <a href="/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>), and Michal's words are a proof that such was in David's time the case. The language of Michal is that of a woman vexed and irritated. After reminding David of his high office as "King of Israel," she reproaches him for appearing on a grand public occasion without the upper and becoming robe in which an Oriental enwraps himself. And this he had done before the female slaves of his own servants, with no more self-respect than that shown by the "vain fellows." "Vain" is the "raca" of <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>, and means "empty," void of virtue, void of reputation, and void of worldly means. The Hebrews, when expressing the greatest possible contempt for a man, called him an "empty," and no word could be found better conveying the meaning of thorough worthlessness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/6-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As soon as David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">returned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
