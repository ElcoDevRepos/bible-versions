The mention of "wheat" suggests a pretense of engaging in a common, everyday activity, which would not arouse suspicion. In ancient Israel, wheat was a staple crop, and its storage and distribution were routine tasks. The act of entering under false pretenses highlights the theme of betrayal, reminiscent of Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus with a kiss (<a href="/matthew/26-48.htm">Matthew 26:48-49</a>). The setting within the house indicates a breach of hospitality and trust, a serious offense in the cultural context of the time.<p><b>and they stabbed him in the stomach</b><br>The violent act of stabbing in the stomach is significant, as it was a method intended to ensure death. This brutal act reflects the treachery and the lengths to which Rechab and Baanah were willing to go to secure their own political advantage. The stomach, being a vulnerable part of the body, symbolizes the vulnerability of Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, who was the victim. This act of murder is a stark contrast to David's respect for Saul's family, as seen in his lament for Saul and Jonathan (<a href="/2_samuel/1-17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17-27</a>).<p><b>Then Rechab and his brother Baanah slipped away</b><br>The escape of Rechab and Baanah after committing the murder indicates their awareness of the gravity of their crime and their desire to avoid immediate retribution. Their actions can be compared to Cain's after he killed Abel, as both involve fratricide and a subsequent attempt to evade justice (<a href="/genesis/4-8.htm">Genesis 4:8-9</a>). The brothers' flight underscores the theme of human sinfulness and the consequences of seeking power through unrighteous means. Their actions ultimately lead to their downfall, as David, unlike them, seeks to establish his kingdom through righteousness and justice, foreshadowing the just reign of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rechab_and_baanah.htm">Rechab and Baanah</a></b><br>These two brothers were captains of raiding bands under Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul.

The LXX. has here a curious addition: "And, behold, the portress of the house was cleansing wheat, and she slumbered and slept, and the brothers slipt through." On "the fifth rib"= abdomen, see Note on <a href="/2_samuel/2-23.htm" title="However, he refused to turn aside: why Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.">2Samuel 2:23</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As though they would have fetched wheat.</span> Not only is the narrative confused, but the versions offer extraordinary varieties of reading. The murder of Ishbosheth is fully described in ver. 7, and is there in its place, while it is out of place in ver. 6. And that the captains would themselves fetch wheat, instead of having it carried from the granary by their men; and that they would go through the king's chamber to obtain it; are both improbable. The very act of going to get wheat at midday, when everybody was having his siesta, would itself be suspicious. The Syriac says nothing about wheat, but that these "wicked men took and smote him." The Vulgate and LXX. lay the blame on the woman who kept the door, the narrative of the latter being as follows: "They entered into the house of Ishbosheth in the heat of the day, and he was asleep in his midday chamber And behold, the woman that kept the door of the house had been winnowing wheat, and she slumbered and slept. And the brothers Rechab and Baanah entered the house without being noticed, and Ishbosheth was asleep on his bed in his chamber, and they smote him," etc. There is, confessedly, considerable confusion in the text, but the versions do not altogether clear it up; and until we have better materials for forming a judgment, we must be content to wait. In ver. 5, instead of "who lay on a bed at noon," the Hebrew has "as he was taking his noonday rest." In ver. 7 the <span class="accented">bed</span> is the divan, or raised bank, which in an Oriental house runs along the wall, and is supplied with pieces of carpet, or cushions, on which to sit cross legged or recline. For sleep, the corners were the favourite places. Even the public rooms had these divans. But Ishbosheth had probably retired for his siesta into a private chamber, where the captains knew that he would be alone. The plain through which they fled was the Arabah, or Jordan valley, as in <a href="/2_samuel/2-29.htm">2 Samuel 2:29</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/4-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They entered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1436;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the interior</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1444;&#1493;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;w&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8432.htm">Strong's 8432: </a> </span><span class="str2">A bisection, the centre</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the house</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1433;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hab&#183;ba&#183;yi&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
