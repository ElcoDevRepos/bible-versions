The Benjamites were the tribe of Saul, Israel's first king, and thus had a vested interest in the leadership of the nation. Abner's communication with them indicates his strategic efforts to consolidate support for David, who was from the tribe of Judah. This move was significant because it showed Abner's shift in allegiance from the house of Saul to David, which was crucial for David's eventual kingship over all Israel. The Benjamites' acceptance of David's rule would have been pivotal, given their loyalty to Saul.<p><b>Then he went to Hebron to tell David</b><br>Hebron was an important city in Judah and served as David's capital during his reign over Judah before he became king over all Israel. It was a city of refuge and had historical significance as the place where Abraham settled. Abner's journey to Hebron signifies a formal and public acknowledgment of David's leadership. This act of going to David in Hebron also symbolizes a transfer of power and a unification effort, as Hebron was a central location for the tribes of Israel.<p><b>all that seemed good to Israel</b><br>This phrase suggests that Abner was acting in the interest of national unity and peace. The term "Israel" here refers to the northern tribes, which had been under the rule of Ish-bosheth, Saul's son. Abner's actions were aimed at bringing these tribes under David's rule, which was seen as beneficial for the nation. This aligns with God's promise to David that he would be king over all Israel, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a> when Samuel anointed David.<p><b>and to the whole house of Benjamin.</b><br>The inclusion of the house of Benjamin highlights the importance of gaining the support of Saul's own tribe. This was a significant political move, as it demonstrated that even Saul's closest kin were willing to accept David as king. The house of Benjamin's support would have been crucial in legitimizing David's rule and ensuring a smooth transition of power. This also reflects the broader theme of reconciliation and unity among the tribes of Israel, which was a key aspect of David's reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abner.htm">Abner</a></b><br>The commander of Saul's army, who played a pivotal role in the power dynamics of Israel after Saul's death.
