Joab, a military commander and close advisor to David, had previously facilitated Absalom's return to Jerusalem. This request indicates Absalom's desire to restore his standing in the royal court. Joab's role as a mediator highlights the political complexities within David's kingdom, where personal relationships often intersect with matters of state. The use of intermediaries in royal communication was common in ancient Near Eastern cultures, reflecting the hierarchical nature of the society.<p><b>but Joab refused to come to him</b><br>Joab's refusal to respond to Absalom's summons suggests a shift in his political calculations or personal motivations. This could indicate Joab's awareness of the potential risks involved in further aligning with Absalom, whose ambitions and actions might threaten the stability of David's reign. Joab's decision not to engage with Absalom at this point may reflect his loyalty to David or a strategic move to distance himself from Absalom's controversial actions. This refusal also underscores the tension and mistrust that can exist even among close allies within a royal court.<p><b>So Absalom sent a second time</b><br>Absalom's persistence in reaching out to Joab demonstrates his determination to achieve his goals, despite initial setbacks. This persistence is characteristic of Absalom's ambitious and assertive nature, which is evident throughout his narrative in 2 Samuel. His repeated attempts to engage Joab highlight the importance of Joab's support for his plans, as Joab holds significant influence in David's administration. This action also reflects the cultural norm of persistence in negotiations and the importance of securing influential allies in ancient political contexts.<p><b>but Joab still would not come</b><br>Joab's continued refusal to meet with Absalom emphasizes the gravity of the situation and the potential consequences of aligning with Absalom. This persistent refusal may indicate Joab's internal conflict or a strategic decision to avoid involvement in a potentially destabilizing power struggle. Joab's actions can be seen as a reflection of the broader theme of loyalty and betrayal that runs throughout the narrative of David's reign. This tension foreshadows the eventual conflict between Absalom and David, highlighting the fragile nature of political alliances and the personal ambitions that can drive them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his handsome appearance and rebellious nature.

Needing a mediator, he naturally turns to Joab, the commander who once engineered his return (<a href="/2_samuel/14-1.htm">2 Samuel 14:1&#8211;3, 21</a>).<p>- The request signals Absalom&#8217;s desire for full restoration to royal favor, following the biblical pattern of approaching a sovereign through an intermediary (<a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14</a>; <a href="/esther/5-2.htm">Esther 5:2</a>).<p>- Spiritually, it reminds us that reconciliation with a king&#8212;whether David or the King of kings&#8212;requires an appointed go-between (1 <a href="/titus/2-5.htm">Titus 2:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but Joab refused to come to him</b><p>- Joab&#8217;s silence may reflect political caution. Helping Absalom the first time pleased David, but pressing now could seem self-serving or disloyal (<a href="/2_samuel/14-20.htm">2 Samuel 14:20-22</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/18-5.htm">2 Samuel 18:5</a>,12).<p>- Joab&#8217;s refusal exposes the limits of human help; even a powerful ally can disappoint (<a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a>).<p>- The scene underlines personal responsibility: Absalom must face David himself, just as each sinner must ultimately stand before God (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So Absalom sent a second time</b><p>- Absalom&#8217;s persistence shows determination, yet also impatience. Scripture often praises godly perseverance (<a href="/luke/11-9.htm">Luke 11:9-10</a>), but here the motive is self-promotion rather than repentance.<p>- His repeated summons hints at growing frustration that will soon erupt in destructive action (<a href="/2_samuel/14-30.htm">2 Samuel 14:30</a>).<p>- The episode cautions that persistence without humility breeds manipulation (<a href="/james/4-3.htm">James 4:3</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but Joab still would not come</b><p>- The double refusal forces Absalom to expose his true character. Instead of waiting on God or approaching David humbly, he will set Joab&#8217;s field on fire (<a href="/2_samuel/14-30.htm">2 Samuel 14:30</a>), revealing a heart willing to harm to get its way (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>).<p>- Joab&#8217;s continued absence also heightens the contrast between human gates that close and God&#8217;s gate that remains open to genuine contrition (<a href="/john/6-37.htm">John 6:37</a>; <a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6-7</a>).<p>- The stalemate spotlights the relational fallout of unresolved sin dating back to Absalom&#8217;s murder of Amnon (<a href="/2_samuel/13-28.htm">2 Samuel 13:28-32</a>). Sin tolerated always complicates future fellowship (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Absalom&#8217;s repeated but fruitless summons of Joab reveals an impatient heart looking for human leverage rather than humble repentance. Joab&#8217;s refusal exposes the frailty of earthly intermediaries and sets the stage for Absalom&#8217;s manipulative escalation. The verse challenges readers to seek reconciliation God&#8217;s way&#8212;through sincere confession and the appointed Mediator&#8212;rather than relying on scheming, force, or human favor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">He would not come.</span>--Joab felt that he had already gone far enough in procuring Absalom's return, and, as he still continued under the displeasure of the king, he was not disposed to do anything more.
