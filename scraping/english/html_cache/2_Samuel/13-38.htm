This act of vengeance reflects the deep-seated familial and moral conflicts within David's household. The flight signifies Absalom's awareness of the gravity of his crime and the potential repercussions from King David, his father. This event is a turning point in Absalom's life, setting the stage for his eventual rebellion against David.<p><b>and gone to Geshur</b><br>Geshur was a small Aramean kingdom located northeast of the Sea of Galilee. Absalom's maternal grandfather, Talmai, was the king of Geshur, providing Absalom a place of refuge. This connection highlights the political alliances through marriage that were common in ancient times. Geshur's location outside of Israel's immediate control offered Absalom a safe haven from David's reach, illustrating the geopolitical dynamics of the region.<p><b>he stayed there three years</b><br>The three-year period of Absalom's stay in Geshur indicates a significant time of separation from his family and the kingdom of Israel. This duration allowed tensions to cool and for David's grief over Amnon's death to be tempered by his longing for Absalom. The number three often symbolizes completeness or a period of testing in biblical literature, suggesting that this time was necessary for the unfolding of God's plan for David's family. This period also foreshadows Absalom's eventual return and the subsequent events that would lead to his rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his handsome appearance and later rebellion against his father.
