This mountain is situated in the northern part of Israel, near the Jezreel Valley. The mention of Mount Gilboa sets the scene for the tragic end of Saul's reign. The Amalekite's presence on the mountain is suspicious, as it was a battlefield, and his claim of being there "by chance" raises questions about his motives and truthfulness. This location is also referenced in <a href="/1_samuel/31.htm">1 Samuel 31</a>, where the battle's outcome is detailed.<p><b>&#8220;and there was Saul, leaning on his spear&#8221;</b><br>Saul leaning on his spear symbolizes his vulnerability and desperation in his final moments. The spear, often a symbol of Saul's military power and authority, now becomes a crutch, indicating his weakened state. This imagery contrasts with Saul's earlier reign when he was a formidable warrior. The spear also connects to earlier narratives, such as when Saul attempted to kill David with a spear (<a href="/1_samuel/18-10.htm">1 Samuel 18:10-11</a>), highlighting the tragic irony of his end. Saul's reliance on his spear in his last moments underscores his isolation and the collapse of his kingship.<p><b>&#8220;with the chariots and the cavalry closing in on him.&#8221;</b><br>The mention of chariots and cavalry indicates the Philistines' military superiority. Chariots were a significant advantage in ancient warfare, often used by the Philistines, as seen in <a href="/judges/1-19.htm">Judges 1:19</a>. The Israelites, lacking such technology, were at a disadvantage. This detail emphasizes the dire situation Saul faced, surrounded by a powerful enemy. The closing in of the Philistine forces signifies the inevitable defeat and the fulfillment of Samuel's prophecy in <a href="/1_samuel/28-19.htm">1 Samuel 28:19</a>, where he foretold that Saul and his sons would fall to the Philistines.

Scripture truthfully records the report while earlier passages reveal the actual sequence of Saul&#8217;s death. Together they teach that God&#8217;s Word is meticulous, human schemes are transparent before Him, and disobedience leads inevitably to downfall while His sovereignty stands sure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Upon mount Gilboa.</span>--The battle appears to have been joined in the plain of Jezreel, but when the Israelites were routed they naturally fled up the mountain range of Gilboa, though apparently much scattered. It was in this straggling flight that the Amalekite happened upon that part of the mountain where Saul was. The true account of the death of Saul is given in <a href="/context/1_samuel/31-3.htm" title="And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.">1Samuel 31:3-6</a>. (See Note on <a href="/2_samuel/1-10.htm" title="So I stood on him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.">2Samuel 1:10</a>.) It is uncertain whether the man saw Saul at all before his death, and it is extremely unlikely that he found him without warriors or armour-bearer, wounded and alone.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As I happened by chance upon</span> <span class="cmt_word">Mount Gilboa.</span> The story of the Amalekite is at variance with the account of Saul's death given in the last chapter of the preceding book. There, sore pressed and wounded by archers, hopeless of escape, and unable to make any further resistance, in sore distress at the death of his sons and the loss of the battle, Saul and his armour bearer fall upon their own swords. Here, closely pursued by chariots and horsemen, the king is so utterly deserted by all his body guard that he cells to a vagabond prowling about for booty to slay him. Naturally, Ewald and his followers, who regard the books of the Bible as mere patchwork, find here the marks of different narrators, whose stories the compiler of the Book of Samuel pieced together without having the shrewdness to observe that they were utterly irreconcilable. Some modern commentators have, however, attempted to harmonize them with little success. Really, the story of the Amalekite is a most improbable fiction, and utterly untrue. He knew nothing as to the manner of Saul's death, but found the body, probably some time after the king had fallen; and he was able to strip it because the pursuing Philistines were hurrying forward to make their victory complete, without being aware of what was the crowning glory of their success. As the pursuit advanced it would soon become safe for the Amalekite and others like him to try and secure some of the booty before the Philistines returned. Archers shooting from a distance might easily so distress Saul as to make him despair of escape - and it appears from the first narrative that they had not recognized him; for Saul is afraid lest they should do so, and, having taken him alive, should "abuse," or make a mock of him. Here chariots and horsemen are in close pursuit, and the king faces them grimly; nevertheless, they allow a stranger, who would not have dared to mix himself up with the battle, to rob them of their prize. We may feel sure that it was not until the tide of battle had moved onward in pursuit that the Amalekite ventured upon the field to rob the dead. When so occupied he came upon a corpse, now for some brief space dead, and at once recognized the tall form of the king, whose identity was made more plain by the golden circlet upon his helmet. At Once he saw the chance of larger gains, and hastily tearing off the royal crown and the bracelet from the fallen monarch, without a thought of rescuing the remains from the indignities which the Philistines were sure to inflict upon them, he hurried away with his tidings. Of course, he knew nothing of David's recent conduct, nor that for some time he had accompanied the invading army, nor that Ziklag had just experienced rough treatment from his own countrymen. Still, if he had told the truth, he would have fared well; for he brought news of great importance.
