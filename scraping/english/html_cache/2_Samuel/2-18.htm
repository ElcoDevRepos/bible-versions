Joab, Abishai, and Asahel were prominent figures in David's military. Joab, the eldest, became the commander of David's army and played a crucial role in many of David's military campaigns. Abishai was known for his bravery and loyalty, often accompanying David in dangerous situations. Asahel, the youngest, was noted for his speed and agility. The mention of these three brothers highlights their importance in the narrative of David's rise to power and the internal conflicts within Israel. Their familial connection to David also underscores the complex dynamics of loyalty and rivalry in the royal court.<p><b>Now Asahel was fleet of foot like a wild gazelle,</b><br>Asahel's swiftness is emphasized here, likening him to a wild gazelle, an animal known for its speed and agility. This comparison not only highlights Asahel's physical prowess but also sets the stage for the events that follow, where his speed becomes a critical factor in the narrative. In the ancient Near Eastern context, such attributes were highly valued in warriors, as speed could determine the outcome of battles. Asahel's fleetness is a key element in the ensuing chase with Abner, Saul's former commander, which ultimately leads to Asahel's death. This phrase also foreshadows the tragic consequences of Asahel's pursuit, illustrating the themes of ambition and the cost of war.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zeruiah.htm">Zeruiah</a></b><br>The mother of Joab, Abishai, and Asahel.

This verse quietly affirms that truth by naming the whole trio together.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joab, Abishai, and Asahel</b><p>&#8226; Joab&#8212;tactical, relentless, later commander of David&#8217;s army (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>; 20:10).<p>&#8226; Abishai&#8212;fearless, once volunteered to strike Saul but held back at David&#8217;s word (<a href="/1_samuel/26-6.htm">1 Samuel 26:6&#8211;9</a>); later rescued David from a giant (<a href="/2_samuel/21-16.htm">2 Samuel 21:16&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; Asahel&#8212;youngest, highlighted here for speed but also bravery; pursued Abner to the point of death (<a href="/2_samuel/2-19.htm">2 Samuel 2:19&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; Together they model varied gifts in one family, echoing Paul&#8217;s picture of diverse yet coordinated body parts in Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18&#8211;21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Now Asahel</b><p>&#8226; The narrative spotlight shifts to the youngest brother. Scripture often singles out the seemingly lesser for pivotal roles&#8212;David the shepherd (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11&#8211;13</a>), Gideon the least in his family (<a href="/judges/6-15.htm">Judges 6:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Asahel&#8217;s introduction prepares the reader for the swift chase that follows, illustrating how one personal trait can become central to God&#8217;s unfolding story (<a href="/2_samuel/2-19.htm">2 Samuel 2:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was fleet of foot</b><p>&#8226; Physical excellence is presented as a God-given asset, not a mere footnote. David sang, &#8220;He makes my feet like those of a deer&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-33.htm">Psalm 18:33</a>), and the Benjamite warriors were &#8220;swift as gazelles on the mountains&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Such speed could turn the tide in ancient combat&#8212;scouts, messengers, and pursuers needed it. By recording this detail, Scripture attests to both the literal event and the broader principle that God equips His servants uniquely for their assignments.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>like a wild gazelle</b><p>&#8226; The simile stresses natural, untamed agility. Song of Solomon uses the same imagery for grace and quickness (Songs 2:9); Habakkuk borrows it to depict sure-footed confidence on high places (<a href="/habakkuk/3-19.htm">Habakkuk 3:19</a>).<p>&#8226; A &#8220;wild gazelle&#8221; outpaces domestic beasts; similarly, Asahel&#8217;s speed surpassed ordinary human ability, setting up the dramatic tension of verses 19&#8211;23.<p>&#8226; The comparison also hints at vulnerability; a gazelle&#8217;s swiftness is often its sole defense, foreshadowing that Asahel&#8217;s very strength would carry him into mortal danger.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18</a> records more than a roster; it reveals how God strategically places gifted, loyal individuals&#8212;often from the same household&#8212;into decisive moments of His redemptive plan. By naming Joab, Abishai, and Asahel together, the text underscores family unity in service. By spotlighting Asahel&#8217;s extraordinary speed with the vivid image of a wild gazelle, it affirms both the literal history of the event and the broader truth that every God-given talent has purpose and consequence within His unfolding story.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/2-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The three</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7969.htm">Strong's 7969: </a> </span><span class="str2">Three, third, thrice</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Zeruiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1497;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#601;&#183;r&#363;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6870.htm">Strong's 6870: </a> </span><span class="str2">Zeruiah -- an Israelite woman</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yih&#183;y&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
