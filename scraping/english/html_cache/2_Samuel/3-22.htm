Joab, David's nephew and commander of his army, is a key figure in David's military campaigns. The mention of a raid and great plunder indicates the ongoing conflicts during this period, as David consolidates his power over Israel. The acquisition of plunder was a common practice in ancient warfare, serving as both a reward for the soldiers and a means to support the kingdom's economy. This reflects the turbulent times and the necessity for David to establish his rule through military strength.<p><b>But Abner was not with David in Hebron,</b><br>Abner, the son of Ner, was the commander of Saul's army and a significant political and military leader in Israel. His absence from Hebron, where David had established his capital, is crucial. Hebron, located in the Judean hills, was an important city both historically and spiritually, serving as David's base before he captured Jerusalem. Abner's absence suggests a moment of political tension and transition, as he had recently pledged allegiance to David, shifting the balance of power in Israel.<p><b>because David had sent him on his way in peace.</b><br>This phrase underscores David's diplomatic approach and his desire to unify the kingdom without unnecessary bloodshed. By sending Abner away in peace, David demonstrates his willingness to reconcile and integrate former adversaries into his administration. This act of sending Abner in peace is significant, as it reflects David's strategic and merciful leadership style, which is often seen as a foreshadowing of the peace and reconciliation brought by Jesus Christ. David's actions here are in line with his broader efforts to establish a united Israel under his rule, fulfilling God's promise to him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who is in the process of consolidating his rule over all Israel.

The Revised Version is right in rendering "came from a foray," <span class="accented">the troop</span> being a company of men sent out on a predatory excursion. It is not unlikely that David had arranged this expedition in order that his interview with Abner might take place in Joab's absence; and as he returned with "great spoil," he had probably been away for some nine or ten days, during which he had penetrated far into the country of the Amalekites. Had David acted frankly and honourably, Joab would not have stood in the way of his master's exaltation, and the blood feud between him and Abner might have been arranged. But it is evident that David secretly disliked and chafed under the control of his strong-willed and too-able nephew. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/3-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Just then</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
