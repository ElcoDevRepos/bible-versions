Jonathan, the son of King Saul, was not only a close friend to David but also a covenant brother (<a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>). Their relationship was marked by loyalty and mutual respect, transcending the political tensions between David and Saul. The term "brother" signifies a bond that goes beyond friendship, indicating a spiritual kinship. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, mourning for a fallen comrade was a profound expression of loss, often accompanied by public lamentation and personal reflection (<a href="/2_samuel/1-17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17-27</a>).<p><b>You were delightful to me;</b><br>Jonathan's character and actions brought joy and comfort to David. The Hebrew word used here conveys a sense of pleasure and delight, highlighting the positive impact Jonathan had on David's life. Jonathan's support and encouragement were crucial during David's years of fleeing from Saul. This phrase underscores the depth of their friendship, which was rooted in shared values and mutual support (<a href="/1_samuel/23-16.htm">1 Samuel 23:16-18</a>).<p><b>your love to me was extraordinary,</b><br>The love between David and Jonathan is described as "extraordinary," indicating a unique and profound connection. This love was based on a covenantal relationship, characterized by loyalty, sacrifice, and selflessness. Jonathan's willingness to protect David, even at the cost of his own future as heir to the throne, exemplifies this extraordinary love (<a href="/1_samuel/20-17.htm">1 Samuel 20:17</a>). Their relationship serves as a model of true friendship and commitment.<p><b>surpassing the love of women.</b><br>This phrase highlights the depth and intensity of David and Jonathan's bond, which David found to be greater than romantic or marital love. In the cultural context, marriage was often arranged for political or familial alliances, whereas the friendship between David and Jonathan was based on genuine affection and shared faith. This comparison is not meant to diminish the value of marital love but to emphasize the unique and profound nature of their friendship. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of the selfless love Christ has for His followers, which surpasses all human understanding (<a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by God, who deeply mourns the loss of his friend Jonathan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul, known for his deep friendship and covenant with David, and his loyalty to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel and father of Jonathan, who dies in battle, leading to David's lament.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation over which Saul reigned and David would eventually become king.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_gilboa.htm">Mount Gilboa</a></b><br>The location where Saul and Jonathan were killed in battle against the Philistines.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_godly_friendships.htm">The Value of Godly Friendships</a></b><br>Godly friendships, like that of David and Jonathan, are characterized by loyalty, love, and mutual respect.

It was such an affection as could only exist between noble natures and those united in the fear of God. In these last verses of the elegy which relate to Jonathan alone, David has given expression to his own personal sorrow.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy love to me was wonderful.</span> Never was there a purer friendship than that of Jonathan for David. It began just after the combat with Goliath, when the young prince, instead of seeing in David a rival, who had equalled his own feat of valour, took him to his heart, put upon him his own robe and armour, and thus presented him to the army as his friend and brother. Nor did his father's hatred of David, nor the knowledge that David was to inherit the kingdom, interfere with his love. He remained a dutiful son to his father, and accepted his inferior position with magnanimity, without once seeing in David cause for blame; and it surpassed the love of women, because, to requite their devotion, they look for protection and homage, the more delightful because it is paid by the strong to the weak. But here the lives of the two friends could not combine in one happy fusion of mutual union. Their hearts were bound together, but a hard fate, of which they were fully aware, made the ruin of the one the certain result of the happiness of the other. Nevertheless, Jonathan, with everything to lose, and David with everything to gain, remained true and loyal friends. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/1-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I grieve</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6887.htm">Strong's 6887: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bind, tie up, be restricted, narrow, scant, or cramped</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1462;&#1431;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;le&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
