This method of transport was similar to how the Philistines returned the Ark to Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/6-7.htm">1 Samuel 6:7-8</a>), indicating a possible influence of foreign practices. The Ark symbolized God's presence and required reverence and obedience to His commands, highlighting the importance of following divine instructions precisely.<p><b>and brought it from the house of Abinadab,</b><br>The Ark had been in the house of Abinadab for about 20 years after being returned by the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/7.htm">1 Samuel 7:1-2</a>). Abinadab's house was located in Kiriath-jearim, a town in the territory of Judah. This period of the Ark's stay in Abinadab's house was marked by a lack of centralized worship in Israel, as the Ark was not in the Tabernacle. The movement of the Ark signifies a shift towards re-establishing proper worship under King David's leadership.<p><b>which was on the hill.</b><br>The mention of the hill indicates a geographical feature that may have been significant for the placement of the Ark, possibly for protection or prominence. Hills were often sites of worship in ancient cultures, and the elevated position could symbolize the exaltation of God's presence. This location also provided a strategic vantage point, which was common for settlements and places of significance in ancient Israel.<p><b>Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab,</b><br>Uzzah and Ahio, as sons of Abinadab, were likely Levites, given their role in handling the Ark. Their involvement in guiding the Ark suggests a familial responsibility for its care during its stay in their father's house. The narrative later highlights the consequences of improper handling of the Ark, as seen in Uzzah's fate (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>), underscoring the holiness of God and the need for reverence.<p><b>were guiding the new cart,</b><br>The act of guiding the cart indicates a role of responsibility and leadership in the transportation of the Ark. This task required careful attention, as the Ark was the most sacred object in Israel. The choice of a new cart and the guidance by Uzzah and Ahio reflect a well-intentioned but ultimately flawed approach to moving the Ark, emphasizing the importance of adhering to God's specific instructions for worship and service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_god.htm">The Ark of God</a></b><br>The sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence and covenant with Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abinadab.htm">Abinadab</a></b><br>A man in whose house the Ark had been kept for many years after being returned by the Philistines.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/uzzah_and_ahio.htm">Uzzah and Ahio</a></b><br>Sons of Abinadab, tasked with guiding the cart carrying the Ark.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_new_cart.htm">The New Cart</a></b><br>A cart specifically made to transport the Ark, which was contrary to the prescribed method of carrying it on the shoulders of the Levites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hill.htm">The Hill</a></b><br>The location of Abinadab's house, indicating the Ark's elevated position before being moved.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_instructions.htm">Reverence for God's Instructions</a></b><br>God's commands are to be followed precisely, especially concerning holy matters.

The verse calls believers to pursue zeal and obedience together, carrying out God&#8217;s work in God&#8217;s way so that His holiness is honored and His blessing enjoyed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Upon a new cart.</span>--The <span class= "ital">new </span>cart, one which had been used for no other purpose, was doubtless intended as a mark of respect (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/6-7.htm" title="Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milk cows, on which there has come no yoke, and tie the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them:">1Samuel 6:7</a>); yet it was a violation of the law (<a href="/numbers/7-9.htm" title="But to the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of the sanctuary belonging to them was that they should bear on their shoulders.">Numbers 7:9</a>), requiring that the ark should be <span class= "ital">borne </span>by the Levites.

Abinadab himself may have been long since dead, and Uzzah and Ahio may have been either his sons, now advanced in life, or his grandsons.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they set the ark of God</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">made it ride</span>) <span class="cmt_word">upon a new cart.</span> This was contrary to the Levitical Law, which required that only Levites should bear the ark, and that it should be veiled even from their eyes (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). But this mistake is not surprising. It is easy enough for us to turn to our Bibles, and see what the exact letter of a command was. But such reference was no easy matter when the Law was contained in manuscripts which were rare and costly. We cannot imagine that David or even Abiathar carried a manuscript about with them in their wanderings. David very probably had a considerable knowledge of the Pentateuch, gained in Samuel's schools, and stored up in his memory, as was the custom in old days when books were scarce. But this knowledge would be chiefly of its narratives and doctrines, and would comprise such portions as Samuel thought most fitting to influence the lives of his scholars. Abiathar probably added to this a knowledge of all such ritual as was in daily use in the sanctuary at Nob. He had fled thence in terror, escaping alone from the cruel destruction of the priests by Saul's decree; but even there the restoration of the Levitical services had been too recent to have given time for much study of the old Law. We can quite believe that the murder of the priests at Nob, following upon the catastrophe at Shiloh, had reduced the knowledge of the priests to a very low ebb. Now, the exact way of bearing the ark was a matter that had long been dismissed from their memories, but they would call to mind that it had been brought to Abinadab's house in a new cart drawn by oxen; and they would take this as a precedent, which would justify them in acting in the same manner a second time. But in so solemn a matter the priests ought to have made diligent search, and have gone for instruction to the copies which they possessed of the Divine Law. David did so subsequently (<a href="/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2</a>), but possibly there was no such copy at present in Jerusalem, and they would have to go to Ramah, where Samuel would deposit whatever records he had saved from the ruin of Shiloh, and where the great work of the prophets was to study the sacred books, and even copy them. But this want of inquiry and easy assumption, that as the ark was brought in a cart to Abinadab's house, so in a cart it should be carried away, was an act of great irreverence, and all the guilty were punished. The heaviest blow fell on the house of Abinadab, which lost a dear son. Entrusted for seventy years with the care of so sacred a symbol of Jehovah's presence, Abinadab and his family ought to have made a special study of the taws concerning it. Apparently they left it very much to itself; for it is never said that God blessed them for their care of it as he did Obed-Edom. And David also was in fault; for he ought to have commanded the priests to make diligent search. His punishment was the breaking out of the Divine wrath, terrifying the people, and turning the joy of the day to mourning. <span class="cmt_word">The house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah;</span> really, <span class="accented">that was upon the hill. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Uzzah and Able, the sons of Abinadab.</span> "Sons" in Hebrew is used in a large sense, and these two men were probably the grandsons of Eleazar, the son of Abinadab, who had been set apart to keep the ark. For seventy years, as it seems, lind passed since the ark was hurriedly put in Abinadab's house, namely, twenty during the Philistine supremacy up to the battle of Ebenezer, forty during the reign of Saul, and about ten since. As Eleazar must have been thirty years of age for his consecration to be legal, he must have died long ago, and his sons would be old and decrepit men. His grandsons would be in the prime of life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/6-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They set</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1436;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yar&#183;ki&#183;&#7687;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
