Mahanaim, located east of the Jordan River in the territory of Gilead, was a fortified city with historical significance. It was previously a refuge for Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, during his claim to the throne (<a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8-9</a>). The city's name means "two camps," possibly referring to its strategic position or its role as a place of refuge. David's choice of Mahanaim reflects his tactical acumen, seeking a defensible position and support from loyalists in the region. This move also underscores the gravity of Absalom's threat, as David had to leave Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Israel.<p><b>and Absalom crossed the Jordan</b><br>Absalom's crossing of the Jordan River signifies his aggressive pursuit of David and his claim to the throne. The Jordan River often represents a boundary or transition in biblical narratives, such as the Israelites entering the Promised Land (Joshua 3). Absalom's crossing indicates a decisive step in his rebellion, as he moves from consolidating power in Jerusalem to actively seeking to confront and overthrow David. This act also symbolizes a breach of familial and covenantal loyalty, as Absalom, David's son, seeks to usurp his father's God-given kingship.<p><b>with all the men of Israel</b><br>The phrase "all the men of Israel" highlights the widespread support Absalom garnered for his rebellion. This support reflects Absalom's charisma and political maneuvering, as he had previously won the hearts of the people through calculated acts of public relations (<a href="/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15:1-6</a>). The mention of "all the men of Israel" also underscores the national scope of the conflict, indicating that the division was not merely a family dispute but a civil war affecting the entire nation. This widespread support for Absalom contrasts with the remnant of loyal followers who remained with David, emphasizing the king's precarious position and the deep divisions within the kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who is fleeing from his son Absalom.

Mahanaim lies east of the Jordan, a fortified city first mentioned when Jacob met angels there&#8212;&#8220;So Jacob named that place Mahanaim&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>). By choosing this historic refuge, David follows a precedent of God-provided safety.<p>&#8226; The move displays David&#8217;s faith and prudence. Rather than hopeless resignation, he acts within God&#8217;s provision, echoing earlier moments when he fled Saul yet trusted the LORD (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Mahanaim belongs to the tribe of Gad (<a href="/joshua/13-26.htm">Joshua 13:26</a>); its Transjordan location grants natural defenses. Here David finds allies like Barzillai the Gileadite (<a href="/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27-29</a>), illustrating <a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>: &#8220;The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Spiritually, Mahanaim reminds believers that God often prepares places of refuge before trials arise. Just as He preserved His anointed king, He preserves those who take shelter in Him (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Absalom crossed the Jordan</b><p>&#8226; Absalom&#8217;s crossing signals open rebellion advancing. Like earlier invaders&#8212;e.g., the Arameans in <a href="/2_samuel/10-17.htm">2 Samuel 10:17</a>&#8212;he passes the natural barrier God once split for Israel (<a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14-17</a>). The contrast is striking: where the crossing under Joshua showcased covenant obedience, Absalom&#8217;s crossing underscores covenant defiance.<p>&#8226; Absalom asserts royal authority, yet without divine mandate. <a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a> fits: &#8220;The kings of the earth take their stand&#8230;against the LORD and against His Anointed.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God allows the usurper to mobilize, revealing hearts (<a href="/2_samuel/15-13.htm">2 Samuel 15:13</a>). Judgment and mercy intertwine: the LORD exposes rebellion while giving David space to regroup.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with all the men of Israel</b><p>&#8226; The phrase highlights the breadth of Absalom&#8217;s popularity: &#8220;all the men of Israel&#8221; mirrors the earlier acclaim David once enjoyed (<a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1</a>). Popularity, however, is not proof of righteousness (<a href="/exodus/23-2.htm">Exodus 23:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Tribal loyalties fracture. Yet even now God preserves a remnant for David&#8212;loyal troops, the Cherethites, Pelethites, and 600 Gittites (<a href="/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18-22</a>). <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a> later echoes this principle of a faithful remnant.<p>&#8226; The verse underscores the gravity of division: an entire nation stands at a crossroads, foreshadowing later schisms between Judah and Israel (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24</a> paints a vivid, literal snapshot: God&#8217;s chosen king secures refuge at Mahanaim while the usurper marches with seemingly overwhelming support. The geography, history, and alliances all reveal divine sovereignty&#8212;providing safety for David, exposing Absalom&#8217;s rebellion, and inviting readers to trust the LORD&#8217;s faithful protection even when circumstances suggest defeat.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Mahanaim.</span>--See Note on <a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm" title="But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;">2Samuel 2:8</a>. The same reasons which made it a favourable place for the capital of Ish-bosheth, recommended it also as a place of refuge to David and a rallying point for his adherents.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">and</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>David came to Mahanaim.</span> (On Mahanaim, see note on 2 Samuel 2:8.) It was now a fortified city, with walls and gates (<a href="/2_samuel/18-24.htm">2 Samuel 18:24</a>), and its strength of position, which had made it a safe capital for Ishbosheth, who had probably added to its defences, made it also a safe retreat for David while gathering his forces. As it was only about fifty miles distant from the fords of the Jordan, David had not retreated far; and, meanwhile, Absalom was wasting time in gathering "all the men of Israel" for the attack. During this interval Absalom was anointed king (<a href="/2_samuel/19-10.htm">2 Samuel 19:10</a>) by the priests, with all due solemnity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/17-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
