David's departure marks a significant moment in his reign, highlighting the consequences of his earlier sins and the fulfillment of Nathan's prophecy (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>). This event is a turning point, showing David's humility and reliance on God during times of distress.<p><b>with all the people following him</b><br>David is not alone in his departure; he is accompanied by loyal followers, including his household and faithful servants. This reflects the loyalty and support David still commands despite the political turmoil. It also illustrates the communal nature of leadership in ancient Israel, where a king's fate was closely tied to that of his people. The loyalty of his followers can be seen as a testament to David's character and leadership.<p><b>He stopped at the last house</b><br>The "last house" likely refers to the outskirts of Jerusalem, marking the boundary of the city. This pause could symbolize a moment of reflection or prayer, as David prepares to leave the city he established as the political and spiritual center of Israel. It may also indicate a strategic pause to organize his followers before continuing their journey. This moment can be seen as a type of Christ, who also faced rejection and suffering, yet remained steadfast in His mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, David is the anointed king of Israel.

Their willingness to follow showcases covenant loyalty (<a href="/2_samuel/20-6.htm">2 Samuel 20:6</a>; <a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; The king leads; the people follow. This pattern reflects the shepherd model David himself wrote about in <a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-4</a> and foreshadows Christ, the greater King, who goes before His flock (<a href="/john/10-4.htm">John 10:4</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s departure fulfills Nathan&#8217;s prophecy that calamity would rise up from within his own house (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>). God&#8217;s word proves literally true, yet His anointed is not abandoned (<a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He stopped at the last house</b><p>&#8220;He stopped at the last house.&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/15-17.htm">2 Samuel 15:17</a>)<p>&#8226; The &#8220;last house&#8221; marks the edge of Jerusalem, a pause before crossing the Kidron Valley (v. 23). It recalls Israel&#8217;s pauses at significant thresholds&#8212;the Jordan before entering Canaan (<a href="/joshua/3-1.htm">Joshua 3:1-3</a>) and Elijah&#8217;s halt at the Jordan before his translation (<a href="/2_kings/2-6.htm">2 Kings 2:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; This stop allows David to review those accompanying him, test loyalties, and give orders (vv. 18-22). Similarly, Jesus paused in Gethsemane to pray and strengthen disciples before His arrest (<a href="/matthew/26-36.htm">Matthew 26:36-46</a>).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s brief halt shows measured leadership amid crisis: he is neither panicked nor inert. In <a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>, &#8220;Victory rests with the LORD.&#8221; David&#8217;s pause demonstrates trust that the Lord directs each step (<a href="/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Physically, the &#8220;last house&#8221; underscores how close David comes to losing the visible throne, yet spiritually God&#8217;s covenant promise stands (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). The earthly kingdom trembles; the divine kingdom remains unshaken (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/15-17.htm">2 Samuel 15:17</a> pictures David, God&#8217;s anointed king, leaving Jerusalem with faithful followers and pausing at the city&#8217;s edge. His swift departure fulfills divine prophecy, while the stop at the &#8220;last house&#8221; reveals calm trust and deliberate leadership. The scene mirrors past and future redemptive moments, reminding us that even when thrones totter, the Lord&#8217;s word proves true and His shepherd-king guides His people step by step.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Tarried in a place that was far off.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">halted at the far house, i.e., </span>at a definite place known by this name, probably the last house on the outskirts of the city before the road crossed the Kidron.
