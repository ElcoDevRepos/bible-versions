Saul was the first king of Israel, and his death marked a significant turning point in Israel's history. The messenger likely expected David to be pleased, as Saul had been pursuing David to kill him. However, David had consistently shown respect for Saul as the Lord's anointed (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>). This reflects David's integrity and his understanding of God's sovereignty in appointing leaders. The phrase also highlights the cultural practice of delivering news of a king's death, which could be seen as an opportunity for political gain.<p><b>and thought he was a bearer of good news,</b><br>The messenger assumed that David would rejoice at Saul's death, viewing it as an opportunity for David to ascend to the throne without opposition. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the death of a rival king was often seen as a cause for celebration by the opposing faction. However, David's reaction was contrary to this expectation, demonstrating his deep respect for God's anointed and his commitment to God's timing for his own kingship. This also underscores the biblical theme of God's ways being higher than human ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><b>I seized him and put him to death at Ziklag.</b><br>Ziklag was a Philistine town given to David by Achish, king of Gath, where David and his men had taken refuge from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a>). The execution of the messenger at Ziklag illustrates David's justice and his refusal to condone the killing of the Lord's anointed, even indirectly. This action aligns with the principle of divine justice, where David acts as an instrument of God's judgment. It also foreshadows the justice of Christ, who will judge righteously (<a href="/john/5-30.htm">John 5:30</a>).<p><b>That was his reward for his news!</b><br>David's statement here is both ironic and instructive. The messenger expected a reward for bringing what he thought was good news, but instead, he received death. This serves as a moral lesson on the consequences of actions and the importance of understanding God's perspective. It also reflects the biblical principle that God rewards righteousness and punishes wickedness (<a href="/proverbs/11-18.htm">Proverbs 11:18</a>). David's response emphasizes the sanctity of God's anointed and the seriousness of taking life, even in the context of political power struggles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who is known for his heart after God.
