Their actions, particularly the humiliation of David's envoys, were seen as a grave insult, making them "a stench" to David. This phrase indicates a severe breach in diplomatic relations, leading to inevitable conflict. The term "stench" suggests a deep offense, echoing the language used in <a href="/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a> when Jacob's sons made him "obnoxious" to the Canaanites and Perizzites.<p><b>they hired twenty thousand Aramean foot soldiers from Beth-rehob and Zoba</b><br>The Ammonites sought military support from the Arameans, a group of Semitic tribes in the region of modern-day Syria. Beth-rehob and Zoba were significant Aramean city-states. This hiring of mercenaries reflects the common ancient Near Eastern practice of forming alliances through paid military support. The Arameans were known for their skilled warriors, and their involvement indicates the seriousness of the Ammonites' preparations against Israel.<p><b>as well as a thousand men from the king of Maacah</b><br>Maacah was a small kingdom located near the northern borders of Israel. The inclusion of Maacah's forces highlights the regional alliances against Israel. The king of Maacah's participation suggests a coalition of smaller states feeling threatened by Israel's growing power under David. This reflects the political landscape of the time, where smaller kingdoms often banded together against a common threat.<p><b>and twelve thousand men from Tob</b><br>Tob was a region east of the Jordan River, possibly linked to the area where Jephthah, the judge of Israel, had previously found refuge (<a href="/judges/11-3.htm">Judges 11:3</a>). The mention of Tob indicates the widespread nature of the coalition against David. The recruitment of men from Tob underscores the Ammonites' desperation and the extent of their efforts to counter David's military might. This coalition of forces from various regions illustrates the geopolitical dynamics of the time, where alliances were crucial for survival and influence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A people descended from Lot, often in conflict with Israel.

This has been understood of several different places. It can hardly have been the Rehob (or Beth-rehob) of <a href="/numbers/13-21.htm" title="So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, as men come to Hamath.">Numbers 13:21</a>; <a href="/judges/18-28.htm" title="And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lies by Bethrehob.

The mercenaries, moreover, were gathered out of numerous districts of Aram - from Rehob, Zoba, Beth-Maacah, and Tob; the margin being right in rendering "the men of Tob," instead of "Ish-tob." So, too, the Revised Version, "The men of Tob twelve thousand men." It was to this land that Jephthah fled (<a href="/judges/11-3.htm">Judges 11:3</a>). The whole number of the allies was thirty-three thousand, with which total the parallel place agrees, as they are described there as "thirty-two thousand, and the King of Maacah and his people," who are here said to have been a thousand strong. The text, however, there must be corrupt, as it describes them all as horsemen (Authorized Version, "chariots;" <a href="/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>); here footmen only are mentioned, with which the narrative agrees (see note on ver. 18). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/10-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the Ammonites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">realized that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yir&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
