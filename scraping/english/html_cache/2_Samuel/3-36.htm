The context here is the aftermath of Abner's death, a significant event in the power struggle between the house of Saul and the house of David. The people observing David's actions suggests a shift in public opinion, crucial for David's consolidation of power. This awareness can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to David, as the people begin to recognize his leadership. The phrase also reflects the importance of public perception in ancient Israel, where the king's actions were closely watched by the populace.<p><b>and were pleased</b><br>The people's pleasure indicates approval of David's conduct, particularly his mourning for Abner. This approval is significant because it shows that David's actions aligned with the cultural expectations of justice and honor. In the ancient Near Eastern context, mourning for a fallen leader like Abner would have been seen as a sign of respect and integrity. This public approval also serves to legitimize David's rule, as it demonstrates that he is seen as a just and rightful leader by the people.<p><b>In fact, everything the king did pleased them</b><br>This statement underscores the growing support for David among the Israelites. It suggests that David's actions were consistently in line with the expectations and values of the people. This approval can be seen as a divine endorsement of David's kingship, as God had chosen him to lead Israel. The phrase also highlights the importance of a king's relationship with his subjects in biblical times, where the king's favor with the people was often seen as a reflection of his favor with God. This approval can be connected to the broader biblical theme of God's chosen leaders being recognized and accepted by the people, as seen in the stories of Moses and Joshua.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is mourning the death of Abner, the commander of Saul's army.

The people &#8220;took note&#8221; because his actions were unmistakably genuine.<p>&#8226; Similar moments appear earlier in David&#8217;s life: after he faced Goliath, &#8220;all Israel and Judah loved David&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/18-16.htm">1 Samuel 18:16</a>), and the elders noticed his courage (<a href="/1_samuel/17-57.htm">1 Samuel 17:57</a>).<p>&#8226; Public recognition here does not mean mere curiosity; it reflects moral discernment. Scripture routinely highlights how a righteous leader&#8217;s behavior is observable&#8212;see <a href="/proverbs/20-11.htm">Proverbs 20:11</a> and <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and were pleased</b><p>&#8226; The people&#8217;s satisfaction springs from seeing justice upheld. Joab&#8217;s murder of Abner could have erupted into civil chaos, but David&#8217;s open lament proved he had no part in the crime. Their pleasure parallels the relief expressed when Joshua was vindicated before Israel (<a href="/joshua/22-30.htm">Joshua 22:30&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/33-5.htm">Psalm 33:5</a> reminds us that &#8220;the earth is full of the LORD&#8217;s loving devotion,&#8221; and whenever a king mirrors that devotion, the nation rejoices (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Notice that their pleasure follows observation; Scripture links clear, righteous conduct with communal well-being (<a href="/jeremiah/22-15.htm">Jeremiah 22:15&#8211;16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In fact, everything the king did pleased them</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Everything&#8221; points to the pattern of David&#8217;s life, not one isolated act. Earlier, &#8220;all that David did pleased all the people&#8221; when he led worship with the ark (<a href="/1_chronicles/13-4.htm">1 Chronicles 13:4</a>).<p>&#8226; A consistent testimony cultivates trust. David had previously spared Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/24-4.htm">1 Samuel 24:4&#8211;10</a>) and mourned Saul and Jonathan (<a href="/2_samuel/1-11.htm">2 Samuel 1:11&#8211;12</a>); each episode reinforced that he governed by God&#8217;s standards.<p>&#8226; The phrase anticipates the fuller statement in <a href="/2_samuel/5-12.htm">2 Samuel 5:12</a> where David recognizes that the LORD &#8220;had established him king over Israel and exalted his kingdom for the sake of His people.&#8221; The people&#8217;s approval lines up with God&#8217;s own approval (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>; <a href="/acts/13-22.htm">Acts 13:22</a>).<p>&#8226; This harmony between ruler and nation foreshadows Messianic fulfillment, when Christ, the perfect King, will reign in absolute righteousness and universal delight (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>In <a href="/2_samuel/3-36.htm">2 Samuel 3:36</a> the nation observes David&#8217;s transparent grief, recognizes his innocence, and rejoices that their king consistently acts with integrity. Their pleasure confirms God&#8217;s choice of David and illustrates the blessing that flows when a leader&#8217;s public conduct aligns with divine righteousness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.</span> This is a tribute to the king's conduct generally. The people would have been grieved and astonished if David had been guilty of this mean murder; but his indignant disavowal of it was in accordance with his usual justice and uprightness, and so it confirmed their high opinion of him. Thus while the more distant tribes condemned David, those who had the best opportunity for forming a judgment gave their verdict in his favour. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/3-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
