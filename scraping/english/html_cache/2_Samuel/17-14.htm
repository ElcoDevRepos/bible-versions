The "men of Israel" refers to the leaders and elders who supported Absalom's rebellion. This moment is critical as it reflects the collective decision-making process during a time of political upheaval. The unity in their statement indicates a temporary consensus among Absalom's followers, highlighting the tension between loyalty to David and the allure of Absalom's charisma.<p><b>&#8220;The advice of Hushai the Archite is better than that of Ahithophel.&#8221;</b><br>Hushai the Archite was a loyal friend of David who infiltrated Absalom's court to act as a spy. His advice was strategically designed to counter Ahithophel, who was known for his wise counsel. Ahithophel's advice was typically regarded as if one had inquired of the word of God, indicating his high reputation. The preference for Hushai's counsel over Ahithophel's marks a pivotal moment, as it reflects divine intervention in the political affairs of Israel. This decision would ultimately lead to Absalom's downfall, showcasing the sovereignty of God over human plans.<p><b>For the LORD had purposed to thwart the good counsel of Ahithophel</b><br>This phrase reveals the divine orchestration behind the events. Despite Ahithophel's reputation for giving sound advice, the LORD intervened to ensure that his counsel would not be followed. This demonstrates the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and His ability to influence human decisions to fulfill His purposes. It echoes <a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>, which states, "Many are the plans in a person&#8217;s heart, but it is the LORD&#8217;s purpose that prevails." The thwarting of Ahithophel's counsel serves as a reminder that God's plans are ultimately unstoppable.<p><b>in order to bring disaster on Absalom.</b><br>The disaster refers to the eventual defeat and death of Absalom, which was a consequence of his rebellion against his father, King David. This outcome fulfills the judgment pronounced by Nathan the prophet in <a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>, where God declared that calamity would arise from David's own household as a result of his sin with Bathsheba. Absalom's rebellion and its tragic end serve as a sobering reminder of the consequences of sin and the fulfillment of divine prophecy. This also typologically points to the ultimate triumph of God's anointed king, prefiguring the victory of Jesus Christ over all rebellion and sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The son of King David who rebelled against his father, seeking to usurp the throne of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hushai_the_archite.htm">Hushai the Archite</a></b><br>A loyal friend and advisor to King David who infiltrated Absalom's court to counteract the counsel of Ahithophel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahithophel.htm">Ahithophel</a></b><br>A highly esteemed counselor whose advice was considered almost as if one had consulted the word of God.

Nothing in it was left to chance, and Absalom, already at the head of such numbers as to be able to select from them twelve thousand picked men, saw himself, in fancy, marching forward with all Israel at his feet. As a matter of fact, he did advance with so large an army that David was saved only by the skilful strategy of Joab. Like other king makers, Ahithophel had put himself too forward. He asked for twelve thousand men to be placed under his command, that he might smite David, and so be, not only Absalom's counsellor, but also his commander-in-chief. Amasa and the other commanders would be displeased at this, and Absalom would feel that he was himself placed in a very secondary position.
