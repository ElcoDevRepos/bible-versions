Hadadezer, the king of Zobah, was a significant regional power in Syria. Zobah was a Syrian kingdom located in the region of modern-day Lebanon and Syria. This victory over Hadadezer demonstrates David's expanding influence and God's favor upon him. The defeat of Hadadezer is a fulfillment of God's covenant with David, ensuring peace and security for Israel. This victory also prefigures the ultimate triumph of Christ over all earthly powers, as David is a type of Christ, the ultimate King.<p><b>who had marched out to restore his dominion</b><br>Hadadezer's attempt to restore his dominion suggests previous losses or challenges to his authority, possibly due to earlier conflicts with Israel or other regional powers. This phrase indicates the political instability and constant warfare typical of the ancient Near East, where kings often sought to expand or reclaim territories. The restoration of dominion can be seen as a parallel to the spiritual restoration that Christ brings, reclaiming what was lost through sin.<p><b>along the Euphrates River</b><br>The Euphrates River was a significant geographical landmark in the ancient world, often considered a natural boundary for empires. It was one of the four rivers mentioned in the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/2-14.htm">Genesis 2:14</a>), symbolizing abundance and life. In the context of David's reign, controlling areas near the Euphrates would have been strategic for trade and military advantage. This expansion towards the Euphrates fulfills part of the Abrahamic promise of land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>), showing God's faithfulness to His covenant people. The Euphrates also appears in eschatological prophecies, such as in Revelation, where it is associated with the end times, highlighting its ongoing biblical significance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his military prowess and his heart for God.

Zobah (called in the title of Psalms 60 Aram-Zobah) was a kingdom, the position of which cannot be exactly determined, but lying north-east of Israel, and formerly governed by petty kings with whom Saul had wars (<a href="/1_samuel/14-47.htm" title="So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he vexed them.">1Samuel 14:47</a>).

The name is spelt Hadarezer in <a href="/2_samuel/10-16.htm">2 Samuel 10:16</a> and in <a href="/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a>, and such is the reading of the versions here and of many Hebrew manuscripts. The other reading has been defended on the ground that Hadad is the name of the Syrian sun-god, but the cuneiform inscriptions show that his real name was Hadar. The King of Syria, mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>, is called in Assyrian Ben-Hidri. <span class="cmt_word">Zobah</span>. Ewald identifies Zobah with the "Sabo" mentioned by Ptolemy. This is uncertain, but evidently Zobah lay northeast of Damascus and south of Hamath, in the region between the rivers Orontes and Euphrates. In <a href="/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a> it appears as a powerless country governed by a multitude of petty kings; but evidently now Hadarezer had made himself supreme, and become a powerful monarch whose authority extended even across the river into Mesopotamia (<a href="/2_samuel/10-16.htm">2 Samuel 10:16</a>). Having crushed his rivals at home, he had next endeavoured to extend his dominion abroad. <span class="cmt_word">As he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.</span> The word "Euphrates" is inserted in the Authorized Version, because the margin says, "Euphrates read but not written." In the Revised Version it is omitted, because the unauthoritative nature of these directions to read something not in the text has been demonstrated. Technically these readings are called <span class="accented">K'ri</span>, and the written text <span class="accented">K'tib.</span> In <a href="/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a> the reading is, "as he went to stablish his dominion by the river" - a change which involves the alteration of only one letter, as the word rendered here "his border," and in <a href="/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a> "his dominion," is the same, signifying literally, "his hand." For this reason the Revised Version renders it correctly in both places "his dominion." Now, David never had possessed up to this time any dominion upon the Euphrates, but in the fuller narrative in ch. 10. we learn that these Syrians of Zobah had sent powerful reinforcements to the Ammonites in their war with David; and he might reasonably, therefore, determine to follow up his victory over. them by extending his power up to the river, so as to guard the fords, and prevent all future invasions. And this Hadarezer would resent. As an able and enterprising man, he had succeeded in making Zobah a powerful realm, and was not likely to submit to having a bridle put upon his adventurous spirit by the posting of an Israelitish garrison on the borders. We learn from <a href="/2_samuel/10-19.htm">2 Samuel 10:19</a> that David's object was to prevent aid coming to Ammon from Zobah, and that he succeeded in putting a barrier in Hadarezer's way. We can scarcely doubt, therefore, that the reading in the Chronicles is to be preferred. In <a href="/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a> we read that Saul had waged war with Zobah, and as David had probably served in it, he would have thereby acquired both a knowledge of the country, very useful in this present more serious expedition, and also have learned the necessity of guarding his dominions against perpetual invasions from that quarter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/8-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1428;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">also defeated</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
