This age aligns with the age at which priests began their service (<a href="/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>), suggesting a time of full maturity and responsibility. David's journey to kingship was marked by years of preparation, including his anointing by Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>) and his experiences as a shepherd, warrior, and fugitive. These experiences equipped him for the challenges of leadership. His age also prefigures Jesus Christ, who began His public ministry at about thirty (<a href="/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23</a>), highlighting a typological connection between David and Jesus as shepherd-kings.<p><b>and he reigned forty years</b><br>The duration of David's reign, forty years, is a period often associated with testing, trial, and completion in the Bible. This number appears frequently, such as the forty years of Israel's wandering in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>) and the forty days of Jesus' temptation in the desert (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). David's reign is divided between Hebron, where he ruled over Judah for seven years and six months, and Jerusalem, where he reigned over all Israel for thirty-three years (<a href="/2_samuel/5-5.htm">2 Samuel 5:5</a>). This period of reign established the united monarchy and set the stage for the future prosperity and expansion under Solomon. David's reign is foundational for the Davidic Covenant (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>), which promises an everlasting kingdom, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, the Son of David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, David is anointed as king over Israel.
