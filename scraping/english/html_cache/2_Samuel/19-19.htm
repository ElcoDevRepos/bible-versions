In ancient Israel, the king held the power to pardon or punish, and addressing him as "my lord" signifies respect and submission. The speaker acknowledges the king's authority to judge guilt, which aligns with the biblical understanding of God as the ultimate judge, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a>.<p><b>and do not remember your servant&#8217;s wrongdoing</b><br>The request to not remember wrongdoing is a plea for complete forgiveness and restoration. Biblically, this echoes the concept of God not remembering sins against those who repent, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>. The term "servant" indicates humility and a recognition of the king's higher status, paralleling the believer's relationship with God.<p><b>on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem.</b><br>This phrase refers to the historical context of King David's flight from Jerusalem during Absalom's rebellion. The departure from Jerusalem was a significant event, symbolizing a period of turmoil and betrayal. Jerusalem, as the city of David, holds deep theological significance as the center of worship and God's chosen city, as seen in <a href="/2_chronicles/6-6.htm">2 Chronicles 6:6</a>.<p><b>May the king not take it to heart.</b><br>The speaker appeals to the king's capacity for mercy and forgiveness, asking him not to internalize the offense. This reflects the biblical theme of forgiveness and the importance of not harboring resentment, as taught in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/ephesians/4-31.htm">Ephesians 4:31-32</a>.
