Their pursuit of Abner, the commander of Saul's army, highlights the ongoing conflict between the house of David and the house of Saul following Saul's death. This pursuit is part of the larger narrative of the struggle for kingship in Israel. Joab's relentless nature is evident here, as he is known for his fierce loyalty to David and his willingness to take decisive action, sometimes with questionable ethics, as seen later in his life (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>).<p><b>By sunset, they had gone as far as the hill of Ammah</b><br>The mention of "sunset" indicates the urgency and intensity of the pursuit, as they continued until the end of the day. The hill of Ammah is a specific geographical location, though its exact site is not known today. The reference to a hill suggests a strategic advantage point, which was common in ancient warfare. Hills were often used for defense and observation, providing a tactical edge in military pursuits.<p><b>opposite Giah</b><br>Giah is another location mentioned in the pursuit, though its precise location is also uncertain. The use of specific place names, even when their exact locations are lost to history, adds authenticity to the narrative and reflects the detailed historical recording typical of biblical texts. The mention of these places indicates the thoroughness of the pursuit and the strategic considerations of the terrain.<p><b>on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.</b><br>The wilderness of Gibeon is significant as Gibeon was a major city in ancient Israel, known for its large pool and as a site of several important biblical events. The wilderness suggests a desolate area, which would have been challenging for both pursuers and the pursued. Gibeon is also notable in the biblical narrative for the battle where the sun stood still (<a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12-14</a>), and later, as a place where Solomon offered sacrifices (<a href="/1_kings/3-4.htm">1 Kings 3:4</a>).

Their pursuit is personal; Abner has just killed their brother Asahel (<a href="/2_samuel/2-23.htm">2 Samuel 2:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The text shows righteous zeal for justice, not reckless vengeance. God&#8217;s law allowed blood-avengers (<a href="/numbers/35-19.htm">Numbers 35:19</a>), yet the brothers remain within the military chain of command rather than acting as lone vigilantes.<p>&#8226; Their determination underscores the larger conflict between Saul&#8217;s house (represented by Abner and Ish-bosheth) and David&#8217;s rising kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The straightforward narration affirms historical accuracy&#8212;names, relationships, and motives are laid out plainly so we can trust what happened (cf. <a href="/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As the sun was setting</b><p>&#8220;&#8203;&#8230;and as the sun was setting&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The inspired writer marks time carefully, placing the scene in late afternoon. Sunset heightens drama&#8212;pursuit can&#8217;t last much longer before darkness (<a href="/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Biblically, twilight often signals a decisive moment (<a href="/joshua/8-29.htm">Joshua 8:29</a>; <a href="/judges/19-14.htm">Judges 19:14</a>). Here it foreshadows the pause that Abner will soon request (<a href="/2_samuel/2-26.htm">2 Samuel 2:26</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty over times and seasons (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>) reminds us that even the length of daylight serves His unfolding plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They came to the hill of Ammah</b><p>&#8220;&#8203;&#8230;they came to the hill of Ammah&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; A specific landmark roots the event in geography, reinforcing the literal nature of Scripture (<a href="/psalms/48-12.htm">Psalm 48:12-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Hills in Scripture often provide strategic advantage (<a href="/1_samuel/17-3.htm">1 Samuel 17:3</a>); Abner chooses elevated ground to slow his pursuers and rally Benjaminites (<a href="/2_samuel/2-25.htm">2 Samuel 2:25</a>).<p>&#8226; The name Ammah, meaning &#8220;a cubit&#8221; or &#8220;mother,&#8221; remains uncertain, but the Spirit&#8217;s purpose is location not symbolism. We can trust the detail even when modern maps cannot trace it exactly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Opposite Giah</b><p>&#8220;&#8203;&#8230;which is near Giah&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Opposite&#8221; or &#8220;near&#8221; stresses proximity: the two hills face each other, creating a natural standoff.<p>&#8226; Including Giah, another otherwise-unknown site, displays the historian&#8217;s precision. Scripture is comfortable recording facts for which archaeology may still be silent (<a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention highlights how God tracks every movement of His people; He knows the exact coordinates of obedience and conflict (<a href="/proverbs/5-21.htm">Proverbs 5:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On the way to the wilderness of Gibeon</b><p>&#8220;&#8203;&#8230;on the way to the Wilderness of Gibeon.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Gibeon had earlier witnessed a miraculous battle under Joshua (<a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10-14</a>) and remained a strategic Benjaminite city (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-39.htm">1 Chronicles 16:39</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;wilderness&#8221; denotes open, rugged terrain&#8212;ideal for retreat or regrouping.

Here it is a staging ground for negotiation: Abner will soon call for peace to avoid needless bloodshed (<a href="/2_samuel/2-26.htm">2 Samuel 2:26-27</a>).<p>&#8226; The road itself becomes a dividing line between two kingdoms, illustrating Jesus&#8217; later teaching that a house divided cannot stand (<a href="/mark/3-24.htm">Mark 3:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>&#8226; Joab and Abishai&#8217;s pursuit is fueled by family loyalty and covenant justice, yet conducted within God-ordained structures.<p>&#8226; Sunset signals God&#8217;s timing; He limits human striving and opens space for mercy.<p>&#8226; The hill of Ammah and nearby Giah confirm Scripture&#8217;s historical reliability and show God&#8217;s attention to detail.<p>&#8226; The wilderness of Gibeon frames the encounter as a clash between rival kingdoms that will ultimately end under David&#8217;s God-given rule.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_samuel/2-24.htm">2 Samuel 2:24</a>, therefore, is not a throwaway itinerary; it is a Spirit-breathed snapshot of justice, timing, geography, and divine sovereignty converging on the road to David&#8217;s rightful throne.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">The hill of Ammah.</span>--No identification of either Ammah or Giah has yet been made, but as it was "by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon," it may be conjectured that it was not far from that town, and hence that the pursuit was not long.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Josh also and Abishai pursued after Abner;</span> really, <span class="accented">but Joab and Abishai pursued</span>, and so the Revised Version.
