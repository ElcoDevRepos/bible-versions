The phrase "If anyone speaks to you" indicates David's willingness to protect the woman from any potential backlash for her involvement in this sensitive matter. This reflects the king's authority and his role as a protector of his subjects. In the broader biblical context, this mirrors God's protective nature over His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/91-14.htm">Psalm 91:14-15</a>, where God promises deliverance and protection to those who call on Him.<p><b>said the king,</b><br>The reference to "the king" highlights David's position of authority and responsibility. As the anointed king of Israel, David's words carry significant weight. His role as king is a type of Christ, who is often referred to as the King of Kings in the New Testament (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>). David's actions and decisions often foreshadow the ultimate kingship of Jesus, who provides protection and justice for His people.<p><b>&#8220;bring him to me,</b><br>David's instruction to "bring him to me" demonstrates his willingness to personally intervene in the situation. This reflects the biblical principle of seeking justice and resolving conflicts directly, as seen in <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>, where Jesus instructs His followers to address issues directly with the involved parties. David's approach also underscores the importance of leadership involvement in conflict resolution, a theme that resonates throughout the Bible.<p><b>and he will not trouble you again!&#8221;</b><br>The assurance that "he will not trouble you again" signifies David's commitment to ensuring the woman's safety and peace of mind. This promise of protection is reminiscent of God's assurances to His people throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, where God tells His people not to fear because He is with them. David's promise can also be seen as a reflection of the peace and security that Christ offers to believers, as mentioned in <a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>, where Jesus speaks of giving His peace to His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The reigning king of Israel, known for his heart after God, yet also for his personal and familial struggles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_of_tekoa.htm">The Woman of Tekoa</a></b><br>A wise woman sent by Joab to speak to King David, using a parable to persuade him to reconcile with his estranged son, Absalom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>David's military commander who orchestrates the woman's appeal to David, aiming to restore Absalom to the king's favor.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, who is in exile after killing his brother Amnon.

As <a href="/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a> reminds us, &#8220;Because the poor are plundered and the needy groan, I will now arise,&#8221; declares the LORD.<p>&#8226; Practical takeaway: God hears every unjust word spoken against His people and calls leaders to listen and act.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;said the king,&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; David&#8217;s role is central. As Israel&#8217;s anointed shepherd-king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>), his word carries covenant authority (<a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Like a judge in the gate (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8-9</a>), David speaks decisively, reflecting God&#8217;s character of justice (<a href="/psalms/89-14.htm">Psalm 89:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Compare Solomon later rendering verdicts in <a href="/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16-28</a>&#8212;both kings embody God&#8217;s concern for equity.<p>&#8226; In the narrative flow, David&#8217;s statement foreshadows his eventual decision about Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/14-21.htm">2 Samuel 14:21</a>). God often uses human authority to reveal His own heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;bring him to me,&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; David offers personal intervention. He does not delegate this case; he invites the woman to bring any accuser directly before him (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1</a>, when Nathan approached David).<p>&#8226; This echoes Moses&#8217; invitation in <a href="/numbers/16-5.htm">Numbers 16:5</a>: &#8220;In the morning the LORD will show who belongs to Him.&#8221; Authority stands ready to confront wrongdoing.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a> encourages believers: &#8220;Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence.&#8221; The invitation is open; we can bring our troubles to the ultimate King.<p>&#8226; Practical note: godly leadership remains accessible, not distant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and he will not trouble you again!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; David pledges protection. Just as Boaz told Ruth, &#8220;Do not fear&#8230; I will do for you whatever you request&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/3-11.htm">Ruth 3:11</a>), David promises final relief.<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;again&#8221; implies a once-for-all settlement, anticipating the gospel promise that Christ&#8217;s finished work silences the accuser (<a href="/romans/8-33.htm">Romans 8:33-34</a>; <a href="/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/46-9.htm">Psalm 46:9</a> portrays the Lord making &#8220;wars cease,&#8221; showing His power to end hostility.<p>&#8226; Immediate context: David is laying groundwork to restore Absalom, but he first demonstrates to the woman that justice will prevail for her imagined plight. God&#8217;s character is consistent: He defends the defenseless.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/14-10.htm">2 Samuel 14:10</a> captures a king&#8217;s protective commitment: he listens, speaks with authority, invites direct appeal, and guarantees lasting relief.
