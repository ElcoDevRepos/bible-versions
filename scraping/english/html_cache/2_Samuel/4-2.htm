The mention of "leaders of raiding parties" indicates a time of political instability and conflict, as raiding was a common military tactic used to disrupt and weaken opponents. This reflects the ongoing struggle for power between the house of Saul and David, who had been anointed king over Judah.<p><b>One was named Baanah and the other Rechab;</b><br>Baanah and Rechab are introduced as significant figures in this narrative. Their names are Semitic, with Baanah meaning "in affliction" or "in response," and Rechab meaning "rider" or "chariot." These names may reflect their roles or characteristics. Their actions later in the chapter reveal their opportunistic nature, as they seek to gain favor with David by assassinating Ish-bosheth.<p><b>they were sons of Rimmon the Beerothite</b><br>Rimmon is identified as their father, and he is from Beeroth. Beeroth was one of the cities of the Gibeonites, who had made a treaty with Israel during the time of Joshua (Joshua 9). This connection to the Gibeonites may suggest a complex relationship between the Israelites and the inhabitants of Beeroth, who were absorbed into the tribe of Benjamin.<p><b>of the tribe of Benjamin&#8212;</b><br>The tribe of Benjamin was the tribe of King Saul, and thus, Ish-bosheth's supporters would naturally include Benjamites. This tribal affiliation is significant in the context of the power struggle, as loyalty to Saul's house would be strong among his own tribe. The Benjamites were known for their warrior skills, as seen in other biblical accounts (Judges 20).<p><b>Beeroth is considered part of Benjamin,</b><br>This geographical note clarifies the location of Beeroth within the tribal allotments of Israel. Although Beeroth was originally a Gibeonite city, it was incorporated into the territory of Benjamin. This detail underscores the integration of different peoples within the tribal system of Israel and highlights the complex socio-political landscape during the time of the united monarchy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul's_son.htm">Saul's Son</a></b><br>Refers to Ish-bosheth, the son of King Saul, who was made king over Israel after Saul's death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/baanah_and_rechab.htm">Baanah and Rechab</a></b><br>Sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, leaders of raiding parties, and key figures in the events leading to Ish-bosheth's demise.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rimmon_the_beerothite.htm">Rimmon the Beerothite</a></b><br>Father of Baanah and Rechab, from Beeroth, a town associated with the tribe of Benjamin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/beeroth.htm">Beeroth</a></b><br>A town considered part of the tribe of Benjamin, indicating the geographical and tribal context of the account.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribe_of_benjamin.htm">Tribe of Benjamin</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, significant for its association with King Saul and the political dynamics of the time.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_leadership_and_loyalty.htm">Understanding Leadership and Loyalty</a></b><br>The actions of Baanah and Rechab highlight the complexities of leadership and loyalty.

It is identified with the modern <span class= "ital">El-Bireh, </span>nine miles north of Jerusalem. It is mentioned here, in the past tense, that Beeroth "<span class= "ital">was </span>reckoned to Benjamin," because in the time of the writer it was no longer inhabited. The fact that the murderers of Ish-bosheth were of his own tribe is made prominent.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul's son had two men captains of bands.</span> The bands mentioned were light-armed troops, used in forays, such as that mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/3-22.htm">2 Samuel 3:22</a>. Their captains would be men of importance with Ishbosheth, who is here described somewhat contemptuously, not as king, nor by his own name, but as "Saul's son." <span class="cmt_word">Beeroth</span>. This place, literally <span class="accented">the Wells</span>, was one of the four towns reserved for the Gibeonites (<a href="/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>), though nominally belonging to Benjamin (<a href="/joshua/18-25.htm">Joshua 18:25</a>). The note, that it <span class="cmt_word">was reckoned to Benjamin,</span> suggests that it had until quite lately been occupied by the Canaanites, whose flight to Gittaim had no doubt been caused by Saul's cruel attack upon them referred to in <a href="/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1, 2</a>. It was thus remarkable that the destruction of Saul's dynasty was the work of the Gibeonites of Beeroth. As we find another of these Beerothites, Naharai, holding the office of armour bearer to Joab (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-39.htm">1 Chronicles 11:39</a>), it seems probable that many of them saved themselves from expulsion by becoming soldiers. But among David's worthies a large number were strangers, and some even men of foreign extraction. Beeroth, however, was probably seized in Saul's reign by the Benjamites, by force, and occupied by them, as its citizens returned in large numbers from the exile (<a href="/ezra/2-25.htm">Ezra 2:25</a>), and are counted as genuine Israelites.
