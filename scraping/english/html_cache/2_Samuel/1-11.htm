This act symbolized the rending of the heart and was a physical manifestation of inner turmoil. David's reaction here is significant as it reflects his deep sorrow over the death of Saul and Jonathan, despite Saul's pursuit of him. This act of mourning aligns with other biblical instances, such as Jacob tearing his clothes upon hearing of Joseph's supposed death (<a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>). It also demonstrates David's respect for Saul as the Lord's anointed, despite their troubled relationship.<p><b>and all the men who were with him did the same</b><br>David's men, likely his loyal followers and warriors, joined him in this act of mourning, indicating their shared grief and loyalty to David. This collective mourning underscores the communal aspect of grief in ancient cultures, where the leader's emotions and actions often set the tone for the group. It also highlights the respect and allegiance these men had for David, as they mirrored his actions. This unity in mourning can be seen as a precursor to the unity David would later bring to the tribes of Israel as king. The communal tearing of clothes also reflects the broader cultural practices of the time, where mourning was a public and shared experience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, known for his deep relationship with God and his role as a central figure in the history of Israel.
