The "house" refers to his dynasty, which God promised would endure forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). This promise is foundational to the Davidic Covenant, which is central to the messianic hope in Israel. The righteousness of David's house is not based on human merit but on God's gracious choice and covenant.<p><b>For He has established with me an everlasting covenant,</b><br>The everlasting covenant refers to God's promise to David that his throne would be established forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). This covenant is unconditional and points to the coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who is often called the Son of David (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>). The eternal nature of this covenant underscores God's faithfulness and the ultimate fulfillment in Christ's eternal reign.<p><b>ordered and secured in every part.</b><br>The covenant is described as "ordered and secured," indicating its divine origin and unchangeable nature. This reflects the meticulous and sovereign plan of God, ensuring that every aspect of His promise is fulfilled. The security of this covenant is seen in the preservation of David's line through the Babylonian exile and ultimately in the birth of Jesus.<p><b>Will He not bring about my full salvation</b><br>David expresses confidence in God's ability to bring about complete salvation. This salvation is both personal and national, pointing to deliverance from enemies and the ultimate redemption through the Messiah. The concept of "full salvation" is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are assured of complete redemption through Christ (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p><b>and my every desire?</b><br>David's desires align with God's will, reflecting a heart after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). The fulfillment of his desires is tied to the realization of God's promises. This phrase suggests that when one's desires are in harmony with God's purposes, they will be fulfilled. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that God grants the desires of those who delight in Him (<a href="/psalms/37-4.htm">Psalm 37:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, King David, reflects on his relationship with God and the covenant established with him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine being who establishes the everlasting covenant with David, ensuring his house is right with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/everlasting_covenant.htm">Everlasting Covenant</a></b><br>The divine promise made by God to David, ensuring the continuity of his lineage and kingdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_david.htm">House of David</a></b><br>Refers to David's dynasty, which is promised to be established forever through God's covenant.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/salvation_and_desire.htm">Salvation and Desire</a></b><br>David's trust in God to fulfill his ultimate salvation and the desires of his heart.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_assurance_of_god's_promises.htm">The Assurance of God's Promises</a></b><br>David's confidence in God's covenant reminds us of the certainty and reliability of God's promises.

That given in the English is found in the LXX., the Vulg., and the Syriac, and if adopted will mean that David recognises how far he and his house have failed to realise the ideal description set forth; yet since God's promise is sure, this must be realised in his posterity. Most modern commentators, however, prefer to take the clauses interrogatively: "Is not my house thus with God? for He hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all, and sure. For all my salvation and all my desire, shall He not cause it to spring forth?" The Hebrew admits either rendering, but that of the ancient versions gives a higher idea of David's spiritual discernment.<p><span class= "bld">Ordered in all.</span>--As a carefully drawn legal document, providing for all contingencies and leaving no room for misconstruction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Although my house,</span> etc. The rendering of the Authorized Version is that of the ancient versions, and is to be retained. David could not but feel that his house was too stained with sin upon sin for him to be able to lay claim to have been in fact that which the theocratic king was in theory, and which David ought to have been as the representative of Christ, and himself the christ, or anointed of Israel's God. But most modern commentators take the negatives as interrogative, and, therefore, as strong assertions. <p><span class="accented">"For is not my house so with God?<br />For he had made with me an eternal covenant,<br />Ordered in all things, and secure:<br />For all my salvation and all my desire,<br />Shall he not make it to grow?"</span> But surely David had failed in realizing the better purposes of his heart, and it was of God's good pleasure that the covenant, in spite of personal failure, remained firm and secure. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/23-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Is not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my house</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
