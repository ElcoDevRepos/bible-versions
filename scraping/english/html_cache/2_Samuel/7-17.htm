Prophets in ancient Israel were often tasked with delivering God's messages to kings and the people. Nathan's role highlights the importance of prophetic authority and the communication between God and His chosen leaders. This interaction underscores the theocratic nature of Israel, where God directly influenced the governance through His prophets.<p><b>all the words</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the completeness and faithfulness of Nathan's message. Prophets were expected to convey God's words accurately, without alteration. This reflects the biblical principle of the inerrancy and sufficiency of God's revelation. Nathan's faithfulness in delivering the message is a model for integrity and obedience in ministry.<p><b>of this entire revelation.</b><br>The revelation refers to God's covenant with David, often called the Davidic Covenant, which is a pivotal moment in biblical history. This covenant promised David an everlasting dynasty, a promise that finds its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, a descendant of David. The Davidic Covenant is foundational for understanding the messianic hope in the Old Testament and its fulfillment in the New Testament. This revelation also connects to other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/89.htm">Psalm 89</a> and <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>, which speak of the eternal kingdom established through David's line.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan.htm">Nathan</a></b><br>A prophet during the reign of King David, Nathan served as a messenger of God's word.

This word does not imply that Nathan saw anything with the natural eye, but signifies that sort of prophecy which was vouchsafed to a "seer." Thus the prophecies of Isaiah, of Nahum, and of Obadiah are called "visions." Probably the word is taken from the fixed gaze, with which the seer looked into the far off world with unmoved eyes, yet seeing not with them, but with the spiritual sight within. It would thus be an intellectual process accompanied by a rigidity of the natural organs, caused partly by intensity of feeling, but chiefly by mental preoccupation, which left no faculty at liberty to discharge its ordinary function. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/7-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">According to all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1465;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
