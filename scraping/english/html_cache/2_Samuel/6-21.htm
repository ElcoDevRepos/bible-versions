Michal had criticized David for his exuberant worship, reflecting a deeper conflict between the house of Saul and David. This tension is rooted in the transition of kingship from Saul to David, which was marked by divine selection and human jealousy.<p><b>I was dancing before the LORD</b><br>David's dance was an expression of worship and joy as the Ark of the Covenant was brought to Jerusalem. This act of worship was significant because the Ark represented God's presence among His people. David's uninhibited worship contrasts with Michal's concern for royal decorum, emphasizing the priority of heartfelt worship over human traditions.<p><b>who chose me over your father and all his house</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine election of David as king. God rejected Saul due to his disobedience and chose David, a man after His own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). This choice was not based on human merit but on God's sovereign will, illustrating the biblical theme of God's authority in appointing leaders.<p><b>when He appointed me ruler over the LORD&#8217;s people Israel</b><br>David acknowledges his kingship as a divine appointment. This reflects the biblical understanding that true leadership is established by God. David's rule is seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to establish a king who would shepherd His people, a role that foreshadows the ultimate kingship of Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd.<p><b>I will celebrate before the LORD</b><br>David's commitment to celebrate before the LORD highlights the importance of worship in the life of a believer. His declaration signifies a resolve to prioritize God's honor above human opinion. This celebration is a precursor to the joy found in the presence of God, a theme echoed throughout Scripture, culminating in the eternal worship of God in Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his deep relationship with God and his role in establishing Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/michal.htm">Michal</a></b><br>The daughter of Saul and wife of David, who criticized David for his exuberant worship as the Ark of the Covenant was brought to Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who chose David to be king over Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence with His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city that David established as the capital of Israel and the central place of worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_choice.htm">God's Sovereign Choice</a></b><br>David acknowledges that his position as king is due to God's sovereign choice, not human merit.
