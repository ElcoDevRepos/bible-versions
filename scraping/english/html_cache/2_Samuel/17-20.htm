Absalom, David's son, had declared himself king, leading to a civil conflict. The "woman at the house" refers to a loyal supporter of David, who played a crucial role in protecting his messengers. This reflects the tension and division within Israel at the time, as well as the bravery of those who remained faithful to David.<p><b>they asked, &#8220;Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?&#8221;</b><br>Ahimaaz and Jonathan were the sons of the priests Zadok and Abiathar, respectively. They served as messengers for David, relaying critical information about Absalom's plans. Their role highlights the importance of communication and intelligence in warfare. The question posed by Absalom's servants indicates their mission to capture these key figures, which would have been a significant blow to David's cause.<p><b>&#8220;They have crossed over the brook,&#8221; she replied.</b><br>The woman's response is a strategic deception to protect Ahimaaz and Jonathan. The "brook" likely refers to a small stream or waterway, possibly the Kidron Valley, which was a known geographical feature near Jerusalem. Her quick thinking and willingness to mislead Absalom's servants demonstrate her loyalty and the risks taken by those supporting David.<p><b>The men searched but did not find them,</b><br>This phrase underscores the success of the woman's deception and the providential protection over David's messengers. It also reflects the theme of divine intervention, as seen throughout the Bible, where God often protects His chosen leaders and their followers from harm, as in the case of David.<p><b>so they returned to Jerusalem.</b><br>The return to Jerusalem signifies the failure of Absalom's servants to capture Ahimaaz and Jonathan, allowing David to receive the crucial information they carried. Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Israel, is a focal point in the narrative, representing the contested seat of power.

narrative places us in Bahurim, where a quick-thinking unnamed woman becomes God&#8217;s instrument of protection for David&#8217;s loyal messengers (<a href="/2_samuel/17-17.htm">2 Samuel 17:17&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; Absalom&#8217;s men arrive with urgency, convinced they will crush David&#8217;s resistance. God, however, repeatedly frustrates their plans (compare <a href="/2_samuel/15-31.htm">2 Samuel 15:31</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar scenes appear elsewhere, such as when Rahab hid the Israelite spies in Jericho (<a href="/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1&#8211;6</a>) and when Jehosheba sheltered young Joash from Athaliah&#8217;s purge (<a href="/2_kings/11-1.htm">2 Kings 11:1&#8211;3</a>). Each account testifies to the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness in preserving His chosen line and purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They asked, &#8220;Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Ahimaaz (Zadok&#8217;s son) and Jonathan (Abiathar&#8217;s son) carried vital intelligence for David (<a href="/2_samuel/15-27.htm">2 Samuel 15:27, 36</a>). Their capture would have meant death for them and disaster for the king.<p>&#8226; The question shows Absalom&#8217;s forces actively hunting anyone loyal to David, echoing Saul&#8217;s pursuit of David years earlier (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture never frames these messengers as mere pawns; their courageous obedience reflects <a href="/proverbs/20-6.htm">Proverbs 20:6</a>: &#8220;Many a man proclaims his own loyalty, but who can find a trustworthy man?&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;They have crossed over the brook,&#8221; she replied</b><p>&#8226; The woman&#8217;s statement is deliberately vague yet technically possible&#8212;there were several small wadis in the area. Like Rahab&#8217;s words to Jericho&#8217;s soldiers (<a href="/joshua/2-4.htm">Joshua 2:4&#8211;5</a>), she diverts danger away from God&#8217;s servants.<p>&#8226; While Scripture condemns lying generally (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>), it also records occasions where God overrules deception to preserve life, as with the Hebrew midwives (<a href="/exodus/1-15.htm">Exodus 1:15&#8211;21</a>) or Michal&#8217;s ruse to save David (<a href="/1_samuel/19-11.htm">1 Samuel 19:11&#8211;17</a>). The text simply reports what happened; it does not endorse falsehood as a routine practice but highlights the Lord&#8217;s sovereign use of flawed people.<p>&#8226; The brook motif recalls earlier moments of deliverance: Elijah by the Brook Kerith (<a href="/1_kings/17-2.htm">1 Kings 17:2&#8211;6</a>) and David himself crossing the Kidron when fleeing Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/15-23.htm">2 Samuel 15:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The men searched but did not find them</b><p>&#8226; Human effort, no matter how determined, cannot overturn God&#8217;s counsel (<a href="/job/42-2.htm">Job 42:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-27.htm">Isaiah 14:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Hidden in a well with a covering of grain (<a href="/2_samuel/17-19.htm">2 Samuel 17:19</a>), Ahimaaz and Jonathan mirror Moses hidden among reeds (<a href="/exodus/2-3.htm">Exodus 2:3</a>) and Jeremiah in a cistern later rescued (<a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; The search&#8217;s failure underlines <a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>: &#8220;There is no wisdom, no understanding, and no counsel against the LORD.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So they returned to Jerusalem</b><p>&#8226; Absalom&#8217;s servants go back empty-handed, leaving the path clear for David to receive the message and cross the Jordan that very night (<a href="/2_samuel/17-21.htm">2 Samuel 17:21&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; Their retreat foreshadows Absalom&#8217;s ultimate defeat (<a href="/2_samuel/18-6.htm">2 Samuel 18:6&#8211;15</a>). Just as Hushai&#8217;s counsel earlier frustrated Ahithophel&#8217;s (<a href="/2_samuel/17-14.htm">2 Samuel 17:14</a>), the inability to locate the spies further unravels the rebellion.<p>&#8226; This return without victory parallels other aborted pursuits: Pharaoh&#8217;s army turning back after Israel&#8217;s escape (<a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24&#8211;25</a>) and Herod&#8217;s soldiers missing the infant Jesus (<a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13&#8211;16</a>).

It was, we may suppose, in the right direction, but when the pursuers had followed for some time, and caught no glimpse of the runners, knowing their swiftness of foot, they concluded that they had outstripped them. and, giving up the chase as hopeless, returned to Jerusalem. It was only when she had seen them far on their way back that she removed the cover and allowed the young priests to resume their journey. The delay, would have been fatal to David if vigorous counsel had been followed at Jerusalem; as it was, they reached David's camp without further incident, and acquainted him with Ahithophel's plan; and the king at once recognized his danger, and without more delay, commenced at once the passage of the Jordan, and carried it out so skilfully and rapidly, that by the morning every one of his company was safe on the other side. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/17-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Absalom&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1448;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;l&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_53.htm">Strong's 53: </a> </span><span class="str2">Absalom -- 'my father is peace', two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">servants</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7687;&#183;&#7695;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5650.htm">Strong's 5650: </a> </span><span class="str2">Slave, servant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
