His name means "father of peace," yet his life is marked by conflict and rebellion. This phrase indicates his assertive and confrontational nature, setting the tone for the conversation. Absalom's character is complex, embodying both charm and ambition, which ultimately lead to his downfall.<p><b>&#8220;I sent for you and said, &#8216;Come here.</b><br>Absalom is speaking to Joab, David's military commander and a key political figure. Joab had previously helped Absalom return to Jerusalem after his exile in Geshur. This phrase shows Absalom's impatience and determination to resolve his status with his father, King David. It reflects the tension in their relationship and Absalom's desire to assert his position.<p><b>I want to send you to the king to ask:</b><br>Absalom seeks to use Joab as an intermediary to communicate with King David. This reflects the hierarchical and formal nature of royal communication in ancient Israel. It also highlights Absalom's strategic thinking, as he chooses a trusted and influential figure to plead his case.<p><b>Why have I come back from Geshur?</b><br>Geshur was a small Aramean kingdom where Absalom took refuge after killing his brother Amnon. This question underscores Absalom's frustration with his unresolved status in Jerusalem. It also reflects the broader theme of exile and return, which is prevalent in the biblical narrative, symbolizing both physical and spiritual journeys.<p><b>It would be better for me if I were still there.&#8217;</b><br>Absalom expresses his discontent with his current situation, suggesting that his return to Jerusalem has not brought the reconciliation or restoration he desired. This sentiment reveals his inner turmoil and foreshadows his eventual rebellion against David. It also highlights the theme of unfulfilled expectations and the consequences of unresolved conflict.<p><b>So now, let me see the king&#8217;s face,</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, seeing the king's face was a sign of favor and acceptance. Absalom's request indicates his desire for reconciliation and restoration of his status as a royal son. This phrase also reflects the importance of personal relationships and face-to-face interactions in resolving conflicts.<p><b>and if there is iniquity in me, let him kill me.&#8221;</b><br>Absalom's bold statement reveals his willingness to face the consequences of his actions. It reflects the biblical principle of justice and accountability, where wrongdoing must be addressed. This phrase also foreshadows the tragic end of Absalom's story, as his rebellion ultimately leads to his death. It serves as a reminder of the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance and reconciliation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his handsome appearance and rebellious nature.

He must either be punished or fully pardoned. Joab's intercession accomplishes its purpose; the king receives Absalom, and kisses him in token of complete reconciliation. In this David showed great weakness, for which he afterwards suffered severely.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If there be</span> (any) <span class="cmt_word">iniquity in me, let him kill me.</span> The word "any," wrongly inserted in the Authorized Version, as omitted in the Revised Version. It would have been monstrous for Absalom to profess innocence, with the murder of Amnon fresh in his memory; but the phrase, "if there be iniquity in me," means, "if my offence is still unpardoned." If year after year he was to be treated as a criminal, then he would rather be put to death at once. And Absalom's plea succeeds. Joab, who had been unwilling to visit the prisoner, now consents to act as mediator, reports to David his son's vexation at such long continued coldness, and obtains full pardon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/14-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Look,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
