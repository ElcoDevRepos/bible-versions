The Ammonites were descendants of Lot and often in conflict with Israel (<a href="/genesis/19-36.htm">Genesis 19:36-38</a>). Rabbah, the capital city of the Ammonites, is located in present-day Amman, Jordan. This battle is part of a larger campaign that began in <a href="/2_samuel/10.htm">2 Samuel 10</a>, where the Ammonites insulted David's envoys, leading to war. Joab's leadership in this campaign highlights his military prowess and loyalty to David, despite the moral complexities in their relationship, as seen in other parts of 2 Samuel.<p><b>and captured the royal fortress.</b><br>The royal fortress of Rabbah was a significant stronghold, indicating the city's importance and the strategic value of its capture. This victory would have been crucial for Israel's dominance in the region. The capture of such a fortress demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel victory over its enemies (<a href="/deuteronomy/20.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1-4</a>). The fall of Rabbah also foreshadows the eventual downfall of other nations opposing God's people, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of God's sovereignty over nations.

Joab&#8217;s faithful warfare against Rabbah secures the royal fortress, underscoring that God&#8217;s covenant promises and kingdom purposes continue, even when His servants falter. The verse calls readers to steadfast duty, confidence in the Lord&#8217;s oversight of simultaneous events, and assurance that every stronghold opposing His people will ultimately fall.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Took the royal city.</span>--The parallel narrative is resumed at this point in <a href="/1_chronicles/20-2.htm" title="And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set on David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.">1Chronicles 20:2</a>. Rabbah was situated in the narrow valley of the upper Jabbok, on both sides of the stream, but with its citadel on the cliff on the northern side. The "royal city" of this verse, and "the city of waters" of the next, refer probably to the city proper, while the "city" of <a href="/context/2_samuel/12-28.htm" title="Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.">2Samuel 12:28-29</a> is no doubt the citadel, which was more strongly fortified.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Joab... took the royal city.</span> As the siege of Rabbah would be conducted by the slow process of blockade, it might easily be prolonged into the second year, and so give ample space for David's sin and its punishment by the death of the child. But more probably the narrator, having commenced the history of David's sin, completes the story before returning to his account of the war. Thus the capture of Rabbah would occupy some of the interval between David's adultery and Nathan's visit of rebuke, and would lessen the difficulty, which we cannot help feeling, of David remaining for nine or ten months with the guilt of adultery and murder resting upon him, and no open act of repentance. Some short time, then, after Uriah's death, Joab captured "the city of waters." This is not a poetical name for Rabbah, but means the "water city," that is, the town upon the Jabbok, whence the supply of water was obtained. The citadel, which occupied a high rock on the northwestern side, must, therefore, soon be starved into submission, and the whole of "the royal city," that is, of the metropolis of the Ammonites, be in Joab's power. He therefore urges David to come in person, both that the honour of the conquest may be his, and also because probably the blockading force had been reduced to as small a body of men as was safe, and the presence of a large army was necessary for completing the subjugation of the country, which would follow upon the capture of the capital. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/12-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Meanwhile, Joab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1428;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3097.htm">Strong's 3097: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joab -- 'the LORD is father', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">fought</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yil&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#7717;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
