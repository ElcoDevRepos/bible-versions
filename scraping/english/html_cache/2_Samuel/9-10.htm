The command reflects the agrarian society of ancient Israel, where land and its produce were central to sustenance and wealth. The phrase underscores the importance of land inheritance and stewardship in Israelite culture, as well as the responsibility of servants and family members to support the household. This act of working the land for Mephibosheth, the grandson of Saul, is a demonstration of David's loyalty to his covenant with Jonathan, Saul's son, and reflects the biblical principle of honoring commitments and showing kindness to the house of one's friend.<p><b>and bring in the harvest,</b><br>Harvest time was a significant period in ancient Israel, marking the culmination of a season's labor and God's provision. The act of bringing in the harvest symbolizes the fulfillment of God's promise of provision and abundance. In a broader biblical context, harvest is often used metaphorically to describe the gathering of God's people or the final judgment (e.g., <a href="/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37-38</a>, <a href="/revelation/14-15.htm">Revelation 14:15</a>). Here, it signifies the practical care and sustenance provided to Mephibosheth, ensuring his well-being and security.<p><b>so that your master&#8217;s grandson may have food to eat.</b><br>This phrase highlights the provision for Mephibosheth, ensuring his physical needs are met. It reflects the biblical theme of God's care for the vulnerable and marginalized, as Mephibosheth was disabled and unable to provide for himself (<a href="/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>). The provision of food is a basic necessity, and David's command ensures that Mephibosheth is not only remembered but actively cared for, illustrating the biblical call to care for those in need (<a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>).<p><b>But Mephibosheth, your master&#8217;s grandson, is always to eat at my table.&#8221;</b><br>David's invitation for Mephibosheth to eat at his table is a profound act of grace and inclusion. In ancient Near Eastern culture, sharing a meal was a sign of fellowship and acceptance. By granting Mephibosheth a permanent place at the royal table, David elevates his status and restores his dignity. This act prefigures the grace of Christ, who invites the spiritually poor and broken to His table (<a href="/luke/14-13.htm">Luke 14:13-14</a>). It also fulfills David's covenant with Jonathan to show kindness to his family (<a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14-17</a>).<p><b>Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.</b><br>This detail about Ziba's household indicates his capacity to fulfill David's command. The mention of his sons and servants suggests a well-established and resourceful household, capable of managing the agricultural responsibilities assigned by David. It also reflects the social structure of the time, where large families and servant networks were common in managing estates. This structure allowed for the efficient operation of land and resources, ensuring that Mephibosheth's needs would be met without burdening David's own resources.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who seeks to show kindness to the house of Saul for Jonathan's sake.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mephibosheth.htm">Mephibosheth</a></b><br>The son of Jonathan, grandson of Saul, who is shown kindness by David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziba.htm">Ziba</a></b><br>A servant of Saul's household, tasked by David to manage the land for Mephibosheth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The deceased son of Saul and father of Mephibosheth, who had a covenant of friendship with David.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where David reigns and where Mephibosheth is brought to eat at the king's table.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/grace_and_kindness.htm">Grace and Kindness</a></b><br>David's actions towards Mephibosheth exemplify grace and kindness, reflecting God's grace towards us.

By assigning Ziba&#8217;s entire household to the task, David ensures steady, practical care. Scripture often links stewardship of the land with faithfulness (<a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-3.htm">Psalm 37:3</a>), and Paul later affirms the dignity of diligent work (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-12.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:12</a>). Here, labor is framed as an expression of covenant mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And bring in the harvest</b><p>David expects results, not mere activity. &#8220;Bring in the harvest&#8221; underlines productivity and accountability (<a href="/proverbs/10-5.htm">Proverbs 10:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37-38</a>). The land is not to lie fallow while Mephibosheth enjoys royal favor; it is to flourish.

Ziba&#8217;s resources remove any excuse for neglecting David&#8217;s command.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/9-10.htm">2 Samuel 9:10</a> reveals covenant faithfulness in action. David orders Ziba&#8217;s household to farm Saul&#8217;s land so Mephibosheth is supplied, while also granting the disabled heir perpetual fellowship at the royal table. The verse blends stewardship, provision, and grace, depicting how a righteous king mirrors God&#8217;s heart: practical care, abundant resources, and intimate communion for those brought under his favor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That thy master's son may have food to eat.</span> Instead of "son," Hebrew <span class="accented">ben</span>, some commentators prefer the reading of a few Greek versions, namely, "house," Hebrew, <span class="accented">beth.</span> But the difficulty which they seek to avoid arises only from extreme literalness of interpretation. Though Mephibosheth ate at the king's table, he would have a household to maintain - for he had a wife and son - and other expenses; and his having "food to eat" includes everything necessary, as does our prayer for "daily bread." He would live at Jerusalem as a nobleman and Ziba would cultivate his estates, paying, as is usual in the East, a fixed proportion of the value of the produce to his master. <span class="cmt_word">Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants</span> (slaves). He had evidently thriven; for, beginning as a slave in Saul's household, he had now several wives and many slaves of his own, and had become a person of considerable importance. He would still remain so, though somewhat shorn both of wealth and dignity in becoming only Mephibosheth's farmer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/9-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_859.htm">Strong's 859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thou and thee, ye and you</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and your sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1504;&#1462;&#1448;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;ne&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
