The "fortress" refers to the stronghold of Zion, a Jebusite city that David captured, which is strategically located on a hill, providing a natural defense. This move signifies the establishment of Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel. The fortress symbolizes God's provision and protection, as David consolidates his rule over a united Israel. This act fulfills God's promise to David, establishing his kingdom and foreshadowing the eternal kingdom of Christ, who is often referred to as the Son of David.<p><b>and called it the City of David.</b><br>By naming the fortress the "City of David," David asserts his authority and legacy. This name not only marks his personal achievement but also signifies the beginning of Jerusalem's central role in Israel's history. The City of David becomes synonymous with the Davidic dynasty, which is crucial in biblical prophecy concerning the Messiah. The title "City of David" is later used in the New Testament to refer to Bethlehem, linking Jesus' birth to David's lineage and fulfilling messianic prophecies.<p><b>He built it up all the way around,</b><br>David's construction efforts indicate his commitment to fortifying the city, ensuring its security and prosperity. This building project reflects the importance of Jerusalem as the capital and a symbol of God's covenant with Israel. The expansion and fortification of the city demonstrate David's wisdom and leadership, as he prepares Jerusalem to be the center of worship and governance. This act of building also prefigures the future construction of the Temple by Solomon, David's son, which becomes the dwelling place of God's presence among His people.<p><b>from the supporting terraces inward.</b><br>The "supporting terraces" likely refer to the Millo, a structure or series of terraces that provided additional fortification and stability to the city's walls. This construction technique highlights the advanced engineering and architectural skills of the time. The inward building suggests a focus on strengthening the city's core, ensuring that it could withstand external threats. This inward development symbolizes the spiritual fortification of Israel, as Jerusalem becomes the heart of religious life and the center of God's covenantal promises. The emphasis on building from the terraces inward can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual growth, starting from a strong foundation and moving towards a deeper relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who establishes his rule by taking residence in Jerusalem, which becomes known as the City of David.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fortress.htm">The Fortress</a></b><br>Refers to the stronghold of Zion, which David captures and makes his dwelling place, signifying the establishment of his kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_of_david.htm">City of David</a></b><br>The name given to Jerusalem after David conquers it, marking it as the political and spiritual center of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/supporting_terraces.htm">Supporting Terraces</a></b><br>These are the structures or fortifications that David builds up around the city, indicating his efforts to strengthen and secure his kingdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city that becomes the capital of Israel under David's rule, symbolizing God's chosen place for His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/establishing_god's_kingdom.htm">Establishing God's Kingdom</a></b><br>David's establishment of Jerusalem as the City of David is a model for how believers are to establish God's kingdom in their lives, prioritizing His presence and purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_fortification.htm">Spiritual Fortification</a></b><br>Just as David built up the supporting terraces, Christians are called to fortify their spiritual lives through prayer, scripture, and community, ensuring a strong foundation in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/significance_of_place.htm">Significance of Place</a></b><br>The transformation of Jerusalem into the City of David highlights the importance of dedicating our homes and communities to God, making them centers of worship and service.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_legacy.htm">Leadership and Legacy</a></b><br>David's actions in making Jerusalem his capital demonstrate the impact of godly leadership and the legacy it leaves for future generations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The establishment of Jerusalem as the City of David underscores God's sovereign plan in history, reminding believers of His control and purpose in their lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Samuel_5_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Samuel 5:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/David_s_rise_in_2_Sam_5_9_shows_God_s_faith.htm">How does David's establishment in 2 Samuel 5:9 reflect God's faithfulness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/David_s_leadership_in_2_Samuel_5_9.htm">What leadership qualities does David exhibit in 2 Samuel 5:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_emulate_David_s_spiritual_life.htm">How can we "build all around" our spiritual lives like David did?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/David_s_growth_in_2_Sam_5_9_God_s_provision.htm">What does David's growth in 2 Samuel 5:9 teach about God's provision?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/2_Sam_5_9_God_s_covenant_to_David.htm">How does 2 Samuel 5:9 connect with God's covenant promises to David?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_David_choose_the_fortress.htm">What is the significance of David's choice to dwell in the fortress in 2 Samuel 5:9?

Subsequent kings, as Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/11-27.htm" title="And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of David his father.">1Kings 11:27</a>) and Hezekiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-5.htm" title="Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.">2Chronicles 32:5</a>), saw its importance and added to its strength. On all other sides Zion was protected by precipitous ravines. There is, however, some difference of opinion about the topography of ancient Jerusalem. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David dwelt in the fort.</span> It was the stronghold or citadel of Zion which David took for his abode; but as he needed space for the dwellings of his mighty men, and for those who would soon flock for trade and security to the capital, David proceeded to fortify the whole of the summit. His works began from "the Millo," rendered "the citadel" by the LXX. Many, deriving the name from a Hebrew root signifying to fill, think that it was a mound, but Nature had herself supplied fit heights for defence, and it is evident that the place was called "the Millo" when David captured the city. We find "Beth-Millo" also in <a href="/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6, 20</a>, where it signifies those who held the citadel of Shechem; and this Mills at Jerusalem was without doubt the old Jebusite keep, and the explanation of its name must be sought in the Jebusite language. As it formed one of the strongest defences of the city, it was rebuilt by Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/9-24.htm">1 Kings 9:24</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>), and repaired by Hezekiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>) in preparation for the Assyrian attack. Probably it stood at a corner, whence the phrase, "round about from the Millo and inward," or, as it is expressed in <a href="/1_chronicles/11-8.htm">1 Chronicles 11:8</a>, "from the Millo inward," that is, starting from. the Millo, the walls enclosed the space behind it. In the parallel place (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-8.htm">1 Chronicles 11:8</a>) we find an interesting addition to the narrative, namely, that "Joab repaired the rest of the city." It appears from this that the Jebusites had occupied a good deal of the ground with their habitations, though probably the number of the tribe was not great; or possibly there remained old buildings which were the remains of the Hittite city, and which, being of massive construction, were easily made fit once again for human habitation. We see also proof of Joab's great ability in peace as well as in war. He it was who had captured the stronghold, and it was now his office to arrange the streets and plan of the city, and to assign dwellings to David's mighty men. This would be a work sure to cause jealousy and heart burnings, and no one but Joab, their old commander, could have satisfied them. We find that he assigned to one of them, Uriah the Hittite, a space of ground for a dwelling close to the royal palace. We may suppose, then, that David was now fully reconciled to the "hard sons of Zeruiah" (<a href="/2_samuel/3-39.htm">2 Samuel 3:39</a>), and in the stern wars which followed David's election, he needed and had the full benefit of their vigour and ability. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/5-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took up residence</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;&#353;e&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
