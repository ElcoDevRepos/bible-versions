It reflects a sense of urgency and determination to resolve the situation he created. In biblical narratives, mornings often symbolize new beginnings or decisive actions (<a href="/genesis/19-27.htm">Genesis 19:27</a>, <a href="/exodus/24-4.htm">Exodus 24:4</a>).<p><b>David wrote a letter</b><br>David's decision to write a letter shows his intent to communicate directly with Joab, his military commander. Writing letters was a common practice for conveying orders in ancient times. This act also highlights David's authority and the gravity of the situation, as written orders were binding and official.<p><b>to Joab</b><br>Joab was the commander of David's army and a key figure in his military campaigns. His loyalty to David is evident throughout the narrative, though his methods are often ruthless. Joab's role in this story underscores the complexities of leadership and loyalty in the biblical narrative (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/20-10.htm">2 Samuel 20:10</a>).<p><b>and sent it with Uriah</b><br>The irony in this phrase is profound, as Uriah unknowingly carries his own death warrant. This act demonstrates David's calculated and deceptive nature at this point in the story. Uriah's integrity and loyalty contrast sharply with David's actions, highlighting themes of honor and betrayal. Uriah's role as a Hittite also emphasizes the inclusivity of David's army, as it was not limited to Israelites alone (<a href="/2_samuel/23-39.htm">2 Samuel 23:39</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is orchestrating a plan to cover up his sin with Bathsheba by sending Uriah to the front lines of battle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of David's army, who receives the letter from David instructing him to place Uriah in a dangerous battle position.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/uriah.htm">Uriah</a></b><br>A Hittite and one of David's mighty men, who is unknowingly carrying his own death warrant back to the battlefield.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The wife of Uriah, with whom David committed adultery, setting off the chain of events leading to this moment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where David resides and from where he sends the letter to Joab.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_deceptive_nature_of_sin.htm">The Deceptive Nature of Sin</a></b><br>Sin often leads to further sin.

David&#8217;s haste echoes Pharaoh rising &#8220;during the night&#8221; to chase Israel (<a href="/exodus/12-30.htm">Exodus 12:30&#8211;31</a>) and Ahab&#8217;s early plotting against Naboth (<a href="/1_kings/21-16.htm">1 Kings 21:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Morning, meant for new mercies (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22&#8211;23</a>), is here seized for darker purposes, illustrating how rebellion warps good gifts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>David wrote a letter</b><p>&#8226; Kings were to write &#8220;a copy of this law&#8221; to guide them (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18&#8211;20</a>), yet David uses his pen to violate that very law.<p>&#8226; Like Ahab&#8217;s letters ordering Naboth&#8217;s death (<a href="/1_kings/21-8.htm">1 Kings 21:8&#8211;10</a>), David&#8217;s royal script becomes an instrument of injustice.<p>&#8226; The contrast is stark with earlier moments when David&#8217;s words brought life&#8212;singing psalms (<a href="/2_samuel/22-1.htm">2 Samuel 22:1</a>)&#8212;now his words usher death (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To Joab</b><p>&#8226; Joab, commander and nephew, had previously fought for David&#8217;s righteous causes (<a href="/2_samuel/10-7.htm">2 Samuel 10:7&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s command chain is co-opted for personal cover-up, anticipating Joab&#8217;s later readiness to kill Absalom against David&#8217;s wishes (<a href="/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14</a>).

Morning light cannot cleanse a heart set on concealment. The king&#8217;s pen writes what the king&#8217;s heart has already decided, dragging Joab into complicity and betraying faithful Uriah. The verse warns that unchecked desire hardens quickly into deliberate action, yet it also prepares the stage for God&#8217;s confrontation (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>) and eventual forgiveness (<a href="/bsb/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>), reminding us that even grievous sin is not beyond the reach of divine mercy when confessed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Sent it by the hand of Uriah.</span>--The brave soldier is made the bearer of his own death-warrant, and his well-known valour for his king is to be the means of accomplishing his destruction, to relieve that king of the consequences of his crime, which also involved a great wrong to himself. No reason is given to Joab for this order, but as a loyal and somewhat unscrupulous general he obeys without question.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David wrote a letter.</span> David now uses the knowledge he had acquired in the schools of the prophets for vicious purposes. For it to be a blessing, knowledge must be sanctified to holy use. The letter would conceal from Joab the truth, and only let him know that Uriah, during his visit to Jerusalem, had incurred the king's serious displeasure; and we may be quite sure that Joab would be very indignant when he learned, as he certainly soon would, that David had made him his tool, and caused him to murder one of "the mighties" in order to cover the shame of his adultery. The only fair side of the picture is that it shews the high state of morality among the people. The crimes of kings and great men are usually lightly pardoned, and especially that of adultery. Even in our own and other Christian countries this is the case; but David has to resort to extreme measures rather than face the indignation of his subjects. Unfortunately, the shedding of blood was not looked upon with equal horror. Possibly the leaving it to the relatives to requite it made the suppression of murder the business, not of the state, but of "the avenger of blood." At all events, Joab without much compunction carries out David's orders, caring to know no more than that Uriah was out of favour. And what is more extraordinary, David remains utterly callous for a whole twelvemonth (see <a href="/2_samuel/12-15.htm">2 Samuel 12:15</a>), and his conscience does not even smite him for the additional meanness of sending the order for Uriah's murder by the hand of the injured man himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/11-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The next morning</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1428;&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;ab&#183;b&#333;&#183;qer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
