It reflects the need for David to take immediate responsibility as a leader. In the context of ancient Israel, kings were expected to be decisive and proactive, especially in times of crisis. This command comes after Absalom's rebellion, highlighting the need for David to reassert his authority.<p><b>Go out and speak comfort to your servants,</b><br>David's men had risked their lives for him, and they needed reassurance and gratitude from their king. In the cultural context of the time, a leader's presence and words were crucial for maintaining loyalty and morale. This reflects the biblical principle of shepherd leadership, where a leader cares for and encourages their followers, similar to how Jesus comforts His disciples in <a href="/john/14.htm">John 14:1</a>.<p><b>for I swear by the LORD</b><br>This oath underscores the seriousness of the situation. Swearing by the LORD was a solemn act, invoking God's name as a witness to the truth and importance of the statement. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God's name was invoked in matters of great significance.<p><b>that if you do not go out,</b><br>The conditional nature of this statement highlights the potential consequences of inaction. It underscores the importance of David's role as king and the immediate need for him to act. This reflects the biblical theme of obedience and the consequences of failing to fulfill one's God-given responsibilities.<p><b>not a man will remain with you tonight.</b><br>This warning indicates the fragility of David's support among his followers. In the historical context, loyalty was often contingent on a leader's ability to inspire and lead effectively. The potential for desertion reflects the human tendency to follow strong, present leadership, as seen in other biblical narratives like Saul's reign.<p><b>This will be worse for you than all the adversity that has befallen you from your youth until now!&#8221;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the gravity of the situation by comparing it to the cumulative hardships David had faced, including Saul's persecution and Absalom's rebellion. It serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of failing to act. The reference to David's past adversities highlights the ongoing spiritual and leadership challenges he faced, drawing a parallel to the trials faced by Jesus, who also endured suffering and rejection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is mourning the death of his son Absalom.
