The context is the civil war in Israel, where Absalom, David's son, has rebelled against his father. The "men" refers to David's troops, who were fighting in the forest of Ephraim. The forest setting is significant, as it was dense and treacherous, contributing to the chaos of the battle. The phrase suggests the importance of eyewitness testimony in the narrative, highlighting the role of individuals in the unfolding events.<p><b>he told Joab</b><br>Joab was the commander of David's army and a key military leader throughout David's reign. His role in the narrative is complex; he is both a loyal servant to David and a ruthless enforcer of his own will. Joab's leadership is crucial in the battle against Absalom, and his actions often reflect a pragmatic, if sometimes brutal, approach to maintaining David's kingdom. This phrase underscores the chain of command and the communication necessary in military operations.<p><b>&#8220;I just saw Absalom</b><br>Absalom is a central figure in this narrative, known for his rebellion against his father, King David. His character is marked by ambition, charisma, and a tragic downfall. Absalom's rebellion is a fulfillment of Nathan's prophecy to David regarding the consequences of his sin with Bathsheba (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>). The mention of Absalom here highlights the tension between father and son and the personal nature of the conflict.<p><b>hanging in an oak tree!&#8221;</b><br>The image of Absalom hanging in an oak tree is both literal and symbolic. Literally, Absalom's long hair, which he was known for, became entangled in the branches, leaving him vulnerable. Symbolically, this moment represents the downfall of pride and rebellion. The oak tree, a strong and enduring symbol, contrasts with Absalom's fleeting power and ambition. This event fulfills the prophecy of Absalom's demise and serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of rebellion against God's anointed king. The imagery also foreshadows the concept of being "hung on a tree," which in the New Testament is associated with the curse of sin and Christ's redemptive sacrifice (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The son of King David, known for his rebellion against his father.

Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/18-9.htm">2 Samuel 18:9</a>). One ordinary soldier, not a commander or prophet, becomes the eyewitness God uses to move the story forward&#8212;reminding us of how the Lord often works through &#8220;insignificant&#8221; people (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/17-55.htm">1 Samuel 17:55</a>; <a href="/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;saw this&#8221; roots the event in real history; nothing here is allegory. David&#8217;s army is battling Absalom&#8217;s rebels, and the Lord&#8217;s providence places Absalom in a literal tree.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s eyes &#8220;roam throughout the earth&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>); likewise, human eyes see what He chooses to reveal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he told Joab</b><p>&#8226; Joab is David&#8217;s seasoned commander (<a href="/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16</a>). Receiving frontline intelligence is crucial for military leadership, and the soldier&#8217;s loyalty to the chain of command contrasts with Absalom&#8217;s disloyalty to his father (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/15-6.htm">2 Samuel 15:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Speaking up carries risk&#8212;Joab&#8217;s reputation for swift, sometimes ruthless action (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/11-16.htm">2 Samuel 11:16</a>) means the messenger could face blame if things go poorly. Yet truth must be reported (<a href="/proverbs/14-25.htm">Proverbs 14:25</a>).<p>&#8226; The episode reflects the biblical principle of bringing matters to those in authority (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I just saw Absalom</b><p>&#8226; Naming Absalom underscores the personal nature of rebellion. This is not an anonymous enemy; it is David&#8217;s own son (<a href="/bsb/2_samuel/13.htm">2 Samuel 13&#8211;15</a>). Family betrayal intensifies the tragedy (<a href="/psalms/55-12.htm">Psalm 55:12&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Absalom&#8217;s handsome appearance and charisma had wooed Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/14-25.htm">2 Samuel 14:25</a>; 15:6), but the soldier&#8217;s words strip away glamour&#8212;Absalom is now helpless. Scripture warns that those who exalt themselves will be humbled (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>; <a href="/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The immediacy of &#8220;I just saw&#8221; conveys urgency. Judgment is unfolding in real time (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>hanging in an oak tree!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The detail fulfills God&#8217;s justice: Absalom, who stole hearts &#8220;standing beside the road&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/15-2.htm">2 Samuel 15:2</a>), is now literally suspended between heaven and earth, belonging fully to neither (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/21-22.htm">Deuteronomy 21:22&#8211;23</a> regarding the curse of a hanged man).<p>&#8226; Oaks often symbolize strength (<a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11</a>), yet the very tree becomes the trap&#8212;illustrating how a person&#8217;s perceived strengths can turn against him (<a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Absalom&#8217;s head, noted for its heavy hair (<a href="/2_samuel/14-26.htm">2 Samuel 14:26</a>), is likely what snagged him. Pride becomes the instrument of downfall (<a href="/proverbs/11-2.htm">Proverbs 11:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene invites comparison with the ultimate Son who was also hanged on a tree, yet bore our curse to bring salvation (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>), the righteous opposite of Absalom&#8217;s rebellion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/18-10.htm">2 Samuel 18:10</a> captures the pivotal moment when God&#8217;s justice intersects human action. An unnamed soldier sees Absalom helplessly caught in an oak, promptly reports to Joab, and sets in motion the end of the rebellion. The verse highlights the value of faithful witness, the certainty that pride leads to downfall, and the sovereign hand guiding every detail.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/18-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1428;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_259.htm">Strong's 259: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, one, first</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saw this,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he told</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yag&#183;g&#234;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5046.htm">Strong's 5046: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be conspicuous</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Joab,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1425;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3097.htm">Strong's 3097: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joab -- 'the LORD is father', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;I just</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
