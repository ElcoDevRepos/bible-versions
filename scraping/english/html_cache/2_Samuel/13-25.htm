David's use of "my son" reflects a personal and familial relationship, emphasizing the intimacy and authority he holds as both father and king. In the context of ancient Israel, the king was seen as a father figure to the nation, and this familial language underscores the personal nature of the interaction. David's response also indicates a decision-making process that considers the implications of his actions, a common theme in his reign.<p><b>&#8220;we should not all go, or we would be a burden to you.&#8221;</b><br>David's concern about being a burden reflects the logistical and economic considerations of royal travel in ancient times. A king's visit would require significant resources, including food, lodging, and security, which could strain the host's resources. This reflects the cultural norms of hospitality in the ancient Near East, where hosting a king and his entourage would be a significant undertaking. David's sensitivity to this burden shows his awareness of the responsibilities and potential strain on Absalom's household.<p><b>Although Absalom urged him,</b><br>Absalom's insistence on David's attendance reveals his determination and possibly ulterior motives. In the broader narrative, Absalom's actions are often driven by ambition and a desire to assert his influence. This urging could be seen as part of his strategy to gain favor or manipulate circumstances to his advantage. The persistence of Absalom also highlights the dynamics of royal family relationships, where personal desires often intersect with political ambitions.<p><b>he was not willing to go,</b><br>David's refusal to attend despite Absalom's urging suggests a discernment or caution on his part. This decision may reflect David's awareness of potential political or familial tensions, as well as his understanding of the broader implications of his presence. In the context of David's life, marked by both triumphs and personal failures, this decision could be seen as an attempt to avoid unnecessary complications or conflicts.<p><b>but gave him his blessing.</b><br>By giving his blessing, David extends his approval and goodwill, which carries significant weight in the cultural and religious context of ancient Israel. A father's blessing was considered a powerful and meaningful act, often associated with the transfer of authority or favor. This blessing could be seen as an attempt to maintain peace and goodwill within the family, despite his physical absence. In biblical narratives, blessings often carry prophetic significance, and David's blessing may foreshadow future events in Absalom's life and the unfolding of God's plan for Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The reigning king of Israel, father of Absalom, and a central figure in the account.

The verse showcases wise restraint, humble leadership, and the danger of hidden sin operating beneath polite insistence. God&#8217;s inerrant record reminds us that prudent decisions, grounded in love and humility, often serve as unseen shields against schemes we cannot yet perceive.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But blessed him.</span> These words, in the courtly language of the East, not only mean that David parted from Absalom with kindly feelings and good wishes, but that he made him a rich present (see note on 1 Samuel 25:27, where the same word occurs; and observe the nature of Abigail's blessing described there). David's court had evidently become lavish, when thus a visit from him to his son's farm would be too costly for the young prince's means; but had he so increased his present as to have made it reasonable for himself and his chief officers to go, Absalom must have deferred his crime. As it was, the invitation put David off his guard, and, forgetting the fatal consequences of his good nature in permitting Tamar's visit to Amnon, he allowed his sons to go to the festival. Nor must we blame him for his compliance. He had probably at first been full of anxiety as to the course Absalom might pursue, but his silence and forbearance made him suppose that Tamar's wrong had not caused her brother any deep sorrow. Himself a man of warm feelings, he had expected an immediate outburst of anger, but such stern rancour persevered in for so long a time with such feline calmness of manner was beyond the range of his suspicions; and the invitation, first to himself and then to all his sons, made him suppose that Absalom had nothing but affectionate feelings toward them all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/13-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;No,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_408.htm">Strong's 408: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my son,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
