The mention of "after him" refers to the previous mighty warrior, Eleazar, indicating Shammah's place in this esteemed group. The name "Shammah" means "astonishment" or "desolation," which may reflect his formidable presence on the battlefield. "Son of Agee" identifies his lineage, while "the Hararite" suggests his origin, possibly from the region of Harar, though the exact location is uncertain. This designation highlights the diverse backgrounds of David's warriors, unified under his leadership.<p><b>When the Philistines had banded together near a field full of lentils,</b><br>The Philistines were a persistent enemy of Israel, often engaging in battles to assert dominance over the region. Their gathering "near a field full of lentils" indicates a strategic move to control agricultural resources, vital for sustenance and economic stability. Lentils were a common crop in ancient Israel, providing essential nutrition. The Philistines' choice of location underscores their intent to disrupt Israel's food supply, a tactic used to weaken their adversaries. This scenario reflects the ongoing struggle between Israel and the Philistines, a theme prevalent throughout the books of Samuel.<p><b>Israel&#8217;s troops fled from them.</b><br>The flight of Israel's troops highlights a moment of fear and retreat in the face of the Philistine threat. This reaction contrasts with the bravery expected of Israel's warriors, emphasizing the dire situation and the overwhelming nature of the Philistine forces. Such instances of retreat are not uncommon in the biblical narrative, often serving as a backdrop for God to demonstrate His power through unlikely heroes. In this context, Shammah's subsequent actions (though not detailed in this verse) would showcase his courage and faith, reminiscent of other biblical figures who stood firm against overwhelming odds, such as David against Goliath.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shammah.htm">Shammah</a></b><br>One of David's mighty warriors, known for his bravery and faithfulness.

Israel&#8217;s retreat contrasts sharply with Shammah&#8217;s courage, preparing us for the victory God will grant through one resolute believer. The verse reminds us that when others flee, God can still secure His people&#8217;s provision and honor His name through a single obedient heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Into a troop.</span>--Josephus, using different vowels, read "to Lehi," the scene of Samson's exploit (<a href="/judges/15-9.htm" title="Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi.">Judges 15:9</a>; <a href="/judges/15-19.htm" title="But God split an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water out of there; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: why he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in Lehi to this day.">Judges 15:19</a>); but as the same word recurs in <a href="/2_samuel/23-13.htm" title="And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time to the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.">2Samuel 23:13</a>, clearly in the sense of "troop," the English reading should be retained.<p><span class= "bld">Lentiles.</span>--Chronicles has "barley." The two words might easily be confounded in the Hebrew, and it is quite immaterial which is correct; the point is that the Philistines had made a foray to gather the ripe crops, the Israelites were terrified and fled, while Shammah, by his courage and valour, turned the tide of battle, and won a great victory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Into a troop.</span> Josephus renders it "to Lehi," the scene of Samson's exploit.
