There was much personal regard for the child, which had been made the more precious by these very eyelets. But David's sorrow was, as we have seen, that of penitence, and not that of natural affection. When, therefore, the threatened penalty had been paid by the death of the child, David felt it to be his duty to show his resignation, and therefore he went into the sanctuary and worshipped, in proof that he acknowledged the justice of God's dealings, and was content to bear the punishment as his righteous desert. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/12-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1448;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">got up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1501;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;q&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
