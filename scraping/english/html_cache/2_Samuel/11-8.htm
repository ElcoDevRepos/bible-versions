This interaction occurs after David's adultery with Bathsheba, Uriah's wife. David's intent is to cover up his sin by making it appear that Uriah is the father of Bathsheba's child. Uriah's loyalty and integrity contrast sharply with David's actions, highlighting themes of honor and deception.<p><b>&#8220;Go down to your house and wash your feet.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase is a euphemism for relaxation and comfort, suggesting that Uriah should enjoy the comforts of home, including being with his wife. In ancient Near Eastern culture, washing one's feet was a common practice upon entering a home, symbolizing rest and hospitality. David's suggestion is laden with ulterior motives, as he hopes Uriah will sleep with Bathsheba, thus concealing the king's sin.<p><b>So Uriah left the palace,</b><br>Uriah's obedience to the king is evident as he leaves the royal palace. The palace, located in Jerusalem, was the center of David's reign and a symbol of his authority. Uriah's departure signifies his respect for the king's command, yet his subsequent actions reveal his steadfast loyalty to his fellow soldiers and the ark of God, which were still in battle.<p><b>and a gift from the king followed him.</b><br>The gift, likely food or other provisions, was intended to encourage Uriah to go home and enjoy a time of feasting and intimacy with his wife. This act of sending a gift was a customary gesture of goodwill and favor from a king. However, in this context, it underscores David's manipulation and the lengths he is willing to go to hide his transgression. The narrative foreshadows the tragic consequences of David's sin, as seen in the unfolding events of 2 Samuel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is central to this account.

By speaking to Uriah directly, the king masks his ulterior motive under a veneer of royal concern. Similar moments of kings using private words for hidden agendas appear in <a href="/1_kings/21-1.htm">1 Kings 21:1&#8211;10</a> (Ahab with Naboth).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go down to your house</b><p>The command sounds like kindness&#8212;encouraging rest after battle&#8212;yet it is part of David&#8217;s scheme to make Uriah appear the father of Bathsheba&#8217;s child (<a href="/2_samuel/11-4.htm">2 Samuel 11:4&#8211;5, 12</a>). Sending a soldier home in the midst of war clashes with the ethic seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/23-9.htm">Deuteronomy 23:9&#8211;11</a>, where warriors maintain focus and purity while camped. Uriah&#8217;s later refusal (<a href="/2_samuel/11-10.htm">2 Samuel 11:10&#8211;11</a>) underlines his loyalty to both army and ark, echoing the soldierly single-mindedness Paul later commends (<a href="/2_timothy/2-4.htm">2 Timothy 2:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and wash your feet</b><p>In Scripture, foot washing speaks of hospitality and refreshment: Abraham offers it to the three visitors (<a href="/genesis/18-4.htm">Genesis 18:4</a>), and Jesus models humble service by washing His disciples&#8217; feet (<a href="/john/13-5.htm">John 13:5</a>). Here David&#8217;s words invite Uriah to relax, bathe, and enjoy marital privileges (cf. <a href="/proverbs/5-18.htm">Proverbs 5:18&#8211;19</a>). Behind the gentle imagery, however, lies the intent to conceal sin (<a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3&#8211;4</a> shows how hidden sin weighs on the conscience).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So Uriah left the palace</b><p>Uriah obeys the king&#8217;s immediate instruction, demonstrating respect for authority (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). Yet he does not proceed home; instead he sleeps at the entrance with the servants (<a href="/2_samuel/11-9.htm">2 Samuel 11:9</a>). His choice mirrors the self-denial of warriors like Gideon&#8217;s three hundred who stayed alert (<a href="/judges/7-5.htm">Judges 7:5&#8211;7</a>) and highlights the stark contrast between Uriah&#8217;s integrity and David&#8217;s deception.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and a gift from the king followed him</b><p>David sends food or provisions after Uriah, a customary royal gesture (<a href="/esther/2-18.htm">Esther 2:18</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/16-1.htm">2 Samuel 16:1&#8211;2</a>). <a href="/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16</a> observes that &#8220;A man&#8217;s gift makes room for him,&#8221; and David hopes this generosity will soften Uriah. Instead, the gift becomes evidence of manipulation, foreshadowing the escalation to a fatal plot (<a href="/2_samuel/11-14.htm">2 Samuel 11:14&#8211;15</a>) and reminding us that external benevolence can cloak internal wrongdoing (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27&#8211;28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every phrase of <a href="/2_samuel/11-8.htm">2 Samuel 11:8</a> exposes David&#8217;s strategy to hide sin through calculated kindness. The verse contrasts royal privilege with soldierly fidelity, hospitality with hypocrisy, and earthly gifts with moral compromise. Uriah&#8217;s steadfast honor sets the stage for God&#8217;s eventual confrontation of David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1&#8211;7</a>), underscoring that the Lord sees past appearances and judges truthfully (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">A mess of meat.</span>--Lit. <span class= "ital">a present. </span>The same word is used in <a href="/genesis/43-34.htm" title="And he took and sent messes to them from before him: but Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of theirs.

Uriah, as one of David's thirty-seven heroes, would hold a high rank in the army, though the statement given by Josephus, that he was Joab's armour bearer, is probably a mere conjecture, made with the view of explaining what seemed to him strange, that a foreigner should hold so distinguished a place among the captains of Israel. David sends for him, on the pretext that he wanted full information of Joab's plans, and the state of the army, and the progress of the siege of Rabbah. And so prompt is Uriah, that he goes to the king still soiled with travel, and without calling at his house. And David makes his inquiries, listens with apparent interest to the narrative of the war, and, after receiving a full report, bids Uriah go home and rest and refresh himself after the journey. He sends him, moreover, a present, such probably as was usual after special service, but large and liberal, so as to put Uriah in good humour. But the old soldier cared for war more than for pleasure, and, instead of going to his house, spent the night in the guard room with the soldiers and others who were in attendance upon the king (see <a href="/1_kings/14-27.htm">1 Kings 14:27, 28</a>). All would be eager for news of friends and relatives, and it was a far greater delight to Uriah to chat with his old comrades than to be resting luxuriously in his own home. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/11-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then [he]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
