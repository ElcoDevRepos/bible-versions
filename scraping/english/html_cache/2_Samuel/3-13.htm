This reflects his strategic mindset and political acumen. David, anointed by God as king, often sought to unify the kingdom under his rule, and this agreement would further that goal. His response also shows his readiness to reconcile and build alliances, a common practice among ancient Near Eastern kings to strengthen their reign.<p><b>&#8220;I will make a covenant with you.&#8221;</b><br>Covenants in the biblical context were solemn agreements, often involving mutual commitments and obligations. David's offer to make a covenant signifies a formal and binding agreement, which was a serious and sacred undertaking. This reflects the biblical theme of covenants as seen with Noah, Abraham, and Moses, where God established His promises with His people. David's covenant here is a political move to solidify his claim to the throne and ensure loyalty from Abner, Saul's former commander.<p><b>But there is one thing I require of you:</b><br>David sets a condition for the covenant, demonstrating his wisdom and foresight. By placing a requirement, David ensures that the agreement is not only beneficial to him but also addresses his personal and political needs. This reflects the biblical principle of counting the cost and ensuring that agreements are equitable and serve a greater purpose.<p><b>Do not appear before me unless you bring Saul&#8217;s daughter Michal when you come to see me.&#8221;</b><br>Michal, Saul's daughter, was David's first wife, whom Saul had given to another man during David's exile. By demanding her return, David asserts his rights and strengthens his claim to Saul's legacy. This move is both personal and political, as Michal's return would symbolize David's legitimate connection to Saul's house, thus reinforcing his position as king. The demand for Michal also fulfills the bride price David paid with the defeat of the Philistines, highlighting themes of justice and restitution. This action foreshadows the restoration and reconciliation themes found in the New Testament, where Christ restores and reconciles humanity to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who is in the process of consolidating his rule over the nation.

He welcomes reconciliation, establishes a covenant for national unity, requires integrity as proof of loyalty, and insists on restoring his rightful marriage to Michal, securing both personal honor and divine order. The verse underscores that God&#8217;s promises are advanced through leaders who hold firm to His statutes while navigating complex human affairs.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Except thou first bring Michal.</span>--David consents to negotiate with Abner only on condition of the previous restoration of his lawful wife. Besides the justice of this demand (Michal having been wrongfully taken from him by Saul), and besides all question of affection towards one who had loved him and saved his life (<a href="/1_samuel/18-20.htm" title="And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.">1Samuel 18:20</a>; <a href="/context/1_samuel/19-11.htm" title="Saul also sent messengers to David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If you save not your life to night, to morrow you shall be slain.">1Samuel 19:11-17</a>), there were political reasons of importance for the demand. The demand itself showed to all Israel that he bore no malice against the house of Saul, and the restoration would again constitute him Saul's son-in-law, and thus further his claims to the throne; while it also showed publicly that he was in a condition to enforce his rights as against the house of Saul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Except thou first bring Michal.</span> Besides David's affection for Michal, there were political reasons for demanding her restoration. Saul's despotic act in giving her in marriage to another man (<a href="/1_samuel/25-44.htm">1 Samuel 25:44</a>) had been a public disavowal of David as the son-in-law of the royal house, and equivalent to a proclamation of outlawry. David's rights were all declared null by such an act. But now Ishbosheth must with equal publicity reverse his father's deed, and restore to David his lost position. It must have been a most painful humiliation to him to be driven thus to cancel his father's decree, and declare thereby to all Israel that he was unable to refuse hie assent to whatever his rival demanded. And for this reason David sent his messengers directly to Ishbosheth, because the importance of Michal's surrender to him lay in its being a public act of the state.
