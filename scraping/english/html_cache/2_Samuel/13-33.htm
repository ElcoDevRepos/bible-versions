In the context of ancient Israel, the king was seen as God's anointed leader, and addressing him with such respect was customary. This reflects the cultural norms of the time, where authority figures were approached with deference.<p><b>do not take to heart the report</b><br>The phrase "do not take to heart" suggests an attempt to calm or reassure. In biblical times, news was often spread by word of mouth, and initial reports could be exaggerated or inaccurate. The speaker is urging King David not to be overwhelmed by the initial, possibly misleading, news. This reflects a common biblical theme of seeking truth and not being swayed by rumors or fear, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>, which warns against answering a matter before hearing it fully.<p><b>that all the sons of the king are dead</b><br>This part of the message addresses a specific fear that King David might have had&#8212;that all his heirs were killed. The context here is the aftermath of Absalom's revenge against Amnon for the rape of their sister Tamar. The fear of losing all his sons would have been devastating for David, not only personally but also for the future of his dynasty. This reflects the importance of lineage and succession in the ancient Near Eastern context, where the continuity of a royal line was crucial for maintaining power and stability.<p><b>Only Amnon is dead.</b><br>This statement clarifies the situation, indicating that the tragedy is not as extensive as initially feared. Amnon's death is significant because he was the firstborn son of David and the heir apparent. His death, orchestrated by Absalom, sets off a chain of events that leads to further family and national turmoil. This reflects the biblical theme of the consequences of sin, as Amnon's actions against Tamar and Absalom's subsequent revenge both stem from moral failings. The death of Amnon also foreshadows the eventual downfall of Absalom, illustrating the destructive cycle of sin and retribution within David's family.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, father of Amnon and Absalom.

Moments earlier, David received a terrifying rumor that &#8220;Absalom has killed all the king&#8217;s sons&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/13-30.htm">2 Samuel 13:30&#8211;31</a>).<p>- Jonadab immediately steps in &#8220;now&#8221; to halt a spiraling crisis, much like the angel&#8217;s &#8220;now&#8221; that stayed Abraham&#8217;s knife (<a href="/genesis/22-11.htm">Genesis 22:11&#8211;12</a>) or Nathan&#8217;s &#8220;now therefore&#8221; that offered David forgiveness (<a href="/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>).<p>- Scripture often uses a timely &#8220;now&#8221; to redirect human emotion toward God&#8217;s truth (<a href="/joshua/1-2.htm">Joshua 1:2</a>; <a href="/luke/2-10.htm">Luke 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>my lord the king</b><p>- Jonadab speaks with full respect for God-ordained authority (<a href="/1_samuel/24-8.htm">1 Samuel 24:8</a>; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p>- Addressing David personally steadies him: grief is met with honor, not hysteria.<p>- The phrase reminds us that leaders need truthful, respectful counsel (<a href="/proverbs/25-12.htm">Proverbs 25:12</a>; 27:9).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>do not take to heart</b><p>- Literally, &#8220;do not let it lay on your heart.&#8221; The command echoes Jesus&#8217; &#8220;Do not let your hearts be troubled&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-1.htm">John 14:1</a>).<p>- Jonadab is not telling David to ignore reality but to refuse a lie. Similar counsel appears in <a href="/psalms/37-1.htm">Psalm 37:1</a> and <a href="/isaiah/7-4.htm">Isaiah 7:4</a>&#8212;believers are told to steady their hearts when frightening news first strikes.<p>- This line models how to stand between a rumor and a broken parent: bring calm before facts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the report</b><p>- The &#8220;report&#8221; (Hebrew: news, rumor) had raced ahead of truth, as in <a href="/job/1-14.htm">Job 1:14&#8211;19</a>.<p>- Proverbs warns, &#8220;The simple believes every word&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/14-15.htm">Proverbs 14:15</a>). Jonadab urges discernment, a vital discipline when emotions run high (<a href="/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17</a>).<p>- False or exaggerated reports can wound more deeply than reality (<a href="/2_samuel/1-4.htm">2 Samuel 1:4&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that all the sons of the king are dead</b><p>- The claim was plausible: Absalom had ordered his men, &#8220;Strike Amnon&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/13-28.htm">2 Samuel 13:28&#8211;29</a>). Panic filled in the blanks.<p>- Satan often amplifies tragedy to paralyze God&#8217;s people (<a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>; <a href="/job/1-13.htm">Job 1:13&#8211;19</a>).<p>- The verse underscores how swift, unchecked conclusions can magnify sorrow (<a href="/psalms/112-7.htm">Psalm 112:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Only Amnon is dead</b><p>- Jonadab clarifies the limited scope: Absalom targeted Amnon alone for the rape of Tamar (<a href="/2_samuel/13-2.htm">2 Samuel 13:2, 22</a>).<p>- Even in judgment, God restrains further bloodshed; none of David&#8217;s other sons die here (<a href="/psalms/103-10.htm">Psalm 103:10</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22</a>).<p>- The line fulfills Nathan&#8217;s earlier prophecy of family turmoil (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10</a>), yet shows God&#8217;s mercy&#8212;discipline, not annihilation (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/13-33.htm">2 Samuel 13:33</a> is Jonadab&#8217;s urgent, respectful reassurance to David. He arrests a deadly rumor, directs the king away from paralyzing grief, and reports the measured truth: only Amnon has fallen. The verse teaches discernment in crisis, the power of calm counsel, and the mercy of God who limits judgment even amid deserved discipline.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/13-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So now,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1441;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
