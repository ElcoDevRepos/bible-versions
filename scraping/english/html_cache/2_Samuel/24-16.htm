The angel, acting as an agent of divine retribution, is poised to execute God's judgment. This event occurs after David's census, which was seen as an act of pride and lack of trust in God. The angel's action is reminiscent of the angel of death in <a href="/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>, highlighting the seriousness of divine judgment. Jerusalem, as the city of David and the future site of the temple, holds significant theological importance, making the potential destruction particularly grave.<p><b>the LORD relented from the calamity</b><br>Here, the LORD's relenting demonstrates His mercy and compassion. This is consistent with God's character as described in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where He is "compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness." The Hebrew word for "relented" can also mean to have compassion or to be moved to pity, indicating a change in response due to David's repentance and intercession. This moment underscores the biblical theme that God is willing to forgive and withhold judgment when there is genuine repentance.<p><b>and said to the angel who was destroying the people, &#8220;Enough! Withdraw your hand now!&#8221;</b><br>God's command to the angel to cease the destruction highlights His sovereign control over all events. The phrase "Enough! Withdraw your hand now!" signifies a decisive halt to the judgment, emphasizing God's authority over life and death. This intervention reflects God's responsiveness to human repentance and intercession, as seen in other biblical narratives such as Abraham's intercession for Sodom in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a>. It also illustrates the power of prayer and repentance in altering the course of divine judgment.<p><b>At that time the angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.</b><br>The location of the angel at the threshing floor of Araunah is significant both geographically and theologically. Threshing floors were often situated on elevated ground, making them suitable for divine encounters. This particular site would later become the location for Solomon's temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/3.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>), marking it as a place of worship and sacrifice. Araunah, a Jebusite, represents the original inhabitants of Jerusalem, indicating the city's transition from a Jebusite stronghold to the center of Israelite worship. This event foreshadows the future significance of the temple as a place where God's mercy and presence would dwell among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger sent by God to execute judgment on Israel due to David's sin of conducting a census.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel who shows mercy by halting the destruction.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who ordered the census, leading to God's judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, which was spared from destruction.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/araunah_the_jebusite.htm">Araunah the Jebusite</a></b><br>The owner of the threshing floor where the angel halted, a significant location for future events.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_mercy_in_judgment.htm">God's Mercy in Judgment</a></b><br>Even in His righteous judgment, God shows mercy.

The pestilence plainly was not a natural visitation; though possibly the means used was a simoom, or poisonous wind, advancing with terrible rapidity throughout Israel. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord repented.</span> In all the dealings of God's providence, his actions are made to depend upon human conduct. Looked at from above, from God's side, all things are foreknown and immutably fixed; looked at from man's side, all is perpetually changing as man changes. The rescue of Jerusalem as the result of David's penitence and prayers, is thus to human view a change in the counsels and even in the feelings of him who changeth not. <span class="cmt_word">The threshing place.</span> "The threshing floor," as rightly translated in vers. 18, 21, 24. Threshing floors were constructed, whenever possible, on eminences, that the wind might drive the chaff and dust away. Araunah's was on the east of Jerusalem, outside the walls, upon Mount Moriah, and was the site on which the temple was built (see <a href="/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Araunah</span>. The name is so spelt seven times in vers. 20-24, for which reason the Massorites have substituted it for <span class="accented">Avarnah</span>, found in this verse in the Hebrew text, and for <span class="accented">Aranyah</span> in ver. 18. In <a href="/1_chronicles/21.htm">1 Chronicles 21</a> the name is spelt <span class="accented">Ornan</span>; in the Septuagint in all places, <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;</span>, <span class="accented">Orna</span>, and in the Syriac, <span class="accented">Oron.</span> The name is, of course, a Jebusite word, and the variation arises from the narrators having written down the sound as it caught their ears. In this, as in many other particulars, it is clear that the chronicler derived his account from independent Sources. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/24-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But when the angel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1445;&#1498;&#1456;
