It reflects the historical context of David's conquest of Jerusalem, a pivotal event in establishing his reign over Israel. The phrase suggests a turning point, emphasizing the importance of the events that follow.<p><b>&#8220;Whoever attacks the Jebusites</b><br>The Jebusites were the original inhabitants of Jerusalem, a Canaanite tribe that had maintained control of the city despite previous Israelite attempts to conquer it. This phrase highlights the challenge David faced in capturing Jerusalem, a strategically significant city due to its central location and defensible position. The Jebusites' presence in Jerusalem is a reminder of the incomplete conquest of Canaan, as described in the Book of Joshua.<p><b>must use the water shaft</b><br>The water shaft, or "tsinnor" in Hebrew, refers to a tunnel or conduit used to access the city's water supply. Archaeological discoveries, such as Warren's Shaft, provide evidence of ancient water systems in Jerusalem. This phrase indicates a strategic military tactic employed by David's forces to infiltrate the city, showcasing David's wisdom and resourcefulness as a leader.<p><b>to reach the lame and blind who are despised by David.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase has been interpreted in various ways, often seen as a metaphorical expression rather than a literal reference to individuals with disabilities. It may refer to the Jebusites' taunts, claiming that even the "lame and blind" could defend the city against David's forces. The phrase underscores the contempt and defiance of the Jebusites, as well as David's determination to overcome their resistance.<p><b>That is why it is said,</b><br>This phrase introduces a proverbial saying or common expression that arose from the events described. It suggests that the actions and outcomes of this day became well-known and were memorialized in the cultural memory of Israel.<p><b>&#8220;The blind and the lame will never enter the palace.&#8221;</b><br>This saying reflects the outcome of David's conquest and the establishment of his rule in Jerusalem. It may symbolize the exclusion of those who opposed David or represent a broader principle of purity and fitness for service in the royal court. The phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, foreshadowing the ultimate establishment of a kingdom where spiritual wholeness and righteousness prevail, as seen in the New Testament's depiction of Jesus healing the blind and lame.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The newly anointed king of Israel, who is establishing his rule and seeking to capture Jerusalem from the Jebusites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jebusites.htm">Jebusites</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Jerusalem, who were confident in their stronghold and mocked David's ability to conquer them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city that David sought to capture and make the political and spiritual center of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/water_shaft.htm">Water Shaft</a></b><br>A strategic point of entry into the city, which David's men used to gain access and conquer the Jebusites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lame_and_the_blind.htm">The Lame and the Blind</a></b><br>A metaphorical reference to the Jebusites' taunt, suggesting that even the weakest defenders could repel David's forces.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/strategic_leadership.htm">Strategic Leadership</a></b><br>David's use of the water shaft demonstrates the importance of strategic thinking and innovation in overcoming obstacles.

They boasted their city was so secure that disabled defenders would suffice.<p>&#8226; David answers their mockery. Calling them &#8220;lame and blind&#8221; echoes the insult back at the scoffers, not the truly disabled (<a href="/proverbs/26-5.htm">Proverbs 26:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture shows David later honoring Mephibosheth, who was lame (<a href="/2_samuel/9-3.htm">2 Samuel 9:3, 13</a>).

By echoing the Jebusites&#8217; own taunt about &#8220;the blind and the lame,&#8221; he highlighted God&#8217;s power to topple human pride. The resulting proverb, &#8220;The blind and the lame will never enter the palace,&#8221; celebrated the Lord&#8217;s victory, not prejudice. The passage affirms both the historical accuracy of Scripture and God&#8217;s faithfulness to fulfill His promises in precise detail.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Getteth up to the gutter.</span>--The sense of this passage is obscure, partly from the difficulty of the Hebrew construction, partly from the uncertainty of the meaning of the word translated <span class= "ital">gutter. </span>This word occurs elsewhere only in <a href="/psalms/42-7.htm" title="Deep calls to deep at the noise of your waterspouts: all your waves and your billows are gone over me.">Psalm 42:7</a>, where it is translated <span class= "ital">waterspouts. </span>The ancient versions differ in their interpretations, but the most probable sense is <span class= "ital">watercourses, </span>such as were connected with the precipices around Mount Zion. The two clauses also are unnecessarily transposed in our version, and the word <span class= "ital">getteth, </span>by a very slight change in the Masoretic vowels, becomes <span class= "ital">cast </span>or <span class= "ital">hurl. </span>The whole clause will then read, "Whosoever smites the Jebusites, let him hurl into the watercourses (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>down the precipice) the lame and the blind." David thus applies to all the Jebusites the expression they had just used of those who would suffice to resist his attack. The clause "that are hated of David's soul," shows that in this siege no quarter was to be given; the Jebusites were under the old ban resting upon all the Canaanites, and were to be destroyed. The English version inserts the clause, "he shall be chief and captain," which is not in the original, and is here obscure. In <a href="/1_chronicles/11-6.htm" title="And David said, Whoever smites the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.">1Chronicles 11:6</a>, however, the same statement is made more fully and is important: "David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up and was chief." It thus appears that David promised the command of his army to the man who should successfully lead the forlorn hope; Joab did this, and won the place in the armies of all Israel which he had hitherto filled in that of Judah. This fact helps to explain the sense of obligation and restraint which David afterwards felt towards Joab.<p><span class= "bld">Wherefore they said.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">they say. </span>This became a proverbial expression: no intercourse is to be had with such people as the Jebusites, here again called "the blind and the lame."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever getteth up to the gutter.</span> The word rendered "gutter" occurs elsewhere only in <a href="/psalms/42-7.htm">Psalm 42:7</a>, where it is translated "waterspout." Josephus thinks that it was an underground passage or drain. Ewald argues that it was a precipice, and others that it was a dent or hollow in the rocky face of the ravine, which David had noticed and thought practicable. The view of Josephus, suggested to him probably by his knowledge of the way in which the site of Jerusalem is honeycombed by tunnels, has been wonderfully confirmed by the discoveries made by Sir C. Warren ('Recovery of Jerusalem,' pp. 240, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>). At the northern end of the Pool of Siloam he found an arched passage gradually narrowing down from a considerable height, till finally there was a passage of only fourteen inches, and as there was a depth of ten inches of water, there were left but four inches of space for breathing. But through this his men struggled, and, at the end of four hours' labour, they reached the light of day at the spring called the Virgin's Fount. Beginning here on a subsequent day, they went along a passage sixty-seven feet in length, and came to a perpendicular shaft leading up through the solid stone of the hill; and, having scaled this, they next came upon a sloping passage, which finally conducted them to a spot on the hill of Ophel within the fortifications. Now, there are reasons for believing that this passage is older than the wall built by Solomon, and through it, or some such tunnel, Joab and a few men may have worked their way, and so have effected an entrance into the city, which otherwise was impregnable. It was probably the entrance near the Virgin's Fountain which they had observed, and David's words mean, "Whoever will undertake this dangerous enterprise, let him try this underground passage, and when he has entered the fortifications by its means, let him smite the lame and the blind, that are hated of David's soul," because of the boast of the Jebusites, that their cripples were a match for his heroes. It must be noticed, however, that the K'tib, or written text, has "who hate David's soul;" and as this is what the Jewish Massorites found in the manuscripts, it has more authority than their correction. These Jebusites had probably, in their boastful insult, spoken of David with contempt, and even said, like Goliath, that they would give his flesh to the vultures (<a href="/1_samuel/17-44.htm">1 Samuel 17:44</a>). We learn from <a href="/1_chronicles/11-6.htm">1 Chronicles 11:6</a> that David promised the office of commander of the host to the man who undertook this exploit; and when Joab had volunteered and succeeded, he regained thereby the post which he had forfeited by the murder of Abner. <span class="cmt_word">The blind and the lame shall not some into the house.</span> The proverb is one of contempt for these poor cripples, and forbids the exercise of hospitality to them. Such people, if they took to mendicancy, were to meet with refusal, though at their own homes they were fit objects of charity. This way of describing tramps as "the blind and lame" arose, we are here told, from this Jebusite taunt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/5-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
