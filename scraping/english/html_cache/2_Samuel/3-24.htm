This reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient Israel, where military leaders had direct access to the king. Joab's role as a military leader is significant, as he often acts independently, sometimes in opposition to David's wishes, highlighting the tension between political and military authority.<p><b>&#8220;What have you done?</b><br>Joab's question indicates his disapproval and surprise at David's actions. This reflects the cultural expectation of loyalty and the importance of strategic decisions in leadership. Joab's tone suggests a challenge to David's authority, which is a recurring theme in their relationship.<p><b>Look, Abner came to you.</b><br>Abner, the commander of Saul's army, had come to David seeking to negotiate peace and unite the kingdom under David's rule. This meeting is pivotal in the transition of power from the house of Saul to David. Abner's visit signifies a shift in political alliances and the fulfillment of God's promise to David to become king over all Israel.<p><b>Why did you dismiss him?</b><br>Joab questions David's decision to let Abner leave without securing a firm alliance. This reflects the strategic importance of Abner's support for David's consolidation of power. Joab's concern is rooted in the potential threat Abner poses if he returns to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, and continues to oppose David.<p><b>Now he is getting away!</b><br>Joab's urgency underscores the potential loss of a critical opportunity to solidify David's rule over all Israel. This phrase highlights the tension between immediate military strategy and long-term political goals. Joab's reaction foreshadows his subsequent actions, which are driven by personal vendetta and political calculation, ultimately leading to Abner's murder.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, known for his military prowess and loyalty to David, but also for his impulsive and sometimes violent actions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, chosen by God for his heart and leadership, who is in the process of uniting the kingdom after Saul's death.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/abner.htm">Abner</a></b><br>The commander of Saul's army, who initially opposed David but later sought to make peace and support David's kingship over all Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebron.htm">Hebron</a></b><br>The city where David was initially anointed king over Judah and where this interaction takes place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event.htm">The Event</a></b><br>Joab confronts King David after David allows Abner to leave in peace, questioning the wisdom of David's decision and expressing concern over Abner's intentions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_discernment.htm">The Importance of Discernment</a></b><br>David's decision to let Abner go reflects a trust in God's plan and a desire for peace.

His coming signaled national unification, fulfilling God&#8217;s promise to David (<a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226;Joab, however, remembers Abner as the man who killed his brother Asahel (<a href="/2_samuel/2-23.htm">2 Samuel 2:23</a>).

Joab seeks to poison David's mind against Abner, that he may better carry out his revenge.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24, 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What hast thou done?</span> David's secret dealing makes Joab see a personal wrong to himself in the negotiation with Abner. There could be no room, he feels, for both of them in David's army, and David meant, he supposes, to sacrifice himself. In hot haste, therefore, he rushes into the king's presence, and reproaches him for what he has done, but covers his personal feelings with professed zeal for his master's interests. Abner is a mere spy, who has come on a false pretext, and with the real intention of learning David's <span class="cmt_word">going out and coming in,</span> that is, his present manner of life and undertakings. <span class="cmt_word">All that thou doest;</span> literally, <span class="accented">all that thou art doing</span>; all that is now going on, and thy plans and purposes. Abner would not only judge by what he saw, but in his interview with David would lead him on to talk of his hopes and prospects. David had little time to explain the real object of Abner's coming, nor was Joab in a mood to listen to anything he said. He had detected his master in secret negotiations, and would regard his excuses as tainted with deceit. And after giving vent to his auger in reproaches, he hurried away to thwart David's plans by a deed of most base villainy.
