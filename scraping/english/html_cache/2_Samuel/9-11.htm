This reflects the broader theme of God's providence in establishing David's kingdom. Ziba's role is significant as he becomes a key figure in the care of Mephibosheth, Saul's grandson.<p><b>&#8220;Your servant will do all that my lord the king has commanded.&#8221;</b><br>Ziba's response demonstrates obedience and submission to King David's authority, which is a recurring theme in the Davidic narrative. This obedience can be seen as a reflection of the expected loyalty to God's anointed king, paralleling the believer's submission to God's will. It also sets the stage for future events where Ziba's loyalty is tested.<p><b>So Mephibosheth ate at David&#8217;s table</b><br>Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan and grandson of Saul, represents the grace and kindness of David, who honors his covenant with Jonathan by caring for his son. Eating at the king's table symbolizes acceptance, provision, and restoration of status. This act of kindness prefigures the grace extended to believers, who are invited to partake in the blessings of God's kingdom.<p><b>like one of the king&#8217;s own sons.</b><br>David's treatment of Mephibosheth as one of his own sons illustrates the theme of adoption and inclusion, which is echoed in the New Testament where believers are adopted into God's family through Christ.
