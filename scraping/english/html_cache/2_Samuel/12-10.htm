The "sword" symbolizes ongoing conflict and violence, which would plague David's family. Historically, this prophecy is fulfilled through the turmoil and bloodshed within David's household, including the rebellion of his son Absalom and the murder of his son Amnon by another son, Absalom. This reflects the biblical principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>) and serves as a warning about the long-term consequences of sin.<p><b>because you have despised Me</b><br>In this context, "despised" indicates a profound disrespect and disregard for God's commandments. David's actions showed contempt for God's authority and holiness. This phrase underscores the personal nature of sin against God, as it is not merely a violation of law but an affront to God's character. Theologically, it highlights the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance, as seen in David's later contrition in <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>.<p><b>and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.</b><br>This phrase points to the specific sin of adultery and murder. Uriah, a Hittite, was one of David's mighty men, indicating his loyalty and importance in David's army. The mention of Uriah's ethnicity highlights the inclusivity of David's reign, yet also the gravity of his betrayal. This act of taking another man's wife is a direct violation of the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13-14</a>). It also foreshadows the greater redemption narrative, where Jesus, a descendant of David, would come to fulfill the law and offer forgiveness for all sins.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who committed adultery with Bathsheba and orchestrated the death of her husband, Uriah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan.htm">Nathan</a></b><br>The prophet who confronted David about his sin, delivering God's message of judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/uriah_the_hittite.htm">Uriah the Hittite</a></b><br>A loyal soldier in David's army and the husband of Bathsheba, whom David had killed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The woman with whom David committed adultery, leading to a series of tragic events.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_david.htm">The House of David</a></b><br>Refers to David's family and lineage, which would be affected by the consequences of his sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin has severe consequences, not only for the individual but also for those around them.

Actions invite responses (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>).

Sin is not merely breaking a rule; it is scorning its Giver (<a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>). Saul&#8217;s earlier rejection of God&#8217;s word led to his downfall (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>); David&#8217;s contempt brings different but equally real consequences.

Jesus later deepens this standard to the heart level (<a href="/matthew/5-27.htm">Matthew 5:27-28</a>).

The verse affirms divine justice, the gravity of sin, and the certainty that God&#8217;s word is both accurate and active&#8212;calling His people to wholehearted obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Shall never depart.</span>--This word, in both its positive and negative forms, <span class= "ital">for ever </span>and <span class= "ital">never, </span>is constantly used to express the longest time possible in connection with the subject of which it is used. Here it must mean "as long as David lives;" and the punishment denounced found its realisation in a long succession of woes, from the murder of Amnon to the execution of Adonijah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sword shall never depart from thine house;</span> that is, thy crime shall not be expiated by one slaughter, but by many, so that thy punishment shall cease only at thine own death. This sentence was fulfilled in Amnon's murder (<a href="/2_samuel/13-28.htm">2 Samuel 13:28</a>), who had been encouraged in his crime by his father's example. Upon this followed Absalom's rebellion and death (<a href="/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14</a>); and finally, when in his last hours David made Solomon his successor, he knew that he was virtually passing sentence on Adonijah, the eldest of his surviving sons. But what a fearful choice! for had he not done so, then Bathsheba and her four sons would doubtless have been slain, whereas there was some hope that Solomon might spare his brother. That Adonijah was unworthy we gather from the fact that he had ceased to be cohen, and that this office was conferred, after Absalom's rebellion, on Ira the Jairite (<a href="/2_samuel/20-26.htm">2 Samuel 20:26</a>), Solomon being then too young to hold such a position. Until he committed this crime, David's family had probably dwelt in concord, and it was his own wickedness which broke up their unity, and introduced among them strife, mutual hatred, and the shedding of blood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/12-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now, therefore,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
