Saul, the first king of Israel, and Jonathan, his son and David's close friend, had fallen in battle against the Philistines. David's retrieval of their bones signifies respect and reconciliation, highlighting the importance of proper burial in ancient Israelite culture. It also reflects David's loyalty and the covenantal friendship he shared with Jonathan (<a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>).<p><b>from the men of Jabesh-gilead</b><br>The men of Jabesh-gilead had a history of loyalty to Saul. When Saul first became king, he rescued Jabesh-gilead from the Ammonites (1 Samuel 11). In gratitude, they later risked their lives to retrieve the bodies of Saul and his sons from the Philistines. This act of bravery and loyalty underscores the deep bonds of kinship and gratitude in Israelite society.<p><b>who had stolen them from the public square of Beth-shan</b><br>Beth-shan was a significant city in the region, strategically located at the junction of the Jezreel and Jordan Valleys. The Philistines displayed the bodies of Saul and his sons in Beth-shan as a public humiliation and a demonstration of their victory. The retrieval of the bodies by the men of Jabesh-gilead was a courageous act, defying the Philistines and restoring honor to Saul and his family.<p><b>where the Philistines had hung the bodies</b><br>The hanging of the bodies was a common practice in the ancient Near East to disgrace enemies and deter others. It was a public declaration of triumph over a defeated foe. This act by the Philistines was intended to demoralize the Israelites and assert Philistine dominance.<p><b>after they had struck down Saul at Gilboa</b><br>The battle at Mount Gilboa was a significant defeat for Israel, resulting in the death of Saul and his sons (1 Samuel 31). This event marked the end of Saul's reign and paved the way for David's ascension to the throne. The location, Gilboa, is a mountainous region, and its mention here serves as a geographical marker of this pivotal battle in Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who sought to honor Saul and Jonathan by retrieving their bones for a proper burial.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first King of Israel, whose death marked a significant transition in Israel's monarchy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>Saul's son and David's close friend, known for his loyalty and bravery.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jabesh-gilead.htm">Jabesh-gilead</a></b><br>A city in Israel whose men bravely retrieved the bodies of Saul and Jonathan from the Philistines.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/beth-shan.htm">Beth-shan</a></b><br>The location where the Philistines displayed the bodies of Saul and Jonathan after their defeat at Mount Gilboa.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>The enemies of Israel who defeated Saul and his sons, displaying their bodies as a sign of victory.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_the_dead.htm">Respect for the Dead</a></b><br>David's actions demonstrate the importance of honoring those who have passed, reflecting a deep respect for the deceased and their families.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/loyalty_and_friendship.htm">Loyalty and Friendship</a></b><br>The relationship between David and Jonathan serves as a model of true friendship and loyalty, even beyond death.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_and_honor.htm">Courage and Honor</a></b><br>The men of Jabesh-gilead exemplify bravery and honor by risking their lives to retrieve the bodies of Saul and Jonathan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_leadership_transitions.htm">God's Sovereignty in Leadership Transitions</a></b><br>The transition from Saul to David as king illustrates God's hand in leadership changes and the fulfillment of His plans.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reconciliation_and_forgiveness.htm">Reconciliation and Forgiveness</a></b><br>David's actions towards Saul's family show a heart of reconciliation and forgiveness, despite Saul's previous attempts on David's life.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Samuel_21_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Samuel 21:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_2_Sam_21_12_show_honoring_dead.htm">How does David's action in 2 Samuel 21:12 demonstrate honoring the dead?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_God_s_justice_from_David.htm">What can we learn about God's justice from David's retrieval of Saul's bones?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/2_Sam_21_12_link_to_honoring_parents.htm">How does 2 Samuel 21:12 connect to the commandment to honor parents?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Why_honor_past_leaders_in_our_faith.htm">Why is it important to remember and honor past leaders in our faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_David_s_respect_for_Saul_today.htm">How can we apply David's respect for Saul to our relationships today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_David_collect_Saul_s_bones.htm">Why did David retrieve Saul and Jonathan's bones in 2 Samuel 21:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_the_burial_site_important.htm">What is the significance of the burial location in 2 Samuel 21:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/David_s_character_in_2_Sam_21_12.htm">How does 2 Samuel 21:12 reflect on David's character and leadership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_samuel_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Samuel 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/did_dogs_literally_eat_jezebel's_body.htm">Could dogs literally devour Jezebel&#8217;s body as described in 2 Kings 9:33&#8211;35, or might this be symbolic hyperbole? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_delay_burial_in_2_sam_21_9.htm">In 2 Samuel 21:9, how is the extended exposure of the corpses justified when Deuteronomy 21:22&#8211;23 calls for prompt burial? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_many_famine_years_for_david.htm">God sent his prophet to threaten David with how many years of famine?
