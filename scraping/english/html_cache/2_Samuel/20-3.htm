This return signifies the restoration of his kingship and the re-establishment of order in the kingdom. Jerusalem, the city of David, is central to Israel's history and God's covenant with David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). The city is a symbol of God's presence and the future site of the Temple.<p><b>he took the ten concubines he had left to take care of the palace</b><br>Concubines in ancient Israel were women who lived with a man but had a lower status than a wife. David's concubines were left to maintain the palace during Absalom's rebellion. This act of leaving them behind shows a trust in their loyalty and a practical need for palace management. The number ten may symbolize completeness or responsibility.<p><b>and he placed them in a house under guard</b><br>David's decision to place the concubines under guard reflects the cultural and legal complexities of their situation after Absalom's public defilement of them (<a href="/2_samuel/16-22.htm">2 Samuel 16:22</a>). This act was a political statement by Absalom to assert his claim to the throne. David's response is protective, ensuring their safety and dignity in a society where their status was compromised.<p><b>He provided for them, but he no longer slept with them</b><br>David's provision for the concubines demonstrates his responsibility and care, despite their altered status. The decision not to sleep with them again is likely due to the cultural implications of Absalom's actions, which made them untouchable for David. This reflects the importance of purity and honor in royal lineage and the complexities of polygamous relationships in biblical times.<p><b>They were confined until the day of their death, living as widows</b><br>The confinement of the concubines symbolizes their permanent change in status. Living as widows, they were neither fully wives nor free women, highlighting the social and personal consequences of Absalom's rebellion. This situation underscores the themes of loss and redemption in David's life and the broader narrative of sin and its repercussions. The concept of living as widows also connects to the biblical theme of God's care for widows and the marginalized (<a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, returning to his palace in Jerusalem after quelling the rebellion led by Sheba.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/concubines.htm">Concubines</a></b><br>Ten women left by David to care for the palace during Absalom's rebellion.
