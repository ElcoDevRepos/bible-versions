In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/3.htm">2 Samuel 3</a>, Joab is speaking to King David, suggesting that David should be aware of Abner's intentions. This reflects the tension and suspicion prevalent in the political landscape of Israel during this time, as the kingdom was transitioning from Saul's rule to David's.<p><b>that Abner son of Ner</b><br>Abner was a prominent military leader and the cousin of King Saul, serving as the commander of Saul's army. His lineage as the son of Ner places him within the tribe of Benjamin, which was significant as it was Saul's tribe. Abner's role in the narrative of 2 Samuel is crucial, as he initially supported Saul's son Ish-bosheth before defecting to David's side, highlighting the shifting allegiances during this period.<p><b>came to deceive you</b><br>Joab accuses Abner of deceit, suggesting that his motives for visiting David were not genuine. This reflects the broader theme of political intrigue and betrayal that runs throughout the books of Samuel. Deception was a common tactic in ancient Near Eastern politics, and Joab's suspicion may have been fueled by his own experiences and the volatile nature of the time.<p><b>and to track your movements</b><br>The idea of tracking movements implies espionage or intelligence gathering, which was a critical aspect of ancient warfare and political strategy. Joab's accusation suggests that Abner's visit was a cover for gathering information on David's plans and military strategies, which would have been valuable to any rival faction.<p><b>and all that you are doing.</b><br>This phrase encompasses the entirety of David's actions and decisions, indicating that Joab believed Abner's intentions were to gain comprehensive insight into David's rule. This reflects the broader narrative of David's rise to power and the challenges he faced from both internal and external threats. The suspicion of Abner's motives underscores the precarious nature of David's early reign and the constant vigilance required to maintain his position as king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abner_son_of_ner.htm">Abner son of Ner</a></b><br>A prominent military leader and the commander of Saul's army.
