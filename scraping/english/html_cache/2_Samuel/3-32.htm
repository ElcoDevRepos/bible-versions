It was one of the oldest cities in the region and served as a major center for the patriarchs, including Abraham, who purchased the cave of Machpelah there as a burial site for his family (<a href="/genesis/23-19.htm">Genesis 23:19</a>). Hebron later became King David's first capital before he moved his reign to Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3-5</a>). The burial of Abner, a prominent military leader and cousin to King Saul, in Hebron signifies the importance of the city as a place of honor and respect. Abner's burial here also reflects the political and tribal dynamics of the time, as Hebron was a stronghold for David's supporters.<p><b>the king wept aloud at Abner&#8217;s tomb</b><br>The king referred to here is David. His public mourning for Abner demonstrates his genuine grief and respect for Abner, despite their previous conflicts. David's lamentation is a political and personal statement, showing his disapproval of Abner's murder by Joab, David's own military commander. This act of mourning helps to solidify David's position as a just and honorable leader, distancing himself from the act of vengeance and bloodshed. It also serves to unify the tribes of Israel by showing that David valued Abner's contributions and sought peace among the factions.<p><b>and all the people wept</b><br>The collective mourning of the people indicates Abner's influence and the respect he commanded among the Israelites. It also reflects the cultural practices of communal grieving in ancient Israel, where public expressions of sorrow were common during funerals. This shared grief underscores the impact of Abner's death on the nation and highlights the tension and instability during the transition of power from the house of Saul to David. The people's response also supports David's position as a leader who empathizes with his subjects, further legitimizing his rule over a united Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abner.htm">Abner</a></b><br>A prominent military leader in Israel, initially serving under King Saul and later aligning with David.

His burial &#8220;in Hebron&#8221; locates him in David&#8217;s capital, not in Saul&#8217;s territory, underscoring David&#8217;s genuine acceptance of Abner&#8217;s reconciliation.<p>&#8226; Hebron is where God first promised Abraham the land (<a href="/genesis/13-18.htm">Genesis 13:18</a>) and where the patriarchs were buried (<a href="/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29&#8211;33</a>). Placing Abner there affirms the covenant setting: God&#8217;s purposes for Israel are still unfolding despite political turmoil.<p>&#8226; David allows Abner a respectful burial rather than handing him over to vengeance. This mirrors the Torah&#8217;s command to honor the dead (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>) and reveals David&#8217;s obedience to God&#8217;s law even toward a former rival.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the king wept aloud at Abner&#8217;s tomb</b><p>&#8226; David&#8217;s public grief fulfills his earlier command, &#8220;Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/3-31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31</a>). His tears are not political theater; Scripture presents them as sincere.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s lament resembles his grief for Saul and Jonathan (<a href="/2_samuel/1-17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17&#8211;27</a>), showing consistent respect for those fallen in Israel, whether friend or foe.<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s weeping also anticipates Christ, the Son of David, who &#8220;wept&#8221; at Lazarus&#8217;s tomb (<a href="/john/11-35.htm">John 11:35</a>). True leadership, even in power, keeps a tender heart.<p>&#8226; By grieving publicly, David clears himself of any suspicion in Abner&#8217;s murder plotted by Joab (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>).

David&#8217;s open weeping demonstrates a ruler&#8217;s tender, righteous heart and distances him from Joab&#8217;s treachery. The people&#8217;s shared tears indicate growing unity and trust in God&#8217;s anointed king. Together, the burial scene reveals that genuine grief, public integrity, and respect for God&#8217;s purposes heal a fractured nation and advance the Lord&#8217;s redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">In Hebron.</span>--The family home, and therefore the natural burial-place, of Abner was at Gibeon (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-29.htm" title="And at Gibeon dwelled the father of Gibeon;
