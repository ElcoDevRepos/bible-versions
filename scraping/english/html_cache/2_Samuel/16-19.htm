Hushai's rhetorical question emphasizes loyalty to the Davidic line, reflecting the cultural importance of family and dynastic succession in ancient Israel. The question implies that serving the son of the king is a natural extension of his previous service to the father, highlighting the continuity of leadership. This loyalty to the Davidic line is significant in biblical theology, as it foreshadows the messianic promise that the Messiah would come from David's lineage (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>As I served in your father&#8217;s presence,</b><br>Hushai refers to his past service to King David, which underscores his established loyalty and trustworthiness. In the historical context, serving in the presence of a king was a position of honor and responsibility, often involving counsel and support. This phrase also reflects the cultural value placed on faithfulness and the expectation that such loyalty would continue across generations. The mention of serving in the king's presence can be seen as a type of Christ, who serves in the presence of God the Father and intercedes on behalf of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>so also I will serve in yours.&#8221;</b><br>Hushai's declaration of continued service to Absalom is part of his strategic plan to remain loyal to David while infiltrating Absalom's court. This statement is a clever use of diplomacy and deception, as Hushai seeks to undermine Absalom's rebellion from within. The historical context of political intrigue and the struggle for power in ancient monarchies is evident here. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty and the ultimate fulfillment of His purposes, despite human schemes. Hushai's actions contribute to the preservation of David's kingdom, aligning with God's covenant promise to David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The son of King David who rebelled against his father, seeking to usurp the throne of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hushai_the_archite.htm">Hushai the Archite</a></b><br>A loyal friend and advisor to King David, who pretended to support Absalom to undermine his plans.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, father of Absalom, who was forced to flee Jerusalem due to Absalom's rebellion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, where Absalom established his temporary rule during his rebellion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebellion_of_absalom.htm">Rebellion of Absalom</a></b><br>A significant event where Absalom sought to overthrow his father, King David, leading to a civil conflict.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/loyalty_and_deception.htm">Loyalty and Deception</a></b><br>Hushai's actions remind us that loyalty to God's anointed can sometimes require strategic deception to thwart evil plans.

In an honor-based culture, a loyal servant would remain within the same royal line (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>).<p>&#8226; His question disarms suspicion by appealing to common sense: &#8220;Service stays in the family.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Yet readers know from <a href="/2_samuel/15-37.htm">2 Samuel 15:37</a> that Hushai is actually serving David&#8217;s cause. Scripture often highlights God&#8217;s use of seeming paradoxes&#8212;Joseph in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>) or Esther in Persia (<a href="/esther/4-14.htm">Esther 4:14</a>)&#8212;to advance His plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As I served in your father&#8217;s presence</b><p>&#8226; Hushai reminds Absalom that his past loyalty was public and verifiable (&#8220;in your father&#8217;s presence&#8221;), reinforcing the credibility of his claim (<a href="/proverbs/27-2.htm">Proverbs 27:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Referring to David as &#8220;your father&#8221; underscores the legitimacy of David&#8217;s kingship and subtly hints that Absalom&#8217;s authority is derivative, not original (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also evokes the covenant promise that God made to David&#8217;s house, a promise that Absalom cannot ultimately overturn (<a href="/psalms/89-34.htm">Psalm 89:34&#8211;37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So also I will serve in yours</b><p>&#8226; The pledge appears straightforward, but its wording cleverly mirrors David&#8217;s directive in <a href="/2_samuel/15-34.htm">2 Samuel 15:34</a>, signaling to the careful reader that Hushai is executing David&#8217;s plan.<p>&#8226; The repetition of &#8220;serve&#8221; highlights the servant motif that runs through Scripture&#8212;true greatness comes through service (<a href="/mark/10-43.htm">Mark 10:43&#8211;45</a>).<p>&#8226; God is at work behind the scenes: Hushai&#8217;s presence will lead directly to Absalom rejecting Ahithophel&#8217;s wise counsel (<a href="/2_samuel/17-14.htm">2 Samuel 17:14</a>), fulfilling the Lord&#8217;s sovereign design.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Hushai&#8217;s seemingly simple words are a masterclass in faithful cunning. By respectfully continuing the dialogue, appealing to family loyalty, citing his proven track record, and echoing David&#8217;s own instruction, he secures a place beside Absalom while actually advancing David&#8217;s cause. The verse illustrates how God can use loyal servants, even in politically charged moments, to protect His anointed and fulfill His promises.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/16-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Furthermore,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1461;&#1504;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#183;n&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
