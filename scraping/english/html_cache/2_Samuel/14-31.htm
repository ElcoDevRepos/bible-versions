His relationship with Absalom is complex, marked by both loyalty to David and personal ambition. Absalom, David's son, had been in exile after killing his brother Amnon and was brought back to Jerusalem through Joab's intervention. The setting is likely in Jerusalem, where Absalom resided after his return. This visit underscores the tension between Joab and Absalom, reflecting the political and familial intrigue within David's court.<p><b>and demanded,</b><br>Joab's demand indicates his authority and the seriousness of the situation. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, setting someone's field on fire was a significant offense, often seen as an act of aggression or a call for attention. Joab's approach is direct, reflecting his military background and no-nonsense attitude.<p><b>&#8220;Why did your servants set my field on fire?&#8221;</b><br>Absalom's act of setting Joab's field on fire was a calculated move to gain Joab's attention after being ignored. This action highlights Absalom's frustration and desperation to communicate with Joab, who had been instrumental in his return to Jerusalem but had since distanced himself. The burning of the field can be seen as a symbolic gesture, representing Absalom's fiery ambition and his willingness to use drastic measures to achieve his goals. This incident foreshadows Absalom's later rebellion against David, illustrating his growing impatience and desire for power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army and a key political figure in David's reign.

Burning Joab&#8217;s barley field forced Joab to respond, showing that passive communication had failed and confrontation became inevitable.<p>&#8226; Joab&#8217;s immediate journey to Absalom&#8217;s residence mirrors Jesus&#8217; teaching: &#8220;If your brother sins against you, go and confront him privately&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a>). Direct, face-to-face engagement is the biblical pattern for resolving conflict.<p>&#8226; Joab had previously confronted powerful figures&#8212;he did not shy from meeting Abner (<a href="/2_samuel/3-24.htm">2 Samuel 3:24</a>) or King David himself (<a href="/2_samuel/19-5.htm">2 Samuel 19:5</a>).

Absalom&#8217;s arson shows the danger of manipulating others through sinful means, while Joab&#8217;s response upholds justice and clarity. <a href="/2_samuel/14-31.htm">2 Samuel 14:31</a> reminds us that God honors straightforward accountability over covert coercion, calling believers to address conflicts openly, protect property rights, and pursue restitution in obedience to His Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Joab arose.</span> This high-handed proceeding forced Joab to pay the wished for visit. But, while we cannot acquit Absalom of petulance, we must not regard his act as one of angry revenge; had it been so, Joab would have openly resented it, and he was quite capable of making even the heir apparent feel his anger. It was probably intended as a rough practical joke, which taught Joab better manners, and which he must laugh at, though with inward displeasure. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/14-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Joab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1428;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3097.htm">Strong's 3097: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joab -- 'the LORD is father', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
