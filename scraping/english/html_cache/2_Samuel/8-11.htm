In the ancient Near Eastern context, it was common for kings to dedicate war spoils to their deities as a sign of gratitude and acknowledgment of divine assistance. David's dedication of these items to the LORD reflects his understanding of God as the true source of his success. This act of dedication is consistent with the biblical principle of giving God the first and best of what one receives, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>. It also prefigures the ultimate dedication of all things to God in the eschatological future, as described in <a href="/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>.<p><b>along with the silver and gold</b><br>The mention of silver and gold indicates the wealth and resources that David accumulated through his conquests. These metals were highly valued in the ancient world, often used for trade, currency, and religious offerings. The dedication of such valuable items underscores the importance of giving to God what is precious. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who, though rich, became poor for our sake (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-9.htm">2 Corinthians 8:9</a>), dedicating His life for the redemption of humanity.<p><b>he had dedicated from all the nations he had subdued&#8212;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the extent of David's military success and the breadth of his kingdom. The nations subdued by David included the Philistines, Moabites, Arameans, and Edomites, among others. Each victory not only expanded Israel's territory but also brought wealth that David dedicated to the LORD. This reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would possess the gates of their enemies (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>). It also foreshadows the messianic reign of Christ, who will subdue all nations and establish His kingdom of peace and righteousness (<a href="/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, David is the king of Israel who is known for his military conquests and his heart for God.

David sees every victory gift as the LORD&#8217;s property first.<p>&#8226; The act echoes the pattern in <a href="/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>, where David places garrisons in conquered territory and &#8220;the LORD gave David victory wherever he went,&#8221; highlighting that success is God-granted, not self-made.<p>&#8226; A parallel record in <a href="/1_chronicles/18-11.htm">1 Chronicles 18:11</a> reinforces the point: &#8220;King David dedicated these articles to the LORD, along with the silver and gold he had carried off from all the nations.&#8221; Scripture repeats the detail to spotlight its importance.<p>&#8226; Dedicating spoils was an act of worship, similar to what Moses prescribed for plunder devoted to the tabernacle (<a href="/numbers/31-48.htm">Numbers 31:48&#8211;54</a>). David&#8217;s obedience links his monarchy to earlier covenant faithfulness.<p>&#8226; Unlike Saul, who used spoils for himself (<a href="/1_samuel/15-9.htm">1 Samuel 15:9</a>), David treats God&#8217;s honor as the first priority, showing why his dynasty receives the everlasting covenant promise (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with the silver and gold he had dedicated from all the nations he had subdued&#8212;</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; along with the silver and gold he had dedicated from all the nations he had subdued&#8212;&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/8-11.htm">2 Samuel 8:11</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;All the nations&#8221; in context include Edom, Moab, Ammon, the Philistines, Amalek, and Aram (<a href="/2_samuel/8-12.htm">2 Samuel 8:12&#8211;14</a>). Every victory&#8217;s wealth flows into God&#8217;s treasury.<p>&#8226; This cumulative dedication anticipates the temple Solomon will build; the materials David gathers become part of its storehouse (<a href="/1_kings/7-51.htm">1 Kings 7:51</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/26-26.htm">1 Chronicles 26:26&#8211;28</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse illustrates the principle voiced later by David: &#8220;Everything comes from You, and we have given You only what comes from Your hand&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-14.htm">1 Chronicles 29:14</a>).<p>&#8226; By devoting international spoils, David proclaims that the LORD is King over all nations, not just Israel&#8212;a foretaste of <a href="/psalms/72-11.htm">Psalm 72:11</a>, &#8220;All kings will bow to Him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The continual dedicating of treasure teaches stewardship: victories, resources, and influence are entrusted to believers for God&#8217;s glory, never for self-exaltation (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19&#8211;21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/8-11.htm">2 Samuel 8:11</a> shows David responding to God-given victories with wholehearted devotion. Every article of bronze, silver, and gold is set apart for the LORD, affirming that success, wealth, and authority all originate from Him. By channeling spoils from every subdued nation into God&#8217;s treasury, David models worship-centered stewardship and proclaims the LORD&#8217;s universal reign.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Which also.</span>--The dedication of the gifts of Toi is especially mentioned, because these were not, like those of <a href="/2_samuel/8-7.htm" title="And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.">2Samuel 8:7</a>; <a href="/context/2_samuel/8-11.htm" title="Which also king David did dedicate to the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;">2Samuel 8:11-12</a>, the spoils of <span class= "ital">conquered </span>nations.

It was in this way that he accumulated those large stores of the precious metals enumerated in <a href="/1_chronicles/29.htm">1 Chronicles 29</a>, and employed in making the sacred vessels of the temple. Their vast amount is the more remarkable because Palestine previously was almost destitute of them. Wherever the armies of Israel went, they made diligent search after everything that would serve towards the building of their sanctuary. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/8-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(gam-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1571.htm">Strong's 1571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assemblage, also, even, yea, though, both, and</span><br /><br /><span class="word">King</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1445;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
