The context is David's flight from Jerusalem due to Absalom's rebellion. David's inquiry about Mephibosheth reflects his concern for the loyalty and whereabouts of Saul's descendants, as Mephibosheth had been shown kindness by David (2 Samuel 9). The term "master's grandson" highlights the dynastic connection to Saul, emphasizing the potential political implications of Mephibosheth's actions during this tumultuous time.<p><b>And Ziba answered, &#8220;Indeed, he is staying in Jerusalem,</b><br>Ziba's response indicates that Mephibosheth has not accompanied David in his escape. This statement is significant because it suggests a possible betrayal or at least a lack of support from Mephibosheth. The mention of Jerusalem is crucial, as it is the political and spiritual center of Israel, and staying there during Absalom's rebellion could imply allegiance to the usurper. This situation reflects the complex loyalties and political maneuvering common in ancient Near Eastern courts.<p><b>for he has said, &#8216;Today, the house of Israel will restore to me the kingdom of my grandfather.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>Ziba claims that Mephibosheth believes the current upheaval will result in the restoration of Saul's dynasty, with himself as the heir. This statement is loaded with political ambition and reflects the ongoing tension between the house of Saul and the house of David. The idea of restoration connects to the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over kingdoms and His ultimate plan for Israel. However, Ziba's report is later revealed to be false (<a href="/2_samuel/19-24.htm">2 Samuel 19:24-30</a>), highlighting themes of deception and the testing of David's discernment. This situation also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises through the lineage of David, culminating in the reign of Jesus Christ, the true King of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The reigning king of Israel, who is fleeing from his son Absalom's rebellion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziba.htm">Ziba</a></b><br>The servant of Mephibosheth, who brings provisions to David and claims that Mephibosheth is seeking to reclaim Saul's kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mephibosheth.htm">Mephibosheth</a></b><br>The grandson of Saul, who is accused by Ziba of staying in Jerusalem to reclaim the kingdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, where Mephibosheth is said to be staying.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom's_rebellion.htm">Absalom's Rebellion</a></b><br>The context of the event, where David's son Absalom has declared himself king, causing David to flee.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_leadership.htm">Discernment in Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders must seek wisdom and discernment, especially when faced with conflicting reports or deceitful individuals.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_assumptions.htm">The Danger of Assumptions</a></b><br>Making assumptions based on incomplete information can lead to unjust decisions and broken relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_adversity.htm">Faithfulness in Adversity</a></b><br>Mephibosheth's later defense of his loyalty to David reminds us of the importance of remaining faithful, even when falsely accused.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_deceit.htm">The Consequences of Deceit</a></b><br>Ziba's deceitful actions serve as a warning about the destructive nature of lies and manipulation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_justice.htm">Trust in God's Justice</a></b><br>Despite human deceit and betrayal, believers can trust in God's ultimate justice and vindication.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Samuel_16_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Samuel 16:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ziba_s_motives_in_2_Sam_16_3.htm">How does 2 Samuel 16:3 reveal Ziba's intentions towards Mephibosheth and David?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_loyalty_from_Ziba_s_actions_3.htm">What can we learn about loyalty from Ziba's actions in 2 Samuel 16:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Ziba_s_claim_and_deception_in_Scripture.htm">How does Ziba's claim connect to themes of deception in other Scriptures?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Christian_response_to_false_reports.htm">How should Christians respond to false reports, as seen in 2 Samuel 16:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/2_Samuel_16_3_Truth_in_tough_times.htm">What does 2 Samuel 16:3 teach about discerning truth in challenging situations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Samuel_16_3_Loyalty_vs_Betrayal.htm">What does 2 Samuel 16:3 reveal about loyalty and betrayal in David's reign?

Whether Ziba lied or Mephibosheth dreamed of power, God&#8217;s anointed king remained David, and the Lord would ultimately vindicate truth (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy master's son;</span> that is, the son of Jonathan, or even of Saul, as the word "son" is used very indefinitely in Hebrew. Mephibesheth held the property as their representative. <span class="cmt_word">Today shall the house,</span> etc. Ziba's slander was absurd. Mephibosheth was likely to meet with no kind treatment from Absalom; but perhaps he was a visionary, and David may have thought that he was holding back for any chance that might turn up. But upon this slander David acts with blamable impetuosity, and, indignant that the son of his old friend should so desert him, he gives Ziba all his lands. The grant would be valid only if David's cause prevailed, and Ziba so far deserves credit in that he attached himself to a ruined man; but his motive was not love to David, but selfish calculation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/16-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Where</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;ay&#183;y&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
