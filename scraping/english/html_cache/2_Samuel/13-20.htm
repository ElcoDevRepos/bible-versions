This familial relationship is significant, as it sets the stage for the ensuing conflict within David's household. Absalom's role as a brother is crucial, as it highlights the familial duty and honor that were highly valued in ancient Israelite culture.<p><b>&#8220;Has your brother Amnon been with you?</b><br>Amnon, the firstborn son of David, is implicated in a grievous sin against Tamar. The question posed by Absalom suggests an awareness of Amnon's actions, reflecting the lack of privacy and the close-knit nature of royal family life. This inquiry also underscores the gravity of Amnon's offense, as it was not only a personal violation but also a breach of familial and societal norms.<p><b>Be quiet for now, my sister.</b><br>Absalom's advice to Tamar to remain silent can be seen as a protective measure, possibly to prevent further shame or scandal. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, a woman's honor was closely tied to her family's reputation, and public knowledge of such an incident could have severe repercussions. This counsel reflects the complex dynamics of honor and shame in the biblical world.<p><b>He is your brother.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the familial bond and the expectation of loyalty and protection within the family unit. It also highlights the tragic irony of the situation, as the perpetrator of the crime is a close relative, which would have compounded the emotional and social turmoil for Tamar.<p><b>Do not take this thing to heart.&#8221;</b><br>Absalom's attempt to console Tamar may reflect a desire to mitigate her distress, though it also underscores the limitations of his ability to provide justice or healing. This phrase can be seen as an acknowledgment of the deep emotional impact of the event, while also suggesting a need to maintain composure in the face of adversity.<p><b>So Tamar lived as a desolate woman</b><br>The term "desolate" indicates Tamar's profound sense of loss and isolation following the incident. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a woman's prospects for marriage and social standing were severely diminished by such an event, leaving her in a state of vulnerability and marginalization. This reflects the harsh realities faced by women in biblical times.<p><b>in the house of her brother Absalom.</b><br>Tamar's residence with Absalom signifies his role as her protector and provider in the absence of a husband. This arrangement also foreshadows Absalom's eventual rebellion against David, as the unresolved injustice against Tamar becomes a catalyst for further familial strife. The narrative highlights the long-term consequences of sin and the breakdown of family relationships within the royal household.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The son of King David and brother to both Amnon and Tamar.

He was, in fact, so indignant at her treatment as to have purposed the sternest vengeance. But this he concealed from her, and counselled patience, net merely because she would have dissuaded him from a course so full of danger to himself, but because it was the duty of both to wait and see what course David would take. Where polygamy is permitted, it is the duty especially of the brothers to defend their sisters' honour (<a href="/genesis/34-31.htm">Genesis 34:31</a>). But David was both her father and the chief magistrate; and, moreover, he had been made an instrument in his daughter's wrong. They must be patient, and only if David failed in his duty would Absalom's turn come. Meanwhile, Tamar dwelt in his house desolate, as one whose honour and happiness had been laid waste. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/13-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Her brother</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1495;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#238;&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
