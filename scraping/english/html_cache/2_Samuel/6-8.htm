This reaction can be understood in the context of his deep desire to honor God by bringing the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem. His anger may have been directed at himself for not following the prescribed method of transporting the Ark, at Uzzah for touching the Ark, or even at God for the severity of the punishment. This moment highlights the tension between human emotion and divine holiness.<p><b>because the LORD had burst forth against Uzzah.</b><br>The phrase "burst forth" indicates a sudden and powerful action by God, reminiscent of the earlier event at Baal-perazim (<a href="/2_samuel/5-20.htm">2 Samuel 5:20</a>), where God "burst through" David's enemies. Uzzah's death serves as a stark reminder of the holiness of God and the importance of adhering to His commands, particularly regarding the sacredness of the Ark. The Ark was to be carried by Levites using poles, as outlined in <a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>, and not on a cart, which was the method used by the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/6-7.htm">1 Samuel 6:7-8</a>).<p><b>So he named that place Perez-uzzah,</b><br>The naming of the place Perez-uzzah, meaning "outburst against Uzzah," serves as a memorial to the event. Naming places after significant events was a common practice in biblical times, serving both as a reminder of God's actions and as a teaching tool for future generations. This act of naming underscores the importance of remembering and learning from past events.<p><b>as it is called to this day.</b><br>The phrase "as it is called to this day" suggests that the account was written or compiled at a time when the name was still in use, indicating the lasting impact of the event on the collective memory of Israel. This enduring name serves as a testament to the seriousness with which God views His holiness and the obedience of His people. It also reflects the historical reliability of the biblical narrative, as such place names often provide geographical and archaeological insights into the biblical world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, a man after God's own heart, who is leading the procession to bring the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/u/uzzah.htm">Uzzah</a></b><br>A man who touched the Ark of the Covenant to steady it and was struck down by God for his irreverence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who enacts judgment upon Uzzah for his actions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/perez-uzzah.htm">Perez-uzzah</a></b><br>The place named by David, meaning "outburst against Uzzah," marking the event where God struck Uzzah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>The sacred chest representing God's presence, being transported to Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_holiness.htm">Reverence for God's Holiness</a></b><br>The incident with Uzzah underscores the importance of approaching God with reverence and respect for His holiness.

Uzzah's death was probably caused by apoplexy, and the sudden effort of stretching forth his hand and seizing the ark had been its immediate cause. So tragic an event spoiled the happiness of the day, filled all present with disappointment, made them break off in haste from the grand ceremonial, and placed David before his subjects in the position of a malefactor. He had prepared a great religious festival, and Jehovah had broken in upon them as an enemy. In his first burst of displeasure he called the place Perez-Uzzah, the word "Perez," or "Breach," conveying to the Hebrews the idea of a great calamity (<a href="/judges/21-15.htm">Judges 21:15</a>) or of a sudden attack upon a foe (<a href="/2_samuel/5-20.htm">2 Samuel 5:20</a>). The historian adds that the place bore this name unto his day; but we cannot tell whether these are the words of the original compiler of the Book of Samuel, or, as is more probably the case, those of some subsequent editor or scribe. Many such remarks are supposed to have been inserted by Ezra and the men of the great synagogue. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/6-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1428;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
