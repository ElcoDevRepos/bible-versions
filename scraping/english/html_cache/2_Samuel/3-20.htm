His decision to come to David marks a pivotal moment in the unification of the kingdom. Hebron, located in the Judean hills, was David's capital at the time and a city of refuge, indicating its importance both politically and spiritually. The number twenty, while not symbolically significant in this context, suggests a delegation of importance, showing Abner's serious intent. This meeting is a turning point in the civil war between the house of Saul and the house of David, as Abner seeks to transfer the allegiance of the northern tribes to David.<p><b>David held a feast for them</b><br>Feasting in ancient Near Eastern culture was a sign of hospitality and covenant-making. By holding a feast, David demonstrates his willingness to reconcile and form alliances, a strategic move to solidify his rule over all Israel. This act of hospitality also reflects David's character as a leader who seeks peace and unity. The feast can be seen as a precursor to the eventual unification of the tribes under David's kingship, foreshadowing the peace and prosperity that would come with his reign. This gesture of goodwill is reminiscent of other biblical instances where meals signify covenant relationships, such as the Last Supper, pointing to the ultimate reconciliation through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abner.htm">Abner</a></b><br>The commander of Saul's army, who initially opposed David but later sought to make a covenant with him to unite Israel under David's kingship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, residing in Hebron at this time, known for his leadership, faithfulness to God, and eventual unification of the tribes of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebron.htm">Hebron</a></b><br>A significant city in Judah, serving as David's capital before he moved to Jerusalem.

The feast which David made for them is not to be understood of mere conviviality, but of a solemn sacrificial feast, such as was customary in ancient times in connection with important negotiations.

Most of them, however, would join Abner on the road, especially those who represented Benjamin and the western tribes. On arriving at Hebron they were honourably received, and, after a feast, they settled the conditions on which David was to be made king of all Israel; and Abner then departed in peace, after giving the assurance that all the tribes would now gladly assemble, and by solemn compact and covenant make David their king. The terms of the league, and the conditions agreed upon for Ishbosheth, are not mentioned, because upon Abner's death the whole plan fell to the ground, and David had to wait for many years before his hopes were fulfilled.
