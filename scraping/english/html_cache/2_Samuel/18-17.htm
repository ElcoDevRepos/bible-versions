The cry, "To your tents, O Israel!" (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>), meant, "Go away to your homes!" and not "Gather for war!" It is remarkable how constantly Absalom's followers are described as "Israel" while the loyal men are "David's servants." Absalom's was evidently the popular cause, and, besides Uriah's murder, there must have been political reasons for discontent at work to make David's government so distasteful. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/18-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1495;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;&#7717;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
