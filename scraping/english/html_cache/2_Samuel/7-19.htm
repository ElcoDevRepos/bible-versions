In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, God has just promised David an everlasting dynasty. David acknowledges that what God has done and promised is beyond human comprehension. The phrase "small thing" indicates that what seems monumental to humans is effortlessly within God's power. This highlights God's sovereignty and grace, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's ways and thoughts are higher than ours.<p><b>You have also spoken about the future of the house of Your servant.</b><br>Here, "the house of Your servant" refers to David's dynasty. God promises that David's lineage will endure forever, which is a pivotal moment in biblical history. This promise is foundational for the messianic expectation, as it is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, a descendant of David, as noted in <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>. The "future" aspect points to the eternal kingdom established through Christ, aligning with prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>, which speaks of an everlasting government on David's throne.<p><b>Is this Your custom with man, O Lord GOD?</b><br>David is expressing wonder at the uniqueness of God's covenant with him. The rhetorical question underscores the extraordinary nature of God's grace and favor. In the ancient Near Eastern context, covenants were common, but God's covenant with David is unparalleled because it is unconditional and eternal. This sets a precedent for the New Covenant through Jesus, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God promises a new relationship with His people.

The verse invites us to marvel at God&#8217;s boundless grace, trust His far-reaching promises in Christ, and join David in heartfelt worship of the Lord who does &#8220;immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Is this the manner of man?</span>--This clause is very obscure in the original, and little help in determining its meaning can be had from the ancient versions. The word translated "manner" is a very common one, and never has this sense elsewhere; its well established meaning is <span class= "ital">law. </span>Neither is there any reason to suppose that a question is intended. Translate, "And this is a law for man!" David expresses his surprise that so great a promise, even a decree of an eternal kingdom, should be given to such as himself and his posterity. The same thought is far less strikingly expressed in the parallel passage (<a href="/1_chronicles/17-18.htm" title="What can David speak more to you for the honor of your servant? for you know your servant.">1Chronicles 17:18</a>), "Thou hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And is this the manner of man, O Lord God?</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">and this is the law of man, O Lord Jehovah.</span> In the parallel passage (<a href="/1_chronicles/17-17.htm">1 Chronicles 17:17</a>) the Hebrew has, "And thou hast regarded me according to the law of a man of high degree." The rendering of the Authorized Version here, which, by making the clause interrogative, implies a negative, gives absolutely no sense; but some commentators render, "And this is the manner of men, O Lord Jehovah," understanding thereby that God was acting towards David in a human manner, that is, as an earthly friend and benefactor would do. But though the Revised Version favours this rendering, the Hebrew word <span class="accented">torah</span> never has this meaning, and, unless, the attempt be made to amend the text, for which the versions give no help, we must take <span class="accented">torah</span> in its usual sense, and understand that this continuance of David's house into the distant future has now become a human law, that is, a divinely constituted ordinance, which must now take its place among the laws which govern human affairs. The words are undoubtedly difficult, and we feel that David was speaking in an ejaculatory manner, in sentences but half expressed, breaking forth from him bit by bit, under the pressure of deep excitement within. We notice too that, while there is no direct reference to the Messiah in David's words, yet that the Psalms indicate that he did connect the duration of his house with the Messiah's advent; and this ejaculation may have sprung forth, if not from a fully formed conviction, yet from the feeling that the permanence of his house was for the purpose of a higher kingdom than that of Jerusalem; and so the promise was a "law of man" and the promulgation of a decree which affected the whole human race. This may be the meaning of the Vulgate, which renders "a law of Adam," that is, one embracing within its scope all Adam's race, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/7-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And as if</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1448;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5750.htm">Strong's 5750: </a> </span><span class="str2">Iteration, continuance, again, repeatedly, still, more</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2063.htm">Strong's 2063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hereby in it, likewise, the one other, same, she, so much, such deed, that, </span><br /><br /><span class="word">was a small thing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1496;&#1463;&#1503;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;tiq&#183;&#7789;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
