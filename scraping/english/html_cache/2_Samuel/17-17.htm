Their presence at En-rogel, a well or spring located near Jerusalem, was strategic. En-rogel served as a discreet meeting point outside the city, allowing them to avoid detection. This location is significant in biblical history, often associated with boundary markers between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. The choice of En-rogel highlights the need for secrecy and the importance of water sources in ancient times for both sustenance and communication.<p><b>where a servant girl would come and pass along information to them</b><br>The use of a servant girl as a messenger underscores the covert nature of their mission. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, women, especially those of lower social status, could move more freely without arousing suspicion. This reflects the wisdom and resourcefulness in David's network, utilizing all available means to gather intelligence. The role of women in biblical narratives often includes pivotal moments where they act as intermediaries or protectors, as seen with Rahab in <a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>.<p><b>They in turn would go and inform King David</b><br>Jonathan and Ahimaaz acted as vital links in the communication chain, ensuring that King David received timely and accurate information. This reflects the loyalty and dedication of David's supporters during Absalom's rebellion. The act of informing David is crucial, as it allowed him to make strategic decisions to protect his reign and fulfill God's promise to him. This mirrors the role of prophets and messengers throughout the Bible, who convey God's will to His chosen leaders.<p><b>for they dared not be seen entering the city</b><br>The need for secrecy was paramount due to the political tension and danger posed by Absalom's rebellion. Entering the city could have led to their capture or death, as Absalom's forces were on high alert for any loyalists to David. This phrase highlights the risk and courage involved in their mission. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God's providence and protection over His servants, as seen in the stories of Daniel and Esther, who navigated hostile environments with divine guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan_and_ahimaaz.htm">Jonathan and Ahimaaz</a></b><br>These are the sons of the priests Abiathar and Zadok, respectively.

There are two localities which claim to represent it, each of which has its earnest advocates: the "Fountain of the Virgin," on the western slope of the valley of the Kidron; and "Job's Well" just below the junction of the valleys of the Kidron and Hinnom. The latter answers much better to the description in Joshua, but either will suit the present passage. The loyalty of the high priests to David must have been well known, and it would have been quite unsafe for their sons to start from the city itself as bearers of tidings to David; even with all their care they were pursued.
