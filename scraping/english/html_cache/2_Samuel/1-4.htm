As a leader, he seeks to understand the situation fully. This moment occurs after the battle at Mount Gilboa, where the Israelites faced the Philistines. David's question shows his responsibility and care for his people, even though he was not present at the battle. This reflects the biblical principle of seeking truth and understanding, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/18-15.htm">Proverbs 18:15</a>, which emphasizes the importance of acquiring knowledge.<p><b>&#8220;Please tell me.&#8221;</b><br>David's request for information demonstrates his humility and willingness to listen. It shows his openness to receiving news, whether good or bad, which is a mark of a wise leader. This attitude is reminiscent of Solomon's request for wisdom in <a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>, where he asks for an understanding heart to judge the people. David's approach contrasts with Saul's often impulsive and disobedient nature, highlighting the difference in their leadership styles.<p><b>&#8220;The troops fled from the battle,&#8221; he replied.</b><br>The retreat of the Israelite troops signifies a significant defeat. This phrase highlights the dire situation Israel faced against the Philistines, who were a constant threat during this period. The Philistines' military strength and strategic advantage are evident here, as they often had superior weaponry and tactics. This defeat fulfills Samuel's prophecy in <a href="/1_samuel/28-19.htm">1 Samuel 28:19</a>, where he foretold that Israel would fall into the hands of the Philistines.<p><b>&#8220;Many of them fell and died.&#8221;</b><br>The loss of life underscores the severity of the battle and the consequences of Israel's disobedience to God. The Israelites' defeat can be seen as a result of Saul's failure to fully obey God's commands, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>. This phrase also serves as a reminder of the cost of war and the human toll it takes, echoing the lamentations found in the Psalms, where David often mourns the loss of life and the suffering of his people.<p><b>&#8220;And Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.&#8221;</b><br>The deaths of Saul and Jonathan mark a turning point in Israel's history. Saul's death signifies the end of his troubled reign, which was marred by disobedience and jealousy. Jonathan's death is particularly poignant, as he was a loyal friend to David and a noble character. Their deaths fulfill the prophecy given by Samuel in <a href="/1_samuel/28-19.htm">1 Samuel 28:19</a>. Jonathan's relationship with David is often seen as a type of Christ's love and friendship, as Jonathan selflessly supported David's future kingship, reflecting the sacrificial love Christ shows to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, known for his heart after God.

Instantly David&#8217;s heart is fixed on the fate of Israel. This opening question shows:<p>&#8226; A shepherd&#8208;king&#8217;s concern for the flock entrusted to him (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34&#8211;35</a>; <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p>&#8226; An eagerness for truth, not rumor&#8212;he seeks a clear, factual report (<a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The beginning of God&#8217;s transition of rule: David is about to learn that the throne of Saul is vacant (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>David asked.</b><p>The inspired narrative pauses to emphasize that David himself is doing the asking.
