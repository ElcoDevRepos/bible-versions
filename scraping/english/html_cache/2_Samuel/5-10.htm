After being anointed king over all Israel, David's reign began to solidify, marked by military victories and political consolidation. His growth in greatness can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to establish his kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8-16</a>). David's increasing greatness also reflects the divine favor upon him, as seen in his successful campaigns against the Philistines and other surrounding nations. This growth is not merely in terms of military might but also in wisdom, leadership, and the establishment of Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel.<p><b>for the LORD God of Hosts was with him</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine source of David's success. The title "LORD God of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and command over the heavenly armies, indicating His supreme power and authority. The presence of God with David is a recurring theme in his life, from his anointing by Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>) to his victories in battle (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-47</a>). This divine accompaniment is a testament to God's covenant faithfulness and His choice of David as king. It also prefigures the presence of God with Jesus Christ, the Son of David, who would establish an eternal kingdom. The assurance of God's presence provided David with the confidence and strength to lead Israel, reflecting the biblical principle that true greatness and success come from reliance on God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, David is the newly anointed king of Israel.

The birth of Solomon even is recorded in it, though it took place long afterwards. The insertion in this summary of Hiram's acknowledgment of David proves that this event made a great impression upon the minds of the people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/5-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">became</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
