Harvest time was significant in Israelite culture, often associated with festivals and offerings to God, such as the Feast of Weeks (Shavuot). It was a time of both celebration and vulnerability, as enemies might attack to seize the harvest.<p><b>three of the thirty chief men</b><br>The "thirty chief men" refers to a group of elite warriors who were part of David's mighty men, a select group of soldiers known for their bravery and loyalty.

The cave symbolizes refuge and the beginning of David's rise to power.<p><b>while a company of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim</b><br>The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel during this period, often engaging in battles with David and his men. The Valley of Rephaim, located southwest of Jerusalem, was a fertile area and a strategic location for military campaigns. The presence of the Philistines in this valley indicates a time of conflict and tension, as they sought to assert control over the region.

The absence of the article shows that these three were not Jashobeam, Eleazar, and Shammah, but probably Abishai, Be-naiah, and another whose name and exploits have been purposely omitted both here and in Chronicles. Apparently this narrative, so interesting as showing the fascination which David exercised over his men, is given as having led to the institution of this second order of three in the brotherhood of the mighties. <span class="cmt_word">In the harvest time.</span> The Hebrew is "to harvest," but in <a href="/1_chronicles/11-15.htm">1 Chronicles 11:15</a> "to the rock."
