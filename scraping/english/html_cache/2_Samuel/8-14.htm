Edom, descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, had a long history of conflict with Israel. By placing garrisons, David ensured a permanent military presence, securing Israel's southern border and maintaining peace. This action reflects the fulfillment of the prophecy given to Rebekah in <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>, where it was foretold that the older (Esau/Edom) would serve the younger (Jacob/Israel). Archaeological evidence suggests that Edom was a significant kingdom during this period, with fortified cities that David would have needed to control to secure his reign.<p><b>and all the Edomites were subject to David</b><br>This subjugation of the Edomites under David's rule signifies the expansion of his kingdom and the fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel victory over its enemies. Historically, this subjugation would have involved tribute and labor, integrating Edom into the economic and political structure of David's kingdom. The Edomites' subjection is a testament to David's military prowess and God's favor upon him. This also prefigures the ultimate reign of Christ, who will have dominion over all nations, as prophesied in <a href="/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>.<p><b>So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine favor and providence that accompanied David's military campaigns. It highlights the theological theme that David's success was not merely due to his own abilities but was a result of the LORD's intervention and blessing. This echoes the covenantal promise made to David in <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, where God assures him of a lasting dynasty. The victories granted to David foreshadow the ultimate victory of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, who triumphs over sin and death, establishing an eternal kingdom. This divine assistance is a recurring theme in the narrative of David's life, emphasizing that true success and victory come from reliance on God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, anointed by God, who expanded the kingdom and established a strong rule.

David&#8217;s strategic moves and military might were real, but the ultimate cause was God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness, ensuring that His anointed king prospered &#8220;wherever he went.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Throughout all Edom put he garrisons.</span> In a country naturally so strong as Edom, and with neighbouring states ready to give shelter to their fugitives, Joab's attempt would cause great misery, but only a moderate loss of life. And as soon as he withdrew, the exiles would return to their old homes. To keep them, therefore, in entire subjection, the country was. held by strong garrisons, and the Edomites became David's servants, being apparently deprived for the present of any form of independent government. We have, then, in this chapter, a brief summary of David's wars, whereby he established his supremacy ever the extensive region from Hamath on the north to the salt plains on the south of the Dead Sea, and from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/8-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He placed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#347;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
