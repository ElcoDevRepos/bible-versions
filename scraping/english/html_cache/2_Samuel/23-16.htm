These men were part of David's elite forces, often called the "Three" or "The Thirty," who performed extraordinary feats. The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel during David's time, and their camp near Bethlehem indicates their control over the area. This act of breaking through the camp demonstrates the men's courage and loyalty to David, risking their lives to fulfill his expressed desire for water from Bethlehem.<p><b>drew water from the well near the gate of Bethlehem</b><br>Bethlehem, David's hometown, held significant personal and historical importance. The well near the gate was a familiar landmark, symbolizing David's longing for the comforts of home amidst the hardships of war. The act of drawing water from this well, despite the Philistine occupation, highlights the men's determination and the strategic importance of Bethlehem. This event also foreshadows the significance of Bethlehem in biblical prophecy, as the birthplace of Jesus Christ (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>).<p><b>and brought it back to David</b><br>The return journey with the water underscores the dedication and loyalty of the mighty men to David. Their willingness to risk their lives for a seemingly simple request illustrates the deep bond between David and his warriors. This act of devotion is reminiscent of the loyalty expected of followers of Christ, who are called to serve with selflessness and courage.<p><b>But he refused to drink it</b><br>David's refusal to drink the water is a profound moment of humility and reverence. Recognizing the sacrifice his men made, David sees the water as too precious for personal consumption. This decision reflects a leader's responsibility to honor the sacrifices of those who serve him, valuing their lives above his own desires.<p><b>instead, he poured it out to the LORD</b><br>Pouring the water out to the LORD is an act of worship and consecration. David offers the water as a libation, a common practice in ancient Israel to dedicate something valuable to God. This act signifies David's acknowledgment that the bravery and lives of his men are sacred, and it elevates their sacrifice to a spiritual level. It also prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who poured out His life for humanity (<a href="/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who expresses a longing for water from the well of Bethlehem, his hometown.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_three_mighty_men.htm">The Three Mighty Men</a></b><br>A group of David's elite warriors known for their bravery and loyalty.

The three mighty men risked everything to satisfy their king&#8217;s longing; David, recognizing the cost, refused to indulge and instead offered the precious water to the LORD. The passage teaches that heroic service, sacrificial love, and God-focused honor are inseparable for those who belong to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Poured it out unto the Lord.</span>--The brave act of the three heroes shows strikingly the personal power of David over his followers and the enthusiasm with which he inspired them. Yet, on the other hand, David would not suffer his own longing to be gratified by the hazard of men's lives. Taking the water, therefore, he "poured it out unto the Lord." The word is the technical term for the sacrificial libation, and David assimilated his act to a sacrifice by a solemn consecration of this dangerously won water to the Lord.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Brake through the host</span> (or, <span class="accented">camp</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>of the Philistines.</span> The Philistine camp was pitched in the valley of Rephaim, and to reach Bethlehem, which was more than twenty or twenty-five miles distant, these three heroes must pass close to the ground occupied by the enemy. The valley of Rephaim, in fact, extended from Jerusalem to Bethlehem, and, to guard their position, the Philistines held Bethlehem with a strong garrison. Of course the heroes would use every precaution; for to be discovered would be certain death. The story of their perils and presence of mind in danger, and hairbreadth escape, would be full of interest; but we are told only that they succeeded, and returned in safety, bearing their precious burden; but David would not drink, <span class="cmt_word">and poured it out unto Jehovah.</span> The word is that used of a sacrificial libation; for David regarded it as holy, and consecrated to God, because it had been bought with blood - at the risk, that is, of the lives of these gallant men. Nothing is recorded in the romances of the Middle Ages, when knightly chivalry was at its height, more gallant and noble than the exploit of these men. And the very essence of its devotion lay in the fact that it was done to gratify a mere sick longing, and therefore out of pure love. Sick, no doubt, David was, and burning with fever; and even more depressed by the apparent hopelessness of his position. The exploit changed the course of his thoughts. What could he not do with such heroes! Though racked during their absence with anxiety and self-reproach, yet on their return he would be dispirited no longer, but filled with confidence. The words, "Shall I drink?" inserted in the Revised Version, have apparently dropped out of the text by accident. They are found in the parallel place in Chronicles, and in the Septuagint and Vulgate here.
