The summit is significant as a place of worship and prayer, reflecting David's deep relationship with God. The Mount of Olives is also a place of prophetic importance, as it is where Jesus would later pray before His crucifixion (<a href="/luke/22-39.htm">Luke 22:39-44</a>).<p><b>where he used to worship God</b><br>David's practice of worshiping at this summit highlights his devotion and reliance on God, even during times of distress.

The summit of the Mount of Olives was one of the many bamoth, or high places, situated on the top of hills, where, in the old Canaanitish time, men had worshipped their heathenish deities. They were still regarded as consecrated places, but the worship had now been transferred to Elohim, the true God. They continued to be hallowed spots, with Levitical priests to minister at them, until the stricter times of Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/23-8.htm">2 Kings 23:8</a>), when such worship was forbidden; but even then these priests seem to have retained considerable privileges, though their position was inferior to that held by the priests of the temple. It was at this hallowed spot that David's old friend and privy counselor (ver. 37), Hushai, met him, <span class="cmt_word">with his coat rent</span> - not the upper garment, but the <span class="accented">kuttoneth</span>, the under tunic, the rending of which was a sign of deeper sorrow. We read of "the border of the Archites" (so the Revised Version, rightly) in <a href="/joshua/16-2.htm">Joshua 16:2</a>, near Bethel, in the tribe of Manasseh; and Hushai's birthplace was probably there. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/15-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5704.htm">Strong's 5704: </a> </span><span class="str2">As far as, even to, up to, until, while</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the summit,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1465;&#1428;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;r&#333;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7218.htm">Strong's 7218: </a> </span><span class="str2">The head</span><br /><br /><span class="word">where</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1469;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he used to worship</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1493;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#353;&#183;ta&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7812.htm">Strong's 7812: </a> </span><span class="str2">To depress, prostrate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">God,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Hushai</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#363;&#183;&#353;ay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2365.htm">Strong's 2365: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hushai -- two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Archite</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;ar&#183;k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_757.htm">Strong's 757: </a> </span><span class="str2">Archite -- a native of a place in Palestine</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was there</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
