Toi, the king of Hamath, recognized David's growing power and influence after his victories. This act of sending Joram signifies a desire for peace and alliance. The name "Joram" means "Yahweh is exalted," which may reflect the religious beliefs of the time, even among neighboring nations. This gesture also prefigures the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate emissary of peace between God and humanity.<p><b>and bless him for fighting and defeating Hadadezer</b><br>Toi's blessing of David for his military success against Hadadezer indicates a political alignment. Hadadezer was a powerful king of Zobah, and his defeat by David would have shifted the balance of power in the region. This blessing can be seen as an acknowledgment of God's favor upon David, aligning with the biblical theme of God granting victory to His chosen leaders. It also reflects the broader biblical narrative of God using Israel to establish His purposes among the nations.<p><b>who had been at war with Toi</b><br>The conflict between Hadadezer and Toi suggests regional power struggles typical of the era. Hamath and Zobah were neighboring kingdoms in what is now modern-day Syria. This historical context highlights the political landscape during David's reign, where alliances and enmities were constantly shifting. The defeat of Hadadezer by David would have been advantageous for Toi, as it removed a common adversary and opened the door for peaceful relations with Israel.<p><b>Joram brought with him articles of silver and gold and bronze</b><br>The presentation of valuable articles signifies a tribute or gift, common in ancient diplomatic relations. These materials were not only symbols of wealth but also of honor and respect. In the biblical narrative, such gifts often represent acknowledgment of God's blessing and favor upon Israel. The mention of silver, gold, and bronze also connects to the wealth and splendor of Solomon's future reign, as well as the construction of the Temple, where these materials were prominently used. This act of giving can be seen as a foreshadowing of the gifts brought to Jesus by the Magi, symbolizing recognition of divine authority and kingship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, David is the king of Israel who has achieved victory over Hadadezer, showcasing his military prowess and God's favor upon him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joram.htm">Joram</a></b><br>The son of King Tou, sent to King David to convey greetings and blessings, and to bring gifts of silver, gold, and bronze.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_tou.htm">King Tou</a></b><br>The king of Hamath, who sends his son Joram to David.

Toi&#8217;s son, Joram, arrives as living proof that God&#8217;s promises stand literal, accurate, and unstoppable: enemies are subdued, allies are blessed, and all glory flows back to the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Joram</span>=Hadoram, <a href="/1_chronicles/18-10.htm" title="He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.">1Chronicles 18:10</a>. Joram is probably the Jewish form of the same name. An embassy headed by the king's son was an especially honourable one. The occasion was David's conquest of Toi's neighbour and constant enemy, and the large presents sent by him have something of the character of tribute. The phrase "to bless him," is simply equivalent to "congratulate him," by which the same word is translated in <a href="/1_chronicles/18-10.htm" title="He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.">1Chronicles 18:10</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Joram</span>. In <a href="/1_chronicles/18-10.htm">1 Chronicles 18:10</a> he is called Hadoram, and this was apparently his real name, Joram being merely the substitution of the nearest Hebrew word for something foreign and therefore unintelligible. So among the descendants of the French refugees settled in England similar changes are common. Thus Pillons becomes Pillow; Chevallier, Shoveller; St. Amour, Stammers. As Hamath bordered upon Zobah, and apparently had waged unsuccessful war with the vigorous Hadarezer, Tel was grateful to David for smiting his rival, and sent this embassy of congratulation for the purpose of ensuring the conqueror's friendship. For this end he also sent rich presents; and as a present is called in the Hebrew a <span class="accented">blessing</span> (<a href="/1_samuel/25-27.htm">1 Samuel 25:27</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-26.htm">1 Samuel 30:26</a>, margin), the phrase used here, to bless him, contains the idea, not only of congratulation, but of offerings. There is something admirable in this high Oriental courtesy. The material value of the gifts is left in the background. Their worth lies in their being the acknowledgment of the Divine favour resting upon David, and in the prayer that that favour may continue. In <a href="/psalms/18-43.htm">Psalm 18:43, 44</a> we have proof of the great pleasure which this embassy from so great a nation gave to David. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/8-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">he</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;&#8216;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8583.htm">Strong's 8583: </a> </span><span class="str2">Toi -- a king of Hamath</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1443;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
