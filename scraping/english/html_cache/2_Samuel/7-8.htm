David is referred to as "My servant," a title of honor and humility, indicating his role as a chosen leader under God's authority. This reflects the biblical theme of servanthood, where leaders are called to serve God and His people, as seen in other figures like Moses (<a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>) and Jesus Christ, who is described as the ultimate servant (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>).<p><b>that this is what the LORD of Hosts says:</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power, often used in contexts of divine authority and military might. It underscores that the message comes from the supreme commander of the heavenly armies, reinforcing the seriousness and authority of the proclamation. This title is frequently used in prophetic literature, highlighting God's control over all creation (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>).<p><b>I took you from the pasture, from following the flock,</b><br>This phrase recalls David's humble beginnings as a shepherd, a common occupation in ancient Israel. Shepherding was a formative experience for David, teaching him leadership, protection, and care, qualities essential for his future role as king. This imagery is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus is described as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), drawing a parallel between David's pastoral role and Christ's spiritual leadership.<p><b>to be the ruler over My people Israel.</b><br>God's elevation of David from shepherd to king signifies divine election and purpose. David's kingship is not just a political role but a spiritual one, as he is to lead God's chosen people, Israel. This transition from shepherd to king prefigures the messianic expectation of a ruler from David's line, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is recognized as the King of Kings (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>). The phrase also highlights the covenant relationship between God and Israel, with David as the mediator of God's rule on earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, David was the youngest son of Jesse, anointed by Samuel to be king over Israel.

The title is one God previously used for Moses (<a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>) and later for the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>). It affirms David&#8217;s loyalty (<a href="/psalms/89-20.htm">Psalm 89:20</a>) and reminds us that true greatness in God&#8217;s kingdom is found in serving (<a href="/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26&#8211;28</a>). Though king, David remains under orders; the Word governs even the ruler (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>this is what the LORD of Hosts says:</b><p>&#8220;LORD of Hosts&#8221; (YHWH &#7778;eb&#257;&#702;&#333;t) presents God as Commander of angelic armies. David once faced Goliath &#8220;in the name of the LORD of Hosts&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>). The title reassures David that the covenant&#8217;s fulfillment rests on omnipotence, not human strength (<a href="/jeremiah/32-17.htm">Jeremiah 32:17</a>). The God who marshals heavenly forces will guard the throne He is about to promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I took you from the pasture,</b><p>The Lord reminds David of humble beginnings. He was literally lifted &#8220;from the sheepfolds&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70</a>). Election, not elevation by self, placed him on Israel&#8217;s throne (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11&#8211;13</a>). By spotlighting the pasture, God underscores grace: every step in David&#8217;s rise was directed by providence (<a href="/1_samuel/17-37.htm">1 Samuel 17:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from following the flock,</b><p>David had been walking behind sheep&#8212;now Israel walks behind him. The sharp contrast magnifies divine promotion (<a href="/amos/7-15.htm">Amos 7:15</a>). It also points to a shepherd-king paradigm: leadership grounded in care, vigilance, and sacrificial concern (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>). As David once guarded lambs from lions, he is to guard a nation from enemies (<a href="/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to be the ruler over My people Israel.</b><p>God defines the purpose of His calling. David rules by divine appointment, not popular consent (<a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>). The phrase &#8220;My people&#8221; stresses possession; Israel belongs to the Lord, and David is trustee, not owner (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5&#8211;6</a>). This appointment foreshadows the ultimate Son of David who will &#8220;shepherd all nations with an iron scepter&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/12-5.htm">Revelation 12:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Each phrase in <a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8</a> traces a journey: grace interrupts (Now then), speaks to a servant (My servant David), with sovereign authority (LORD of Hosts), recalling humble origins (pasture, flock), and defining a divine mission (ruler over My people). The verse invites us to marvel at God&#8217;s initiative, His transforming grace, and His unwavering commitment to lead and protect His people through the shepherd-king of His choosing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Sheepcote.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">pasture.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I took thee from the sheepcote.</span> There is in Nathan's message a marked advance upon the words of all previous prophecies. Hitherto God's promises had been general, and no tribe, and much less any special person, had been chosen as the progenitor of the Messiah. The nearest approach to the selection of a tribe had been the prediction of Judah's supremacy until Shiloh came (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>); but it was not even there expressly declared that Shiloh should be of Judah's race. But now David is clearly chosen. Jehovah takes him from the sheepcote; Hebrew, "the meadow" (see <a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70</a>). It was in the meadows, the Naioth, round Ramah, that Samuel had gathered the young men of Israel to study their ancient records, and raise their country to a sense of its high calling. In those meadows David had been formed for his high vocation; but he had returned from them to Bethlehem, to feed his father's sheep. And now, "from following the ewes that gave suck," Jehovah takes him to be "his servant," a word of high dignity, applied to but few persons in the Old Testament. It signifies the prime minister, or vicegerent of Jehovah, as the theocratic king, and is the special title of Moses among God's people, and, among the heathen, of Nebuchadnezzar, as one summoned to do a great work for God. But it is in the last twenty-seven chapters of Isaiah that the title reaches its full grandeur. For there, first of all, Israel is called Jehovah's servant, because it was Israel's office to be the witness for the oneness of God amidst the debasing polytheism of all the nations round. And then, finally, the servant is Messiah, as being the personal Representative of God upon earth. The title is now given to David as the type of Christ's kingly office, and also as the sweet singer, who added a new service to the worship of God, and made it more spiritual, and more like the service of angels round God's throne. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/7-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1440;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
