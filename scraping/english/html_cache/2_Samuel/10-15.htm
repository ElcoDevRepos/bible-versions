Their defeat by Israel highlights the military prowess of King David's forces, which were divinely supported. This event is part of a series of victories that established Israel as a dominant regional power. The Arameans' defeat can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to David to subdue his enemies (<a href="/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>). This phrase also reflects the ongoing conflict between Israel and surrounding nations, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>they regrouped</b><br>The act of regrouping indicates the resilience and determination of the Arameans despite their defeat. This response is typical of ancient warfare, where defeated armies would often attempt to reorganize and counterattack. The regrouping of the Arameans suggests a strategic move to consolidate their forces, possibly seeking alliances with other nations, as seen in their previous coalition with the Ammonites (<a href="/2_samuel/10-6.htm">2 Samuel 10:6</a>). This persistence can be contrasted with the ultimate victory of Israel, which foreshadows the ultimate triumph of God's kingdom despite opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/arameans.htm">Arameans</a></b><br>A group of people from the region of Aram, known for their conflicts with Israel.
