Rising early signifies diligence and a desire to be the first to influence those seeking justice. The city gate was a central place for legal matters and public affairs in ancient Israel, serving as a courtroom and a hub for community interaction (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">Deuteronomy 21:19</a>, <a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1</a>). By positioning himself here, Absalom aimed to intercept those seeking the king's judgment, subtly undermining King David's authority.<p><b>Whenever anyone had a grievance to bring before the king for a decision,</b><br>This phrase highlights the judicial role of the king in ancient Israel. The king was expected to be a just ruler, providing decisions on disputes and grievances (<a href="/1_kings/3-16.htm">1 Kings 3:16-28</a>). Absalom's actions suggest dissatisfaction with the current administration, exploiting any perceived inefficiencies in David's governance to gain favor with the people.<p><b>Absalom would call out and ask, &#8220;What city are you from?&#8221;</b><br>Absalom's inquiry about the city of origin was a tactic to personalize his interaction, making each person feel recognized and important. This approach helped him to build rapport and gather support from various regions, subtly sowing seeds of division by emphasizing tribal affiliations. It reflects a political maneuver to create a sense of connection and loyalty among the tribes of Israel.<p><b>And if he replied, &#8220;Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel,&#8221;</b><br>The response indicates the diverse representation of the tribes coming to seek justice, underscoring the unity and complexity of the nation of Israel. Absalom's reference to the tribes taps into the tribal identity and loyalty, which were significant in Israel's social and political structure (<a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24:1-28</a>). By addressing individuals as "your servant," Absalom positions himself as a servant leader, contrasting himself with the perceived remoteness of King David, and appealing to the people's desire for accessible leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his handsome appearance and charismatic personality.

The passage warns that charismatic substitutes thrive where rightful leadership grows distant, urging vigilant discernment and loyalty to God-ordained authority.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The way of the gate.</span> The gate would be that of the royal palace, where the king gave audience and administered justice. At the gate of the city the elders were the judges, and, though the higher authority of the king may have weakened the action of this citizen court, yet passages such as Isaiah 50:23 and <a href="/jeremiah/5-28.htm">Jeremiah 5:28</a> imply, not only its continued existence, but also that it retained much importance. Probably all causes between citizens were tried by it, just as causes in the country were tried by the mishpachah (see note on 2 Samuel 14:7); but with an appeal in weighty matters to the king. It is a mistake to suppose that David altogether neglected his judicial functions. On the contrary, the woman of Tekoah obtained an audience, as a matter of course; and Absalom would not have risen up thus early unless David had also taken his seat in the early morning on the royal divan to administer justice. It was the suitors on their way to the king whom Absalom accosted, and made believe that he would be more assiduous in his duties than his father, and that he would have decided every suit in favour of the person to whom he was talking, whereas really one side alone can gain the cause. Still, we may well believe that, guilty himself of adultery and murder, and with his two eider sons stained with such terrible crimes, David's administration of justice had become half hearted. And thus his sin again found him out, and brought stern punishment. For Absalom used this weakness against his father, and, intercepting the suitors on their way, would ask their city and tribe, and listen to their complaint, and assure them of the goodness of their cause, and lament that, as the king could not hear all causes easily himself, he did not appoint others to aid him in his duties. It was delay and procrastination of which Absalom complained; and as many of the litigants had probably come day after day, and not succeeded in getting a hearing, they were already in ill humour and prepared to find fault. Now, as David possessed great powers of organization, we may well believe that he would have taken measures for the adequate administration of law had it not been for the moral malady which enfeebled his will. In the appointment of Jehoshaphat and Seraiah (<a href="/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16, 17</a>) he had made a beginning, but soon his hands grew feeble, and he did no more. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/15-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;l&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_53.htm">Strong's 53: </a> </span><span class="str2">Absalom -- 'my father is peace', two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">would get up early</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hi&#353;&#183;k&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
