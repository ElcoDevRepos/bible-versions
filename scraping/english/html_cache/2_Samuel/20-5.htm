This reflects David's attempt to consolidate his kingdom after Absalom's rebellion. Amasa's role is significant as it highlights the political tensions within Israel, especially between the tribes of Judah and the northern tribes. The act of summoning Judah indicates the need for unity and military readiness, emphasizing the importance of leadership and loyalty in the kingdom.<p><b>but he took longer than the time allotted him</b><br>Amasa's delay in gathering the troops could be attributed to several factors, including possible resistance from the people of Judah or logistical challenges. This delay is critical as it sets the stage for Joab's return to power, showcasing the themes of loyalty and betrayal. The time-sensitive nature of military campaigns in ancient Israel underscores the urgency and the potential consequences of failing to act swiftly.

The pattern shows that leaders must rally God&#8217;s people swiftly to meet threats and pursue God-given mandates.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but he took longer</b><p>&#8226; The text states a simple fact: Amasa delayed. Reasons are unstated, yet possibilities include:<p>&#8211; Logistical hurdles in mustering dispersed troops (cf. <a href="/judges/5-16.htm">Judges 5:16</a>).<p>&#8211; Lukewarm allegiance among men still grieving Absalom or uncertain about David&#8217;s restored rule (<a href="/2_samuel/19-41.htm">2 Samuel 19:41-43</a>).<p>&#8211; Personal hesitation as Amasa replaces Joab, a seasoned and feared commander (<a href="/2_samuel/3-39.htm">2 Samuel 3:39</a>).<p>&#8226; Whatever the cause, Scripture highlights that delay in divine assignments carries consequences. Saul&#8217;s unlawful sacrifice under pressure (<a href="/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8-14</a>) and Lot&#8217;s lingering in Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-16.htm">Genesis 19:16</a>) show how postponement jeopardizes God&#8217;s purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>than the time allotted him</b><p>&#8226; David had fixed a three-day window (<a href="/2_samuel/20-4.htm">2 Samuel 20:4</a>).

The simplest explanation may be drawn from the fact that, in <a href="/2_samuel/20-8.htm" title="When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was girded to him, and on it a girdle with a sword fastened on his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it fell out.">2Samuel 20:8</a>, Amasa is met on his return at Gibeon. He had therefore gone quite out of the bounds of Judah into Benjamin, and had consumed more time in consequence of exceeding his instructions. The fact suggests great doubt of his fitness for the place David had promised him. Joab appears to insinuate (in <a href="/2_samuel/20-11.htm" title="And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that favors Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.">2Samuel 20:11</a>) that Amasa was not really loyal.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - He tarried longer than the set time. But not longer than was to be expected. For the appointment was so surprising that everybody must have been agape with astonishment. They would naturally have expected that Amasa would he punished. Instead of this, he is commissioned to gather the militia in David's name. And men would hesitate about joining such a leader. Was he really loyal? or would he embark them in a new rebellion? And what would Joab do? He was not a man likely to bear such a slight tamely, and David ought to have foreseen that he was sowing for himself a crop of discord and enmity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/20-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Amasa</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#347;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6021.htm">Strong's 6021: </a> </span><span class="str2">Amasa -- two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
