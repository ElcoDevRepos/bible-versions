It signifies God's power over creation and His ability to reveal hidden things. The "channels" suggest pathways or routes that were previously unseen, emphasizing God's sovereignty in making a way where there seems to be none.<p><b>and the foundations of the world were exposed</b><br>This imagery suggests a cataclysmic event where the very structure of the earth is laid bare. It can be seen as a metaphor for God's judgment and His ability to uncover the deepest truths. The "foundations" symbolize stability and order, and their exposure indicates a divine intervention that disrupts the natural order. This can be connected to the creation narrative in Genesis, where God establishes the earth, and to prophetic literature like <a href="/isaiah/24-18.htm">Isaiah 24:18-20</a>, which speaks of the earth reeling under God's judgment.<p><b>at the rebuke of the LORD</b><br>The term "rebuke" indicates a strong expression of disapproval or correction from God. Throughout scripture, God's rebuke is often associated with His judgment against sin and injustice, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/18-15.htm">Psalm 18:15</a> and <a href="/isaiah/50-2.htm">Isaiah 50:2</a>. It underscores God's authority and His role as the righteous judge who holds creation accountable.<p><b>at the blast of the breath of His nostrils</b><br>This phrase uses anthropomorphic language to describe God's power and wrath. The "breath of His nostrils" is a vivid depiction of God's life-giving and life-taking force, reminiscent of <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, where God breathes life into Adam. It also parallels the imagery in <a href="/job/4-9.htm">Job 4:9</a> and <a href="/isaiah/11-4.htm">Isaiah 11:4</a>, where God's breath is a means of executing judgment. This phrase highlights the immediacy and potency of God's actions, reinforcing His omnipotence and the awe-inspiring nature of His presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this song of praise, David is reflecting on God's deliverance and power.

Think of <a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>, where &#8220;the waters were divided&#8221; and Israel walked &#8220;through the sea on dry ground.&#8221; The same thought re-emerges in <a href="/psalms/18-15.htm">Psalm 18:15</a>, a parallel song: &#8220;The channels of the sea appeared&#8230;&#8221;<p>- This line proclaims that when God decides to rescue, every barrier&#8212; even an ocean&#8212; simply moves aside. <a href="/joshua/3-16.htm">Joshua 3:16</a> shows the Jordan River piling up in a heap; <a href="/psalms/77-16.htm">Psalm 77:16-19</a> recalls waters trembling at God&#8217;s presence. All these scenes echo the idea that creation itself is no match for the Creator.<p>- The picture stirs confidence: if the Lord can make the ocean floor visible, He can certainly open a path for us through any crisis.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the foundations of the world were exposed</b><p>- &#8220;Foundations&#8221; suggests the deepest, firmest parts of the earth. <a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4-6</a> asks where those foundations were laid; <a href="/psalms/104-5.htm">Psalm 104:5</a> says God &#8220;set the earth on its foundations.&#8221; When He intervenes, even those hidden supports shake (<a href="/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5-6</a>; <a href="/revelation/6-14.htm">Revelation 6:14</a>).<p>- The verse tells us that no realm&#8212; physical or spiritual&#8212; is outside God&#8217;s reach. He can peel back the layers of the world as easily as we lift a stone.<p>- Practical takeaway: because He sees what is normally unseen, He also exposes motives, plots, and dangers we cannot detect. Nothing stays buried when He acts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the rebuke of the LORD</b><p>- A &#8220;rebuke&#8221; is more than a verbal correction; it carries force. <a href="/psalms/106-9.htm">Psalm 106:9</a> says, &#8220;He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up.&#8221; <a href="/isaiah/50-2.htm">Isaiah 50:2</a> reminds us that at His rebuke, seas turn to deserts.<p>- David credits God&#8217;s spoken authority for his deliverance, not military skill or circumstance. Creation obeys God&#8217;s voice, so foes must also bow.<p>- For us, this means every enemy&#8212; visible or invisible&#8212; ultimately answers to that same rebuke. When the Lord speaks against something, it cannot stand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the blast of the breath of His nostrils</b><p>- The picture intensifies: not only God&#8217;s word, but even the breath from His nostrils unleashes might. <a href="/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a> celebrates that &#8220;At the blast of Your nostrils the waters piled up.&#8221; <a href="/job/4-9.htm">Job 4:9</a> adds, &#8220;By the breath of God they perish.&#8221;<p>- Breath suggests both life-giving and life-ending power. <a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a> shows God breathing life into Adam, while <a href="/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8</a> describes smoke and fire issuing from Him in judgment.<p>- David&#8217;s point: what terrifies enemies is effortless for God&#8212; it is no more difficult than breathing. That is the measureless gap between Creator and creation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/22-16.htm">2 Samuel 22:16</a> paints a cascading picture: God breathes, rebukes, lays bare seas and earth, and rescues His servant. Every phrase shouts that the Lord&#8217;s power is absolute, immediate, and personal. If He can expose ocean channels and earth&#8217;s foundations, He can certainly reach into our circumstances, overturn obstacles, and defend His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Of the sea</span>.--Psalms 18, "of waters."
