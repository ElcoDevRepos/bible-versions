The metaphor of smoke rising from the nostrils is reminiscent of a snorting, powerful animal, suggesting divine wrath and strength. In the ancient Near Eastern context, such imagery would be understood as a demonstration of a deity's might. This phrase can be connected to other biblical passages where God's anger is described with similar imagery, such as in <a href="/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8</a>, which parallels this verse. It emphasizes the seriousness of God's judgment and His active involvement in the affairs of humanity.<p><b>and consuming fire came from His mouth</b><br>Fire is a common biblical symbol for God's holiness and judgment. The consuming fire from God's mouth signifies His ability to destroy and purify. This imagery is consistent with other scriptural references, such as <a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>, which describes God as a "consuming fire." It also foreshadows the final judgment and purification of the world, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>, where a sharp sword comes from the mouth of Christ to strike down the nations. This phrase highlights God's power to enact justice and His role as the ultimate judge.<p><b>glowing coals blazed forth</b><br>The glowing coals represent the intense and purifying nature of God's presence. In the ancient world, coals were used for refining metals, symbolizing purification and judgment. This imagery is also found in <a href="/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6-7</a>, where a seraphim touches Isaiah's lips with a live coal to purify him. The blazing forth of coals signifies the active and dynamic nature of God's intervention in the world. It underscores the theme of divine purification and the transformative power of God's presence, which is both fearsome and purifying.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this song of praise, David is reflecting on God's deliverance and power.
