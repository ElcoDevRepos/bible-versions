Joab, as the commander of David's army, had a retinue of young men, indicating his high status and the importance of his role. The number ten may symbolize completeness or fullness, suggesting a well-prepared and formidable group. This reflects the organized military structure of Israel during King David's reign. The presence of these young men highlights Joab's authority and the loyalty of his followers.<p><b>surrounded Absalom</b><br>Absalom, David's son, had rebelled against his father, leading to a civil war. His capture and death were pivotal in quelling the rebellion. The act of surrounding Absalom signifies the inescapable judgment he faced due to his actions. This moment fulfills the prophecy of Nathan in <a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>, where God declared that calamity would arise from David's own house. The surrounding of Absalom also symbolizes the inevitability of divine justice.<p><b>struck him</b><br>The act of striking Absalom is significant as it represents the execution of justice. Absalom's rebellion was not only against his father but against God's anointed king. The striking down of Absalom can be seen as a necessary act to restore order and uphold God's chosen leadership. This moment echoes the biblical theme of the consequences of sin and rebellion against divine authority.<p><b>and killed him</b><br>The death of Absalom marks the end of his insurrection and the restoration of David's rule. It serves as a sobering reminder of the cost of rebellion and the seriousness of opposing God's will. Absalom's death also prefigures the ultimate judgment that awaits those who reject God's authority. In a typological sense, it contrasts with the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, who, unlike Absalom, submitted to God's will and brought reconciliation rather than division.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The son of King David, who rebelled against his father and sought to take the throne of Israel.

Their number contrasts with Absalom&#8217;s lonely predicament, fulfilling the warning that &#8220;the sword shall never depart from your house&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who carried Joab&#8217;s armor</b><p>&#8226;
