This highlights David's diverse following, including foreigners, which reflects his leadership and the fulfillment of God's promise to make Israel a light to the nations. Ittai's loyalty to David, despite being a Philistine, prefigures the inclusion of Gentiles in God's plan, as seen in the New Testament.<p><b>&#8220;Why should you also go with us?</b><br>David questions Ittai's decision to join him during Absalom's rebellion. This reflects David's humility and concern for the well-being of his followers. It also shows David's awareness of the risks involved in his flight from Jerusalem. This moment parallels Jesus' invitation to count the cost of discipleship (<a href="/luke/14-28.htm">Luke 14:28</a>).<p><b>Go back and stay with the new king,</b><br>David refers to Absalom, who has declared himself king. This phrase underscores the political turmoil and the reality of Absalom's temporary power. It also highlights David's willingness to release his followers from loyalty, a contrast to Absalom's ambition. This can be seen as a type of Christ's kingdom, where true allegiance is voluntary and not coerced.<p><b>since you are both a foreigner and an exile from your homeland.</b><br>Ittai is identified as a foreigner and exile, emphasizing his outsider status. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's care for the foreigner and the marginalized (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18-19</a>).

His Philistine background recalls David&#8217;s own earlier refuge in Gath under Achish (<a href="/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>), showing how God weaves unlikely people into His plan, much as He did with Rahab (<a href="/joshua/6-25.htm">Joshua 6:25</a>) and Ruth (<a href="/ruth/2-12.htm">Ruth 2:12</a>).<p>&#8226; David still speaks as &#8220;the king,&#8221; underscoring that earthly upheaval cannot cancel God&#8217;s choice (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-28.htm">Psalm 89:28-29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Why should you also go with us?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; David&#8217;s first instinct is protective, not self-preserving. He refuses to draft loyalty; he invites Ittai to count the cost (cf. Lu 14:28-30).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s humility resembles earlier moments when he put others&#8217; welfare ahead of his own (<a href="/1_samuel/22-3.htm">1 Samuel 22:3</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/18-5.htm">2 Samuel 18:5</a>).<p>&#8226; This approach mirrors Christ, who &#8220;did not come to be served, but to serve&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Go back and stay with the new king&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; David acknowledges Absalom&#8217;s present advantage (<a href="/2_samuel/15-10.htm">2 Samuel 15:10</a>), yet never concedes God&#8217;s promise.<p>&#8226; Offering Ittai a safe return reflects David&#8217;s confidence that the throne ultimately rests in God&#8217;s hands (<a href="/2_samuel/15-25.htm">2 Samuel 15:25-26</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5-7</a>).<p>&#8226; The suggestion also frees Ittai to act from conviction, not compulsion&#8212;a pattern later echoed by Paul with Onesimus (<a href="/bsb/philemon/1.htm">Philemon 14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;You are both a foreigner and an exile from your homeland.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; David empathizes; he too had lived as an exile among the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/29-6.htm">1 Samuel 29:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently commands kindness to the sojourner (<a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-19.htm">Deuteronomy 10:19</a>). David practices what the Law preaches.<p>&#8226; Ittai&#8217;s forthcoming choice (<a href="/2_samuel/15-21.htm">2 Samuel 15:21</a>) will parallel Ruth&#8217;s pledge: &#8220;Where you go I will go&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16-17</a>). Such Gentile loyalty prefigures the gathering of all nations to David&#8217;s greater Son (<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12-13</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David&#8217;s brief exchange with Ittai highlights a king who protects rather than coerces, trusts God rather than circumstances, and honors outsiders within the covenant community. The verse showcases the Lord&#8217;s heart for the foreigner and signals the widening circle of grace that culminates in Christ&#8217;s global kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Ittai the Gittite.</span>--The patronymic must here be understood literally, since David calls him "a stranger and also an exile;" he had but comparatively recently (<a href="/2_samuel/15-20.htm" title="Whereas you came but yesterday, should I this day make you go up and down with us? seeing I go where I may, return you, and take back your brothers: mercy and truth be with you.">2Samuel 15:20</a>) attached himself to David's service, bringing with him his family and others of his countrymen. From the fact that David afterwards entrusted him with the command of a third of his forces, it is clear that he must have been an experienced general. It cannot be shown positively that he was a proselyte, although this is probable.<p>In the latter part of this verse the English has unnecessarily changed the order of the words. Read, "Return and abide with the king, for thou art a stranger and an exile at thy place," viz., at Jerusalem. David neither means to recognise Absalom as king, nor yet to speak of him ironically; he only means to tell Ittai that, as a foreigner, he need not concern himself in such a question, but is quite justified in serving the king <span class= "ital">de facto, </span>whoever he may be. Ittai's answer may be compared with Ruth's (<a href="/context/ruth/1-16.htm" title="And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave you, or to return from following after you: for where you go, I will go; and where you lodge, I will lodge: your people shall be my people, and your God my God:">Ruth 1:16-17</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ittai the Gittite.</span> Ittai was not one of the six hundred, though there was an Ittai among them, a Benjamite. He was a citizen of Gath, who had lately come ("yesterday," see ver. 20), with all his household of slaves and dependents, his clan, Hebrew, his <span class="accented">taf</span> - translated in ver. 22 his "little ones." He had evidently been a person of importance in his own country, whence he had been driven, perhaps by political troubles, and was now, therefore, an exile and a foreigner (Authorized Version, "stranger") at Jerusalem. As David made him joint commander of his army with Joab and Abishai (<a href="/2_samuel/18-2.htm">2 Samuel 18:2</a>), he must also have been a general of recognized military skill. As he was thus not personally interested in the government of Israel, and, in fact, had only lately come thither, David recommends him to <span class="cmt_word">return... and abide with the king,</span> that is, with the <span class="accented">de facto</span> king, Absalom. But so great was the fascination which David exercised upon those around him, that this foreigner boldly threw in his lot with him, and accompanied him in his flight. Return to thy place. This is a very daring transposition, as the Hebrew is, <span class="accented">Return and abide with the king</span>; <span class="accented">for thou art a foreigner, and also an exile art thou to thy place.</span> The Revised Version gives the same sense as the Authorized, though it shows more respect to the grammar. But the Septuagint, Syriac, and Vulgate, by "his own place" understand Gath, either taking the words as meaning "an exile as to thy own place," or having a different reading. The Hebrew then proceeds, <span class="accented">Yesterday was thy coming, and shall</span> 1 <span class="accented">today make thee wander to go with us, seeing I go whither I go?</span> that is, I go I know not whither. <span class="accented">Return thou, and take back thy brethren - in mercy and truth.</span> This gives a very good sense, but the Septuagint and Vulgate have a different reading: "Take back thy brethren with thee, and the Lord chew thee mercy and truth."
