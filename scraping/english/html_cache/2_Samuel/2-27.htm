It reflects the seriousness and solemnity of Joab's words. The use of such an oath is common in the Old Testament, emphasizing the speaker's sincerity and the gravity of the situation. It underscores the belief in God's active presence and sovereignty, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/12-16.htm">Jeremiah 12:16</a>.<p><b>Joab replied,</b><br>Joab, the commander of David's army, is a central figure in the narrative of 2 Samuel. His role as a military leader is significant, and his actions often reflect the political and military tensions of the time. Joab's interactions with Abner, the commander of Saul's army, highlight the complex dynamics between the house of David and the remnants of Saul's kingdom. Joab's character is multifaceted, showing both loyalty and ruthlessness, which are explored in various parts of 2 Samuel.<p><b>if you had not spoken up,</b><br>This phrase refers to Abner's earlier plea to Joab to cease the pursuit and bloodshed between the two factions. Abner's intervention is crucial in preventing further conflict, illustrating the power of words to influence and change the course of events. The importance of wise counsel and timely intervention is a recurring theme in biblical narratives, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/15.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>, which speaks to the power of a gentle answer to turn away wrath.<p><b>the troops would have continued pursuing their brothers</b><br>The term "brothers" emphasizes the familial and national ties between the combatants, as both groups are Israelites. This internal conflict is a tragic aspect of Israel's history, reflecting the division and strife that can occur within God's chosen people. The pursuit of "brothers" highlights the civil war-like nature of the conflict, reminiscent of other biblical instances where internal strife threatened the unity of God's people, such as the division of the kingdom in <a href="/1_kings/12.htm">1 Kings 12</a>.<p><b>until morning.</b><br>This indicates the relentless nature of the pursuit and the potential for prolonged violence. The mention of "morning" suggests a continuation of hostilities that could have resulted in greater loss of life. The cessation of conflict before morning signifies a turning point, where restraint and peace are chosen over continued bloodshed. This moment of potential reconciliation foreshadows the eventual unification of Israel under David's rule, aligning with God's promise to establish David's kingdom, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of David's army, known for his military prowess and loyalty to David.

And Joab said, Let them arise.">2Samuel 2:14</a>) there would have been no battle, but "the people" of both sides would have separated peaceably at Gibeon; or (2), as the phrase is more generally and more probably under. stood, that Joab had intended to keep up the pursuit only until the following morning, but as Abner already sued for mercy, he was content, and would stop now.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up;</span> or as the Revised Version renders, <span class="accented">had gone away, nor followed every man his brother.</span> The Revised Version makes the sense more plain. Joab throws the whole blame, and rightly so, on Abner. David would under no circumstances have attacked Ishbosheth, and Joab with his men had marched to the tank of Gibeon simply to repel an invading force. When there, Joab, doubtless by David's orders, had remained strictly on the defensive, and so unwilling were both armies to fight, that Abner had to resort to a most cruel scene of butchery in order to inflame their passions and force them to begin a conflict of brother against brother. But for Abner's challenge, both armies would have separated as friends. And Joab still acts upon the same principle of forbearance, and gives the signal for stopping the pursuit. He was not a man of a tender heart, but he was wise and sensible, and fully aware that the slaughter of Abner and his men, even if he could have destroyed them all, would only have rankled in the minds of all Israel, and set them against David and his rule. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/2-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;As surely as God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
