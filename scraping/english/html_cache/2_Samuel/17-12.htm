Ahithophel was known for his wisdom and his advice was highly regarded, often seen as if one had inquired of the word of God. The plan to attack David "wherever we find him" indicates a relentless pursuit, showing the urgency and determination to eliminate David as a threat. This reflects the intense political and familial conflict within Israel at the time. The pursuit of David can be compared to Saul's earlier pursuit of him, highlighting the recurring theme of David as a fugitive and the trials he faced before and during his kingship.<p><b>and we will descend on him like dew on the ground</b><br>The imagery of descending "like dew on the ground" suggests a sudden and overwhelming attack. Dew covers the ground completely and uniformly, symbolizing the thoroughness and inevitability of the planned assault. This metaphor also implies a silent and stealthy approach, as dew forms quietly overnight. In biblical literature, dew is often associated with blessing and provision (e.g., <a href="/hosea/14-5.htm">Hosea 14:5</a>), but here it is used to convey the idea of an inescapable and encompassing threat. This phrase underscores the severity of the danger David faced and the comprehensive nature of the attack planned against him.<p><b>And of all the men with him, not even one will remain</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the totality of the intended destruction. The goal was not only to kill David but to annihilate all his supporters, leaving "not even one" alive. This reflects the brutal nature of ancient Near Eastern warfare, where complete eradication of the enemy was often sought to prevent any future retaliation. The phrase also emphasizes the loyalty and risk faced by those who stood with David, as they were targets of the same deadly intent. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate victory of God's anointed, as despite the plans of his enemies, David's line would continue, leading to the eventual coming of Jesus Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise to David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The son of King David who rebelled against his father, seeking to usurp the throne of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahithophel.htm">Ahithophel</a></b><br>A counselor to Absalom, known for his wise advice, who proposed the plan to attack David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who was fleeing from Absalom's rebellion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hushai.htm">Hushai</a></b><br>A friend of David who infiltrated Absalom's court to counter Ahithophel's counsel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The general area where David and his men were hiding during Absalom's rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_human_schemes.htm">The Futility of Human Schemes</a></b><br>Despite Ahithophel's seemingly wise counsel, God's sovereignty prevails.

Ahithophel, once David&#8217;s trusted counselor, outlines a ruthless strategy that builds on earlier betrayals (<a href="/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a>; 16:23). Knowing this backdrop helps us read <a href="/2_samuel/17-12.htm">2 Samuel 17:12</a> with heightened clarity: the aim is swift, total elimination of God&#8217;s anointed king.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Then we will attack David wherever we find him&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Ahithophel proposes a search-and-destroy mission with no safe zones, no sanctuary, echoing Saul&#8217;s former pursuit of David in <a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14-15</a>.<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores deliberate intent; it is not a defensive posture but an aggressive hunt (<a href="/psalms/10-8.htm">Psalm 10:8-11</a> shows wicked men plotting in similar fashion).<p>&#8226; Scripture&#8217;s literal report reminds us God&#8217;s covenant king is under mortal threat, yet also under divine protection (<a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Even when enemies seem to control the timetable, God&#8217;s sovereignty frames every movement (<a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and we will descend on him like dew on the ground&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Dew arrives silently and covers everything&#8212;imagery that signals a surprise assault from every direction (<a href="/judges/6-37.htm">Judges 6:37-38</a> highlights dew&#8217;s pervasive reach).<p>&#8226; The simile stresses speed and inevitability: once dew settles, you can&#8217;t escape its touch. Likewise, Ahithophel envisions no escape route for David.<p>&#8226; Other texts speak of sudden calamity falling on the wicked (<a href="/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18-19</a>) but here the wicked imagine themselves wielding that calamity.<p>&#8226; God later overturns this counsel through Hushai (<a href="/2_samuel/17-14.htm">2 Samuel 17:14</a>), proving again that &#8220;The LORD nullifies the counsel of the nations&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;And of all the men with him, not even one will remain&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The goal is extermination&#8212;no survivors, no future claimants, total erasure (compare Pharaoh&#8217;s command in <a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a> and Herod&#8217;s in <a href="/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Such ruthless resolve shows the depth of rebellion against God&#8217;s chosen ruler (<a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet David&#8217;s earlier experience with Saul teaches us that human vows of destruction cannot override divine promises (<a href="/1_samuel/26-23.htm">1 Samuel 26:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; In God&#8217;s providence, the very army sworn to wipe David out soon scatters in confusion (<a href="/2_samuel/18-6.htm">2 Samuel 18:6-8</a>), illustrating <a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>&#8212;&#8220;Many plans are in a man&#8217;s heart, but the purpose of the LORD will prevail.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/17-12.htm">2 Samuel 17:12</a> records Ahithophel&#8217;s bold three-part plan: locate David, strike with swift saturation, and leave no survivors.
