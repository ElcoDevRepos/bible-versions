Her use of "No" signifies a strong objection, reflecting her understanding of the moral and legal implications of Amnon's actions. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, a woman's voice in such matters was often suppressed, making Tamar's protest significant.<p><b>&#8220;sending me away is worse than this great wrong you have already done to me!&#8221;</b><br>Tamar highlights the compounded injustice of being cast out after the assault. In the historical context, a woman's honor and future prospects were closely tied to her virginity and marital status. By sending her away, Amnon not only violated her but also condemned her to a life of shame and isolation. This reflects the severe social consequences for women in ancient times, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/22-28.htm">Deuteronomy 22:28-29</a>, where a man who violated a virgin was required to marry her, ensuring her protection and provision.<p><b>But he refused to listen to her.</b><br>Amnon's refusal to heed Tamar's plea underscores his callousness and disregard for her dignity and well-being. This phrase highlights the theme of hardened hearts and the consequences of sin, reminiscent of Pharaoh's refusal to listen to Moses in Exodus. It also foreshadows the familial strife and divine judgment that would follow, as seen in the subsequent chapters of 2 Samuel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tamar.htm">Tamar</a></b><br>The daughter of King David, who is wronged by her half-brother Amnon.

Amnon was now doing her a greater wrong than at first, because he was now bound, in consequence of that, to protect and comfort her.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - There is <span class="cmt_word">no cause</span>. This is certainly not a possible translation of the Hebrew, which is probably corrupt; and though Tamar's words may have been broken and hysterical, we cannot suppose that the narrator intended to represent her sobs. The text is rendered by Philippsohn, "And she said to him respecting the evil deed, Greater is this than the other." Similarly Cahen renders it, "au sujet de ce mal." Flat as this is, no better rendering is possible; but the Vatican copy of the Septuagint has a reading which suggests the line of probable emendation: "Nay, my brother, this evil is greater than the other." It was greater because it east the reproach upon her, refused her the solace of his affection, and made her feel that she had been humbled, not because he loved her, but for mere phantasy. He has had his will, and, careless of her sorrow, he scuds her contemptuously away, indifferent to the wrong he has done her, and piqued and mortified at her indignant resistance. However much we may disapprove of Absalom's conduct, Amnon richly deserved his punishment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/13-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;No,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_408.htm">Strong's 408: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">she replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
