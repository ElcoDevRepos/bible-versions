Hebron, located in the Judean hills, was a city of refuge and a significant historical site, being associated with the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The birth of sons to David in Hebron signifies the establishment of his royal lineage and the fulfillment of God's promise to David regarding his descendants (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>His firstborn was Amnon:</b><br>Amnon, as the firstborn son, held a position of prominence and potential succession to the throne. However, his life was marked by tragedy and sin, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/13.htm">2 Samuel 13</a>, where he committed a grievous act against his half-sister Tamar. This event set off a chain of violence and retribution within David's family, highlighting the complexities and challenges of David's household.<p><b>by Ahinoam of Jezreel:</b><br>Ahinoam of Jezreel was one of David's wives, and her mention here indicates the political alliances and marriages that were common in the ancient Near Eastern context.

By recording these births, the writer underscores God&#8217;s fulfillment of His promise to &#8220;make you a great name&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>; <a href="/genesis/17-6.htm">Genesis 17:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Listing the sons also anchors the unfolding narrative: each name will later influence Israel&#8217;s history, for good or ill (cf. <a href="/bsb/2_samuel/13.htm">2 Samuel 13&#8211;18</a>; <a href="/bsb/1_kings/1.htm">1 Kings 1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; Hebron itself is rich in covenant history&#8212;Abraham settled there (<a href="/genesis/13-18.htm">Genesis 13:18</a>), and it became a city of refuge (<a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7</a>). David&#8217;s fruitful family life in that city links him to the faith lineage already established.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His firstborn was Amnon</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Firstborn&#8221; carries weight: the eldest son normally held preeminence and a double portion (<a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming Amnon first, the text foreshadows tension over succession rights, a theme that threads through 2 Samuel (13:1; 15:10; <a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Amnon&#8217;s later sin against Tamar (<a href="/2_samuel/13-14.htm">2 Samuel 13:14</a>) will fracture the household, fulfilling Nathan&#8217;s warning that &#8220;the sword will never depart from your house&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention here, then, is not merely genealogical; it prepares readers to see how unchecked desires in the king&#8217;s children mirror the nation&#8217;s own struggles.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by Ahinoam of Jezreel</b><p>&#8226; Ahinoam is introduced earlier among David&#8217;s wives (<a href="/1_samuel/25-43.htm">1 Samuel 25:43</a>). By specifying &#8220;of Jezreel,&#8221; Scripture distinguishes her from Saul&#8217;s wife of the same name (<a href="/1_samuel/14-50.htm">1 Samuel 14:50</a>).<p>&#8226; Jezreel (in Judah, not the northern valley) reminds us of David&#8217;s wanderings while fleeing Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/27-3.htm">1 Samuel 27:3</a>). God turned those trials into relationships that expanded David&#8217;s household.<p>&#8226; The verse quietly exposes the complexity of David&#8217;s polygamy. While the law tolerated multiple wives, it warned kings not to &#8220;multiply wives&#8221; lest their hearts turn away (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>). The later turmoil among these sons confirms that warning.<p>&#8226; Yet even through imperfect family structures, the LORD advances His redemptive plan, ultimately bringing forth Messiah through David&#8217;s line (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2</a> records more than a birth notice. It celebrates the LORD&#8217;s covenant faithfulness to David in Hebron, introduces the firstborn who will shape the narrative&#8217;s future conflict, and highlights the mother whose presence ties back to David&#8217;s earlier journeys. The verse invites readers to trace God&#8217;s hand in every family detail&#8212;blessing, warning, and ultimately guiding history toward His promised King.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2-5) <span class= "bld">And unto David.</span>--The list of David's sons born during his seven and a half years' reign in Hebron rather interrupts the continuity of the narrative, but is quite in accordance with the habit of the sacred historians to insert at the beginning or at some turning point in each reign statistics about the house or family of the king. (See <a href="/context/1_samuel/14-49.htm" title="Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:">1Samuel 14:49-51</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/5-13.htm" title="And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.">2Samuel 5:13</a>; <a href="/1_kings/3-1.htm" title="And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.">1Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-21.htm" title="And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there.

For though contrary to the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>), it was yet looked upon as part of the state of a king, and as such had been practised by Gideon (<a href="/judges/8-30.htm">Judges 8:30</a>), who approached more nearly to the royal dignity than any other of the judges. But it is the rule of the Books of Samuel that they generally abstain alike from praise and 'blame, and allow facts to speak for themselves. But never did a history more clearly deserve the title of 'A Vindication of the Justice of God.' Alike in Eli, in Saul, and in David, their sufferings were the result of their sins, and to the polygamy and lust of the last are due both the crimes which stained his character and the distress of the last twenty years of his life.
