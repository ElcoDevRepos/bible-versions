His decision to send for a wise woman from Tekoa reflects his strategic thinking and understanding of human nature. Tekoa was a town located about 10 miles south of Jerusalem, known for its wisdom and possibly its prophetic tradition, as the prophet Amos also hailed from there (<a href="/amos/1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>). The term "wise woman" suggests someone with insight, discernment, and possibly experience in matters of justice or mediation, which were highly valued in ancient Israelite society. This action by Joab indicates his intention to use wisdom and cunning to influence King David's decision regarding Absalom, David's estranged son.<p><b>He told her, &#8220;Please pretend to be a mourner;</b><br>Joab instructs the woman to take on the role of a mourner, which in ancient Israelite culture involved specific behaviors and appearances. Mourning was a significant cultural practice, often involving public displays of grief, such as wearing sackcloth, putting ashes on one's head, and wailing. By asking her to pretend, Joab is orchestrating a scenario to evoke a particular emotional response from David, highlighting Joab's understanding of the king's compassionate nature. This act of pretending also foreshadows the parables and stories used by prophets like Nathan (<a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-7</a>) to convey deeper truths or prompt self-reflection.<p><b>put on clothes for mourning and do not anoint yourself with oil.</b><br>The instruction to wear mourning clothes and refrain from anointing with oil is significant. Mourning clothes were typically rough garments, such as sackcloth, symbolizing distress and humility. Anointing with oil was a common practice for personal grooming and refreshment, often associated with joy and celebration (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, <a href="/ecclesiastes/9-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:8</a>). By avoiding oil, the woman would present herself as someone in deep, prolonged grief, enhancing the authenticity of her role. This detail underscores the cultural importance of external appearances in conveying one's internal state and the lengths to which Joab is willing to go to achieve his aims.<p><b>Act like a woman who has mourned for the dead a long time.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the depth and duration of the mourning the woman is to portray. In the ancient Near East, prolonged mourning was not uncommon, especially for significant losses. The portrayal of extended grief would likely elicit sympathy and attention, making the woman's story more compelling to David. This tactic of using a prolonged mourning scenario is reminiscent of other biblical narratives where individuals use storytelling or role-playing to reveal truths or influence decisions, such as the prophet Nathan's confrontation with David over his sin with Bathsheba. The use of a wise woman in this context also subtly points to the role of women in biblical narratives as conveyors of wisdom and truth, often in unexpected ways.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of King David's army, known for his strategic mind and sometimes ruthless actions.

Hearing a story of lingering loss would mirror his own feelings and soften him toward reconciliation.<p>&#8226; Prolonged mourning also evokes national laments such as those for Saul and Jonathan (<a href="/2_samuel/1-17.htm">2 Samuel 1:17-27</a>) or for Josiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-25.htm">2 Chronicles 35:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/14-2.htm">2 Samuel 14:2</a> shows Joab orchestrating a carefully scripted encounter. By sending for a rhetorically gifted woman from Tekoa and instructing her to embody deep, prolonged grief&#8212;in dress, demeanor, and even personal hygiene&#8212;Joab sets the stage for a living parable designed to reach King David&#8217;s heart. The verse highlights the power of story, the cultural language of mourning, and Joab&#8217;s shrewd determination to bring Absalom home, all within the sovereign narrative God is weaving through Israel&#8217;s history.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Tekoah.</span>--A village on a high hill five miles south of Bethlehem, the home of the prophet Amos. It was also the native place of Ira, one of David's thirty heroes (<a href="/2_samuel/23-26.htm" title="Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,">2Samuel 23:26</a>), and was near enough to Bethlehem, the home of Joab, for him to have had personal knowledge of this "wise woman." There is no ground whatever for suspecting her of being a "witch," or in any way disreputable.<p>The parable that follows was contrived by Joab, yet also required skill and address on the part of the woman. It is purposely made not too closely parallel to the case of Absalom, lest it should defeat its own object. In general it needs no comment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tekoah</span>. This town, famous as the birthplace of the Prophet Amos, lay upon the borders of the great wilderness southeast of Jerusalem. As it was only five miles to the south of Bethlehem, Joab's birthplace, he had probably often heard tales of this woman's intelligence; and, though he contrived the parable himself, yet it would need tact and adroitness on the woman's part to give the tale with tragic effect, and answer the king's questions with all the signs of genuine emotion. If her acting was bad, the king would see through the plot, and only by great skill would his heart be so moved as to three him to some such expression of feeling as would serve Joab's purpose. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/14-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Joab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3097.htm">Strong's 3097: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joab -- 'the LORD is father', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1444;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
