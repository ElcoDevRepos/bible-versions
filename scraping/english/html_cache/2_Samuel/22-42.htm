In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a>, David is singing a song of deliverance, recounting how God saved him from his foes. The enemies' search for salvation highlights their realization of defeat and the futility of relying on their own strength or false gods. This mirrors the broader biblical theme that salvation comes only from the Lord (<a href="/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>). Historically, this could refer to the numerous battles David fought, where his adversaries often found themselves without hope or rescue. Theologically, it underscores the idea that without God, there is no true deliverance.<p><b>to the LORD, but He did not answer.</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the sovereignty of God in choosing when and whom to save. The enemies' appeal to the LORD, despite their previous opposition to Him, shows a recognition of His ultimate power. However, their cries go unanswered, illustrating that God&#8217;s favor and salvation are not automatic but are granted according to His will and purpose. This can be connected to <a href="/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28</a>, where wisdom warns that those who reject God will call upon Him in vain. It also serves as a type of Christ, who, in His earthly ministry, demonstrated that not all who call upon Him will be saved without true repentance and faith (<a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>).

The phrase &#8220;They looked&#8221; pictures a frantic search for help once their own strength had failed.<p>- Throughout Scripture, &#8220;looking&#8221; often means seeking deliverance or refuge (<a href="/psalms/34-5.htm">Psalm 34:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1&#8211;2</a>). Here, however, the looking is too late and in the wrong direction&#8212;these foes have spent their lives opposing the LORD&#8217;s anointed, and now their eyes dart about in panic.<p>- The scene underlines a hard truth: when people reject God&#8217;s ways, the moment will come when every earthly source of rescue falls silent (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but there was no one to save them</b><p>- No army, idol, ally, or clever plan could step in. The silence of human saviors exposes the emptiness of all substitutes for God (<a href="/judges/10-13.htm">Judges 10:13&#8211;14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36&#8211;39</a>).<p>- Bullet points to notice:<p>&#8226; The enemies trusted in weapons and numbers; David trusted in the LORD (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; God allows the collapse of false confidences so His justice is seen (<a href="/psalms/9-15.htm">Psalm 9:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>- For believers, the line is a sober reminder that every refuge apart from Christ eventually fails (<a href="/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the LORD</b><p>- In desperation, they finally cry &#8220;to the LORD.&#8221; Ironically, the very God they opposed is now their last resort.<p>- Scripture records similar moments when hardened hearts make a token appeal to God only when disaster looms (<a href="/exodus/10-16.htm">Exodus 10:16&#8211;17</a>; <a href="/jonah/1-14.htm">Jonah 1:14</a>).<p>- Yet genuine repentance is absent. Their plea is driven by fear, not faith. <a href="/isaiah/59-1.htm">Isaiah 59:1&#8211;2</a> explains that unconfessed sin erects a barrier God will not ignore.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but He did not answer</b><p>- God&#8217;s silence is an act of righteous judgment. <a href="/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28</a> echoes the same outcome: &#8220;Then they will call me, but I will not answer.&#8221;<p>- Other examples underline that persistent rebellion invites divine silence (<a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>; <a href="/micah/3-4.htm">Micah 3:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/66-18.htm">Psalm 66:18</a>).<p>- For David, the unanswered cry of his enemies magnifies the answered cries he himself experienced earlier in the song (<a href="/2_samuel/22-7.htm">2 Samuel 22:7</a>). The contrast showcases God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness toward those who trust Him and His justice toward those who oppose Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/22-42.htm">2 Samuel 22:42</a> portrays the turning point where David&#8217;s enemies, once confident in themselves, discover every source of help gone. They glance around, then finally up, but God&#8212;whom they have scorned&#8212;remains silent. The verse underscores two truths: no substitute savior can deliver in the day of judgment, and the LORD gladly hears those who trust Him yet justly withholds aid from the unrepentant.
