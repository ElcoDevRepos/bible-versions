It was a staple in the diet and used as a sweetener. In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/17-29.htm">2 Samuel 17:29</a>, honey represents the generosity and care provided to David and his men during a time of need. This provision can be seen as a reflection of God's providence and care for His people, similar to how He provided manna in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-31.htm">Exodus 16:31</a>).<p><b>curds</b><br>Curds, or thickened milk, were a common food in the ancient Near East, providing essential nutrients and energy. They were often consumed with bread and were a sign of hospitality and sustenance. The offering of curds to David and his men highlights the practical support given to them, ensuring they had the strength to continue their journey. This act of kindness can be compared to the hospitality shown by Abraham to the three visitors in <a href="/genesis/18-8.htm">Genesis 18:8</a>.<p><b>sheep</b><br>Sheep were a vital part of the agrarian economy in ancient Israel, providing meat, wool, and milk. The gift of sheep to David and his people signifies a substantial and sacrificial offering, as livestock were valuable assets. This gesture underscores the loyalty and support of David's allies during his flight from Absalom. Sheep are also significant in biblical typology, often representing sacrifice and pointing to Jesus Christ as the Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>and cheese from the herd</b><br>Cheese, made from the milk of sheep or goats, was another important food item, offering sustenance and nourishment. The mention of cheese from the herd indicates a well-prepared and thoughtful provision for David and his men. This reflects the care and concern of those who supported David, ensuring that he and his followers were well-fed and able to endure their hardships. The provision of cheese can be seen as an act of kindness and solidarity, reminiscent of the communal support found in the early church (<a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>).<p><b>for David and his people to eat</b><br>The provision of food for David and his people highlights the importance of community and support during times of crisis. David, as the anointed king, was in a vulnerable position, and the sustenance provided by his supporters was crucial for his survival and the morale of his followers. This act of provision can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to care for His anointed and a foreshadowing of the ultimate provision found in Christ, who feeds His people spiritually (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>For they said, &#8220;The people have become hungry, exhausted, and thirsty in the wilderness.&#8221;</b><br>This statement acknowledges the dire condition of David and his men, who were fleeing from Absalom and facing the harsh realities of the wilderness. The wilderness is often a place of testing and reliance on God's provision, as seen in the Israelites' journey in the desert (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2-3</a>). The physical needs of hunger, exhaustion, and thirst emphasize the human vulnerability and dependence on God's provision, which is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus, who offers rest and living water (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28</a>, <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who is fleeing from his son Absalom during a time of rebellion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, who has usurped the throne and is pursuing David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The harsh environment where David and his followers find themselves, symbolizing trials and testing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/supporters_of_david.htm">Supporters of David</a></b><br>Individuals who provide sustenance to David and his men, demonstrating loyalty and compassion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>Refers to David's followers who are enduring hardship alongside him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_in_times_of_need.htm">God's Provision in Times of Need</a></b><br>Just as God provided for David and his men through the generosity of others, He continues to provide for His people today.

Honey was the energy-rich food that travelers in Scripture often relied on (<a href="/judges/14-8.htm">Judges 14:8-9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-27.htm">1 Samuel 14:27</a>). In the middle of flight from Absalom, David and his men needed quick, natural fuel. God had once &#8220;brought them to a land flowing with milk and honey&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>), and now, in a dark hour, He let that sweetness touch them again. The honey on the table quietly said, &#8220;The covenant God who sweetened your past has not forgotten you in the present.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Curds</b><p>Curds&#8212;thick, nutritious dairy&#8212;signaled settled abundance (<a href="/genesis/18-8.htm">Genesis 18:8</a>). Isaiah foretold that Immanuel would &#8220;eat curds and honey&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15</a>), a picture of everyday provision even during national crisis. In Mahanaim, the curds reminded David that the Lord supplies substance, not scraps. They also soothed weary bodies: calcium, protein, and fat for soldiers who had marched hard and slept rough (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-27.htm">2 Corinthians 11:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Sheep</b><p>Next came &#8220;sheep,&#8221; living meat on the hoof. Sheep had accompanied Israel since the Passover night (<a href="/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3-8</a>); now they appear again to sustain the king who once shepherded them. Barzillai and his friends provided more than enough, echoing Abigail&#8217;s feast for David&#8217;s men years earlier (<a href="/1_samuel/25-18.htm">1 Samuel 25:18</a>). The gift underlined God&#8217;s ongoing pledge: &#8220;The LORD is my shepherd; I lack nothing&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Cheese from the herd</b><p>&#8220;Cheese from the herd&#8221; points to preserved nourishment that would last beyond one meal. Job compared his own formation to curdled cheese (<a href="/job/10-10.htm">Job 10:10</a>), showing that cheese was familiar in ancient diets. For David&#8217;s band, this portable protein allowed them to keep moving without starving. It was God&#8217;s way of stocking their pantry while they were still on the run, just as He had turned quail and manna into wilderness rations for earlier generations (<a href="/exodus/16-13.htm">Exodus 16:13-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For David and his people to eat</b><p>The verse stresses purpose: the food was &#8220;for David and his people.&#8221; God&#8217;s care was personal and communal. He was feeding a king and his followers, mirroring how He later fed Elijah with angel-baked bread (<a href="/1_kings/19-5.htm">1 Kings 19:5-8</a>) and how Christ fed five thousand with multiplied loaves (<a href="/matthew/14-19.htm">Matthew 14:19-20</a>). No one in the righteous remnant was overlooked.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For they said</b><p>The suppliers did more than notice need; they voiced it and acted. Their compassion recalls the Good Samaritan, who &#8220;saw him and had compassion&#8221; (<a href="/luke/10-33.htm">Luke 10:33</a>). True love is practical; it speaks and spends to meet a brother&#8217;s lack (<a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The people have become hungry</b><p>Hunger weakens resolve. Israel had groaned in the desert, &#8220;Why did you bring us out to this wilderness to die of hunger?&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/16-3.htm">Exodus 16:3</a>). By providing hearty food, these friends fought despair with tangible hope. Jesus later declared, &#8220;I am the bread of life; whoever comes to Me will never hunger&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>); this scene foreshadows that sustaining grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Exhausted</b><p>Weariness of body and soul can erode courage. Yet Scripture promises, &#8220;He gives power to the faint&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-29.htm">Isaiah 40:29-31</a>). The simple act of serving a meal became God&#8217;s channel to renew David&#8217;s strength so he could keep trusting and leading.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And thirsty in the wilderness</b><p>Thirst in Scripture often pictures deep spiritual need (<a href="/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>). God had opened a rock for Moses (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>) and would later offer &#8220;living water&#8221; through Christ (<a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>). Fresh cheese and curds contained moisture; honey provided quick sugars; sheep could be boiled into broth&#8212;together answering parched throats. Even in a physical wilderness, the Lord again proved Himself &#8220;a spring of water whose waters do not fail&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/58-11.htm">Isaiah 58:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every item in <a href="/2_samuel/17-29.htm">2 Samuel 17:29</a> showcases God&#8217;s timely, literal provision. Honey supplied quick strength, curds deep nourishment, sheep sustaining protein, and cheese lasting reserves&#8212;all expressly for David and his weary followers. Loving friends recognized hunger, exhaustion, and thirst, and God used their generosity to refresh His people. The verse invites us to trust the same faithful Provider who meets practical needs while advancing His redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Cheese of kine.</span>--A word occurring only here, and of uncertain meaning.

The Bedaween, after removing the butter, make a kind of cheese from the remaining milk. It is as hard as the cheese made from skimmed milk in Dorsetshire, but wholesome. It must, however, be soaked before eating, or softened with butter. Generally in the East, cow's milk is regarded as coarse, and camel's milk is used for drinking, while that of sheep and goats, and cheese made from it, holds the next place in general estimation. It is curious that "butter" literally means "cheese of kine." <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/17-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">honey,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#7687;a&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
