Hamath was an important city in the ancient Near East, known for its strategic location along trade routes. The mention of Toi indicates the far-reaching impact of David's military campaigns, as news of his victories spread beyond Israel's immediate neighbors. This reflects the growing influence and reputation of David's kingdom. The political landscape of the time was characterized by shifting alliances and power struggles, and Toi's response to David's victory suggests a diplomatic approach to the rising power of Israel.<p><b>that David had defeated</b><br>David's military prowess is a central theme in the narrative of his reign. His victories are often attributed to divine favor and are seen as a fulfillment of God's promises to establish David's kingdom. The defeat of enemies is a recurring motif in the biblical text, symbolizing the triumph of God's chosen leader over opposition. David's success in battle is not only a testament to his leadership but also serves as a demonstration of God's support for Israel. This victory over Hadadezer is part of a series of conquests that expand Israel's territory and secure its borders.<p><b>the entire army of Hadadezer</b><br>Hadadezer was a powerful king of Zobah, a region north of Israel. His army represented a significant threat to Israel's security. The complete defeat of Hadadezer's forces underscores the effectiveness of David's military strategy and the strength of his army. This victory is significant in the broader context of David's efforts to establish Israel as a dominant power in the region. The defeat of Hadadezer also has theological implications, as it is seen as a manifestation of God's promise to give David victory over his enemies. This event is part of the larger narrative of God's covenant with David, which includes the promise of a lasting dynasty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_toi_of_hamath.htm">King Toi of Hamath</a></b><br>A ruler of the city-state of Hamath, located in what is now modern-day Syria.

Its interest in the present day lies in its having been the capital of the Hittites - a race whose very existence was doubted a few years ago, in spite of the testimony of Holy Scripture; but whose marvellous empire has been lately proved to be historical by Egyptian records on the one side, and cuneiform inscriptions on the other. Unfortunately, inscriptions which they have themselves left behind have not yet found any one capable of deciphering them. In the <span class="date">twelfth century B.C.</span> they were the paramount power from the Euphrates to the Lebanon. For many centuries they contended with the Pharaohs for the possession of Egypt, and while Rameses II. had to make an inglorious peace with the Kheta, as they are called, and marry the king's daughter, Rameses III won a great victory over them, and saved Egypt from thraldom. In the cuneiform inscriptions we find the record of a struggle between Assyria and the Hittites, lasting for four hundred years, during which Shalmaneser made thirty campaigns against them, but they were not finally conquered until <span class="date">B.C. 717</span>, during the reign of Sargon. Fuller details will be found in Dr. Wright's 'Empire of the Hittites,' published by Messrs.
