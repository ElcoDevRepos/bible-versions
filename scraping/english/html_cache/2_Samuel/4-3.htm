This treaty was made under false pretenses, as the Gibeonites deceived Israel into believing they were from a distant land. Despite the deception, the Israelites honored the treaty, and the Gibeonites, including the Beerothites, were spared. The flight to Gittaim suggests a time of instability or threat, possibly related to the political turmoil during the reign of King Saul and the subsequent power struggles. Gittaim is mentioned in <a href="/nehemiah/11-33.htm">Nehemiah 11:33</a> as a place where the Benjamites resettled, indicating it was a known location for refuge. The movement of the Beerothites reflects the broader theme of displacement and seeking refuge, which is a recurring motif in the biblical narrative.<p><b>and have lived there as foreigners to this day.</b><br>The phrase "to this day" indicates that the Beerothites remained in Gittaim for an extended period, suggesting a long-term displacement. Living as foreigners implies a lack of full integration or acceptance in their new location, which resonates with the experiences of many groups in the biblical narrative, such as the Israelites in Egypt. This status as foreigners can also be seen as a metaphor for the Christian experience of living in the world but not being of it (<a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14-16</a>). The enduring presence of the Beerothites in Gittaim highlights the lasting impact of historical events and decisions, such as the treaty with the Gibeonites, on the lives of individuals and communities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/beerothites.htm">Beerothites</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Beeroth, one of the cities of the Gibeonites, who were originally Hivites.

(<a href="/2_samuel/4-2.htm">2 Samuel 4:2-3</a>)<p>&#8226; The author pauses the narrative about Ish-bosheth&#8217;s fragile reign to explain why Rechab and Baanah are called &#8220;Beerothites.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By noting their displacement, the writer underscores the unsettled condition of Saul&#8217;s tribe after his downfall&#8212;an important backdrop for David&#8217;s eventual consolidation of the kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-5</a>).<p>Cross references woven in: <a href="/joshua/18-25.htm">Joshua 18:25</a> shows Beeroth allotted to Benjamin;

The note grounds the narrative in real history, illustrates the fallout of Saul&#8217;s sins, and highlights God&#8217;s ongoing concern for displaced people.
