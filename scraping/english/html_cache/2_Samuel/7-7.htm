It emphasizes God's faithfulness and guidance, as seen in Exodus and Numbers, where God led the Israelites with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. This divine accompaniment underscores the covenant relationship between God and His people, highlighting His role as their protector and guide.<p><b>have I ever asked any of the leaders I appointed to shepherd My people Israel</b><br>Here, God refers to the leaders He appointed, such as Moses, Joshua, and the judges, who were tasked with guiding and governing Israel. The term "shepherd" is significant, as it conveys the idea of care, guidance, and protection, much like a shepherd with his flock. This imagery is prevalent throughout Scripture, with leaders like David being described as shepherds. It also foreshadows Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd, who leads and cares for His people (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>&#8216;Why haven&#8217;t you built Me a house of cedar?&#8217;</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights that God never required a permanent temple or house of cedar during the time of the judges or earlier leaders. The use of "cedar" indicates a structure of grandeur and permanence, contrasting with the temporary tabernacle. This points to God's transcendence and His desire for a relationship with His people over physical structures. The eventual building of the temple by Solomon (1 Kings 6) fulfills a different purpose, symbolizing God's dwelling among His people, yet it also foreshadows the coming of Christ, who embodies God's presence on earth (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His sovereignty and contentment with His dwelling among His people without a permanent temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, whom He led through various journeys and whom He chose as His own.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/leaders.htm">Leaders (Judges)</a></b><br>The appointed leaders or judges of Israel who were tasked with shepherding the people before the establishment of the monarchy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The king of Israel at the time, who desired to build a temple for God, prompting this divine response.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_cedar.htm">House of Cedar</a></b><br>Refers to a permanent temple or dwelling place for God, which David intended to build.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_contentment.htm">God's Sovereignty and Contentment</a></b><br>God is sovereign and does not require human efforts to establish His presence.

Instead of <span class="accented">tribes</span>, the Chronicler (<a href="/1_chronicles/17-6.htm">1 Chronicles 17:6</a>) reads "judges," the words in the Hebrew being almost identical. "Judges" is, of course, the more easy and natural reading, but "tribes" gives a fuller sense, and is supported by all the versions. For in the troubled anarchy which lasted until Saul's reign, first one tribe and then another was called to the front, and had a temporary ascendancy; but neither did Jehovah give it any command to provide a settled place for his worship, nor did any one of the judges conceive the thought of making his tribe permanently the chief, by providing a fixed abode for the ark and for God's worship within its borders. <span class="cmt_word">To feed my people Israel.</span> The shepherd, in biblical language, is the ruler, and <span class="accented">to feed</span> is to govern, yet in a kindly way, going in front as the shepherd before his flock, to bear the brunt of danger, to clear the road, and to guide into the safe pastures. So tribe after tribe had been called to bear the brunt of war, and, after winning deliverance, it became its duty to guide and lead the people. In <a href="/1_kings/8-16.htm">1 Kings 8:16, 18, 25</a>, and still more remarkably in <a href="/1_chronicles/22-8.htm">1 Chronicles 22:8, 9</a>, we find large additions made to the account here given.
