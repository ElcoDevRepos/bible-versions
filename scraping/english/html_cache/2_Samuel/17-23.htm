His advice was not followed by Absalom, who chose to heed Hushai's counsel instead. This rejection was significant, as it indicated a turning point in Absalom's rebellion against David. The rejection of Ahithophel's counsel can be seen as divine intervention, as God intended to bring about Absalom's downfall. This moment reflects the theme of human plans being subject to God's sovereign will, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>.<p><b>he saddled his donkey and set out for his house in his hometown</b><br>The act of saddling a donkey indicates a deliberate and personal decision to leave the court. Ahithophel's hometown was Giloh, located in the hill country of Judah. This journey back to his roots signifies a retreat from public life to private affairs. The donkey, a common mode of transportation, symbolizes his status and wealth, as only those of means could afford such an animal. This phrase highlights the cultural practice of returning to one's origins in times of distress or failure.<p><b>He put his affairs in order and hanged himself</b><br>Ahithophel's decision to put his affairs in order before taking his life suggests a methodical and calculated approach, reflecting his character as a wise and prudent man. His suicide can be seen as an act of despair and shame, as his unheeded counsel meant the failure of Absalom's rebellion, which he had supported. This act parallels Judas Iscariot's suicide in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/27-5.htm">Matthew 27:5</a>), both being betrayals that ended in self-inflicted death. It underscores the biblical theme of the consequences of betrayal and the ultimate futility of opposing God's anointed.<p><b>So he died and was buried in his father&#8217;s tomb</b><br>Burial in one's family tomb was a sign of honor and respect, even in death. This indicates that despite his tragic end, Ahithophel was still afforded the dignity of being laid to rest with his ancestors. The mention of his father's tomb emphasizes the importance of family lineage and heritage in ancient Israelite culture. It also serves as a reminder of the temporal nature of human life and the enduring legacy of one's actions, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a>, which speaks to the value of a good name over fine perfume.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahithophel.htm">Ahithophel</a></b><br>A counselor to King David, known for his wisdom.

Realizing his strategy was thwarted by God, he withdrew, settled his estate, and chose suicide&#8212;an act that sealed both his earthly failure and spiritual folly. His quiet burial contrasts sharply with God&#8217;s unfolding victory through David, underscoring that opposing divine authority ultimately ends in hopelessness, while submission leads to life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">And hanged himself.</span>--Ahithophei was moved, not merely by chagrin at the rejection of his counsel, but was shrewd enough to see that, with this delay, Absalom's rebellion would inevitably fail, and he himself be likely to come to a traitor's death.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ahithophel...hanged himself.</span> There is an old fancy, put down by Thenius as one of the curiosities of interpretation, that Ahithophel died of a quinsy; for the word might mean "was strangled or choked." But the act seems mentioned as a proof of Ahithophel's unerring judgment. Indignation at Absalom's folly, and at the slight. cast upon himself, is not a sufficient reason for so violent a deed. He must have foreseen the certain ruin of the conspiracy if David was allowed time; and he knew that upon its failure would follow his own punishment. It is proof also that he was a fierce and ill-tempered man, and animated for some reason or other with a malignant hatred of David. The parallel between Ahithophel and the traitor Judas must strike every one. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/17-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Ahithophel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1465;&#1443;&#1508;&#1462;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7717;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#333;&#183;p&#772;el)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
