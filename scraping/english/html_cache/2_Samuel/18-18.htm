It reflects the human desire for remembrance and legacy, a theme seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a> with the Tower of Babel.<p><b>Absalom had set up for himself a pillar</b><br>Absalom's act of setting up a pillar is significant in the ancient Near Eastern context, where monuments were often erected to commemorate individuals or events. This self-commemoration contrasts with the biblical ideal of God establishing one's legacy, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-13</a> with God's promise to David.<p><b>in the King&#8217;s Valley</b><br>The King&#8217;s Valley is traditionally identified with the Kidron Valley, located near Jerusalem. This location is significant as it is close to the city of David, highlighting Absalom's desire to be remembered in association with royal authority and proximity to the seat of power.<p><b>for he had said, &#8220;I have no son to preserve the memory of my name.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reveals Absalom's concern for his legacy. Although <a href="/2_samuel/14-27.htm">2 Samuel 14:27</a> mentions that Absalom had sons, it is possible they died young or were otherwise unable to carry on his name. This reflects the cultural importance of male offspring in ancient Israel for the continuation of one's lineage and name.<p><b>So he gave the pillar his name</b><br>Naming the pillar after himself underscores Absalom's self-centeredness and desire for personal glory. This act can be contrasted with the biblical principle of seeking God's glory rather than one's own, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>.<p><b>and to this day it is called Absalom&#8217;s Monument</b><br>The phrase "to this day" suggests that the monument was still known by this name at the time the text was written, indicating its lasting impact. This enduring name serves as a reminder of Absalom's rebellion and tragic end, paralleling the fate of those who seek their own glory rather than God's, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his handsome appearance and rebellious nature.

Its site has not been identified, and writers differ as to whether it was near Jerusalem, in the valley of the Kidron, which seems probable, or was near the site of Sodom. On Absalom's statement that he had no son, see note on 14:27.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Absalom... had taken and reared up for himself a pillar.</span> In contrast with the heap of stones cast over his dishonoured body, the narrator calls attention to the costly memorial erected by Absalom in his lifetime. The three unnamed sons mentioned in <a href="/2_samuel/14-27.htm">2 Samuel 14:27</a> seem to have died in their infancy, and probably also their mother; and Absalom, instead of taking other wives to bear him sons, which would have been in unison with the feelings of the time, manifested his grief by raising this monument. We have no reason for supposing that it was the result of vanity and ostentation. Ostentatious he was, and magnificent, but his not marrying again is a sign of genuine sorrow. <span class="cmt_word">The king's dale</span> is "the Valley of Shaveh," mentioned in <a href="/genesis/14-17.htm">Genesis 14:17</a>; but whether it was near Jerusalem, as Josephus asserts, or near Sodom, is uncertain. The pillar was probably an obelisk, or possibly a pyramid, and certainly was not the Ionic column of Roman workmanship shown in the Middle Ages and at the present time as "Absalom's grave." This is in the Kidron valley, about two furlongs from Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Absalom's place;</span> literally, <span class="accented">Absalom's hand</span>; that is, memorial (see note on 1 Samuel 15:12). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/18-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">During his lifetime,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7717;ay&#183;y&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
