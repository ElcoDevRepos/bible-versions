Angels often serve as messengers or agents of God's will, as seen in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19:1</a> and <a href="/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a>. The angel's presence signifies God's direct intervention in human affairs, emphasizing the gravity of David's sin in ordering the census. This event occurs after David's military census, which was against God's will, leading to a plague as punishment (<a href="/2_samuel/24.htm">2 Samuel 24:1-15</a>). The angel's actions are a fulfillment of the judgment pronounced by the prophet Gad.<p><b>he said to the LORD</b><br>David's immediate response is to turn to God in prayer, demonstrating his recognition of God's sovereignty and his own accountability. This reflects the biblical principle of repentance and seeking God's mercy, as seen in <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>, where David confesses his sin with Bathsheba. It underscores the importance of direct communication with God in times of crisis.<p><b>Surely I, the shepherd, have sinned and acted wickedly</b><br>David acknowledges his role as a shepherd, a metaphor for leadership and responsibility, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> and <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, where Jesus is described as the Good Shepherd. By admitting his sin, David takes full responsibility for his actions, contrasting with his earlier failures to do so, such as in the case of Uriah (2 Samuel 11). This confession is a model of humility and accountability for leaders.<p><b>But these sheep, what have they done?</b><br>David's plea for the people reflects his pastoral heart and concern for his subjects, akin to Moses interceding for Israel in <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>. The metaphor of sheep emphasizes the innocence and vulnerability of the people, who suffer due to the actions of their leader. This highlights the biblical theme of intercession and the responsibility of leaders to protect their people.<p><b>Please, let Your hand fall upon me and my father&#8217;s house</b><br>David offers himself and his family as substitutes for the punishment, a foreshadowing of the concept of substitutionary atonement found in <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-6</a> and fulfilled in Jesus Christ's sacrifice on the cross. This self-sacrificial attitude is a type of Christ, who bore the sins of humanity. David's willingness to bear the consequences of his sin demonstrates true repentance and a desire to protect his people, aligning with the biblical principle of sacrificial leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who acknowledges his sin and takes responsibility for the consequences affecting his people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger executing judgment upon Israel as a result of David's sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is just and merciful, and to whom David appeals for mercy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>Referred to as "sheep" by David, they are suffering due to the king's actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the angel was poised to strike, highlighting the severity of the situation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_weight_of_leadership.htm">The Weight of Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders bear significant responsibility for their actions, which can have widespread consequences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart_of_a_shepherd.htm">The Heart of a Shepherd</a></b><br>True leadership involves self-sacrifice and a deep concern for the well-being of those under one's care.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_intercession.htm">Repentance and Intercession</a></b><br>Genuine repentance involves acknowledging one's sin and interceding for others affected by it.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_mercy.htm">God's Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>God's response to sin is just, yet He is also merciful to those who repent and seek His forgiveness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_christ_as_the_ultimate_shepherd.htm">The Role of Christ as the Ultimate Shepherd</a></b><br>David's willingness to take the punishment points to Christ, who took upon Himself the sins of the world.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Samuel_24_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Samuel 24:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/David_s_plea_true_repentance_in_2_Sam_24_17.htm">How does David's plea in 2 Samuel 24:17 demonstrate true repentance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/David_s_leadership_in_2_Sam_24_17.htm">What leadership qualities does David exhibit in 2 Samuel 24:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/David_s_intercession_as_Christ_s_mediator.htm">How does David's intercession reflect Christ's role as our mediator?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_David_s_responsibility_daily.htm">How can we apply David's sense of responsibility in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/2_Sam_24_17_on_accountability.htm">What does 2 Samuel 24:17 teach about accountability for our actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_David_claim_the_sin_in_2_Sam_24_17.htm">Why does David take responsibility for the sin in 2 Samuel 24:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/2_Sam_24_17_God_s_justice_mercy.htm">How does 2 Samuel 24:17 reflect on God's justice and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_David_s_plea_in_2_Sam_24_17_key.htm">What is the significance of David's plea in 2 Samuel 24:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_samuel_24.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Samuel 24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_1_chr_17_and_2_sam_7.htm">How do we reconcile the differences between 1 Chronicles 17 and 2 Samuel 7 regarding the details of God's covenant with David?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_would_god_send_a_deadly_plague.htm">Why would a merciful God send a plague that kills 70,000 people for David&#8217;s wrongdoing (2 Samuel 24:15)? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_does_god_change_his_mind_in_exodus_32_14.htm">Why does an all-knowing God, in Exodus 32:14, appear to change His mind after Moses intercedes? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/who_incited_david's_census.htm">Who incited David to take a census?

David acknowledges that his conduct had not been upright and straightforward, but that he had turned aside into the paths of self-will and personal aggrandizement. <span class="cmt_word">These sheep, what have they done?</span> The sin had been quite as much that of the people as of the king; for the war lust had entered into the very heart of the nation. But David, with that warmth of feeling which makes his character so noble, can see only his own fault. It is not a true repentance when the sinner looks for excuses, and apportions the blame between himself and others. To David the people seemed innocent, or, if at all to blame, he felt that it was he who had set them the example and led them on. The narrative in this place is much briefer than in Chronicles. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/24-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1448;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1514;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;
