This description sets the stage for understanding Absalom's influence and the role his charisma played in his later actions. In the ancient Near Eastern context, physical appearance often correlated with leadership qualities and favor, as seen in other biblical figures like Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/9-2.htm">1 Samuel 9:2</a>) and David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12</a>). Absalom's beauty and the praise he received foreshadow his ability to win the hearts of the Israelites, which becomes significant in his rebellion against David (<a href="/2_samuel/15-6.htm">2 Samuel 15:6</a>).<p><b>From the sole of his foot to the top of his head, he did not have a single flaw.</b><br>This hyperbolic expression emphasizes Absalom's perfection in appearance, suggesting an idealized form of beauty. In biblical literature, such descriptions often highlight the contrast between outward appearance and inner character. While Absalom's physical perfection is noted, his later actions reveal moral and spiritual flaws, drawing a parallel to the biblical theme that God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). This phrase also serves as a reminder of the dangers of valuing external beauty over inner righteousness, a recurring theme in wisdom literature such as Proverbs (<a href="/proverbs/31-30.htm">Proverbs 31:30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his striking appearance and charisma.

Absalom has the first qualification but not the second.<p>&#8226; His flawless exterior masks fatal interior fractures&#8212;bitterness, pride, rebellion (<a href="/2_samuel/13-28.htm">2 Samuel 13:28&#8211;29</a>; 15:10&#8211;12). Outward perfection cannot secure inward righteousness (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>; <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/14-25.htm">2 Samuel 14:25</a> spotlights Absalom&#8217;s unmatched physical beauty and popularity, traits that dazzled a nation hungry for impressive leaders. Yet the verse also serves as an implicit caution: external perfection without internal submission to God breeds destruction. Like Saul before him and others after, Absalom&#8217;s striking appearance could not compensate for a heart set on self-exaltation. True wholeness, Scripture reminds us, comes when the inside matches the outside&#8212;something fulfilled only in the flawless character of Christ, who invites His people to cultivate beauty of spirit over mere attractiveness of form.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/14-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now there was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1447;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
