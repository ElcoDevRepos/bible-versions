By appointing Amasa, Absalom sought to consolidate his power and distance himself from David's loyalists. Joab, David's nephew and a seasoned military commander, had been a key figure in David's reign. Replacing Joab with Amasa, who was also related to David, indicates Absalom's strategic move to gain support from those discontented with Joab's leadership. This decision reflects the political maneuvering common in ancient monarchies, where familial ties often influenced military and political appointments.<p><b>Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra, the Ishmaelite</b><br>Ithra, also known as Jether in some translations, is identified as an Ishmaelite, linking Amasa to the descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's son with Hagar. This connection highlights the diverse ethnic and familial backgrounds present in Israel's leadership. The Ishmaelites were traditionally seen as outsiders to the covenant community, yet Ithra's marriage into a prominent Israelite family suggests a degree of integration and acceptance. This detail underscores the complex social and familial networks in ancient Israel, where alliances often transcended ethnic boundaries.<p><b>who had married Abigail, the daughter of Nahash</b><br>Abigail, Amasa's mother, is described as the daughter of Nahash. This reference to Nahash, who was likely a king of the Ammonites, suggests a possible alliance or connection between Israel and its neighboring nations. The Ammonites were often in conflict with Israel, yet intermarriage indicates periods of peace and cooperation. Abigail's marriage to Ithra and her role in the narrative highlight the intricate web of relationships that influenced political and military dynamics in the region.<p><b>and sister of Zeruiah the mother of Joab.</b><br>Zeruiah, David's sister, was the mother of Joab, Abishai, and Asahel, all of whom were prominent military leaders. This familial connection between Amasa and Joab adds a layer of complexity to the narrative, as it pits relatives against each other in the struggle for power. The mention of Zeruiah emphasizes the importance of family ties in the leadership structure of David's kingdom. It also foreshadows the eventual reconciliation and tension between David's loyalists and those who supported Absalom's rebellion. The intricate family dynamics serve as a backdrop for the unfolding drama of loyalty, betrayal, and the quest for power in the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The son of King David who rebelled against his father, seeking to usurp the throne of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/amasa.htm">Amasa</a></b><br>Appointed by Absalom as the commander of the army, replacing Joab.

By elevating Amasa, Absalom hoped to<p>&#8226; sever Joab&#8217;s influence over the troops (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/18-2.htm">2 Samuel 18:2</a>)<p>&#8226; buy the allegiance of those disenchanted with Joab&#8217;s ruthless tactics (compare <a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>)<p>&#8226; signal a fresh start under his rule (like Adonijah later tried in <a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5&#8211;7</a>)<p>This political calculation shows the danger of power plays that sidestep God-ordained leadership (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra, the Ishmaelite</b><p>Scripture emphasizes lineage because it shapes loyalties.

While Gentiles could join Israel (<a href="/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48</a>), the note hints at mixed allegiances. David later tries to reconcile with Amasa (<a href="/2_samuel/19-13.htm">2 Samuel 19:13</a>), illustrating grace toward those on the fringe, yet reminding us that divided heritage can mirror divided hearts (<a href="/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who had married Abigail, the daughter of Nahash</b><p>Abigail here is not David&#8217;s wife from Carmel (<a href="/bsb/1_samuel/25.htm">1 Samuel 25</a>) but another woman of the same name. Calling her &#8220;daughter of Nahash&#8221; may seem odd since Nahash was a known Ammonite king (<a href="/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1</a>). Most scholars see Nahash as either:<p>&#8226; another name for Jesse, David&#8217;s father (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/2-13.htm">1 Chronicles 2:13&#8211;16</a>), or<p>&#8226; Abigail&#8217;s mother&#8217;s previous husband.<p>Either way, the verse underscores how complicated family trees become when marriages cross tribal or national lines (<a href="/nehemiah/13-23.htm">Nehemiah 13:23&#8211;27</a>).

It is impossible to decide certainly. The Jewish tradition that Nahash is another name for Jesse has no support.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ithra an Israelite.</span> In <a href="/1_chronicles/2-17.htm">1 Chronicles 2:17</a> he is called "Jether the Ishmeelite." The first name is the same, Ithra being the emphatic form of Jether; and as it is difficult to find a reason for mentioning so ordinary a fact as that his father was an Israelite, we may conclude that "Ishmeelite" is the correct reading. Bishop Wordsworth, however, suggests that "Israelite" was in contrast to "Judahite;" but this distinction did not come into use until after the disruption of the kingdom. The Vatican text of the Septuagint has "Jezreelite," which is probably a conjecture to get rid of the obvious error of calling him an Israelite. Amasa was an illegitimate son, which confirms the reading "Ishmeelite" in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-17.htm">1 Chronicles 2:17</a>, as a marriage between Abigail and a foreigner would be sure to be opposed by all the members of Jesse's family. <span class="cmt_word">Nahash</span>. Jewish interpreters regard Nahash (equivalent to "serpent") as another name for Jesse, quoting in proof, "Out of the root of Nahash (the serpent) shall come forth the basilisk" (<a href="/isaiah/14-29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a>), which in the Chaldee Paraphrase is explained as meaning, "out of the root of Jesse shall come forth the Messiah." This conceit would scarcely have deserved mention, had it not found a place in the margin of the Authorized Version. Some few commentators regard Nahash as a woman's name, and think that she was a wife of Jesse, and mother of Abigail and Zerniah, but not of David. But Nahash is so constantly a man's name that it is easier to believe that Nahash was the first husband of David's mother, and Abigail and Zerniah his half-sisters, not on the father's, but on the mother's side. Joab and his brothers are always described as sons of Zeruiah, both to mark their relationship to David, and also because the rank was on her side. Amasa was probably the Amasai mentioned in <a href="/1_chronicles/12-18.htm">1 Chronicles 12:18</a> as bringing a powerful reinforcement to David while at Ziklag; but the ambition of supplanting Joab made him now forget David's long friendship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/17-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Absalom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1465;&#1435;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;l&#333;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun -
