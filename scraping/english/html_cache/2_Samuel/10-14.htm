Their alliance with the Arameans, a powerful group from the region of modern-day Syria, was strategic. The Arameans' retreat signaled a significant loss of morale and support for the Ammonites. This reflects the common ancient Near Eastern practice of forming coalitions for military campaigns. The Arameans' flight may have been seen as a divine judgment, as alliances against God's people often ended in failure (<a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-4</a>).<p><b>they too fled before Abishai</b><br>Abishai, the brother of Joab and a valiant warrior, was a key military leader under King David. His presence on the battlefield was formidable, and the Ammonites' retreat before him underscores the effectiveness and reputation of David's military commanders. This moment highlights the theme of God granting victory to Israel through His chosen leaders, reminiscent of victories under Joshua (<a href="/joshua/10-10.htm">Joshua 10:10</a>).<p><b>and they entered the city</b><br>The Ammonites retreating into their city indicates a defensive strategy, typical in ancient warfare when open-field battles were lost. Cities were fortified and provided a last line of defense. This action reflects the Ammonites' desperation and the shift from offensive to defensive tactics. It also sets the stage for future sieges, a common military strategy in the ancient world (<a href="/2_samuel/11.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>).<p><b>So Joab returned from fighting against the Ammonites</b><br>Joab, the commander of David's army, was known for his military prowess and strategic acumen. His decision to return suggests a temporary cessation of hostilities, possibly due to the onset of winter or the need to regroup. This reflects the cyclical nature of ancient warfare, where campaigns were often paused due to seasonal changes (<a href="/2_samuel/11.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>).<p><b>and came to Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Israel, was the seat of King David's power. Joab's return to Jerusalem signifies a regrouping and reporting to the king, a common practice for military leaders. This also emphasizes the centrality of Jerusalem in Israel's national identity and God's covenantal promises, foreshadowing its significance in biblical prophecy and as a type of the heavenly city (<a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A group of people descended from Lot, often in conflict with Israel.

The hired Aramean mercenaries collapse first (cf. <a href="/1_chronicles/19-15.htm">1 Chronicles 19:15</a>), exposing the weakness of Ammon&#8217;s confidence in human alliances rather than in the living God (see <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, Joab had split Israel&#8217;s forces&#8212;he faced Aram while Abishai faced Ammon (<a href="/2_samuel/10-9.htm">2 Samuel 10:9-10</a>).

David will soon besiege Rabbah and claim its crown (<a href="/2_samuel/12-26.htm">2 Samuel 12:26-31</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a> foresees a similar impulse on a cosmic scale: people hiding &#8220;in caves of the rocks&#8221; when the Lord rises to shake the earth.

But as the Ammonites were posted close to the gate of their city, they would withdraw into it without less as soon as they learned that their allies were defeated. There was thus the certainty of a long siege before Rabbah could be taken. We gather from <a href="/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a> that it was late in the year when Joab won this victory, and it was part of the weakness of ancient warfare that a long campaign was beyond the power of either side. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/10-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the Ammonites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
