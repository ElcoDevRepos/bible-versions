In the biblical narrative, Israel is set apart from other nations due to their covenant relationship with God, beginning with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). This distinctiveness is emphasized throughout the Old Testament, where Israel is often referred to as a "holy nation" (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). The rhetorical question underscores the unparalleled nature of Israel's identity and mission.<p><b>the one nation on earth whom God went out to redeem as a people for Himself&#8212;</b><br>This part of the verse refers to the Exodus, where God delivered the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. The concept of redemption is central to Israel's identity, as it signifies God's intervention to save and claim them as His own. This act of redemption is a foreshadowing of the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who redeems humanity from sin (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13-14</a>). The idea of being a people "for Himself" indicates a special relationship and purpose, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>.<p><b>and to make a name for Himself?</b><br>God's actions in redeeming Israel were not only for the benefit of the people but also to reveal His power and character to the world. The making of a "name" refers to God's reputation and glory being known among the nations. This is echoed in the Psalms, where God's mighty deeds are proclaimed to all peoples (<a href="/psalms/96-3.htm">Psalm 96:3</a>). The ultimate fulfillment of God's name being made great is seen in the New Testament, where Jesus' name is exalted above all (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<p><b>You performed great and awesome wonders&#8212;</b><br>The "great and awesome wonders" refer to the miraculous events during the Exodus, such as the plagues, the parting of the Red Sea, and the provision in the wilderness. These acts demonstrated God's sovereignty and power over creation and other deities, affirming His supremacy. Such wonders are a recurring theme in Scripture, serving as signs of God's presence and authority (<a href="/psalms/77-14.htm">Psalm 77:14</a>).<p><b>by driving out nations and their gods from before Your people,</b><br>This phrase recalls the conquest of Canaan, where God enabled Israel to defeat the inhabitants of the land. The driving out of nations and their gods signifies the establishment of God's kingdom and the rejection of idolatry. It reflects the spiritual battle against false gods and the call to worship the one true God (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-5</a>). This conquest is a type of the spiritual victory believers have in Christ, who triumphs over all powers and authorities (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<p><b>whom You redeemed for Yourself from Egypt.</b><br>The repetition of redemption from Egypt emphasizes the foundational event of Israel's history. It serves as a constant reminder of God's faithfulness and the basis for Israel's identity and mission. This redemption is a type of the greater redemption through Christ, who delivers from the bondage of sin and death (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>). The Exodus narrative is central to understanding God's plan of salvation and His covenant relationship with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen nation of God, set apart to be His people and to reflect His glory to the world.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who redeems and performs wonders for His people, establishing His name and authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land from which God redeemed Israel, symbolizing bondage and oppression.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations_and_their_gods.htm">Nations and their gods</a></b><br>The pagan nations and their deities that God drove out to establish Israel in the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The king of Israel at the time, who is receiving God's covenant promise through the prophet Nathan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_choice.htm">God's Sovereign Choice</a></b><br>God chose Israel not because of their merit but out of His sovereign will and purpose.

The verse underlines two unchanging truths&#8212;God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness and His zeal for His own glory&#8212;providing a rock-solid foundation for every promise that follows.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Whom God went to redeem.</span>--The word here used for God in this its usual plural form is always construed with a singular verb when it refers to the true God. Here the verb is plural, because the thought is, "What nation is there whom its gods went to redeem?"<p><span class= "bld">For you.</span>--These words, which can only refer to Israel, seem strange in a prayer to God. They are omitted by the LXX., and changed into <span class= "ital">for them </span>by the Vulg. If they are retained as they are, it must be understood that David for the moment turns in thought to the people, instead of to God whom he is immediately addressing.<p><span class= "bld">For thy land.</span>--The LXX. and the parallel passage (<a href="/1_chronicles/17-21.htm" title="And what one nation in the earth is like your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make you a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before your people whom you have redeemed out of Egypt?">1Chronicles 17:21</a>), instead of this have, "by driving out." If the text here may be corrected in this way, there will be no occasion for inserting <span class= "ital">from </span>before <span class= "ital">the nations, </span>which is not in the Hebrew. This part of the verse will then read, <span class= "ital">to do great things and terrible, by driving out before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, nations and their gods. </span>The phrase, "great things and terrible," in reference to the Exodus, is taken from <a href="/deuteronomy/10-21.htm" title="He is your praise, and he is your God, that has done for you these great and terrible things, which your eyes have seen.">Deuteronomy 10:21</a>. The whole of this part of the prayer is evidently founded upon <a href="/deuteronomy/4-7.htm" title="For what nation is there so great, who has God so near to them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call on him for?">Deuteronomy 4:7</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/4-32.htm" title="For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven to the other, whether there has been any such thing as this great thing is, or has been heard like it?">Deuteronomy 4:32-34</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And what one nation,</span> etc.? The translation should be, <span class="accented">And who is like thy people, like Israel, the one nation upon earth which God went to redeem for himself to be his people, and to make for him a name</span>, etc.? Israel both was and remains to this day a nation unique in its history, both in those early dealings of God with it, and also in its later history and its marvellous preservation unto this day. It is remarkable that in this place the word for "God," <span class="accented">Elohim</span>, is followed by a verb plural, the almost invariable rule in Hebrew being that, though <span class="accented">Elohim</span> is itself plural, it takes a verb singular whenever it refers to the true God. In the corresponding passage (<a href="/1_chronicles/17-21.htm">1 Chronicles 17:21</a>) the verb is in the singular. No adequate reason has been given for this deviation, but probably the usage in these early times was not so strict as it became subsequently. It is the influence of writing, and of the eye becoming conversant with writing, that makes men correct in their use of language and in the spelling of words. In the Syriac Church, God the Word and God the Holy Ghost were at first spoken of in the feminine gender, because "Word" and "Spirit" are both feminine nouns; but grammar soon gave way to soundness of thought and feeling. So probably in colloquial language <span class="accented">Elohim</span> was often used with a verb plural, but correct thinking forbade and overruled grammar. We may regard this, then, as one of the few passages in which the colloquial usage has escaped correction, and attach no further importance to it. <span class="cmt_word">For you.</span> "You" is plural, and refers to the people. The Vulgate has "for them," which is in accordance with the greater exactness of modern grammar. But sudden changes of person are very common in Hebrew, which follows the rules of thought rather than of written composition; and so David speaks of Israel as <span class="accented">you</span>, because they seemed to him to be present. We must note, however, that in the words that follow, <span class="cmt_word">for thy land, and thy people,</span> the pronoun is singular, and refers to God. <span class="cmt_word">From the nations and their gods.</span> Both the Authorized Version and the Revised Version, by inserting "from," which is not in the Hebrew, take "nations" as in apposition with "Egypt;" but a moment's consideration shows that this is untenable, as "nations" is plural. But the whole verse is so full of grammatical difficulties as to make it extremely probable that the text is corrupt, and that we ought to supply the verb "to drive out," which is actually read in <a href="/1_chronicles/17-21.htm">1 Chronicles 17:21</a>, or even to substitute it in the place of "for thy land," which is omitted in the parallel passage. The nations which God drove out had nothing to do with Egypt, but were the seven dominant tribes of Canaan; and the bestowal upon Israel of their territories was as essential a part of Jehovah's dealings with his people as the Exodus itself. Thus the reading will be, <span class="accented">To drive out before thy people, whom thou purchasedst for thee from Egypt, nations and their gods.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/7-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
