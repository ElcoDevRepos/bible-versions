Standing his ground signifies unwavering commitment and bravery in the face of overwhelming odds.

This mirrors the spiritual battles believers face, as described in <a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4</a>, where the weapons of warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power.<p><b>until his hand grew weary and stuck to his sword</b><br>This phrase highlights Eleazar's perseverance and dedication.

It also foreshadows the endurance required in spiritual warfare.<p><b>The LORD brought about a great victory that day</b><br>The victory is attributed to the LORD, emphasizing divine intervention and the belief that success in battle comes from God. This aligns with the biblical principle that God fights for His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>. It also points to the ultimate victory through Christ, who conquers sin and death.<p><b>Then the troops returned to him, but only to plunder the dead</b><br>The returning troops highlight the aftermath of the battle, where the spoils are collected. This reflects the biblical theme of God providing for His people through victory.

Eleazar literally stays in the field while everyone else retreats, embodying the truth that &#8220;one of you can put a thousand to flight&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/23-10.htm">Joshua 23:10</a>).<p>&#8226; His hand &#8220;stuck to his sword.&#8221; This isn&#8217;t poetic embellishment; it describes muscles locked in exhaustion and resolve. He would rather lose the use of his hand than let go of the weapon God placed there&#8212;an image echoed spiritually in <a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a>, where believers are told to grip &#8220;the sword of the Spirit.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Courage like this flows from confidence in the Lord, not self-reliance. Jonathan voiced the same conviction in <a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>: &#8220;Nothing can hinder the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Eleazar&#8217;s stand foreshadows the New Testament call to &#8220;having done all, to stand&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>). <a href="/hebrews/10-39.htm">Hebrews 10:39</a> reminds us that God&#8217;s people &#8220;are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The LORD brought about a great victory that day</b><p>&#8226; Scripture is clear about the source of the triumph. Eleazar fought, yet the success was the Lord&#8217;s. <a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a> states, &#8220;It was not by their sword that they took the land&#8230; it was Your right hand.&#8221;<p>&#8226; David told Goliath, &#8220;the battle is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>), and that same principle governs here. Human effort is real and necessary, but God gives the increase (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a> rings true: &#8220;The battle is not yours, but God&#8217;s.&#8221; Eleazar&#8217;s story shows that divine sovereignty and human responsibility work together&#8212;our obedience becomes the stage on which God displays His power.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then the troops returned to him, but only to plunder the dead</b><p>&#8226; Those who had fled come back, but the fight is over. Their role is limited to gathering the spoil, reminiscent of <a href="/judges/7-23.htm">Judges 7:23</a>, where Israel&#8217;s scattered men rejoined Gideon after God had routed Midian.<p>&#8226; The scene underscores a sober lesson: blessings often flow through the faithfulness of a few, and others enjoy the benefits afterward (<a href="/1_samuel/30-24.htm">1 Samuel 30:24</a>).<p>&#8226; It also highlights accountability. When the moment to stand arrives, some retreat and lose the privilege of sharing in the victory itself. <a href="/deuteronomy/20-4.htm">Deuteronomy 20:4</a> promises God&#8217;s presence in battle, yet it is the courageous who experience that promise firsthand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Eleazar&#8217;s refusal to retreat, his hand welded to the sword, and the Lord&#8217;s unmistakable victory teach that God honors steadfast faith. One believer&#8217;s obedience can turn the tide, because the real power in every struggle belongs to the Lord. Stand firm, hold fast to the tools He has provided, and trust Him to bring the victory&#8212;others may gather the spoils, but those who stand will know the joy of having fought by His side.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Clave unto the sword.</span>--Instances are rare, but well authenticated, of a sort of cramp following excessive exertion, so that the hand could only be released from the sword by external appliances.<p><span class= "bld">Returned after him.</span>--Does not imply that they had at any time deserted him, but only that they turned wherever he went to gather the spoil of the men he slew.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Victory</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">salvation</span>; and so also in ver. 12 and <a href="/1_samuel/11-13.htm">1 Samuel 11:13</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/19-5.htm">1 Samuel 19:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Returned after him.</span> This does not imply that they had fled, but simply that they turned in whichever way he turned, and followed him.
