Zadok, from the line of Eleazar, was a descendant of Aaron, which legitimized his priestly role. His presence signifies continuity in the priesthood, as he later becomes a key figure in Solomon's reign, supporting the transition of power (<a href="/1_kings/1-39.htm">1 Kings 1:39</a>). Ahimelech, son of Abiathar, represents the line of Ithamar, another of Aaron's sons. Abiathar, Ahimelech's father, had been a loyal supporter of David during his flight from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/22-20.htm">1 Samuel 22:20-23</a>). The dual priesthood reflects the political and religious complexities of the time, as both lines of Aaron were represented, ensuring broader acceptance among the tribes. This arrangement also prefigures the dual roles of Christ as both priest and king, uniting different aspects of leadership and service.<p><b>Seraiah was the scribe;</b><br>Seraiah's role as a scribe indicates the importance of record-keeping and administration in David's kingdom. Scribes were essential for maintaining legal documents, royal decrees, and historical records, which were crucial for governance and the preservation of Israel's history. The position of scribe was one of significant influence, as it involved close interaction with the king and his court. This role underscores the value placed on literacy and education in ancient Israel, reflecting a society that valued the written word, which is foundational for the transmission of Scripture. The mention of Seraiah highlights the organized structure of David's administration, which laid the groundwork for the future prosperity of Israel under Solomon. This administrative order can be seen as a type of the order and peace that Christ brings to His kingdom, where He is both the Word and the ultimate authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zadok_son_of_ahitub.htm">Zadok son of Ahitub</a></b><br>Zadok was a prominent priest during the reign of King David.

This difficulty is increased by the further notices of the men bearing these names. Ahimelech was certainly the high priest who gave the shew-bread to David, and was slain in consequence by Saul (1 Samuel 21, 22), and Abiathar, who fled to David, and afterwards became high priest, and was finally put out of the high-priesthood by Solomon (1 Kings 1, 2) was certainly his son; but, on the other hand, in <a href="/1_chronicles/24-3.htm" title="And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service.">1Chronicles 24:3</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/24-6.htm" title="And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.">1Chronicles 24:6</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/24-31.htm" title="These likewise cast lots over against their brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brothers.">1Chronicles 24:31</a> Ahimelech. is said to have been the co-priest with Zadok during the reign of David, and our Lord says that David ate the shew-bread "in the days of Abiathar, the high priest" (<a href="/mark/2-26.htm" title="How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the show bread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?">Mark 2:26</a>). These apparently conflicting facts have occasioned unnecessary perplexity. The simple solution of the difficulty seems to be that <span class= "ital">both </span>names were borne alike by father and by son, so that both of them are spoken of sometimes under one name, sometimes under the other. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Zadok... and Ahimelech... were the priests.</span> We have already seen that this was contrary to the letter of the Mosaic Law, and yet that there was no schism, and that by patience matters came back to the right groove. Zadok, of the elder line of Eleazar (<a href="/1_chronicles/6-4.htm">1 Chronicles 6:4-8, 50-53</a>), was high priest at Gibeon, and Ahimelech, of the junior line of Ithamar, was the high priest at Jerusalem. Instead of <span class="accented">Ahimelech the son of Abiathar</span>, the Syriac transposes the names, and reads, "Abiathar the son of Ahimelech" This agrees with the list in <a href="/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>, and it is certain that Abiathar outlived David (<a href="/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26</a>), and that he was David's high priest throughout his reign, though Zadok is not only constantly associated with him, but is placed first, as the man of higher rank (<a href="/2_samuel/15-24.htm">2 Samuel 15:24-35</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/17-15.htm">2 Samuel 17:15</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>). It is also remarkable that our Lord makes Abiathar the person who gave David the shewbread (<a href="/mark/2-26.htm">Mark 2:26</a>), whereas in <a href="/1_samuel/21.htm">1 Samuel 21</a>. he is repeatedly called Ahimelech. As both the LXX. and the Vulgate support the Hebrew against the Syriac, and as the reading "Ahimelech" is confirmed by <a href="/1_chronicles/18-16.htm">1 Chronicles 18:16</a> and 1 Chron 24:3, 6, 31, we must reject the emendation of the Syriac, and conclude that there was a double tradition respecting these names, some manuscripts making Abiathar the father, and others giving the seniority to Ahimelech. Our Lord made Abiathar the father, but the scribes, in their editing of the Hebrew text, gave that place to Ahimelech, yet did not carry out their restoration so thoroughly as not to leave proof that the names probably ought to be reversed. <span class="cmt_word">Seraiah was scribe.</span> His office was similar to that of a secretary of state with us. For <span class="accented">Seraiah</span> we have <span class="accented">Shavsha</span> in <a href="/1_chronicles/18-16.htm">1 Chronicles 18:16</a>, <span class="accented">Shisha</span> in <a href="/1_kings/4-3.htm">1 Kings 4:3</a>, and <span class="accented">Sheva</span> in <a href="/2_samuel/20-25.htm">2 Samuel 20:25</a>. This illustrates what has just been said as to the uncertainty about proper names. They are always most difficult to read, as the sense gives no aid, and these various forms of a name that does not occur elsewhere really bear witness to the high antiquity of the manuscripts uses by the scribes in settling the text of the Old Testament; and also to their self-restraint in not making them all forcibly agree. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/8-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Zadok</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1491;&#1447;&#1493;&#1465;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;wq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
