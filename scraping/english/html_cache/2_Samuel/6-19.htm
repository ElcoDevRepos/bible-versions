The act of distributing food to every man and woman signifies inclusivity and equality, reflecting the communal nature of Israelite society. This event occurs during the celebration of bringing the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem, a significant religious and national event. The distribution of food can be seen as a form of fellowship and unity among the people, reminiscent of the communal meals in the early Christian church (<a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>).<p><b>a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake</b><br>These items were common in ancient Israel and hold symbolic significance. Bread is a staple food, representing sustenance and life, and is often used in biblical texts to symbolize God's provision (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>). Date cakes and raisin cakes were considered delicacies, indicating a time of celebration and abundance. The inclusion of these items suggests a festive atmosphere and the joy of the occasion. The provision of these foods can also be seen as a precursor to the messianic banquet, a theme found in prophetic literature (<a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>).<p><b>And all the people departed, each to his own home</b><br>This phrase indicates the conclusion of the communal celebration, with each person returning to their daily life. It reflects the orderly nature of the event and the satisfaction of the people after receiving both spiritual and physical nourishment. The return to their homes signifies peace and contentment, as well as the successful integration of the Ark into the life of Israel. This moment can be compared to the peace and fulfillment believers find in Christ, who provides both spiritual and physical sustenance (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who orchestrated the return of the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem.

Literally and historically, the next thing he does is hand out provisions to the gathered crowd&#8212;he does not retreat to his palace or keep the celebration private. His royalty shows itself in generosity, modeling the LORD&#8217;s own giving heart (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-2.htm">1 Chronicles 16:2&#8211;3</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-19.htm">Psalm 68:19</a>). Centuries later Paul links Christ&#8217;s ascension with Him &#8220;giving gifts to men&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/4-7.htm">Ephesians 4:7&#8211;8</a>), an echo of this kingly pattern.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to every man and woman among the multitude of Israel</b><p>No one present is overlooked; blessing is extended to males and females alike, rich and poor, leaders and commoners. The text underscores that covenant joy is communal, not elitist (<a href="/exodus/16-16.htm">Exodus 16:16-18</a> with manna; <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a> regarding equality in Christ). In including women explicitly, Scripture highlights their full participation in worship and blessing&#8212;something already seen when Miriam sang by the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake</b><p>These three items combine basic sustenance with festive sweetness:<p>&#8226; Bread&#8212;daily provision (<a href="/1_kings/17-12.htm">1 Kings 17:12-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Date cake&#8212;energy-rich fruit pressed and baked for feasts (<a href="/1_samuel/25-18.htm">1 Samuel 25:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Raisin cake&#8212;often linked to love and celebration (Song of Songs 2:5).<p>By giving both staple and delicacy, David declares that God meets ordinary needs and delights His people with abundance (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And all the people departed, each to his own home</b><p>Worship concludes, yet the blessing goes with the worshipers.

The parallel passage adds, &#8220;David returned home to bless his household&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/16-43.htm">1 Chronicles 16:43</a>), reminding us that public devotion should overflow into private life (<a href="/luke/24-52.htm">Luke 24:52-53</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/6-19.htm">2 Samuel 6:19</a> records a literal historical act of King David that illustrates the character of God: His generosity is tangible, inclusive, and meant to travel from the place of worship into everyday homes.

Of the first of the three gifts there is no doubt. It was the round dough cake baked for sacrificial meals (<a href="/leviticus/8-26.htm">Leviticus 8:26</a>). So, too, there is no doubt of the third; it means "a cake of raisins" (see <a href="/songs/2-5.htm">Song of Solomon 2:5</a>; <a href="/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>, in which latter place raisins, or dried grapes, are expressly mentioned, boldly rendered in the Authorized Version "wine"). The Revised Version has given the correct rendering of the passage. The second word occurs only here, but the rendering of the Authorized Version is that of the Jews; and as it is some common domestic term not likely to be found in literature, but well known in every kitchen, they are most probably right. On the same sort of local authority Jerome renders it in the Vulgate "a piece of beef for roasting." As it is coupled with the bread and the raisin cake, we may feel sure that it was a portion of the flesh of the animals which had been killed in Sacrifice, and which the people were now permitted to take to their homes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/6-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then he distributed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1448;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7717;al&#183;l&#234;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
