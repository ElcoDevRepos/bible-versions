In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/13.htm">2 Samuel 13</a>, David has just received devastating news about the death of his son Amnon, who was killed by Absalom's servants. The act of standing up signifies a shift from a state of normalcy to one of crisis. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a king standing up could also symbolize the beginning of a formal response to a grave situation.<p><b>tore his clothes</b><br>Tearing one's clothes was a traditional expression of grief, mourning, or distress in ancient Israel. This act is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as when Jacob believed Joseph was dead (<a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>) and when Job received news of his children's death (<a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>). It was a public demonstration of inner turmoil and sorrow, often accompanied by other mourning practices like wearing sackcloth or ashes.<p><b>and lay down on the ground</b><br>Lying on the ground further emphasizes David's profound grief and despair. This posture is one of submission and vulnerability, often associated with mourning or penitence. In biblical times, lying prostrate was also a way to express humility before God, as seen in <a href="/joshua/7-6.htm">Joshua 7:6</a> when Joshua lay before the Ark of the Covenant.<p><b>And all his servants stood by with their clothes torn</b><br>The servants' actions mirror those of the king, indicating their shared grief and loyalty to David. In the hierarchical society of ancient Israel, the actions of a king or leader often set the tone for those around him. The servants' torn clothes signify their participation in the mourning process, reflecting the communal nature of grief in biblical times. This collective mourning underscores the gravity of the situation and the impact of Amnon's death on the entire royal household.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, David is the king of Israel, a man after God's own heart, yet deeply flawed.

His servants mirror his anguish, proving that sorrow reverberates through every layer of God&#8217;s people.
