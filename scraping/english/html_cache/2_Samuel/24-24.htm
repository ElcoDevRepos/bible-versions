His response is decisive, reflecting his understanding of leadership and accountability before God. This moment follows a divine judgment on Israel due to David's earlier census, which was against God's will. The king's reply signifies a turning point towards obedience and repentance.<p><b>&#8220;I insist on paying a price,</b><br>David's insistence on paying for the threshing floor highlights the principle of sacrificial giving. In the ancient Near Eastern context, offerings to deities were common, but David's determination to pay underscores the importance of personal sacrifice in worship. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where true worship involves personal cost and commitment (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>for I will not offer to the LORD my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing.&#8221;</b><br>David's statement reveals his deep reverence for God. Burnt offerings were a significant part of Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and dedication. By refusing to offer something that cost him nothing, David acknowledges that genuine worship requires personal sacrifice. This foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who gave Himself fully for humanity's redemption (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<p><b>So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</b><br>The purchase of the threshing floor, which later becomes the site of Solomon's Temple, is significant both historically and theologically. The location is Mount Moriah, where Abraham was tested with Isaac (Genesis 22), linking it to themes of faith and obedience. The transaction for fifty shekels of silver indicates a fair and deliberate exchange, emphasizing the value David placed on making things right with God. This act of purchasing the site for worship prefigures the establishment of a permanent place for God's presence among His people, ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who is the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his heart after God, who insists on paying for the threshing floor to offer a sacrifice to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/araunah.htm">Araunah</a></b><br>A Jebusite who owned the threshing floor that David desired to purchase for building an altar to the Lord.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/threshing_floor.htm">Threshing Floor</a></b><br>The location where David intended to build an altar to offer sacrifices to God, which later became the site of Solomon's Temple.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offerings.htm">Burnt Offerings</a></b><br>Sacrifices made to God, symbolizing atonement and dedication, which David insists must cost him something.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fifty_shekels_of_silver.htm">Fifty Shekels of Silver</a></b><br>The price David paid for the threshing floor and oxen, signifying his commitment to offering a meaningful sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_true_worship.htm">The Cost of True Worship</a></b><br>Worship that honors God often requires personal sacrifice and commitment.

In <a href="/1_chronicles/21-25.htm" title="So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.">1Chronicles 21:25</a>, it reads "six hundred shekels of gold by weight." One of the most ingenious propositions for the reconciliation of the two statements is that our text speaks of fifty shekels, not of silver but of money, and that Chronicles means that these were of gold, in value equal to 600 shekels of silver. But the explanation is quite inconsistent with the text in both places. In one of them the statement of price must have been altered in transcription. In the entire uncertainty as to the extent of the purchase of Araunah (the whole hill of Moriah, or only a part), and of the value of land in the locality and at the time, it is impossible to decide between the two.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24, 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</span> In <a href="/1_chronicles/21-25.htm">1 Chronicles 21:25</a>, "So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight." There is a superficial, but no real discrepancy between these two narratives. David gave the fifty shekels for the immediate use of the place, and for the oxen and implements. He had no idea at the time of permanently occupying it, and probably the note in the LXX., interpolated by scribes from the margin into the text, is true, "And Solomon added to the altar afterwards, for it was small at the first." It was a small altar hurriedly put together for the purpose of offering one sacrifice; and fifty shekels would be full compensation. But the sacrifice had hallowed the spot, and, when finally it was selected as the site for the temple, David bought the whole area and all that Araunah possessed there. Fifty shekels of silver would be about &pound;9; six hundred shekels of gold would be about &pound;1500; so that there is no comparison between the two sums. But the precious metals were worth very much more in David's time than in ours, so that the smaller sum was adequate compensation for David's first acquisition, while the larger implies the purchase of an extensive and valuable estate. Substantially the fuller narrative in Chronicles agrees with this. David refuses to sacrifice of that which cost him nothing, and must therefore have at once paid for what he took. But When God accepted his offering, and answered him by fire from heaven, then David said, "This is the house of the Lord God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel." And as the Chronicler has in view throughout the selection of the site for the temple, he naturally mentions its full cost. In the Book of Samuel this purpose is not expressly mentioned, and the narrative closes with the forgiveness of the sin both of David and his people. Jehovah was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed. But this sudden smiting down of so large a host humbled both king and people, and their eagerness for war and their lust of empire ceased. ?
