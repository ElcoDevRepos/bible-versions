Building an altar was a common practice for worship and seeking God's favor, as seen with Noah (<a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>) and Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). This act signifies repentance and dedication to God.<p><b>and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</b><br>Burnt offerings symbolized atonement and complete surrender to God, while peace offerings expressed thanksgiving and fellowship (Leviticus 1, 3). These offerings reflect David's desire for reconciliation with God and the restoration of peace between God and Israel. The dual offerings highlight the need for both atonement and communion with God.<p><b>Then the LORD answered the prayers on behalf of the land,</b><br>God's response to David's offerings and prayers demonstrates His mercy and willingness to forgive. This mirrors other instances where God relented from sending disaster in response to genuine repentance, such as in the story of Jonah and Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>). It underscores the power of intercessory prayer and God's readiness to restore His people.<p><b>and the plague upon Israel was halted.</b><br>The cessation of the plague signifies God's acceptance of David's repentance and offerings. This event parallels the Passover in Egypt, where the blood of the lamb spared the Israelites from the plague (<a href="/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>). It foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose atonement halts the spiritual plague of sin for believers (<a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who, after realizing his sin of conducting a census, seeks to make amends with God by building an altar and offering sacrifices.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel who responds to David's repentance and offerings by halting the plague on Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/araunah_the_jebusite.htm">Araunah the Jebusite</a></b><br>The owner of the threshing floor where David builds the altar.

<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s mercy is immediate and complete, turning a site of death into ground destined for the temple&#8212;a living testimony of grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/24-25.htm">2 Samuel 24:25</a> shows David moving from sinful self-reliance to obedient worship. By building an altar, offering atoning and fellowship sacrifices, and praying earnestly, he experiences God&#8217;s gracious answer: the plague stops. The verse teaches that genuine repentance expressed through obedient faith secures divine mercy and transforms judgment into blessing, pointing ultimately to the perfect atonement of Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Built there an altar.</span>--The parallel place in Chronicles states that the tabernacle "and the altar of burnt offering were at that season in the high place at Gibeon," and that David was afraid to go before it "because of the sword of the angel," <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the pestilence. It also mentions that when David "offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD," "He answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering." David then fixed upon this as "the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel" (<a href="/1_chronicles/22-1.htm" title="Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.">1Chronicles 22:1</a>).<p>Thus, with David's repentance and reconciliation to God after his second great sin closes this narrative and this book. David's reign and life were now substantially ended--a witness to all time of the power of Divine Grace over human infirmity and sin, of God's faithfulness and mercy to those that trust in Him, and of the triumph of an earnest and humble faith notwithstanding some very great and grievous falls.<p><span class= "bld">#define description=DESC<p>#define abbreviation=ABBR<p>#define comments=CMTS<p>#define version=3<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/24-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1444;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1448;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8033.htm">Strong's 8033: </a> </span><span class="str2">There, then, thither</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he built</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1462;&#1503;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#183;&#7687;en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
