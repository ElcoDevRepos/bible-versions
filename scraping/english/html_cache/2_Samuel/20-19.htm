The term "peaceable" suggests a community that values harmony and seeks to avoid conflict, aligning with the biblical ideal of living in peace with others (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>). "Faithful" indicates loyalty to God and His covenant, reflecting the importance of faithfulness in the life of Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>). The speaker identifies herself as part of a community that upholds these values, emphasizing the city's reputation for wisdom and counsel (<a href="/2_samuel/20-18.htm">2 Samuel 20:18</a>).<p><b>but you are trying to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel</b><br>The city is described as "a mother in Israel," indicating its significance and possibly its role as a center of wisdom and counsel. This metaphor suggests nurturing and foundational qualities, similar to how Jerusalem is later described as a mother (<a href="/galatians/4-26.htm">Galatians 4:26</a>). The destruction of such a city would be a significant loss to the nation, highlighting the gravity of Joab's actions. Historically, cities like Abel Beth Maacah were vital for their strategic locations and contributions to the cultural and spiritual life of Israel.<p><b>Why would you swallow up the LORD&#8217;s inheritance?&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "the LORD&#8217;s inheritance" refers to the people of Israel, whom God has chosen as His own (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-29.htm">Deuteronomy 9:29</a>). The rhetorical question challenges Joab's actions, implying that attacking the city would be an offense against God Himself. This reflects the biblical principle that God's people are His treasured possession (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>). The use of "swallow up" conveys a sense of complete destruction, warning against actions that would harm what God has established. This echoes the broader biblical theme of God's protection over His people and the land He has given them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wise_woman_of_abel.htm">The Wise Woman of Abel</a></b><br>A key figure in this passage, she is a wise and influential woman from the city of Abel Beth Maacah.

Compare <a href="/psalms/37-37.htm">Psalm 37:37</a>, where the blameless and upright are singled out for protection, and <a href="/1_samuel/26-23.htm">1 Samuel 26:23</a>, where David calls the LORD&#8217;s people &#8220;faithful.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Her gentle appeal echoes the principle of <a href="/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10&#8211;12</a>, which instructs Israel to offer peace before attacking even foreign cities. If God&#8217;s own people are inside the walls, how much more should negotiation be sought!<p>&#8226; The woman models <a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a> (&#8220;A gentle answer turns away wrath&#8221;) and anticipates our Lord&#8217;s blessing on peacemakers (<a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>). She stands as a reminder that quiet wisdom within the covenant can avert needless bloodshed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but you are trying to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;A city that is a mother in Israel&#8221; pictures Abel-beth-maacah as a nurturing center&#8212;much like Deborah, who was called &#8220;a mother in Israel&#8221; in <a href="/judges/5-7.htm">Judges 5:7</a>.<p>&#8226; Destroying such a city would rip away heritage, protection, and identity from surrounding towns, contradicting God&#8217;s concern for preserving His people&#8217;s well-being (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-19.htm">Deuteronomy 20:19&#8211;20</a>, which even protects fruit trees during war).<p>&#8226; Joab himself had once been confronted over needless slaughter (<a href="/2_samuel/2-26.htm">2 Samuel 2:26</a>); the wise woman reminds him that unchecked violence turns brother against brother and threatens the fabric of the nation.<p>&#8226; Her words reveal God&#8217;s heart: He values the preservation of life and the continued flourishing of communities that honor Him (<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why would you swallow up the LORD&#8217;s inheritance?</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The LORD&#8217;s inheritance&#8221; is a covenant term for Israel as God&#8217;s personal possession (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-9.htm">Deuteronomy 32:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/94-14.htm">Psalm 94:14</a>). To &#8220;swallow up&#8221; that inheritance is to oppose the very plan and promise of God.<p>&#8226; The woman gently shifts Joab&#8217;s focus from a military objective to a theological reality: every Israelite city belongs to God first. <a href="/1_samuel/26-19.htm">1 Samuel 26:19</a> carries the same warning when David asks why Saul is driving him &#8220;from sharing in the LORD&#8217;s inheritance.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Her question exposes the moral urgency of the moment. If Joab proceeds blindly, he risks sinning against the LORD, for whom he is supposed to fight (<a href="/2_samuel/20-20.htm">2 Samuel 20:20</a>).<p>&#8226; By raising the stakes to a covenant level, she moves Joab to negotiate: Abel will hand over Sheba, and the city will be spared (20:21-22). God&#8217;s inheritance is preserved through wise, peace-seeking dialogue.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/20-19.htm">2 Samuel 20:19</a> shows how a single voice of wisdom, anchored in covenant truths, can halt impending disaster. The woman identifies herself with the faithful, reminds Joab that Abel-beth-maacah is a nurturing &#8220;mother&#8221; within Israel, and frames any assault on her city as an assault on &#8220;the LORD&#8217;s inheritance.&#8221; Her appeal based on loyalty, community, and divine ownership persuades Joab to relent. The passage underscores God&#8217;s desire that His people be preserved through righteous, peace-oriented action rather than reckless violence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am one of them that are,</span> etc. The Authorized Version translates in this way, because, while "I" is singular, "peaceable" and "faithful" are plural. Really this construction shows that the woman speaks in the name of the city, and consequently the Authorized Version, while preserving the grammar, loses the sense.
