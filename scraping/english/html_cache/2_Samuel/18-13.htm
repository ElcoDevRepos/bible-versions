The context is the rebellion led by Absalom against his father, King David. The speaker, a soldier, is responding to Joab, David's military commander, who is frustrated by the soldier's refusal to kill Absalom. The soldier's concern for his own life highlights the seriousness of royal commands in ancient Israel, where disobedience could lead to severe punishment or death. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the cost of loyalty and obedience, as seen in other narratives such as Daniel's refusal to worship the king's statue (Daniel 3).<p><b>and nothing is hidden from the king&#8212;</b><br>This phrase underscores the belief in the king's omniscience, a common perception in ancient Near Eastern monarchies. It suggests that King David, as God's anointed, has a special insight or divine guidance that allows him to be aware of events within his kingdom. This belief is echoed in other parts of the Bible, such as when Nathan the prophet reveals David's sin with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 12). The phrase also implies the futility of attempting to conceal actions from a divinely appointed leader, paralleling the idea that nothing is hidden from God (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p><b>you would have abandoned me.&#8221;</b><br>The soldier's statement to Joab indicates a lack of trust in Joab's loyalty or protection. Historically, Joab is known for his ruthless pragmatism and willingness to act independently of David's wishes, as seen in his previous actions (<a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/20-10.htm">2 Samuel 20:10</a>). The soldier's fear of being abandoned reflects the political intrigue and shifting loyalties within David's court. This phrase also highlights the theme of betrayal and the precarious nature of human alliances, contrasting with the steadfast faithfulness of God, as seen in the covenant promises throughout Scripture (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>- The commander of King David's army, known for his military prowess and sometimes ruthless actions.

David had just ordered, &#8220;Deal gently with the young man Absalom for my sake&#8221; (v. 5). Disobeying a direct royal command carried the death penalty (see <a href="/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14-16</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/26-9.htm">1 Samuel 26:9</a>).<p>&#8226; In Scripture, those who refuse to strike the Lord&#8217;s anointed are commended (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>; 26:11), while those who take matters into their own hands suffer judgment (<a href="/2_samuel/4-11.htm">2 Samuel 4:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The soldier&#8217;s integrity outweighs Joab&#8217;s promised reward (v. 11; cf. <a href="/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>).

The soldier is certain David would learn the truth about Absalom&#8217;s death.<p>&#8226; The statement also hints at a deeper reality: nothing is hidden from the Lord (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>). A healthy fear of divine and royal scrutiny keeps the soldier from sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you would have abandoned me</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;you would have abandoned me.&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/18-13.htm">2 Samuel 18:13</a>)<p>&#8226; The soldier doesn&#8217;t trust Joab to protect him once David&#8217;s wrath ignites.

Contrast Jonathan, who stood by David even under threat (<a href="/1_samuel/20-30.htm">1 Samuel 20:30-34</a>).<p>&#8226; The soldier wisely avoids becoming a disposable pawn. <a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a> warns, &#8220;the companion of fools suffers harm.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>This verse captures a soldier&#8217;s refusal to violate the king&#8217;s explicit command.

Not only was the man faithful to the king, but he was perfectly aware of Joab's unscrupulous character. If only Absalom were put out of the way, Joab would have readily consented to the execution of the unimportant person who had been the means of gratifying his wish. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/18-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;w-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_176.htm">Strong's 176: </a> </span><span class="str2">Desire, if</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I had jeopardized</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my own life&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;nap&#772;&#183;&#353;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
