David, as king, relied on such messengers to stay informed about the state of his kingdom. This moment marks a pivotal point in David's reign, highlighting the importance of timely and accurate information. The use of messengers is also seen in other biblical narratives, such as the story of Joseph and his brothers (<a href="/genesis/37-32.htm">Genesis 37:32</a>) and the account of the spies sent by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2:1</a>).<p><b>The hearts of the men of Israel</b><br>The phrase "hearts of the men of Israel" indicates a shift in loyalty and allegiance. In biblical terms, the heart often represents the center of will and emotion. This shift suggests a deep-seated change in the people's support, which is significant given Israel's covenant relationship with God and their historical loyalty to David as God's anointed king. This change in allegiance can be compared to the Israelites' frequent turning away from God in the book of Judges.<p><b>are with Absalom</b><br>Absalom, David's son, had been strategically winning the favor of the people, as described earlier in <a href="/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15</a>. His actions reflect a calculated rebellion against his father, which is a fulfillment of Nathan's prophecy in <a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a> regarding the consequences of David's sin with Bathsheba. Absalom's rebellion can be seen as a type of antichrist figure, opposing God's anointed king, which foreshadows the ultimate rebellion against Christ. This phrase underscores the theme of division and the consequences of sin within a family and a nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, chosen by God, who is facing a rebellion led by his son Absalom.

Absalom has spent four years (<a href="/2_samuel/15-7.htm">2 Samuel 15:7</a>) quietly &#8220;stealing the hearts of the men of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/15-6.htm">2 Samuel 15:6</a>). The messenger arrives exactly when David needs to decide whether to stay or flee, underscoring God&#8217;s providence in the flow of events (cf. <a href="/esther/4-14.htm">Esther 4:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>).<p>&#8226; David is in Jerusalem, governing faithfully (<a href="/2_samuel/8-15.htm">2 Samuel 8:15</a>), yet he is still vulnerable. Scripture shows that even a king after God&#8217;s own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>) must stay alert to danger and depend on the Lord&#8217;s guidance (<a href="/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and reported,</b><p>&#8226; The Hebrew narrative often pivots on a report that forces a crisis moment (<a href="/genesis/45-26.htm">Genesis 45:26</a>; <a href="/joshua/2-2.htm">Joshua 2:2</a>). Here the messenger&#8217;s words become a turning point, moving David from calm rule to urgent flight.<p>&#8226; Honest reporting is a grace. <a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a> reminds us, &#8220;Faithful are the wounds of a friend,&#8221; and the messenger&#8217;s fidelity spares David from an ambush.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;The hearts of the men of Israel</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Hearts&#8221; in Scripture represent will, loyalty, and affection (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>). Absalom has captured not just opinions but emotions, indicating a deep shift in allegiance.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Men of Israel&#8221; suggests widespread national support, not a fringe movement. Earlier, the people&#8217;s hearts had been with David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-16.htm">1 Samuel 18:16</a>). The swing shows how rapidly public sentiment can change when charisma replaces character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are with Absalom.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Absalom&#8217;s slick charm (<a href="/2_samuel/14-25.htm">2 Samuel 14:25&#8211;26</a>) and strategic politicking at the city gate (<a href="/2_samuel/15-2.htm">2 Samuel 15:2&#8211;6</a>) result in mass defection. He offers false justice, promising, &#8220;If only someone would appoint me judge&#8230; I would ensure justice!&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/15-4.htm">2 Samuel 15:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement exposes spiritual drift. By siding with a rebel, Israel resists God&#8217;s anointed king (<a href="/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>). Yet God remains sovereign, later restoring David and disciplining Absalom (<a href="/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14&#8211;17</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, the verse warns against being swayed by personality over principle (<a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3</a>). Loyalty must align with the Lord&#8217;s chosen leadership, not the most attractive alternative.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/15-13.htm">2 Samuel 15:13</a> records the moment David learns that national loyalty has shifted to Absalom. A timely messenger delivers hard truth, revealing that Israel&#8217;s hearts&#8212;seat of their allegiance&#8212;have been won by a cunning rebel. The verse highlights God&#8217;s providence in warning David, the danger of superficial charisma, and the necessity of steadfast loyalty to God&#8217;s anointed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/15-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then a messenger</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mag&#183;g&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
