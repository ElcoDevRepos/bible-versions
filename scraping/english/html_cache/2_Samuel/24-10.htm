In the ancient Near East, censuses were often conducted for taxation or military purposes, indicating a shift in trust from divine provision to human resources. This act was contrary to the instructions given in <a href="/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12</a>, where a census required a ransom to avoid a plague, highlighting the seriousness of counting the people without divine sanction.<p><b>his conscience was stricken</b><br>David's conscience, or heart, being stricken indicates an immediate awareness of wrongdoing. This internal conviction is a testament to the work of the Holy Spirit, who convicts individuals of sin. The Hebrew word used here suggests a deep emotional and spiritual turmoil, reflecting David's sensitivity to God's standards and his own moral failure.<p><b>and he said to the LORD</b><br>David's response to his conviction is to turn to the LORD in prayer. This demonstrates the biblical principle of confession and repentance. Throughout the Psalms, David models a heart that seeks God in times of trouble, showing that true repentance involves direct communication with God (Psalm 51).<p><b>&#8220;I have sinned greatly in what I have done.</b><br>David acknowledges the gravity of his sin, which is a crucial step in repentance. The use of "greatly" emphasizes the seriousness of his actions. This mirrors other instances in Scripture where leaders confess their sins, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24</a> with Saul, but unlike Saul, David's confession is genuine and heartfelt.<p><b>Now, O LORD, I beg You to take away the iniquity of Your servant,</b><br>David's plea for forgiveness highlights the concept of divine mercy. The term "iniquity" refers to the moral corruption and guilt associated with sin. David's request for God to "take away" his iniquity reflects the sacrificial system where sin is atoned for and removed, pointing forward to the ultimate atonement through Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>for I have acted very foolishly.&#8221;</b><br>David's admission of foolishness underscores the biblical theme that true wisdom comes from fearing the LORD (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). His acknowledgment of folly contrasts with the wisdom he is known for, illustrating that even the wisest can fall into sin. This confession is a reminder of human frailty and the need for divine guidance and forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who ordered the census of the troops, later realizing his sin and seeking God's forgiveness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whom David addresses in repentance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/census_of_the_troops.htm">Census of the Troops</a></b><br>The event where David ordered a count of the fighting men in Israel and Judah, which was against God's will.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/conscience.htm">Conscience</a></b><br>David's inner sense of right and wrong, which convicted him of his sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/iniquity.htm">Iniquity</a></b><br>The sin or moral wrongdoing that David acknowledges before God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_weight_of_conscience.htm">The Weight of Conscience</a></b><br>David's conscience was stricken, reminding us that God has given us an inner moral compass.

The verse models genuine repentance: sensitivity to God&#8217;s voice, immediate honesty, and confidence that the LORD stands ready to remove iniquity when His servant turns back to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">David's heart smote him.</span>--This time David's own conscience was awakened, without the necessity of being roused, as in the case of Uriah, by the visit of a prophet. He confesses his sin, and prays for pardon. Still it must be remembered that ten months had passed (<a href="/2_samuel/24-8.htm" title="So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.">2Samuel 24:8</a>) before David saw his sin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David's heart smote him.</span> It appears from <a href="/1_chronicles/27-24.htm">1 Chronicles 27:24</a> that the census was not completed, and, though Joab had visited Judah, he had not even begun to enrol the names of the men of the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-6.htm">1 Chronicles 21:6</a>). It appears also that the displeasure of God was manifesting itself before David repented (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-7.htm">1 Chronicles 21:7</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/27-24.htm">1 Chronicles 27:24</a>). Some sign of this, either in public trouble, or in the brooding of the pestilential miasma over the land, brought home to David's mind the conviction of sin; and he at once humbled himself before God, for the vanity of mind which had engendered in him a wicked lust after martial glory and thirst for bloodshed. <span class="cmt_word">I have done very foolishly</span> (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13</a>;
