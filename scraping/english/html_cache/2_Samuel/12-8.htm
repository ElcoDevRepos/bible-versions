In ancient Near Eastern culture, the transfer of a king's house to his successor was a sign of divine favor and legitimacy. The "house" here symbolizes Saul's royal authority and possessions. David's rise to power was orchestrated by God, who anointed him as king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). This transfer signifies God's sovereign choice and the fulfillment of His promise to David.<p><b>and your master&#8217;s wives into your arms</b><br>In the context of ancient Israel, the taking of a predecessor's wives was a political act that signified the transfer of kingship and authority. While there is no biblical record of David taking Saul's wives, this phrase underscores the completeness of the transfer of Saul's royal privileges to David. It highlights the cultural practice of consolidating power and the divine endorsement of David's rule.<p><b>I gave you the house of Israel and Judah</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unification of the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah under David's reign. Historically, this unification was significant as it established a centralized monarchy and strengthened the nation. Theologically, it reflects God's covenantal promise to establish David's throne (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). This unification prefigures the ultimate unity found in Christ, who reconciles all believers into one body (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<p><b>and if that was not enough, I would have given you even more</b><br>This statement reveals God's abundant generosity and willingness to bless David beyond measure. It underscores the principle that God is a provider who desires to give good gifts to His people (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). Theologically, it points to the limitless nature of God's grace and foreshadows the ultimate gift of salvation through Jesus Christ, who offers life abundantly (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).

The Lord Himself moved him &#8220;from the pasture&#8230; to be ruler over My people Israel&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and your master&#8217;s wives into your arms.</b><p>&#8226; In the ancient Near East, inheriting a predecessor&#8217;s harem signified full succession to the throne (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/3-7.htm">2 Samuel 3:7</a>; 12:11).<p>&#8226; God is not commending polygamy; He is stating historical fact&#8212;David now possessed everything that had belonged to Saul, even the royal concubines.<p>&#8226; The gesture displayed total transfer of royal privilege and security, yet it also amplified David&#8217;s accountability; abundance leaves no excuse for coveting another man&#8217;s wife (<a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I gave you the house of Israel and Judah,</b><p>&#8226; After years of civil tension, God united both northern Israel and southern Judah under David (<a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-5</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/11-1.htm">1 Chronicles 11:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;house&#8221; here means the entire nation&#8212;tribes, armies, elders, resources.<p>&#8226; David ruled a kingdom that God Himself had knit together, fulfilling promises made to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-6.htm">Genesis 17:6</a>) and to David personally (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and if that was not enough, I would have given you even more.</b><p>&#8226; The Lord exposes the depth of His generosity: limitless blessing was available had David continued in obedience (<a href="/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>; <a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s sin with Bathsheba and murder of Uriah (<a href="/bsb/2_samuel/11.htm">2 Samuel 11</a>) sprang not from lack but from discontent.<p>&#8226; The line highlights God&#8217;s fatherly heart&#8212;ready to supply beyond measure&#8212;while simultaneously revealing the folly of grasping for what He has forbidden (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>; <a href="/matthew/7-11.htm">Matthew 7:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/12-8.htm">2 Samuel 12:8</a> is God&#8217;s personal ledger of generosity toward David: He handed him Saul&#8217;s estate, royal wives, a unified kingdom, and stood willing to pour out even more. The verse magnifies two truths: the Lord is the sole source of every good gift, and sin is never the product of unmet need but of hearts that turn from God&#8217;s sufficiency to self-seeking desire.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Thy master's wives.</span>--In <a href="/context/2_samuel/12-7.htm" title="And Nathan said to David, You are the man. Thus said the LORD God of Israel, I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul;">2Samuel 12:7-8</a> the prophet enumerates the chief favours and blessings shown to David, and these are so brought out as to show not only his base ingratitude, but also the unreasonableness of this particular sin. We are told of only one wife of Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/14-50.htm" title="And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.">1Samuel 14:50</a>) and of one concubine (<a href="/2_samuel/3-7.htm" title="And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?">2Samuel 3:7</a>) who was taken by Abner. If he had others, David certainly could not have taken them until more than seven and a half years after Saul's death. The prophet refers to the Oriental custom that the new king had a right to the harem of his predecessor.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I gave... thy master's wives into thy bosom.</span> These words probably mean that, as the whole possessions of his predecessor belonged, by Oriental custom, to the next occupant of the throne, David might have claimed the entire household and the wives both of Saul and Ishbosbeth as his own, though apparently he had not done so. As far as we know, Saul had but one wife (<a href="/1_samuel/14-50.htm">1 Samuel 14:50</a>) and one concubine, Rizpah (<a href="/2_samuel/3-7.htm">2 Samuel 3:7</a>). Of Ishbosheth's family arrangements we know little, but his harem, if he had one, would become the property of David. But independently of this, the permission of polygamy had made it possible for him to take any of the daughters of Israel and Judah to wife, and he had freely availed himself of this licence. Yet, not content, he had lusted after a married woman, and had got rid of her husband by murder, meanly using the sword of the Ammonites to accomplish his own criminal purpose. The word used in this clause, and rendered "thou hast slain him," is a very strong one, and literally means "thou hast murdered him," though the sword was that of the enemy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/12-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I gave</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;et&#183;t&#601;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
