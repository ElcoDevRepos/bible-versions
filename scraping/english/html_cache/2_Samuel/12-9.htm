The word "despised" indicates a deep disrespect and disregard for God's authority and commandments. In the context of ancient Israel, the king was expected to uphold God's law as a model for the people. David's actions were not just personal failings but a public violation of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>, where rebellion against God's command is equated with idolatry. The phrase "doing evil in His sight" underscores the omniscience of God, who sees all actions and intentions, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>.<p><b>You put Uriah the Hittite to the sword and took his wife as your own.</b><br>This part of the verse recounts David's specific sins: the murder of Uriah and the taking of Bathsheba. Uriah, though a Hittite, was a loyal soldier in David's army, highlighting the betrayal involved. The act of taking another man's wife was a direct violation of the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13-14</a>). The cultural context of the time placed a high value on loyalty and honor among warriors, making David's actions even more egregious. This incident foreshadows the consequences of sin and the unraveling of David's household, as prophesied later in <a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>.<p><b>You have slain him with the sword of the Ammonites.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the indirect method David used to ensure Uriah's death, manipulating the ongoing conflict with the Ammonites to achieve his ends. The Ammonites were long-standing enemies of Israel, and using them as instruments of murder added a layer of treachery to David's sin. This reflects the deceitful nature of sin, as described in <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>, where desire leads to sin, and sin, when full-grown, leads to death. The use of the Ammonites' sword also serves as a grim reminder of the consequences of David's actions, as violence and strife would later plague his own family.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, chosen by God, who committed adultery with Bathsheba and orchestrated the murder of her husband, Uriah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan.htm">Nathan</a></b><br>The prophet sent by God to confront David about his sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/uriah_the_hittite.htm">Uriah the Hittite</a></b><br>A loyal soldier in David's army and the husband of Bathsheba, whom David had killed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The wife of Uriah, with whom David committed adultery.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ammonites.htm">The Ammonites</a></b><br>A people group at war with Israel, whose battle was used by David as a cover for Uriah's murder.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>David's actions remind us that sin is a serious offense against God, not just a personal failing.

To scoff at them is to scoff at Him (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s sins violated at least two Ten Commandments&#8212;&#8220;You shall not commit adultery&#8221; and &#8220;You shall not murder&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13-14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-17.htm">Deuteronomy 5:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; God sees everything done in secret (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>), so the king&#8217;s palace walls offered no cover.<p>&#8226; David later acknowledges this perspective: &#8220;Against You, You only, have I sinned and done what is evil in Your sight&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>).<p>Sin is never merely horizontal; it is first and foremost vertical. Nathan&#8217;s words remind us that personal evil is ultimately an affront to a holy God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You put Uriah the Hittite to the sword and took his wife as your own.</b><p>Nathan now names the specific deeds. By spelling them out, he prevents David from hiding behind vague remorse.<p>&#8226; David engineered Uriah&#8217;s death through battlefield maneuvering (<a href="/2_samuel/11-15.htm">2 Samuel 11:15-17</a>). Premeditation makes the guilt unmistakable (<a href="/numbers/35-20.htm">Numbers 35:20-21</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Took his wife&#8221; highlights theft as well as adultery (<a href="/2_samuel/11-4.htm">2 Samuel 11:4</a>). Like Ahab seizing Naboth&#8217;s vineyard (<a href="/1_kings/21-1.htm">1 Kings 21:1-16</a>), David abused royal power for personal pleasure.<p>&#8226; Scripture often links sexual sin and violence because both spring from selfish desire (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>). David&#8217;s lust escalated to murder once thwarted by Uriah&#8217;s integrity.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s standard for kings demanded the protection&#8212;not exploitation&#8212;of subjects (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3-4</a>). David inverted that mandate.<p>The prophet&#8217;s blunt wording forces David to see his sin through God&#8217;s eyes, stripping away excuses and exposing the full sequence&#8212;from covetous glance to fatal command.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You have slain him with the sword of the Ammonites.</b><p>Though Ammonite soldiers physically killed Uriah, God holds David responsible.<p>&#8226; Delegating sin does not dilute guilt (<a href="/isaiah/10-15.htm">Isaiah 10:15</a>; <a href="/romans/2-3.htm">Romans 2:3</a>). David&#8217;s pen may have signed the order, but God reads motives behind the ink.<p>&#8226; By using the enemy&#8217;s sword, David tried to mask murder as a war casualty. Yet God uncovers even the cleverest cover-ups (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The instrument of sin often becomes the instrument of judgment. &#8220;The sword will never depart from your house&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10</a>) mirrors &#8220;the sword of the Ammonites.&#8221; What David wielded against Uriah would hound his own family&#8212;Amnon, Absalom, Adonijah.<p>&#8226; <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a> echoes Nathan centuries later: &#8220;God is not mocked; whatever a man sows, this he will also reap.&#8221;<p>Sin&#8217;s concealed methods cannot escape divine notice, and its consequences frequently return in kind.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Nathan&#8217;s threefold indictment shows that <a href="/2_samuel/12-9.htm">2 Samuel 12:9</a> is God&#8217;s verdict on deliberate, layered rebellion:<p>&#8226; David despised God&#8217;s word, rejecting its authority.<p>&#8226; He committed adultery and orchestrated murder, abusing his kingly trust.<p>&#8226; He hid behind others&#8217; swords, yet God pierced the disguise and held him fully accountable.<p>The verse warns that no position, plan, or pretense can shield a believer from God&#8217;s all-seeing justice. Yet it also sets the stage for grace: once David confessed (<a href="/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>; <a href="/bsb/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>), God forgave, though the temporal consequences remained.
