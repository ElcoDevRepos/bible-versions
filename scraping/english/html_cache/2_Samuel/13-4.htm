This highlights the role of advisors and confidants in royal courts, often influencing decisions and actions. The presence of Jonadab, who is described as shrewd, sets the stage for the unfolding events, emphasizing the importance of counsel in biblical narratives.<p><b>&#8220;Why are you, the son of the king,</b><br>Amnon's status as the son of King David is significant. As the firstborn, he is the heir apparent, which adds weight to his actions and decisions. This phrase underscores the expectations and pressures faced by royal offspring, as well as the privileges and responsibilities that come with such a position.<p><b>so depressed morning after morning?</b><br>Amnon's persistent depression suggests a deep internal struggle. In biblical times, emotional states were often linked to spiritual or moral conditions. This ongoing sadness indicates a conflict that is not just personal but also moral, setting the stage for the moral and ethical dilemmas that follow.<p><b>Won&#8217;t you tell me?&#8221;</b><br>Jonadab's probing question reflects the importance of communication and transparency in relationships. It also foreshadows the manipulation and deceit that will occur, as Jonadab's inquiry is not merely out of concern but also a prelude to his involvement in Amnon's plans.<p><b>Amnon replied,</b><br>Amnon's response marks a turning point in the narrative. His willingness to confide in Jonadab reveals the trust he places in him, which will later have significant consequences. This moment of confession is pivotal, as it exposes the desires that drive the subsequent actions.<p><b>&#8220;I am in love with Tamar,</b><br>Amnon's declaration of love for Tamar is complex. In the biblical context, love often encompasses a range of emotions and intentions, from genuine affection to lustful desire. The use of "love" here is ironic, as it foreshadows the tragic events that result from Amnon's misguided and sinful desires.<p><b>my brother Absalom&#8217;s sister.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights the familial relationships involved, emphasizing the incestuous nature of Amnon's desire. Tamar is not only Amnon's half-sister but also Absalom's full sister, which complicates the dynamics and heightens the tension. The mention of Absalom foreshadows his later actions and the ensuing family conflict, which will have far-reaching implications for David's household and the kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amnon.htm">Amnon</a></b><br>The eldest son of King David, who becomes infatuated with his half-sister Tamar.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tamar.htm">Tamar</a></b><br>The beautiful sister of Absalom and half-sister to Amnon, who becomes the object of Amnon's illicit desire.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>Tamar's full brother, who later avenges the wrong done to his sister.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonadab.htm">Jonadab</a></b><br>A cousin to Amnon and a shrewd advisor, who questions Amnon about his distress and later gives him advice on how to act on his desires.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The father of Amnon, Tamar, and Absalom, whose family is torn apart by these events.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/guard_your_heart.htm">Guard Your Heart</a></b><br>Amnon's unchecked desires led to devastating consequences.

Scripture presents this as a real moment between two historical figures, underscoring how the Lord often lets caring relatives or friends see what is hidden (cf. <a href="/genesis/4-9.htm">Genesis 4:9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/27-17.htm">Proverbs 27:17</a>).<p>&#8226; God uses relationships to bring hidden struggles into the light.<p>&#8226; The initiative here is not idle curiosity; it highlights accountability within family (<a href="/leviticus/19-17.htm">Leviticus 19:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Why are you, the son of the king, so depressed morning after morning?"</b><p>Jonadab emphasizes Amnon&#8217;s royal privilege. By framing the question around Amnon&#8217;s high position, the text shows how sin disregards status (cf. <a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm">1 Kings 11:4</a>; <a href="/james/1-9.htm">James 1:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Persistent grief signals a deeper spiritual problem (<a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Even the king&#8217;s son can sink into misery when desires turn disordered.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Won&#8217;t you tell me?"</b><p>A direct invitation to confess. The narrative affirms that openness is the path God provides for help (<a href="/psalms/142-2.htm">Psalm 142:2</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Jonadab&#8217;s request models the probing of conscience.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word encourages transparent speech to prevent sin from festering (<a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Amnon replied</b><p>Amnon finally speaks, illustrating that unspoken lust often becomes vocal before it turns to action (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Confession without repentance is possible; the coming verses show Amnon sought gratification, not purity.<p>&#8226; The reply reveals the power of honest words to expose a heart&#8217;s true state (<a href="/luke/6-45.htm">Luke 6:45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"I am in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom&#8217;s sister."</b><p>Amnon names his obsession. The literal phrase exposes two layers of violation: Tamar is both his half-sister and Absalom&#8217;s full sister, making the desire doubly forbidden (<a href="/leviticus/18-9.htm">Leviticus 18:9, 11</a>).<p>&#8226; What Amnon calls &#8220;love&#8221; is lust; biblical love seeks another&#8217;s good (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; The family identifier &#8220;my brother Absalom&#8217;s sister&#8221; reminds readers how personal sin fractures wider relationships (<a href="/genesis/37-4.htm">Genesis 37:4</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/13-22.htm">2 Samuel 13:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement foreshadows tragic fallout: Absalom&#8217;s vengeance and national turmoil (<a href="/2_samuel/13-28.htm">2 Samuel 13:28-29</a>; 14:24).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/13-4.htm">2 Samuel 13:4</a> captures a private exchange that lays bare a prince&#8217;s hidden lust. Jonadab&#8217;s probing question shows God&#8217;s provision of accountability, while Amnon&#8217;s answer exposes the destructive power of unchecked desire. The verse teaches that rank cannot shield a person from the consequences of sin, that confession must lead to repentance, and that what one calls &#8220;love&#8221; must be measured by God&#8217;s clear moral standard.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why art thou, being the king's son, lean?</span> The Hebrew is, <span class="accented">Why, O son of the king, dost thou pine away morning by morning</span>?
