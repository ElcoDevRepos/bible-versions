His role highlights the political and military power he wielded during this transitional period in Israel's history. Abner was also Saul's cousin, which may have contributed to his loyalty to Saul's house. His actions in this verse set the stage for the ensuing conflict between the house of Saul and the house of David.

Abner's decision to make Ish-bosheth king indicates a strategic move to maintain the Saulide dynasty and counter David's claim to the throne.

The choice of Mahanaim reflects the geographical and political considerations of the time, as it was a fortified city that offered protection and a base for operations.

Abner was therefore the cousin-german of Saul, and had been made by him the commander in chief of his army (<a href="/1_samuel/14-51.htm" title="And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.">1Samuel 14:51</a>). He was thus, both by kindred and office, strongly attached to the house of Saul. He had been with Saul in his pursuit of David, and may have resented David's address to him on that occasion (<a href="/context/1_samuel/26-14.htm" title="And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answer you not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who are you that cry to the king?">1Samuel 26:14-16</a>). There is no statement of the time that had elapsed after the death of Saul before Ish-bosheth was set up as king by Abner, but it was probably four or five years, for the following reasons: Ish-bosheth reigned only two years (<a href="/2_samuel/2-10.htm" title="Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.">2Samuel 2:10</a>), but David appears to have been acknowledged as king over all Israel soon after his death, and had then reigned over Judah alone seven and a half years. Again, at the death of Saul all the northern part of the country was under the control of the Philistines, and some time must have elapsed before the Israelites would have been in condition to make themselves a new king; and, finally, Ish-bosheth was the youngest of Saul's sons, born apparently some time after he came to the throne, and he was now forty years old (<a href="/2_samuel/2-10.htm" title="Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.">2Samuel 2:10</a>), Saul himself having reigned about forty years (<a href="/acts/13-21.htm" title="And afterward they desired a king: and God gave to them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty years.">Acts 13:21</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Abner</span>. This hero had been present at the battle of Gilboa, and probably had rallied many of the defeated Israelites, and made as much resistance as was possible to the onward march of the Philistines. And as soon as he had effected his retreat into the region beyond the Jordan, his power would be supreme. There was no one there to oppose the commander-in-chief of what remained of Saul's army. Certainly all that remained of Saul's body guard of three thousand men would gather round Abner, and as the Philistines did not push their pursuit further than the Jordan, he was free to do as he chose. Nor would there be any opposition. Abner was bound to do his best for Saul's family, and the people would feel this, and approve of his conduct in standing up for the children of their king. Moreover, David by his conduct had made himself an object of suspicion to all the valiant men who had formed Saul's army, and these would be the more embittered against him by their defeat. <span class="cmt_word">Ishbosheth</span>. This name signifies "man of shame," that is, "man of the shameful thing," the idol. Originally he was named Eshbaal (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/9-39.htm">1 Chronicles 9:39</a>), that is "man of Baal," the word <span class="accented">esh</span> being merely a dialectic variation for <span class="accented">ish</span>, equivalent to "man." At this early date Baal was not the specific name of any idol, but simply meant "lord," "master," "husband." In the earlier books of the Bible we find the word used of many local deities, who were lords of this or that, but had nothing in common with the Phoenician Baal, whose worship Ahab attempted to introduce into Israel. From that time Baal became a term of reproach, and Bosheth, "the shame," was substituted for it in the old names of which it had formed part. Thus Gideon is still called Jerubbaal in <a href="/1_samuel/12-11.htm">1 Samuel 12:11</a>, but the title is transformed into Jerubbesheth, or more correctly, Jerubbosheth, "let the shame plead," in <a href="/2_samuel/11-21.htm">2 Samuel 11:21</a>. Originally, therefore, the name Ishbaal had no discreditable meaning, but signified, "man of the Lord," or, as Ewald supposes, "lordly man." It was not till long afterwards, when Israel had been horrified by Jezebel's doings, that Baal, except in the sense of "husband," became an ill-omened word. Jonathan, whose own name, "Jehovah's gift," in Greek Theodore, is proof sufficient that Saul's family were worshippers of the true God, called his son's name Meribbaal, "the Lord's strife" (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-34.htm">1 Chronicles 8:34</a>). In some strange way this was altered into Mephibosheth, that is, "from the face of the shameful thing" (ch. 2 Samuel 4:4. etc.). Possibly it is a corruption of Meribbosheth, but it is remarkable that a son of Saul by his concubine Rizpah also bore the name (<a href="/2_samuel/21-8.htm">2 Samuel 21:8</a>). Among the ancestors of Saul, the simple name Baal, "Lord," occurs (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-30.htm">1 Chronicles 8:30</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Mahanaim</span>. Abner chose this town because it was on the eastern side of the Jordan, and so beyond the range of the Philistines, who never seem to have crossed the river. It was situated on the borders of the tribe of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, from both of which valiant warriors had joined David; but the people generally were not ill affected to the house of Saul. As having been assigned to the Levites (<a href="/joshua/21-38.htm">Joshua 21:38</a>), it had a quasi-religious character, inherited from the vision of angels seen there by Jacob (<a href="/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>). As a safe, out of the way place, David subsequently took refuge there (<a href="/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24</a>).
