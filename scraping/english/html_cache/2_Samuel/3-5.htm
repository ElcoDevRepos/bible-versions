The name Ithream means "abundance of people" or "advantage of the people," which may reflect the growing strength and influence of David's house. The listing of David's sons in this passage highlights the political alliances and familial ties that were significant in ancient Israelite society. Each son represented a potential heir and a connection to different tribes or influential families.<p><b>by David&#8217;s wife Eglah</b><br>Eglah is mentioned as one of David's wives, though little else is known about her from the biblical text. The inclusion of her name signifies her importance in the royal lineage, as each wife of David contributed to the expansion of his dynasty. The practice of polygamy was common among ancient Near Eastern kings, often used to secure political alliances and strengthen the king's position. Eglah's mention here underscores the complex family dynamics and the potential for rivalry among David's sons, which later plays a significant role in the narrative of David's reign.<p><b>These sons were born to David in Hebron</b><br>Hebron was a significant city in the history of Israel, serving as David's capital for seven and a half years before he moved his throne to Jerusalem. It was a city of refuge and a Levitical city, rich in patriarchal history as the burial place of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The birth of David's sons in Hebron marks the beginning of his consolidation of power and the establishment of his rule over Judah. This period in Hebron was crucial for David as he built alliances and strengthened his claim to the throne of all Israel. The mention of Hebron also connects David's reign to the promises made to the patriarchs, emphasizing the fulfillment of God's covenant through David's lineage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>- The anointed king of Israel, who is in the process of consolidating his rule over the nation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebron.htm">Hebron</a></b><br>- The city where David reigned as king over Judah for seven and a half years before becoming king over all Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahinoam.htm">Ahinoam</a></b><br>- One of David's wives, the mother of Amnon, David's firstborn.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/abigail.htm">Abigail</a></b><br>- Another of David's wives, the widow of Nabal, and the mother of Chileab.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/maacah.htm">Maacah</a></b><br>- The daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur, and the mother of Absalom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_family_dynamics.htm">The Importance of Family Dynamics</a></b><br>Understanding the family dynamics in David's life helps us see the impact of personal relationships on leadership and governance.

That quiet presence reminds us that every child, whether prominent or little-known, is known to God.<p>&#8226; The order of birth here matters: later conflicts among David&#8217;s sons&#8212;Amnon&#8217;s sin (<a href="/bsb/2_samuel/13.htm">2 Samuel 13</a>), Absalom&#8217;s rebellion (<a href="/bsb/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15-18</a>), Adonijah&#8217;s grasp for the throne (<a href="/bsb/1_kings/1.htm">1 Kings 1-2</a>)&#8212;all hinge on seniority. Recording Ithream&#8217;s birth secures the historical line and vindicates Scripture&#8217;s accuracy.<p>&#8226; Six often signals incompleteness in Scripture (<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31-2</a>:2). By stopping at six in Hebron, the text hints that David&#8217;s family&#8212;and reign&#8212;are still unfinished until God moves him to Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by David&#8217;s wife Eglah.</b><p>&#8226; Eglah is singled out as &#8220;wife,&#8221; just as earlier wives are named (Michal, Abigail, Ahinoam, Maacah, Haggith). The wording affirms covenant marriage rather than concubinage (compare <a href="/2_samuel/5-13.htm">2 Samuel 5:13</a>).<p>&#8226; God never endorses polygamy, yet He records it truthfully. David&#8217;s multiple marriages reflect human weakness (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>), but God still weaves His redemptive plan through flawed people.<p>&#8226; Listing Eglah prevents any claim that Ithream was illegitimate. In a time of dynastic struggle between Saul&#8217;s house and David&#8217;s (<a href="/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1</a>), every legitimate heir counts toward the promise that &#8220;a dynasty will be established for you&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Though Eglah plays no later role, her inclusion honors the women who bore and nurtured the next generation&#8212;echoing how Scripture later praises Bathsheba&#8217;s influence on Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/2-19.htm">1 Kings 2:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>These sons were born to David in Hebron.</b><p>&#8226; Hebron was David&#8217;s base for seven and a half years (<a href="/2_samuel/2-11.htm">2 Samuel 2:11</a>), before Jerusalem became the capital. The note stamps authenticity on the chronology; later births occur only after the move (<a href="/2_samuel/5-13.htm">2 Samuel 5:13-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Hebron itself is rich with covenant history: Abraham built an altar there (<a href="/genesis/13-18.htm">Genesis 13:18</a>), the patriarchs are buried there (<a href="/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29-31</a>), and Caleb claimed it by faith (<a href="/joshua/14-13.htm">Joshua 14:13-15</a>). By giving David sons in Hebron, God signals continuity with those earlier promises.<p>&#8226; In the middle of civil war (<a href="/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1</a>), the peaceful birth of sons shows that God is securing David&#8217;s house even while enemies oppose him&#8212;an echo of <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, &#8220;You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase also brackets this entire unit (<a href="/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2-5</a>), reminding readers that every detail fits God&#8217;s unfolding plan: the Messiah will ultimately descend from David, and every recorded birth supports that unbroken line (<a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The brief statement, &#8220;and his sixth was Ithream, by David&#8217;s wife Eglah. These sons were born to David in Hebron,&#8221; does more than log names&#8212;it quietly showcases God&#8217;s faithfulness. It completes the initial list of heirs, confirms their legitimacy, anchors them in Hebron&#8217;s covenant setting, and assures us that even amid human imperfection and national turmoil, the Lord is steadily building the house of David for His redemptive purposes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/3-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and his sixth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ha&#353;&#183;&#353;i&#353;&#183;&#353;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
