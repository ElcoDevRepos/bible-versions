In biblical literature, earthquakes often symbolize God's power and judgment (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>, <a href="/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a>). The shaking of the earth signifies a theophany, a visible manifestation of God to humans, emphasizing His sovereignty over creation. This imagery is consistent with other Old Testament passages where natural phenomena accompany divine revelation or judgment.<p><b>the foundations of the heavens trembled;</b><br>The "foundations of the heavens" is a poetic expression indicating the very structure of the cosmos being affected. This phrase suggests that God's anger and power are so immense that they reach beyond the earthly realm into the heavens. In ancient Near Eastern cosmology, the heavens were seen as a solid dome over the earth, and their trembling signifies a cosmic disturbance. This imagery is echoed in prophetic literature, such as <a href="/isaiah/13-13.htm">Isaiah 13:13</a>, where cosmic upheaval accompanies divine judgment.<p><b>they were shaken because He burned with anger.</b><br>God's anger here is depicted as a consuming force that causes the natural world to react violently. This anthropomorphic description of God "burning with anger" conveys His intense displeasure and righteous indignation, often in response to sin or injustice. The shaking of the earth and heavens serves as a metaphor for the upheaval that God's judgment brings. This concept is seen throughout Scripture, where God's wrath leads to both physical and spiritual consequences (<a href="/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5-6</a>, <a href="/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12-14</a>). The passage reflects the seriousness of divine judgment and the ultimate authority of God over all creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this song of praise, David is reflecting on God's deliverance from his enemies and from the hand of Saul.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, whose power and righteous anger are depicted through the imagery of an earthquake.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/earthquake.htm">Earthquake</a></b><br>A metaphorical or literal event symbolizing God's mighty intervention and judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavens.htm">Heavens</a></b><br>Representing the divine realm, their trembling signifies the cosmic impact of God's actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/anger_of_god.htm">Anger of God</a></b><br>A righteous response to sin and injustice, demonstrating His holiness and justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>The shaking of the earth and heavens illustrates God's supreme authority over creation.

The passage anchors our confidence that the God who once shook the earth for David still rules every realm and will one day shake all things again&#8212;leaving an unshakable kingdom for His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Of heaven.</span>--Psalms 18, "of the hills." The thought is the same, but the strong poetic figure by which the mountains are spoken of as "the pillars of heaven" (comp. <a href="/job/26-11.htm" title="The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.">Job 26:11</a>) is softened in the psalm.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-10.</span> - <p><span class="accented">"And the earth quaked and trembled;<br />The foundations of the heavens shook,<br />And quaked because he was wroth.<br />A smoke went up in his nostril,</span> <p><span class="accented">And fire out of his mouth devoured;<br />Red hot cinders burned from him.<br />And he bowed the heavens and came down,<br />And darkness was under his feet."</span> In describing the manifestation of God for his deliverance, David bore in mind and repeated the description of God's descent to earth given in <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16, 18</a>. But the poetic vigour of David's imagination intensities the imagery, and makes it more grand and startling. Not merely is there the earthquake and the volcano and the storm cloud, but the dim form of the Almighty is present, with the smoke of just anger at unrighteousness ascending from his nostrils, and the lightnings flashing forth to execute his wrath. But David certainly intended that these metaphors should remain ideal; and it was quite unnecessary for the Targum carefully to eliminate all such expressions as seem to give the Almighty bureau shape. In so doing it merely changes poetry into prose. But even more dull and commonplace is the explanation given by some modern commentators, that all that is meant is that David was once saved by a thunderstorm from some danger or other. Really this glorious imagery, taken from all that is grandest on earth, is intended to magnify to us the spiritual conception of God's justice coming forth to visit the earth and do right and equity. In ver. 8 for "the foundations of the heavens," we find in <a href="/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7</a> "the foundations of the hills." The former is the grander metaphor, and signifies the mighty mountain ranges, like those of Lebanon, on which the skies seem to rest. <span class="cmt_word">The smoke</span> signifies hailstorms and, perhaps, also the rain driven in wreaths along the ground by the wind. <span class="cmt_word">Red hot cinders burned from him</span> describes the flashing lightnings that were shot forth like the coals from the refiner's furnace when heated to the full. It is to be regretted that the Revised Version retains the bathos of the old rendering, that God's fiery breath set coals on fire. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/22-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the earth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1428;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
