His name means "man of shame," which may reflect the ignominy of his reign. He was not the first choice for kingship, as his brother Jonathan was the heir apparent, but Jonathan's death in battle left Ish-bosheth as the next in line. His ascension to the throne was orchestrated by Abner, Saul's military commander, indicating a lack of personal authority or leadership.<p><b>was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel</b><br>At forty, Ish-bosheth was relatively mature for a new king, suggesting he had ample time to observe his father's reign and learn from it. However, his lack of experience in leadership and military matters, compared to David, was a significant disadvantage. The age also implies that he was born during Saul's early years as king, providing a timeline for Saul's reign.<p><b>and he reigned for two years</b><br>Ish-bosheth's reign was short and marked by instability. The brevity of his rule highlights the division within Israel and the lack of support he had compared to David. His reign was primarily limited to the northern tribes, as the southern tribe of Judah had already declared allegiance to David. This division foreshadows the eventual split of the united monarchy into the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah.<p><b>The house of Judah, however, followed David</b><br>Judah's loyalty to David underscores the tribal divisions within Israel. David, being from the tribe of Judah, had strong support from his kinsmen, which was crucial in establishing his rule. This allegiance also fulfilled God's promise to David, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>, where David was anointed by Samuel.

Abner elevates forty-year-old Ish-bosheth to preserve Saul&#8217;s line, yet his two-year reign exposes the futility of opposing God&#8217;s declared choice. Meanwhile, Judah&#8217;s faithful recognition of David aligns with divine promise and sets the stage for a united monarchy under a covenant king. The verse invites readers to trust God&#8217;s sovereign appointments and remain loyal to His revealed will.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ishbosheth...two years ... David... seven years and six months</span>. Where are we to place the five years and a half of difference? The usual assumption is that David was made King of Israel immediately upon Ishbosheth's murder; but this is wrong. We cannot believe that Abner would allow so long a period as five years to elapse before asserting the claims of Saul's family, especially as David was already made King of Judah at Hebron. Still, as the war with the Philistines was the first object of his care, and as some form of popular ratification was necessary, some months may have passed before Ishbosheth was publicly installed as king, though Abner must have acted in his name from the first. The main interval of five years before David's accession must have been after Ishbosheth's death. That murder, and still more so the murder of Abner, must have made David an object of great suspicion to all Israel. Shimei, when he called him "a bloody man" (<a href="/2_samuel/16-8.htm">2 Samuel 16:8</a>), was but uttering a slander commonly current among the people. Gradually most of them would become convinced of his innocence; and all, as they contrasted the anarchy which prevailed in their country with the peace and security won by David for Judah, would regard his election as the best course under the circumstances. As the Philistines immediately resented their action, and endeavoured to crush the king before he could concentrate his power, it is probable that during these five years they had again obtained practical command of the more fertile districts of Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">Ishbosheth... was forty years old.</span> In the previous narrative Jonathan always appears as the most important of Saul's sons, and naturally it is assumed that he was the firstborn; yet his child was but five years old at his father's death, while Ishbosheth, his uncle, a younger brother of Jonathan, is described as a man of forty. Some think that Ishbosheth was the eldest son, but in <a href="/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a> he is placed last, and, though a weak man, was not so feeble as to have been set aside from the succession. But confessedly the chronology of Saul's reign is so full of difficulties, that it is impossible altogether to explain it (see note on 1 Samuel 13:1). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/2-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Saul&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Ish-bosheth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#333;&#183;&#353;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_378.htm">Strong's 378: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ish-bosheth -- 'man of shame', a son of Saul and king of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was forty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;b&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_705.htm">Strong's 705: </a> </span><span class="str2">Forty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">years old</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when he began to reign</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1493;&#1465;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;m&#257;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
