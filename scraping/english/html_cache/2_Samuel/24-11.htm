In the context of <a href="/2_samuel/24.htm">2 Samuel 24</a>, David is dealing with the consequences of his actions from the previous day, specifically the census he ordered. Mornings in biblical times were often associated with prayer and seeking God's guidance, as seen in <a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>, where David himself speaks of directing his prayer to God in the morning.<p><b>the word of the LORD had come</b><br>This phrase signifies divine communication, a common occurrence in the Old Testament where God speaks to His people through prophets. The "word of the LORD" is authoritative and carries the weight of divine instruction or judgment. In this context, it is a message of both judgment and mercy, as God provides David with options for the consequences of his sin. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God&#8217;s justice and mercy, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>.<p><b>to Gad the prophet</b><br>Gad is identified as a prophet, a role that involves receiving and delivering messages from God. Prophets were crucial in guiding the kings of Israel, providing divine insight and correction. Gad's role here is significant as he serves as a mediator between God and David. Gad is mentioned earlier in <a href="/1_samuel/22-5.htm">1 Samuel 22:5</a>, where he advises David during his time in the wilderness, indicating his long-standing relationship with David.<p><b>David&#8217;s seer</b><br>The term "seer" is an older designation for a prophet, emphasizing the visionary aspect of their role. Seers were known for their ability to perceive divine visions and communicate them to others. This term highlights Gad's specific role in David's life, providing personal guidance and insight. The use of "seer" connects to other biblical figures like Samuel, who is also referred to as a seer in <a href="/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9</a>, underscoring the continuity of prophetic ministry in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his heart after God, but also for his human failings.

Disobedience can lead to severe consequences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophets.htm">The Role of Prophets</a></b><br>Gad's role as a seer highlights the importance of listening to God's messengers. God often uses others to speak truth into our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>David's response to God's judgment shows the power of repentance. When we acknowledge our sins and turn back to God, He is faithful to restore us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_guidance.htm">Divine Guidance</a></b><br>The passage underscores the necessity of seeking God's guidance in all decisions. We should prioritize His will over our own plans.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_pride.htm">The Consequences of Pride</a></b><br>David's census was rooted in pride and self-reliance.

God does not delay; His mercies and corrections arrive with the new day (<a href="/psalms/30-5.htm">Psalm 30:5</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-23.htm">Lamentations 3:23</a>).<p>- Mornings in Scripture often mark turning points: Abraham receives covenant assurance at dawn (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>), and the women discover the empty tomb &#8220;very early&#8221; (<a href="/mark/16-2.htm">Mark 16:2</a>). Here, dawn signals that God is already at work to address David&#8217;s sin and guide Israel forward.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the word of the LORD</b><p>- This phrase underscores divine initiative; revelation begins with God, not man (<a href="/genesis/15-1.htm">Genesis 15:1</a>; <a href="/1_kings/17-2.htm">1 Kings 17:2</a>).<p>- The &#8220;word&#8221; is living, decisive, and perfectly authoritative (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>). David&#8217;s kingship is subject to that word, reminding us that no leader is above Scripture&#8217;s judgment or comfort (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7-11</a>).<p>- By sending a verbal message instead of immediate calamity, God shows both justice and grace: He gives David the terms of response before the final outcome unfolds.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>had come to Gad the prophet</b><p>- Gad first appears as David&#8217;s counselor in exile (<a href="/1_samuel/22-5.htm">1 Samuel 22:5</a>). Years later, he remains God&#8217;s chosen mouthpiece, proving the continuity of faithful ministry.<p>- God could have spoken directly to David, yet He honors the prophetic office (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>). This protects the king and the nation from subjective impressions; objective prophecy anchors them to God&#8217;s declared will.<p>- The arrival of God&#8217;s word through Gad also emphasizes communal accountability. Leaders need godly voices around them, a principle echoed in <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>David&#8217;s seer</b><p>- Calling Gad &#8220;David&#8217;s seer&#8221; highlights a personal, trusted relationship. David kept a prophet close, valuing spiritual counsel in both triumphs and failures (cf. Nathan in <a href="/bsb/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12</a>).<p>- The term &#8220;seer&#8221; stresses spiritual sight&#8212;Gad perceives realities David cannot. Similar partnerships appear with Samuel and Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/9-19.htm">1 Samuel 9:19</a>) or Isaiah and Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/19-1.htm">2 Kings 19:1-6</a>).<p>- Holding this role, Gad delivers options of judgment (<a href="/2_samuel/24-12.htm">2 Samuel 24:12-13</a>), guiding David toward repentance and ultimately to the site where the temple will be built (<a href="/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>). God uses the seer to transform crisis into redemptive purpose.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/24-11.htm">2 Samuel 24:11</a> shows God&#8217;s swift, gracious response to David&#8217;s sin: at first light, His authoritative word reaches David through a trusted prophet. Dawn symbolizes renewed mercies; the &#8220;word of the LORD&#8221; asserts divine authority; Gad&#8217;s prophetic role safeguards truth; and the title &#8220;David&#8217;s seer&#8221; underscores the necessity of godly counsel. Together, these elements reveal a God who confronts sin, directs His people, and weaves redemption even out of failure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1l) <span class= "bld">For when David.</span>--Read, <span class= "ital">and when. </span>There is no suggestion in the original, as seems to be implied in the English, that David's repentance was in consequence of the visit of Gad; on the contrary, it was in consequence of his repentance and confession that the prophet was sent to him.<p><span class= "bld">The prophet Gad.</span>--This prophet has not been mentioned since his warning to David to return from the land of Moab (<a href="/1_samuel/22-5.htm" title="And the prophet Gad said to David, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get you into the land of Judah.
