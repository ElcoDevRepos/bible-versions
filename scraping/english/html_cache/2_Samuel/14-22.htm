Joab, as a military commander, demonstrates his loyalty and reverence for King David by this act. This gesture is reminiscent of other biblical instances where individuals show submission to authority, such as in <a href="/genesis/18-2.htm">Genesis 18:2</a> when Abraham bows before the three visitors. Joab's action signifies his acknowledgment of David's authority and his gratitude for the king's decision.<p><b>&#8220;Today,&#8221; said Joab, &#8220;your servant knows that he has found favor in your eyes, my lord the king,</b><br>Finding favor in the eyes of a king was crucial for survival and success in the ancient world. Joab's statement reflects the importance of royal favor, which often determined one's position and influence. This phrase echoes similar sentiments found in <a href="/genesis/39-4.htm">Genesis 39:4</a>, where Joseph finds favor in the eyes of Potiphar. Joab's use of "your servant" underscores his role and relationship to David, emphasizing humility and dependence on the king's goodwill.<p><b>because the king has granted his request.&#8221;</b><br>Joab's request, which involved the return of Absalom to Jerusalem, was a politically sensitive issue. By granting this request, David not only shows leniency but also navigates the complex dynamics of family and kingdom politics. This decision reflects David's struggle to balance justice and mercy, a theme prevalent throughout his reign. The granting of requests by a king can be seen in other biblical narratives, such as <a href="/esther/5-6.htm">Esther 5:6</a>, where King Xerxes offers to grant Esther's petition.

Literal, historical, and instructive, <a href="/2_samuel/14-22.htm">2 Samuel 14:22</a> teaches that honor, gratitude, and confidence naturally flow from hearts that experience the kindness of their sovereign.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.</span> Keil concludes from this that Joab had often interceded for Absalom's pardon, and that this had made the king suspect him of being the prime mover in the affair. But this is to force the meaning, Joab now stood confessed as the person who had brought the woman before the king, and had employed her to gain a hearing. Had he been allowed to plead freely, her intervention would not have been necessary. We have seen, too, that the king's suspicions have been made in the Authorized Version much stronger than they really were. Many commentators also assume that Joab had a friendship for Absalom, but there are few traces of it in his conduct, and more probably Joab was chiefly influenced by politic motives. It was injurious to the well being of the nation that there should be discord and enmity between the king and his eldest son, and that the latter should be living in exile. The K'ri, <span class="accented">thy <span class="cmt_word"></span>servant</span>, placed in the margin, is to be decidedly rejected, with all other attempts of the Massorites to remove little roughnesses of grammar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/14-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Joab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1448;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3097.htm">Strong's 3097: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joab -- 'the LORD is father', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">fell</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1465;&#1500;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yip&#183;p&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
