Joab, the commander of David's army, is leading the siege. The Ammonites, known for their hostility towards Israel, are defending their city. This battle is part of a larger campaign against the Ammonites, which began in <a href="/2_samuel/10.htm">2 Samuel 10</a>. The mention of Joab highlights his role as a key military leader, often tasked with executing David's military strategies.<p><b>some of David&#8217;s servants fell</b><br>This indicates that the battle was fierce and resulted in casualties among David's troops. The term "servants" refers to soldiers loyal to King David, emphasizing the personal loss to the king. The narrative underscores the cost of war and the human toll it takes, even on the victorious side. This loss foreshadows the personal consequences David will face due to his actions surrounding this event.<p><b>and Uriah the Hittite also died</b><br>Uriah's death is central to the narrative, as it is the culmination of David's plan to cover up his adultery with Bathsheba, Uriah's wife. Uriah, though a Hittite, is portrayed as a loyal and honorable soldier in David's army, highlighting the tragedy of his death. His inclusion among the fallen serves as a moral indictment of David's actions. Uriah's loyalty contrasts sharply with David's betrayal, and his death sets the stage for the subsequent judgment pronounced by the prophet Nathan in <a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12</a>.
