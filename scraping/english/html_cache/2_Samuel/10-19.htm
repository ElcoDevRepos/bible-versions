Hadadezer was a powerful ruler who had previously expanded his territory. The mention of "all the kings" indicates a significant alliance, suggesting Hadadezer's influence and the threat he posed to Israel. This coalition reflects the common practice in the ancient Near East of forming alliances for mutual defense and aggression.<p><b>saw that they had been defeated by Israel</b><br>The defeat by Israel highlights the military prowess of King David and his army. This victory is part of a series of military campaigns that established Israel as a dominant power in the region. The phrase underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to David of giving him victory over his enemies (<a href="/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6, 14</a>). It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God fighting for Israel and granting them success against formidable foes.<p><b>they made peace with Israel and became subject to them</b><br>The making of peace and becoming subject indicates a shift in power dynamics. These kings, once adversaries, now recognize Israel's dominance and submit to its authority. This submission often involved paying tribute, providing military support, or acknowledging Israel's sovereignty. This outcome aligns with the Deuteronomic promise that Israel would be the head and not the tail (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-13.htm">Deuteronomy 28:13</a>) if they obeyed God.<p><b>So the Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore</b><br>The Arameans' fear signifies a strategic withdrawal from supporting the Ammonites, who were also enemies of Israel. This fear is a direct result of witnessing Israel's military strength and God's favor upon David. The cessation of support to the Ammonites further isolates them, demonstrating the effectiveness of David's campaigns in neutralizing threats. This phrase also illustrates the broader biblical principle of God instilling fear in Israel's enemies (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hadadezer.htm">Hadadezer</a></b><br>A king of Zobah, a region in Aram (modern-day Syria), who was a powerful adversary of Israel.
