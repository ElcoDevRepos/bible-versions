The Jordan River is a significant geographical marker in Israel's history, symbolizing transitions and new beginnings, such as the Israelites entering the Promised Land (Joshua 3-4). Barzillai's willingness to accompany David, even for a short distance, demonstrates his dedication despite his advanced age. This act of service can be seen as a type of Christ's servanthood, where Jesus humbly served others (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>).<p><b>why should the king repay me with such a reward?</b><br>Barzillai's question underscores his selflessness and contentment, contrasting with the human tendency to seek rewards for service. This reflects the biblical principle of serving without expectation of earthly reward, as seen in Jesus' teachings on humility and service (<a href="/matthew/6.htm">Matthew 6:1-4</a>). Barzillai's attitude can be compared to the parable of the unworthy servants (<a href="/luke/17-7.htm">Luke 17:7-10</a>), emphasizing that service to God and His anointed should be its own reward. This also foreshadows the ultimate reward believers receive in Christ, not based on works but on grace (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/barzillai_the_gileadite.htm">Barzillai the Gileadite</a></b><br>An elderly and wealthy man from Rogelim who supported King David during Absalom's rebellion by providing him with supplies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, returning to Jerusalem after the defeat of Absalom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>A significant geographical landmark in Israel, symbolizing transition and change, as David crosses it to return to his kingdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom's_rebellion.htm">Absalom's Rebellion</a></b><br>A pivotal event where David's son, Absalom, attempted to usurp the throne, leading to David's temporary exile.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rogelim.htm">Rogelim</a></b><br>The hometown of Barzillai, located in Gilead, east of the Jordan River.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_service.htm">Humility in Service</a></b><br>Barzillai's willingness to serve without seeking reward exemplifies true humility.

Barzillai&#8217;s final crossing with David pictures a faithful life finishing well (<a href="/acts/20-24.htm">Acts 20:24</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminds us that even small acts done for the King matter (<a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>why should the king repay me</b><p>&#8226; Barzillai declines repayment, illustrating generosity without expectation (<a href="/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>; <a href="/luke/6-35.htm">Luke 6:35</a>).<p>&#8226; His question reflects the heart that knows every good deed is already a privilege (<a href="/luke/17-10.htm">Luke 17:10</a>).<p>&#8226; He models contentment&#8212;preferring service to reward (<a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with such a reward?</b><p>&#8226; David&#8217;s offer of royal provision (<a href="/2_samuel/19-33.htm">2 Samuel 19:33</a>) symbolizes abundant grace, yet Barzillai seeks no earthly luxury. Similar to Moses choosing reproach with God&#8217;s people over palace pleasures (<a href="/hebrews/11-24.htm">Hebrews 11:24-26</a>).<p>&#8226; Barzillai entrusts the favor to Chimham (<a href="/2_samuel/19-37.htm">2 Samuel 19:37-38</a>), showing generational vision, much like Paul investing in Timothy (<a href="/2_timothy/2-2.htm">2 Timothy 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; His attitude encourages storing treasure in heaven rather than on earth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Barzillai&#8217;s words reveal a humble servant who gladly walks with God&#8217;s king, knows his limits, serves without craving payback, and values eternal reward over temporal honor.
