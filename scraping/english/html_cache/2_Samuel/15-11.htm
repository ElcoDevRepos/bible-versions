Jerusalem, being the political and spiritual center of Israel, suggests that these men were likely prominent figures or representatives of the city's leadership. The number "two hundred" can symbolize completeness or a large group, emphasizing the scale of Absalom's support. This gathering of men also foreshadows the division within Israel, as Absalom's rebellion would later lead to civil strife.<p><b>They had been invited as guests</b><br>The invitation of these men as guests suggests a social or political gathering, possibly under the guise of a feast or celebration. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, hospitality was a significant aspect of social interaction, and being invited as a guest implied trust and honor. This context indicates that Absalom was using cultural norms to mask his true intentions, which were to usurp the throne from his father, David. The use of hospitality for deceitful purposes is a recurring theme in the Bible, as seen in other narratives where trust is betrayed.<p><b>and they went along innocently,</b><br>The innocence of these men underscores their lack of awareness regarding Absalom's true intentions. This phrase highlights the deceptive nature of Absalom's actions, as he manipulated the situation to gain support without revealing his plans. The concept of innocence here can be contrasted with the cunning and deceit of Absalom, drawing a parallel to other biblical stories where the innocent are unwittingly caught in the schemes of the wicked. This also serves as a reminder of the importance of discernment and the potential consequences of being unaware of underlying motives.<p><b>for they knew nothing about the matter.</b><br>This final phrase emphasizes the complete ignorance of the men regarding Absalom's conspiracy. It reflects the secrecy and careful planning involved in Absalom's rebellion. The lack of knowledge among the men can be seen as a commentary on the nature of sin and deception, where individuals can be unwittingly drawn into wrongdoing. This situation also mirrors the broader biblical theme of hidden plots and the eventual revelation of truth, as seen in other narratives where God ultimately exposes deceit and upholds justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The son of King David, who is orchestrating a rebellion against his father to seize the throne of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_hundred_men.htm">Two Hundred Men</a></b><br>These men were from Jerusalem and accompanied Absalom without knowledge of his rebellious intentions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, where King David's reign is centered and from where the two hundred men were invited.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The reigning king of Israel, unaware of Absalom's conspiracy at this point.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebron.htm">Hebron</a></b><br>The place where Absalom declared himself king, initiating his rebellion against David.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_naivety.htm">The Danger of Naivety</a></b><br>The two hundred men followed Absalom innocently, highlighting the importance of discernment and understanding the full context before committing to a cause.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_subtlety_of_deception.htm">The Subtlety of Deception</a></b><br>Absalom's ability to deceive even those close to him serves as a reminder of the subtlety of sin and the need for vigilance in our spiritual lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_intentions.htm">The Importance of Intentions</a></b><br>While the men were innocent, their lack of awareness led them into a compromising situation.

This was not a handful of followers but a group large enough to lend public credibility to Absalom&#8217;s trip (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>, where David gathered &#8220;about four hundred men&#8221; to himself).<p>&#8226; Their origin&#8212;Jerusalem&#8212;matters. These men would naturally have been perceived as loyal to King David, making their presence with Absalom appear to be royal endorsement (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/15-10.htm">2 Samuel 15:10</a>, where Absalom&#8217;s conspiracy sought to steal &#8220;the hearts of the men of Israel&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The number also contrasts with later references to David&#8217;s own small band when he flees (<a href="/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a>), highlighting how quickly appearances can shift in political upheaval.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>accompanied Absalom</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Accompanied&#8221; points to more than casual travel; it implies public alignment. Similar language appears when Adonijah gathers supporters to bolster his claim to David&#8217;s throne (<a href="/1_kings/1-5.htm">1 Kings 1:5&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Absalom&#8217;s carefully choreographed procession mimicked royal protocol, creating the impression that the succession was already decided (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a>, &#8220;the conspiracy gained strength&#8221;).<p>&#8226; This was calculated persuasion: seeing others follow can pressure onlookers to join (cf. <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, &#8220;victory is won through many counselors&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They had been invited as guests</b><p>&#8226; The phrase frames the trip as a social event, not a military or political rally. Absalom exploited hospitality culture, where an invitation carried honor and obligation (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/9-13.htm">1 Samuel 9:13</a>; 16:3).<p>&#8226; Absalom had used the same tactic earlier when he invited&#8212;and murdered&#8212;Amnon at the sheep-shearing feast (<a href="/2_samuel/13-23.htm">2 Samuel 13:23&#8211;29</a>). He repackaged that strategy for a broader audience.<p>&#8226; Manipulating a feast to launch treachery foreshadows Judas&#8217;s misuse of the Passover table (<a href="/john/13-26.htm">John 13:26&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they went along innocently</b><p>&#8226; Scripture affirms their &#8220;innocence,&#8221; highlighting moral blamelessness, not political na&#239;vet&#233; alone. <a href="/psalms/26-1.htm">Psalm 26:1</a> echoes this stance: &#8220;I have walked in my integrity.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Their innocence magnifies Absalom&#8217;s guilt; the conspiracy relied on deceiving the upright (cf. <a href="/romans/16-18.htm">Romans 16:18</a>, &#8220;by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the na&#239;ve&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds believers to be &#8220;wise as serpents and innocent as doves&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>), balancing discernment with purity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for they knew nothing about the matter</b><p>&#8226; Ignorance, not complicity, explains their presence. Like Jehonadab joining Jehu&#8217;s chariot without grasping the bloodshed ahead (<a href="/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15</a>), these men were swept into events beyond their knowledge.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/3-17.htm">Acts 3:17</a> notes how leaders acted &#8220;in ignorance,&#8221; yet ignorance never excuses the instigator&#8212;only highlights his deception.<p>&#8226; The statement vindicates these men and implicitly warns readers: lack of awareness can entangle the unwary in sinful schemes (<a href="/proverbs/14-15.htm">Proverbs 14:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Absalom orchestrated a public spectacle that looked legitimate because two hundred respected Jerusalemites walked beside him. He won their presence through the cultural power of invitation, not honest disclosure. Their innocence and ignorance spotlight the prince&#8217;s calculated deceit and remind us how easily appearances can mask rebellion against God-ordained authority. Vigilant discernment, anchored in the clear teaching of Scripture, guards believers from being unwitting pawns in another&#8217;s unrighteous agenda.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Went in their simplicity.</span>--The two hundred guests whom Absalom had invited to take part with him in his sacrifices, were doubtless prominent and influential citizens of Jerusalem. That they were entirely ignorant of Absalom's purposes shows the extreme secrecy with which the affair was managed. Absalom, no doubt, hoped when he once had them at Hebron, to secure them for his side, or, failing this, forcibly to prevent their opposition. In any case it would appear to the people that they were with him, and he would thus secure additional prestige.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Two hundred men.</span> These, doubtless, were courtiers and men of rank, who were so accustomed to Absalom's love of display, that, when <span class="cmt_word">called</span>, that is, invited, they would go without suspicion. To Absalom their attendance was most important, not only because, being compromised, many would join him, and even all of them for a time be forced to yield obedience, but because they would make the people of Hebron suppose that Absalom had a powerful body of supporters at Jerusalem. It is quite possible that at Hebron, and generally in Judah, there was great discontent because David had left their tribe to choose a capital elsewhere, and because he did not show them any decided preference over the other tribes, whose good will he would rightly seek to conciliate. The existence of much jealousy between Judah and the ten tribes is plain from <a href="/2_samuel/19-41.htm">2 Samuel 19:41-43</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/15-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Two hundred</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1488;&#1514;&#1463;&#1444;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;&#7791;a&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - fd<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3967.htm">Strong's 3967: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hundred</span><br /><br /><span class="word">men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from Jerusalem</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1460;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;&#183;r&#363;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;lim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
