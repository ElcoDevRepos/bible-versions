The presence of a thousand men from Benjamin indicates a substantial support for David, despite the tribe's previous allegiance to Saul. This reflects a shift in loyalty and the unification of Israel under David's rule. The number "thousand" often symbolizes completeness or a large group in biblical terms, suggesting a significant representation from Benjamin.<p><b>as well as Ziba the steward of the house of Saul</b><br>Ziba was a servant of Saul's household, previously introduced in <a href="/2_samuel/9.htm">2 Samuel 9</a>, where he served Mephibosheth, Jonathan's son. His presence here signifies the continued influence and connections of Saul's house, even after Saul's death. Ziba's actions throughout the narrative reveal themes of loyalty and self-interest, as he previously misrepresented Mephibosheth to David.<p><b>and his fifteen sons and twenty servants</b><br>The mention of Ziba's sons and servants highlights his wealth and status. In ancient Israel, having many sons and servants was a sign of prosperity and influence. This detail underscores Ziba's importance and the resources he could mobilize, which would be significant in supporting David's return to power.<p><b>They rushed down to the Jordan before the king</b><br>The Jordan River was a significant geographical and symbolic boundary in Israel. Crossing it often marked a transition or new beginning, as seen in the Israelites' entry into the Promised Land (Joshua 3). The urgency in "rushed down" suggests eagerness and perhaps a desire to demonstrate loyalty to David before others could. This act of meeting the king at the Jordan symbolizes reconciliation and the restoration of David's kingship, echoing themes of renewal and divine favor.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, returning to Jerusalem after Absalom's rebellion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziba.htm">Ziba</a></b><br>The steward of Saul's household, who previously deceived David regarding Mephibosheth.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_benjamin.htm">Men of Benjamin</a></b><br>A group of a thousand men from the tribe of Benjamin, showing allegiance to David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jordan_river.htm">Jordan River</a></b><br>The geographical location where these events occur, symbolizing a crossing back into rightful rule.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fifteen_sons_and_twenty_servants_of_ziba.htm">Fifteen Sons and Twenty Servants of Ziba</a></b><br>They accompany Ziba, indicating his wealth and influence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/loyalty_and_allegiance.htm">Loyalty and Allegiance</a></b><br>The men of Benjamin and Ziba's household demonstrate loyalty to David.

Earlier, many Benjaminites had opposed David during Absalom&#8217;s revolt (<a href="/2_samuel/18-7.htm">2 Samuel 18:7</a>).

Earlier he slandered Mephibosheth to David during the flight from Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/16-1.htm">2 Samuel 16:1&#8211;4</a>).
