Sheba, identified as a "son of Bichri," is from the tribe of Benjamin, the same tribe as King Saul. This connection may suggest lingering tribal tensions and loyalties after Saul's death. The Benjamites had a history of conflict with other Israelite tribes, as seen in <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19-21</a>. Sheba's presence at this moment indicates a potential for division within the kingdom, as he is positioned to exploit dissatisfaction with David's rule.<p><b>and he blew the ram&#8217;s horn and shouted</b><br>The blowing of the ram's horn, or shofar, is significant in Israelite culture, often used to signal the start of a significant event, such as a call to arms or a proclamation. In this context, Sheba's use of the shofar is a call to rebellion, reminiscent of how the shofar was used in the conquest of Jericho (Joshua 6). This act is a public declaration of defiance against King David, aiming to rally support for his cause.<p><b>&#8220;We have no share in David, no inheritance in Jesse&#8217;s son.</b><br>This statement reflects a deep-seated discontent with David's leadership, emphasizing a rejection of his kingship. The reference to "Jesse's son" underscores David's humble origins, possibly used here to undermine his authority. This phrase echoes the earlier division between the northern tribes and Judah, seen in <a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>, when the northern tribes rejected Rehoboam, Solomon's son. It highlights the recurring theme of division and the fragility of the united monarchy.<p><b>Every man to his tent, O Israel!&#8221;</b><br>This phrase is a call for the Israelites to abandon David and return to their homes, effectively dissolving their allegiance to him. It is a rallying cry for independence and self-governance, similar to the cry in <a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a> during the division of the kingdom. The call to "every man to his tent" signifies a withdrawal from centralized authority, promoting tribal autonomy. This rebellion foreshadows the eventual split of the kingdom after Solomon's reign, illustrating the persistent challenges of unity among the tribes of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheba.htm">Sheba</a></b><br>A Benjamite described as a "wicked man" who instigates a rebellion against King David.

Most recent commentators consider it as a patronymic, <span class= "ital">the Bichrite, i.e., </span>of the family of Becher, the second son of Benjamin. He was, to this extent at least, of the same clan with Saul. He was <span class= "ital">there, </span>at Gilgal, with the representatives of the ten tribes, and took advantage of the dispute just mentioned to renew the rebellion of Absalom.<p><span class= "bld">Every man to his tents.</span>--Comp. the cry of Jeroboam as he inaugurated his rebellion (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm" title="So when all Israel saw that the king listened not to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to your own house, David. So Israel departed to their tents.">1Kings 12:16</a>). It was the signal of revolt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There happened to be there a man of Belial.</span> The fierce words of the men of Judah led to evil results. It was a time when all wise and thoughtful persons would have laboured for peace, and tried to soothe and appease the angry passions fomented by the late war. Instead of this, the men of Judah irritated the Israelites with insult and contumely, and the day, intended as one of rejoicing and of the restoration of David to his throne by common consent, saw the rebellion break forth afresh. Among those who had taken part in the discussion with Judah was Sheba, a man of Belial, that is, a worthless fellow, but possibly possessed of rank and influence; for, according to many commentators, <span class="accented">ben-Bichri</span> does not mean <span class="cmt_word">the son of Bichri,</span> but "a descendant of Becher," the second son of Benjamin (<a href="/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>), and possibly the representative of the mishpachah descended from him. But it is remarkable that this son of Benjamin disappears from the genealogies, and that no mishpachah of Bichrites is mentioned either in <a href="/numbers/26-38.htm">Numbers 26:38</a> or in <a href="/1_chronicles/8-1.htm">1 Chronicles 8:1</a>. In both places Ashbel, who is enumerated as the third son in <a href="/genesis/46-21.htm">Genesis 46:21</a>, takes the second place. We must be content, therefore, to leave this matter in uncertainty; but evidently Sheba had come with Shimei and Ziba to welcome David back, and, with the rest of the thousand Benjamites, had rushed with loud cries of welcome across the Jordan, and, but for this altercation, would have remained faithful. But tribal jealousies were always ready to break forth, and were a permanent source of weakness; and now, stung by some jibe at Benjamin, Sheba gave orders to a trumpeter to give the signal for the breaking up of the meeting, and, as is commonly the case in large and excited gatherings, the crowd obeyed the unauthorized dictation of one man. His words are contemptuous enough. David is no king, but a private person, and the son, not of a great chief, but of Jesse merely, a yeoman of Bethlehem. <span class="cmt_word">Every man to his tents.</span> "To his tent" meant "to his home" (see <a href="/2_samuel/18-17.htm">2 Samuel 18:17</a>). But this withdrawal home signified the rejection of David's government. Almost the same words are used in <a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/20-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now a worthless</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1431;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;l&#238;&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1100.htm">Strong's 1100: </a> </span><span class="str2">Without profit, worthlessness, destruction, wickedness </span><br /><br /><span class="word">man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">named</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1435;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
