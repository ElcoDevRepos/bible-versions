Zadok and Abiathar were loyal to King David during Absalom's rebellion. The mention of their sons highlights the importance of family loyalty and the role of the priesthood in supporting the king. Ahimaaz and Jonathan served as messengers, a critical role in the communication network during the rebellion. This reflects the trust David placed in the priestly families, as well as the strategic use of familial connections in political and military affairs. The presence of these young men also underscores the continuity of the priestly line and their involvement in the nation's leadership.<p><b>Send them to me with everything you hear.</b><br>David instructs that Ahimaaz and Jonathan be sent to him with information, indicating the urgency and importance of intelligence during the conflict with Absalom. This phrase underscores the necessity of reliable communication in times of crisis. The use of messengers was a common practice in ancient times, as it was the primary means of relaying information over distances. This directive also highlights David's strategic acumen and his reliance on trusted individuals to maintain his position. The phrase can be seen as a precursor to the role of the Holy Spirit in the New Testament, who conveys God's messages to believers.
