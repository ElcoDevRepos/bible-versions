Absalom, being the son of King David, would have had access to such animals. This detail highlights Absalom's royal status and the resources at his disposal during his rebellion against his father.<p><b>when he met the servants of David</b><br>The "servants of David" refers to the loyal soldiers and followers of King David. This encounter occurs during the battle in the forest of Ephraim, where David's forces are fighting against Absalom's rebellion. The meeting signifies a turning point in the conflict, as Absalom's forces are ultimately defeated.<p><b>and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak</b><br>The oak tree, or terebinth, is significant in biblical literature, often symbolizing strength and endurance. The forest setting is crucial, as it provides a natural trap for Absalom. The thick branches suggest a dense and potentially dangerous environment, which plays a role in Absalom's downfall.<p><b>Absalom&#8217;s head was caught fast in the tree</b><br>This phrase is pivotal, as it describes the moment of Absalom's entrapment. Absalom's long hair, which he took great pride in, is traditionally understood to be the cause of his entanglement. This detail is ironic, as his vanity and pride become the instruments of his demise. It also serves as a fulfillment of Nathan's prophecy to David that calamity would arise from within his own house (<a href="/2_samuel/12-11.htm">2 Samuel 12:11</a>).<p><b>The mule under him kept going</b><br>The mule's departure leaves Absalom vulnerable and helpless, suspended between heaven and earth. This imagery can be seen as symbolic of Absalom's spiritual and moral state&#8212;caught between his ambition and his rebellion against God's anointed king, David.<p><b>so that he was suspended in midair</b><br>Absalom's suspension in midair is a powerful image of judgment and helplessness. It foreshadows his impending death and serves as a visual representation of his separation from both earthly power and divine favor. This moment can be seen as a type of Christ, in that Absalom, like Jesus, is lifted up; however, unlike Christ, Absalom's lifting is not for salvation but for judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his handsome appearance and rebellious nature.

As he did so his head caught between the branches of a tree, his mule went from under him, and he hung there helpless. There is nothing said to support the common idea (which seems to have originated with Josephus), that he hung by his long hair, though this may doubtless have helped to entangle his head.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Absalom met the servants of David.</span> The verb means that he came upon them by chance. Evidently in the intricacies of the forest, Absalom. had lost his way, and, finding himself suddenly in damager of being captured by some of David's men, he urged his mule through a thicket, as the open ground was blocked by his pursuers. But in the attempt his head was jammed between the boughs of a great terebinth, and the mule, struggling onward, left him hanging in mid-air. Nothing is said about his hair having caused the accident, and apparently it was his neck which became fixed. Probably, too, he was half stunned by the blow, and choked by the pressure; and then his hair would make it very difficult for him to extricate himself. And so, after one or two efforts, in which he would be in danger of dislocating his neck, he would remain suspended to await his fate. Now, this adventure makes the whole affair perfectly plain. Absalom was riding his mule, evidently unprepared for battle. The chariot and horses, with fifty men as his body guard, used by him at Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15</a>:l), are nowhere near him. Chariots, of course, would have been useless on such rough ground, but Absalom would have had a picked body of young men round him in the battle; and mules were only for use on the march, and were sent into the rear when the fighting began. But the last thing that Absalom expected was that he should be attacked on the march. He was advancing with an army infinitely more numerous than that of David, and assumed that David would wait at Mahanaim, and, if he fought at all, would fight under its walls. His defeat he regarded as certain, and then the vain glorious prince and all Israel would drag the city into the nearest ravine. In this over confidence he was riding in advance of his army, which was struggling on over most difficult ground. For "rising as the country does suddenly from the deep valley of the Jordan, it is naturally along its whole western border deeply furrowed by the many streams which drain the district; and our ride," says Canon Tristram, "was up and down concealed glens, which we only perceived when on their brink, and mounting from which on the other side, a short canter soon brought us to the edge of the next" (Tristram, p. 462). Struggling along over such ground, Absalom's men were not merely tired and weary, but had lost all order, and "become a scattering," and probably Absalom had cantered on in order to find some suitable spot for reforming them. Suddenly he sees at a little distance before him one of the three detachments of David's army, which had marched out a few miles from Mahanaim, and posted themselves on some fit spot to attack the rebels on their march. Apparently they caught no glimpse of him, but he immediately became aware of the tactics of the king's generals, and discerned the extreme danger of his position. Everything depended upon celerity. If he could warn his men, the foremost would halt until the others came up, and a sufficient force be gathered to resist Joab's onslaught. There was no cowardice on his part, but simply the discharge of his duty as a general. He turns his mule round, and dashes away in order to halt and form his men, keeping to the wood that he may not be seen. In his great haste he is not careful in picking his route, and possibly his mule was stubborn, and swerved; and so, in attempting to force his way through the thicket, he is stunned by a blow from a branch of a terebinth tree, and so entangled in its boughs that he cannot free himself; and as none of David's men had seen him, he might have hung there to be the prey of the vultures, and only his riderless mule have been left to bear witness to his having met with some disaster. Meanwhile his followers struggle on, until they come upon David's men, who put them to the sword. There is no battle, but the three divisions, advancing in order, make merciless slaughter of their opponents. For some time Absalom's forces, extended over many miles of march, do not even learn what is going on in their front, and twenty thousand men had fallen before, becoming aware of their defeat, they fly in wild confusion, to lose more men in their panic than had fallen in fighting. Their loss would even have been greater had not Joab stopped the pursuit upon Absalom's death. But where was Amasa, and what was he doing? He had led his troops miserably, had taken no precautions against surprise, and did nothing to rally them. Had Absalom got back in safety to the van, he might have saved his men from so disastrous a defeat; but Amasa, doubtless a brave soldier, proved himself quite incompetent to the duties of a commander-in-chief, and no match for the sagacious Joab. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/18-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Absalom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1500;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7687;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;l&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_53.htm">Strong's 53: </a> </span><span class="str2">Absalom -- 'my father is peace', two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was riding</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1465;&#1499;&#1461;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7392.htm">Strong's 7392: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ride, to place upon, to despatch</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his mule</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1431;&#1512;&#1462;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(hap&#183;pe&#183;re&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
