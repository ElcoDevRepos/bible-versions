In the ancient Near Eastern culture, hospitality was a significant social practice, often used to build alliances or show favor. David's invitation might have seemed like an honor, but it was a manipulation. This reflects the complexity of human motives and the potential for misuse of power, a theme seen throughout the Bible, such as in the story of Saul and David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17-25</a>).<p><b>and he got Uriah drunk</b><br>Alcohol was commonly consumed in biblical times, often as a safer alternative to water. Here, David's intention was to impair Uriah's judgment, hoping he would go home to his wife, thus concealing David's sin. This act of getting Uriah drunk highlights the moral decline that can accompany attempts to cover sin, reminiscent of Noah's drunkenness (<a href="/genesis/9-21.htm">Genesis 9:21</a>) and its consequences. It underscores the biblical principle that sin often leads to further sin.<p><b>And in the evening Uriah went out to lie down on his cot with his master&#8217;s servants</b><br>Despite being intoxicated, Uriah's loyalty and sense of duty prevailed. His decision to sleep with the servants rather than go home demonstrates his integrity and commitment to his fellow soldiers, who were in battle. This contrasts sharply with David's actions and serves as a rebuke to the king's behavior. Uriah's actions echo the loyalty of Jonathan to David (<a href="/1_samuel/20-16.htm">1 Samuel 20:16-17</a>), highlighting the theme of faithfulness.<p><b>but he did not go home</b><br>Uriah's refusal to go home, even when drunk, underscores his dedication and honor. This decision is pivotal in the narrative, as it thwarts David's plan to cover up his sin. It also sets the stage for the subsequent tragic events. Uriah's integrity is a stark contrast to David's moral failure, emphasizing the biblical theme that righteousness often stands in opposition to worldly schemes. This moment foreshadows the ultimate exposure of sin, as seen in <a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>, "be sure your sin will find you out."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who orchestrates a plan to cover up his sin with Bathsheba by attempting to manipulate Uriah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/u/uriah_the_hittite.htm">Uriah the Hittite</a></b><br>A loyal soldier in David's army and the husband of Bathsheba, who remains faithful to his duties despite David's attempts to compromise him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events take place, serving as the political and spiritual center of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, she is central to the events as the woman with whom David committed adultery.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/david's_servants.htm">David's Servants</a></b><br>They are part of the royal household and witness to David's actions, highlighting the public nature of his sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_deceptive_nature_of_sin.htm">The Deceptive Nature of Sin</a></b><br>Sin often leads to further sin.

Earlier, the king had already failed to cover his sin when Uriah refused to go home (<a href="/2_samuel/11-8.htm">2 Samuel 11:8&#8211;11</a>). Now David shifts to hospitality as another tactic.<p>&#8226; Royal meals often communicated favor (<a href="/2_samuel/9-7.htm">2 Samuel 9:7</a>), but here the intent is deception rather than blessing, echoing the misuse of a meal in <a href="/genesis/27-17.htm">Genesis 27:17&#8211;25</a> when Jacob deceived Isaac.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s invitation contrasts sharply with the integrity Uriah had just displayed&#8212;an integrity David himself once prized (<a href="/1_samuel/26-23.htm">1 Samuel 26:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he got Uriah drunk.</b><p>The text shows deliberate manipulation: David &#8220;got Uriah drunk.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture plainly condemns causing another to stumble&#8212;<a href="/habakkuk/2-15.htm">Habakkuk 2:15</a> warns, &#8220;Woe to him who gives drink to his neighbor&#8230;.&#8221;<p>&#8226; David, who should have modeled righteousness, instead imitates the schemes of the wicked (<a href="/proverbs/23-20.htm">Proverbs 23:20&#8211;21</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment marks another step down the path <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14&#8211;15</a> describes: desire conceives, gives birth to sin, and sin when full-grown brings forth death.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And in the evening Uriah went out to lie down on his cot with his master&#8217;s servants</b><p>Even impaired, Uriah&#8217;s soldierly resolve holds.<p>&#8226; Earlier he had declared, &#8220;The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in tents&#8230; how could I go to my house?&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/11-11.htm">2 Samuel 11:11</a>). His actions now match his words, reflecting the unity and discipline expected of troops in the field (<a href="/1_samuel/14-23.htm">1 Samuel 14:23&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; Uriah&#8217;s choice highlights David&#8217;s lapse. The king remains in comfort and intrigue, while the foreign-born Hittite aligns himself with Israel&#8217;s covenant army&#8212;an echo of <a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16</a>, another Gentile displaying covenant loyalty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but he did not go home.</b><p>David&#8217;s scheme fails again. God quietly thwarts evil plans, even through the unsuspecting obedience of others (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; Uriah&#8217;s refusal magnifies David&#8217;s guilt; the righteous conduct of a subordinate exposes the sin of the ruler, much like Nathan&#8217;s parable will soon do (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse underscores <a href="/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a>: &#8220;He who walks in integrity walks securely, but he who perverts his ways will be found out.&#8221; David&#8217;s cover-up is unraveling because truth stands firm (<a href="/proverbs/12-19.htm">Proverbs 12:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/11-13.htm">2 Samuel 11:13</a> records a critical moment in David&#8217;s downward spiral. The king employs hospitality and alcohol to hide his adultery, yet Uriah&#8217;s steadfast loyalty frustrates the plan. Each phrase highlights a contrast: David&#8217;s calculated deceit versus Uriah&#8217;s unwavering integrity. The verse warns that sin never stays private; attempts to conceal it only compound the wrongdoing, while God continues to uphold righteousness and expose darkness in His perfect time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">He made him drunk.</span>--This fresh attempt of David to conceal his crime by attempting to send Uriah to his house while in a state of intoxication does not need comment, but Uriah's resolve was so strong that it still governed his conduct while in this almost irresponsible condition.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He made him drunk.</span> David thus adds sin to sin, and, in order to accomplish his vile end, he degrades the brave soldier whom already he had dishonoured. But even when intoxicated Uriah kept to his determination; and though on this second night there would not be the same pleasure in chatting with old comrades seen again after long absence, he still sleeps in the guard room. And thus there were witnesses that he had not gone to his house. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/11-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1431;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">invited</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;r&#257;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
