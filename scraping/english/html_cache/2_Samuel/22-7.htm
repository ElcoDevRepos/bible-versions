David, the author of this passage, often faced distress, whether from enemies, personal sin, or leadership challenges. This mirrors the human condition and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>I called upon the LORD</b><br>Calling upon the LORD signifies an act of faith and reliance on God. In the Old Testament, calling on the name of the LORD is a way of invoking His presence and power. This is seen throughout the Psalms and in the lives of the patriarchs, such as Abraham and Jacob, who built altars and called on God's name.<p><b>I cried out to my God</b><br>The repetition of calling and crying out emphasizes the urgency and desperation of David's plea. It also highlights a personal relationship with God, as David refers to Him as "my God." This personal connection is a key aspect of the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>And from His temple He heard my voice</b><br>The reference to God's temple, though it was not yet built in David's time, symbolizes God's dwelling place and His readiness to hear the prayers of His people. This anticipates the construction of the temple by Solomon and points to the heavenly temple where God resides. It also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of believers as the temple of the Holy Spirit.<p><b>and my cry for help reached His ears</b><br>This assures believers that God is attentive to their prayers. The imagery of God hearing emphasizes His responsiveness and compassion. It connects to other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>, which assures that the righteous cry out, and the LORD hears them. This also prefigures Christ, who intercedes for believers, ensuring their prayers reach the Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The author of this song of praise, David is reflecting on God's deliverance from his enemies and Saul.
