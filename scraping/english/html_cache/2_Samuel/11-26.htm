This highlights the gravity of David's sin, as Bathsheba was not just any woman but the wife of one of his loyal soldiers. The use of "heard" suggests the news was brought to her, possibly by a messenger, indicating the communication methods of the time. This moment marks a turning point in the narrative, as Bathsheba's life is about to change dramatically.<p><b>that her husband was dead,</b><br>Uriah's death was orchestrated by King David, who sent him to the front lines of battle to ensure he would be killed, as detailed earlier in the chapter. This act of treachery was a direct violation of the commandments against murder and adultery. Uriah's death is significant as it sets off a chain of events leading to David's confrontation with the prophet Nathan and the subsequent consequences for David's household. The mention of Uriah's death also serves as a reminder of the cost of sin and the misuse of power.<p><b>she mourned for him.</b><br>Mourning in ancient Israel was a deeply cultural and religious practice, often involving specific rituals such as wearing sackcloth, fasting, and lamentation. Bathsheba's mourning would have been expected and necessary to honor her husband, despite the circumstances of his death. This period of mourning also reflects the human aspect of the narrative, showing Bathsheba's grief and loss. It sets the stage for the subsequent events where David takes her as his wife, further complicating the moral and ethical dimensions of the story.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The wife of Uriah, who becomes a central figure in this account.

Having been the cause of his murder, she is careful to make for him the customary mourning. How long it lasted is uncertain. The mourning for Aaron (<a href="/numbers/20-29.htm">Numbers 20:29</a>) and that for Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-8.htm">Deuteronomy 34:8</a>) were each for thirty days; while that for Jacob at Atad (<a href="/genesis/50-10.htm">Genesis 50:10</a>) and that of the men of Jabesh-Gilead for Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/31-13.htm">1 Samuel 31:13</a>) lasted only for seven days. Both these, however, were under such exceptional circumstances as made them no rule; but in Ecclus. 22:12 we read, "Seven days do men mourn for him that is dead," and the national lamentation for Judith lasted the same time (Judith 16:24). Probably, however, the mourning of a widow for her husband would last a month. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/11-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Uriah&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1469;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#363;&#183;r&#238;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_223.htm">Strong's 223: </a> </span><span class="str2">Uriah -- 'flame of Yah', the name of a Hittite and of two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wife</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;&#353;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><br /><span class="word">heard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;ti&#353;&#183;ma&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
