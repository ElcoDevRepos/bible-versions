Joab, the commander of David's army, was known for his strategic mind and political maneuvering. This question indicates David's awareness of Joab's involvement in orchestrating the situation to bring Absalom back to Jerusalem. Joab's actions often reflect a pragmatic approach to maintaining stability in the kingdom, even if it involves manipulation.<p><b>The woman answered, &#8220;As surely as you live, my lord the king,</b><br>The woman's response begins with an oath, a common practice in ancient Israel to affirm the truthfulness of one's words. This phrase underscores the seriousness and sincerity of her reply, acknowledging the king's authority and the gravity of the situation. Oaths were significant in biblical times, often invoking God's name or the king's life as a guarantee of truth.<p><b>no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything that my lord the king says.</b><br>This phrase highlights the king's authority and the respect he commands. It reflects the cultural context where a king's word was law, and deviation from his commands was not tolerated. The imagery of not turning to the right or left suggests unwavering obedience and the expectation that the king's decisions are final and binding.<p><b>Yes, your servant Joab is the one who gave me orders;</b><br>The woman confirms Joab's involvement, acknowledging his role in directing her actions. Joab's position as a trusted military leader and advisor to David gave him significant influence. This admission reveals the hierarchical structure of the court, where servants and subordinates acted on the orders of those in power, reflecting the chain of command typical in monarchies.<p><b>he told your maidservant exactly what to say.</b><br>This statement indicates the premeditated nature of the woman's appeal to the king. Joab's instructions were precise, suggesting a carefully crafted plan to achieve a specific outcome. The use of "maidservant" emphasizes her role as a subordinate, acting under Joab's authority. This reflects the broader theme of agency and influence within the royal court, where individuals often acted as intermediaries to achieve political goals.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The ruler of Israel, known for his heart after God, but also for his personal and familial struggles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of David's army, known for his military prowess and political maneuvering.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wise_woman_of_tekoa.htm">The Wise Woman of Tekoa</a></b><br>A woman used by Joab to deliver a parable to King David, aiming to influence his decision regarding Absalom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, who was in exile after killing his brother Amnon.

David had seen the general drift of the woman's meaning, but she had involved it in too much obscurity for him to do more than suspect that she was the mouthpiece of Joab, who was standing by, and whose face may have given signs of a more than ordinary interest in the woman's narrative.
