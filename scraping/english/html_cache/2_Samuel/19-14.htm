Historically, Judah was David's own tribe, and he had previously reigned over them in Hebron before becoming king over all Israel. This connection likely facilitated his influence. The phrase suggests a unified response, indicating that David's appeal was compelling enough to overcome any lingering divisions or hesitations following Absalom's rebellion. This unity is reminiscent of the tribal loyalty seen in earlier biblical narratives, such as the support of the tribe of Judah for David in <a href="/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>.<p><b>as though they were one man</b><br>The expression "as though they were one man" emphasizes the complete and unanimous support David received from the tribe of Judah. This unity is significant in the context of ancient Israel, where tribal affiliations often led to divisions. The phrase echoes the unity seen in other biblical accounts, such as the Israelites' collective response to God's commands in <a href="/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3</a>. It also foreshadows the ideal of unity in the body of Christ, as described in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12</a>).<p><b>and they sent word to the king:</b><br>The act of sending word to David signifies a formal invitation and acknowledgment of his rightful place as king. This gesture was necessary to restore David's authority and re-establish his rule over the nation. In the cultural context of the time, such communication would have been a significant step in repairing the relationship between the king and his people, especially after the turmoil of Absalom's rebellion.<p><b>&#8220;Return, you and all your servants.&#8221;</b><br>The invitation for David to return, along with all his servants, underscores the desire for the restoration of the king's court and the re-establishment of order in the kingdom. This request reflects a recognition of David's legitimate kingship and a willingness to submit to his rule once more. The call for David's return can be seen as a type of Christ's return, where believers anticipate the return of the King to restore and reign in peace and justice, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a> and <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is in the process of returning to Jerusalem after the rebellion of his son Absalom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_judah.htm">Men of Judah</a></b><br>The tribe of Judah, who are being persuaded to bring King David back to Jerusalem.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>David's son, whose rebellion against his father has just been quashed, leading to David's return.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Israel, from which David had fled during Absalom's rebellion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebron.htm">Hebron</a></b><br>The city where Absalom initially declared himself king, and a significant location in the account of David's reign.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_leadership.htm">Unity in Leadership</a></b><br>The passage highlights the importance of unity under godly leadership.
