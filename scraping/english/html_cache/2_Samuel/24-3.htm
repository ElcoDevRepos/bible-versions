His role as a military leader gave him insight into the practical and spiritual implications of the king's decisions. Joab's relationship with David was complex, marked by loyalty but also tension, as seen in other instances such as <a href="/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14</a>.<p><b>&#8220;May the LORD your God multiply the troops a hundred times over</b><br>This phrase reflects a common biblical blessing, expressing a desire for God's abundant provision and favor. The multiplication of troops signifies strength and security, echoing promises of prosperity found in <a href="/deuteronomy/1-11.htm">Deuteronomy 1:11</a>. It underscores the belief that true increase and success come from divine blessing rather than human effort alone.<p><b>and may the eyes of my lord the king see it.</b><br>Joab wishes for David to witness God's blessing firsthand, emphasizing the king's role as a leader who benefits from divine favor. This reflects the biblical theme of leaders being accountable to God and the people, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/12-13.htm">1 Samuel 12:13-15</a>. It also highlights the importance of faith and patience in waiting for God's timing.<p><b>But why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?&#8221;</b><br>Joab questions David's motives, indicating his awareness of the potential spiritual and moral implications of conducting a census. In ancient Israel, censuses were often associated with military conscription or taxation, which could imply a lack of trust in God's provision. This echoes the warning in <a href="/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12</a> about the dangers of numbering the people without divine instruction.

His immediate objection signals that the king&#8217;s directive is spiritually suspect.<p>&#8226; The narrative backdrop shows that &#8220;the anger of the LORD burned against Israel&#8221; and He &#8220;incited David&#8221; to call for the census (<a href="/2_samuel/24-1.htm">2 Samuel 24:1</a>), yet Joab still recognizes human responsibility.<p>&#8226; Even a hardened warrior senses the danger of placing trust in numbers rather than in the Lord, echoing <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, &#8220;Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;May the LORD your God multiply the troops a hundred times over</b><p>&#8226; Joab blesses David, praying for exponential growth that only God can grant, recalling promises like <a href="/deuteronomy/1-11.htm">Deuteronomy 1:11</a> where Moses says, &#8220;May the LORD&#8230; increase you a thousand times.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By invoking divine multiplication, Joab highlights that Israel&#8217;s strength depends on the Lord, not on a census ledger (cf. <a href="/leviticus/26-8.htm">Leviticus 26:8</a>; <a href="/joshua/23-10.htm">Joshua 23:10</a>).<p>&#8226; His wording subtly rebukes the underlying motive: if God can give any number of warriors, why count them?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and may the eyes of my lord the king see it</b><p>&#8226; Joab wishes David a long life to witness God&#8217;s ongoing faithfulness (cf. <a href="/psalms/91-16.htm">Psalm 91:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also reminds David that victories and growth are meant to glorify God before the king&#8217;s very eyes (<a href="/psalms/118-23.htm">Psalm 118:23</a>), not to bolster personal pride.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But why does my lord the king want to do such a thing?</b><p>&#8226; The question exposes doubt about the census&#8217;s legitimacy. God had allowed counting only with atonement money to avert plague (<a href="/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12</a>); David&#8217;s order omits that safeguard.<p>&#8226; Joab&#8217;s challenge parallels later prophetic confrontations, such as Nathan&#8217;s in <a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>, showing that even rulers must heed godly counsel (<a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The query underscores the spiritual peril of relying on military might instead of on the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Joab&#8217;s respectful but firm objection reveals that the census request stems from misplaced confidence in numbers rather than in God. By blessing David, affirming divine power to multiply, and questioning the king&#8217;s motive, Joab points back to the biblical truth that Israel&#8217;s security rests in the Lord alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Why doth my lord?</span>--Even in the eyes of the unscrupulous Joab David's act was abominable. Joab never gives evidence of being influenced by religious motives, but his natural shrewdness sufficed to show him that David's act was at variance with the fundamental principle of the national existence. Chronicles adds to Joab's words, "Why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?" The strong objection of Joab shows that there was something obviously wrong in the action of David.<p><span class= "bld">And against the captains.</span>--Joab's objections were sustained by his subordinate officers, and David carried through his sinful act by sheer force of self-will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Why doth my lord the king delight in this thing?</span> Joab was an unscrupulous and irreligious man; but he was clear headed, and far more statesmanlike than David (<a href="/2_samuel/19-5.htm">2 Samuel 19:5-7</a>). He saw whither the king was drifting, and that the increase of the royal power, resulting from successful war, would be fatal to the liberties of Israel. Probably, too, though he had consented to carry out Uriah's murder, yet he despised David for it. When he had murdered Abner to avenge Asahel, David had deprived him of his command, and he had to endure a long period of disgrace; and now David uses him to murder one altogether innocent. Joab, we may feel sure, noted the degradation of David's character, and drew the conclusion that he was not the man to be trusted at the head of a military despotism. Warned thus by what he saw, his mind reverted to the principles of the theocracy, and their truth and value became more clear to his understanding; and honourably he remonstrates with David for violating them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/24-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But Joab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1436;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3097.htm">Strong's 3097: </a> </span><span class="str2">Joab -- 'the LORD is father', three Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
