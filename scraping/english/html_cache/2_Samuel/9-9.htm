This action reflects David's commitment to honoring his covenant with Jonathan, Saul's son, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14-17</a>. Ziba's role as a servant in Saul's house indicates his familiarity with Saul's family and estate, making him a key figure in the unfolding events. The summoning of Ziba also highlights the hierarchical structure of ancient Israelite society, where servants played crucial roles in the management of estates.<p><b>and said to him,</b><br>David's direct communication with Ziba underscores the importance of the message he is about to deliver. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a king's words carried significant weight and authority, often resulting in immediate action. This interaction also demonstrates David's leadership style, which involved direct engagement with those who served the royal household.<p><b>&#8220;I have given to your master&#8217;s grandson</b><br>David refers to Mephibosheth, Jonathan's son and Saul's grandson. This act of giving is a fulfillment of David's promise to show kindness to Jonathan's family. The mention of "master's grandson" emphasizes the continuity of Saul's lineage and David's respect for it, despite Saul's previous enmity towards him. This gesture is a profound example of grace and mercy, reflecting the biblical theme of covenant faithfulness.<p><b>all that belonged to Saul and to all his house.</b><br>David restores Saul's estate to Mephibosheth, which includes land, wealth, and status. This restoration is significant, as it not only provides for Mephibosheth's physical needs but also reinstates his family's honor and legacy. In the broader biblical narrative, this act prefigures the restoration and inheritance themes found in the New Testament, where believers are restored to a right relationship with God and receive an eternal inheritance through Christ. The restoration of Saul's estate also serves as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where what was lost is fully restored.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart after God and his leadership.
