The use of "again" suggests a pattern of behavior that has previously provoked divine displeasure. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings and curses are contingent upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28). The anger of the LORD is often a response to idolatry, injustice, or failure to uphold the covenant. In this context, it is not specified what particular sin has incited God's anger, but it sets the stage for the events that follow.<p><b>and He stirred up David against them</b><br>This phrase suggests divine sovereignty and the mysterious interplay between God's will and human actions. The stirring up of David can be seen as God allowing or using David's decision to fulfill a larger purpose. In <a href="/1_chronicles/21.htm">1 Chronicles 21:1</a>, a parallel account attributes the incitement to Satan, highlighting the complexity of understanding divine and demonic influences. This dual attribution underscores the biblical theme that God can use even the actions of adversaries to accomplish His purposes (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>).<p><b>saying, &#8220;Go and take a census of Israel and Judah.&#8221;</b><br>The command to take a census is significant in the biblical context. Censuses were typically conducted for military or taxation purposes (<a href="/numbers/1-2.htm">Numbers 1:2-3</a>). However, this particular census is viewed negatively, as it reflects a reliance on human strength and numbers rather than trust in God's provision and protection. The act of counting the people can be seen as an expression of pride or self-reliance, which is contrary to the faith and dependence on God that is expected of Israel's leaders. This event foreshadows the consequences of David's actions, leading to a plague as a form of divine judgment (<a href="/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15</a>). The census also serves as a type of Christ, as it points to the need for a true shepherd who trusts fully in God and leads His people in righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, whose anger is kindled against the nation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, who is incited by God to take a census of the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel_and_judah.htm">Israel and Judah</a></b><br>The united kingdom under David's rule, consisting of the northern tribes (Israel) and the southern tribe (Judah).<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/census.htm">Census</a></b><br>The act of counting the population, which in this context is seen as an act of pride or lack of trust in God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/anger_of_the_lord.htm">Anger of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine response to sin or disobedience, indicating God's displeasure with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_sovereignty.htm">Understanding God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Recognize that God's actions, even when difficult to understand, are part of His sovereign plan.

This is a striking instance of attributing directly to God whatever comes about under His permission. And yet it is more than that. God has established immutable spiritual as well as material laws, or rather those laws themselves are but the expression of His unchanging will. Whatever comes about under the operation of those laws is said to be His doing. Now David's numbering the people was the natural consequence of the condition of worldliness and pride into which he had allowed himself to fall. God then moved him, because He had from the first so ordered the laws of the spirit that such a sinful act should be the natural outcome of such a sinful state. Of other interpretations: that which makes the verb impersonal--"one moved"--is hardly tenable grammatically; and that which makes the nominative a sort of compound word--"the wrath of the Lord" (as in some of the ancient versions)--leads to substantially the same explanation as that given above.<p>The word "number" in this verse is a different one from that used in the rest of the chapter, and means simply to <span class= "ital">count, </span>while the other conveys the idea of a military muster.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/24-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Again</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1433;&#1505;&#1462;&#1507;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;sep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
