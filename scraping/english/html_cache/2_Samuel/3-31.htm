Joab, David's military commander, had killed Abner, Saul's former army commander, in an act of vengeance. This order reflects David's desire to publicly distance himself from Joab's actions and to honor Abner, demonstrating his commitment to justice and reconciliation. The people with Joab likely included soldiers and officials, indicating the importance of this public mourning.<p><b>Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth</b><br>Tearing clothes and wearing sackcloth were traditional expressions of mourning and repentance in ancient Israel. This act signified deep sorrow and humility. By commanding this, David emphasizes the gravity of Abner's death and the need for national lamentation. It also serves as a public declaration of David's innocence in Abner's murder, aligning with cultural practices of expressing grief.<p><b>and mourn before Abner</b><br>Mourning before Abner signifies respect and acknowledgment of his status. Abner was a significant figure, having been the commander of Saul's army and a key player in the power dynamics of Israel. This public mourning underscores the importance of unity and reconciliation in the kingdom, as Abner had recently pledged allegiance to David, seeking to unite the northern tribes with Judah.<p><b>And King David himself walked behind the funeral bier</b><br>David's personal participation in the funeral procession highlights his sincerity and respect for Abner. Walking behind the bier was a sign of honor and mourning, showing David's genuine grief and his desire to be seen as a just and compassionate leader. This act also prefigures the humility of Christ, who, though a king, walked among His people and shared in their sorrows.

His personal participation validates the nation&#8217;s grief (<a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Walking behind the bier was the place of chief mourner, marking David&#8217;s humility and solidarity (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; This foreshadows the Greater Son of David who would identify with our sorrow and enter death&#8217;s shadow to bring life (<a href="/luke/7-12.htm">Luke 7:12&#8211;14</a>; <a href="/john/11-35.htm">John 11:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/3-31.htm">2 Samuel 3:31</a> shows a godly leader guiding his people through tragedy with visible repentance, public justice, and humble identification. David&#8217;s commands confront sin, honor the fallen, and foster unity, illustrating how righteous grief can heal a nation and point hearts to the King who perfectly fulfills sorrow and sovereignty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">Rend your clothes.</span>--David commands a public mourning with the usual signs of rent clothes and sackcloth, and lays this command especially upon Joab, who is thus required, as it were, to do public penance for his act. David himself followed the bier as chief mourner.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David said to Joab.</span> The excuse of the blood feud made it impossible for David to punish Joab further than by depriving him of his command; but he made him condemn his own deed by taking part in the public mourning for the man he had murdered. This mourning consisted in going in solemn procession, clad in sackcloth, before Abner's body, carried on a bier to the grave, while David followed as chief mourner; and the emphatic way in which he is called <span class="cmt_word">King David</span> suggests the thought that he went in royal state, so as to give all possible dignity to the funeral. His tears and lamentations with uplifted voice were so genuine and hearty as to move the people to a similar outburst of grief. But while all those at Hebron had proof that David was innocent, the people generally would know only that, when Abner was escorting the king's wife back to him, and arranging for his election to rule over all Israel, he was treacherously murdered at the gate of Hebron by one who was chief over David's army and also his nephew. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/3-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1448;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">ordered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
