The context is the aftermath of Absalom's revenge on Amnon for the rape of their sister Tamar. The speaker is Jonadab, who had informed David that only Amnon was dead, not all the king's sons as initially feared. This moment highlights the tension and fear within the royal family, reflecting the consequences of sin and familial discord.<p><b>the sons of the king came in, wailing loudly</b><br>The sons of King David, except for Amnon, return from Absalom's feast visibly distressed. Their loud wailing signifies deep grief and fear, a cultural expression of mourning in ancient Israel. This public display of emotion underscores the gravity of the situation and the impact of Amnon's death on the royal family. It also reflects the broader theme of familial strife and the fulfillment of Nathan's prophecy to David that "the sword shall never depart from your house" (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10</a>).<p><b>Then the king and all his servants also wept very bitterly</b><br>King David and his servants join in the mourning, indicating the communal nature of grief in ancient Israel. David's bitter weeping is a poignant reminder of the personal and national consequences of his own sins, as the turmoil within his family unfolds. This moment of shared sorrow among the king and his servants highlights the unity in grief and the deep emotional ties within the royal household. It also foreshadows the continued troubles David will face, as familial discord and rebellion continue to plague his reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_david.htm">King David</a></b><br>The reigning king of Israel, father to Amnon, Absalom, and Tamar.

The verse paints a scene of family devastation brought on by sin, yet it also underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty in the midst of human failure and the scriptural assurance that He draws near to the brokenhearted.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king also and all his servants wept very sore.</span> The narrative sets very clearly before us the great terror of the king, who at first supposes that all his sons are murdered; there is then suspense while Jonadab suggests that one only has been sacrificed to private vengeance; then quickly comes the watchman's report of the appearance of much people rapidly descending the hillside, and this is followed by the hasty rush of the fugitives into his presence, and the terrible certainty that one son has, with long premeditated malice, murdered his brother. And as he wept, David, we may feel sure, thought of Uriah, murdered because of his own base passions, whereas Amnon had brought death upon himself by following, alas! the example of his own father. He would think, too, of the words of his sentence, that "the sword should never depart from his house." It had claimed one victim, and who could now stop the outburst of angry passions in a family which previously had dwelt in kindly friendship? Probably, too, he reproached himself for not punishing Amnon. Had he done so with sufficient severity to have satisfied Absalom, he would have saved the life of his firstborn, and not have driven his second son into terrible crime. He had not done so because his own sins had tied his hands. Yes; David had good reason for weeping sore. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/13-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And as he finished</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7733;al&#183;l&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
