Jabesh-gilead was a city east of the Jordan River, in the territory of Gilead. Historically, this city had a strong connection to Saul, as he had previously rescued them from the Ammonites (1 Samuel 11). David's outreach to them shows his respect for Saul and his desire to unify the kingdom, acknowledging the loyalty of Jabesh-gilead to Saul.<p><b>to tell them, &#8220;The LORD bless you,</b><br>David invokes the LORD's blessing, which reflects his deep faith and recognition of God's sovereignty. This blessing is significant as it aligns with the biblical principle of honoring those who act righteously. It also sets a tone of peace and goodwill, which is crucial for David as he seeks to establish his rule over all Israel.<p><b>because you showed this kindness to Saul your lord</b><br>The kindness referred to is the burial of Saul, which was an act of loyalty and respect. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, proper burial was a significant duty, and the men of Jabesh-gilead risked their lives to retrieve and bury Saul's body (<a href="/1_samuel/31-11.htm">1 Samuel 31:11-13</a>). This act of kindness is highlighted by David, who acknowledges their loyalty to Saul, despite Saul's downfall.<p><b>when you buried him.</b><br>The burial of Saul by the men of Jabesh-gilead was a courageous act, as it involved retrieving his body from the Philistines. This act not only honored Saul but also maintained the dignity of Israel. In biblical times, burial was an important cultural and religious practice, and by ensuring Saul's proper burial, the men of Jabesh-gilead demonstrated their faithfulness to their king and to God. David's recognition of this act underscores the importance of honoring the dead and the values of loyalty and respect.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, known for his heart after God.

Some suppose that when David was told of their deed, it was with a view of prejudicing him against them. But this is not credible. By this time all men knew how loyal and affectionate were David's feelings towards his former king; and moreover the men of Jabesh were bound to Saul by no ordinary ties of gratitude (<a href="/1_samuel/11.htm">1 Samuel 11</a>.). Nor could David wish that Saul's remains, and those of Jonathan, should be subject to indignity. We may well feel sure that information respecting Saul was eagerly welcomed at Hebron, and the valiant men there would all rejoice at finding that the high spirit of the nation was not quenched. But in sending to thank them, in premising to requite them, and in bidding them persevere in similar conduct, David was acting as the head of the nation; and, to justify his action, he informs them that the men of Judah had made him their king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/2-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1444;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
