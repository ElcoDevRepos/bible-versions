This phrase indicates David's understanding of the holiness associated with the offering, reminiscent of the Levitical laws where certain offerings were considered sacred. It also echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/1_samuel/26-11.htm">1 Samuel 26:11</a>, where David refuses to harm Saul, the Lord's anointed, showing his respect for God's will and order.<p><b>Is this not the blood of the men who risked their lives?&#8221;</b><br>David acknowledges the sacrifice and bravery of his warriors, who risked their lives to bring him water from Bethlehem. This phrase highlights the value of life and the seriousness of their actions. In biblical culture, blood symbolizes life (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>), and David equates the water with the blood of his men, emphasizing the gravity of their sacrifice. This act of valor is a testament to the loyalty and courage of David's mighty men, paralleling the dedication seen in other biblical figures who risked their lives for God's purposes, such as Esther (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>).<p><b>So he refused to drink it.</b><br>David's refusal to drink the water is an act of respect and honor towards his men, acknowledging their sacrifice as too precious to be consumed for personal satisfaction. This decision reflects a leader who values the lives of his followers above his own desires, a characteristic that aligns with the servant leadership model exemplified by Jesus Christ, who came not to be served but to serve (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><b>Such were the exploits of the three mighty men.</b><br>This phrase serves as a summary of the extraordinary deeds performed by David's elite warriors, known as the "Three." Their exploits are recorded to highlight their exceptional bravery and loyalty. The narrative of the mighty men is part of a larger tradition of heroic literature in the ancient Near East, where the deeds of great warriors were celebrated. These exploits also foreshadow the ultimate victory and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the true King, who would accomplish the greatest act of deliverance for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel, known for his deep relationship with God and his leadership.
