In the context of ancient Israel, such actions were not only morally reprehensible but also a violation of the Mosaic Law, which David, as king, was expected to uphold. The word "deed" underscores the gravity of his sin, highlighting the deliberate nature of his actions. This serves as a reminder of the biblical principle that leaders are held to a higher standard of accountability (<a href="/james/3.htm">James 3:1</a>).<p><b>you have shown utter contempt for the word of the LORD</b><br>David's actions demonstrated a profound disrespect for God's commandments. The "word of the LORD" refers to the divine laws and instructions given to Israel, which David was supposed to embody as king. This contempt is not just a personal failing but a public scandal, as David's sin could lead others to question the integrity of God's law. This phrase echoes the biblical theme that sin is ultimately against God (<a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>), and it highlights the seriousness of disregarding divine authority.<p><b>the son born to you will surely die.&#8221;</b><br>This pronouncement of judgment is both personal and prophetic. The death of David and Bathsheba's child serves as a direct consequence of David's sin, illustrating the biblical principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). In the cultural context of ancient Israel, the death of a child was a profound tragedy, often seen as a sign of divine displeasure. This judgment also foreshadows the suffering and loss that sin brings, pointing to the need for redemption and the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who would bear the consequences of sin for humanity. The certainty of the child's death underscores the seriousness of sin and the justice of God, while also setting the stage for David's repentance and the eventual birth of Solomon, through whom God's promises would continue.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The King of Israel who committed adultery with Bathsheba and orchestrated the death of her husband, Uriah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nathan.htm">Nathan</a></b><br>The prophet sent by God to confront David about his sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bathsheba.htm">Bathsheba</a></b><br>The woman with whom David committed adultery, resulting in the birth of a son.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/u/uriah_the_hittite.htm">Uriah the Hittite</a></b><br>Bathsheba's husband, whom David had killed to cover up his sin.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, serving as the capital of Israel and the center of David's reign.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin is not just a personal failing but an act of contempt against God.

David&#8217;s forgiven heart still faces the serious fallout of despising God&#8217;s word. The verse underscores that God&#8217;s law is not a casual suggestion; contempt for it invites painful, even tragic, discipline. The infant&#8217;s death, heartbreaking as it is, teaches that sin&#8217;s price is real, public, and proportionate to God&#8217;s holiness. Yet the narrative shortly turns toward hope in Solomon, assuring us that God&#8217;s corrective justice always serves His larger redemptive purpose.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Thou hast given great occasion.</span>--Although David was forgiven, yet since his sin had brought great scandal on the church, it was necessary that he should suffer publicly the consequences of that sin. We can see that this was especially important in David's case, both for the vindication of God's justice, and to destroy the hope that other sins also might go unpunished; yet it is not to be forgotten that the effect of sin generally is similar. The far greater part of David's sufferings were from what are called "the natural consequences" of his sin, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>from consequences which flowed from it under the immutable laws of the world's moral government. These laws are always in force, and bring home the earthly consequences of sin, however the sinner may have repented and been forgiven.<p><span class= "bld">The child also that is born.</span>--The death of a little infant in the harem of a great Oriental monarch might seem of small significance, and but a light punishment; David, however, saw it in its true light--as an evidence of God's unalterable purpose, and a sign of the greater judgments that must come upon him. The people also, no doubt, saw and felt the appropriateness of this punishment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of Jehovah to blaspheme;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">thou hast made the enemies of Jehovah to despise</span>; that is, to despise Jehovah's government, the theocracy, of which David was the visible head and earthly representative. Jehovah's enemies are not the heathen, but Israelitish unbelievers, who would scoff at all religion when one in David's position fell into terrible open sin. But the death of the adulterous offspring of David and Bathsheba would prove to these irreligious men that Jehovah's righteous rule could reach and punish the king himself, and would thus vindicate his justice from their reproach. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/12-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Nevertheless,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1431;&#1508;&#1462;&#1505;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;p&#772;es)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_657.htm">Strong's 657: </a> </span><span class="str2">Cessation, an end, no further, the ankle, foot</span><br /><br /><span class="word">because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1462;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
