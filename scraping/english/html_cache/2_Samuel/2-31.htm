The context is a battle between the forces of David and those loyal to Saul's son, Ish-bosheth, led by Abner. The phrase underscores the violent and tumultuous period during the transition of power from Saul's house to David's rule. It reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to David to establish his kingdom, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>, where David is anointed as king.<p><b>360 Benjamites</b><br>The tribe of Benjamin was historically significant, being the tribe of King Saul. The Benjamites were known for their skill in battle, as noted in <a href="/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>. The number 360 suggests a substantial loss for Abner's forces, indicating a decisive victory for David's men. This loss would have weakened the support for Ish-bosheth and further solidified David's claim to the throne. The tribe's loyalty to Saul's house is evident, but this defeat marks a turning point in the power struggle.<p><b>who were with Abner</b><br>Abner, the son of Ner, was a prominent military leader and cousin to Saul. He played a crucial role in supporting Ish-bosheth's claim to the throne. His leadership and military prowess are highlighted throughout the narrative of 2 Samuel. Abner's alignment with the Benjamites against David's forces illustrates the division within Israel during this period. His eventual defection to David, as seen later in <a href="/2_samuel/3.htm">2 Samuel 3</a>, signifies a pivotal shift in the political landscape, leading to the unification of the tribes under David's kingship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Anointed king over Judah, David is in conflict with the house of Saul, represented by Abner and the Benjamites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abner.htm">Abner</a></b><br>The commander of Saul's army, who supports Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, as king over Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_benjamites.htm">The Benjamites</a></b><br>The tribe of Benjamin, loyal to Saul's house, and involved in the conflict against David's forces.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/joab.htm">Joab</a></b><br>The commander of David's army, leading the forces against Abner and the Benjamites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gibeon.htm">Gibeon</a></b><br>The location near where the battle between the forces of David and Abner took place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_division.htm">The Cost of Division</a></b><br>The conflict between David and Abner's forces illustrates the destructive nature of division among God's people.
