The four years suggest a calculated period during which Absalom was building support and planning his rebellion against his father, King David. This time frame is significant as it shows Absalom's patience and strategic planning, reflecting the political tension and unrest in David's kingdom.<p><b>Absalom said to the king</b><br>Absalom, the third son of David, is addressing his father, King David. This interaction highlights the strained relationship between them, following Absalom's return from exile after killing his brother Amnon. Absalom's approach to the king is part of his deceptive plan to usurp the throne, showcasing his cunning nature and ambition.<p><b>Please let me go to Hebron</b><br>Hebron is a significant city in the history of Israel. It was David's first capital before he moved to Jerusalem, and it holds historical and religious importance as the burial place of the patriarchs. Absalom's request to go to Hebron is strategic, as it is a place where he could gather support for his rebellion. The choice of Hebron is symbolic, as it connects to David's early reign and the unity of the tribes of Israel.<p><b>to fulfill a vow I have made to the LORD</b><br>Absalom uses the pretext of fulfilling a religious vow to gain permission from David to leave Jerusalem. This reflects the cultural and religious practices of making vows to God, which were taken seriously in Israelite society. Absalom's invocation of a vow to the LORD is manipulative, as he uses religious devotion to mask his true intentions of rebellion. This act of deception contrasts with the genuine faith and integrity often associated with David, highlighting Absalom's moral decline.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/absalom.htm">Absalom</a></b><br>The third son of King David, known for his handsome appearance and charismatic personality.

With deceptive politeness he seeks permission to leave Jerusalem, selecting Hebron&#8212;the birthplace of David&#8217;s rule&#8212;and wraps his request in the language of a sacred vow. The verse warns that calculated rebellion can hide under a veneer of piety, yet the all-seeing God will ultimately defend His anointed purposes and expose false devotion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_samuel/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">After forty years.</span>--The reading is certainly incorrect. Absalom was born after David began his reign in Hebron, and his whole reign was only forty years. Absalom therefore was not yet forty at his death. The reading found in the Syriac and most MSS. of the Vulgate, and adopted by Josephus, <span class= "ital">four </span>years, is probably correct. It remains uncertain from what point this four years is to be reckoned; probably it is from Absalom's return to Jerusalem.<p><span class= "bld">Pay my vow . . . in Hebron.</span>--We have no means of knowing whether this vow was real or fictitious; certainly Absalom now uses it as a pretext, and yet there is nothing improbable in his having actually made such a vow during his exile. Hebron was the place of his birth and childhood, as well as a holy city from very ancient times, and was thus a suitable place for the performance of his vow; it was also at a convenient distance from Jerusalem, and had been the royal city of David for the first seven years of his reign. It was thus well adapted to be the starting place of Absalom's rebellion, and it is not unlikely, moreover, that the men of Hebron may have resented the transfer of the capital to Jerusalem, and therefore have lent a willing ear to Absalom. Like many other culprits, Absalom veils his crime under the cloak of religion, pretending submission to his father, and receiving his blessing at the very moment when he is striking at his crown and his life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After forty years.</span> As Absalom was born in Hebron after David was made king (<a href="/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>), and as David's whole reign lasted only forty years and six months, the reading "forty" is evidently incorrect. Suggestions, such, for instance, as that the forty years are to be reckoned from the desire of the Israelites to have a king, or from the anointing of David by Samuel, are merely methods of evading a difficulty. The Syriac, however, and the Vulgate - except the Codex Amiatinus, which reads "forty," supported by Josephus and some manuscripts have "four years," which would give ample, yet not too long, time for the growth of Absalom's popularity, and of dissatisfaction at David's tardy administration of justice. <span class="cmt_word">In Hebron.</span> Absalom chose this town, beth as being his birthplace, and also because it was on the road to Geshur (<a href="/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8</a>), whither flight might be necessary should the enterprise fail. He hoped also to win to his cause some of the powerful tribe of Judah, though it generally was the mainstay of David's throne. Local sacrifices were still customary (see note on 1 Samuel 16:2), and the visit of the king's son for such a purpose would be celebrated by a general holiday and much feasting at Hebron. As Ewald remarks, David's confidence and want of suspicion were the results of a noble-minded generosity. And besides, there was no state police ever on the watch, and ready to put an unfavourable construction on all that was done; and probably David was even pleased at his son's popularity, and took his professions as proof that he would be a just and wise ruler on succeeding to his father's place. Perhaps, too, he was glad at this indication of religious feeling on Absalom's part; for a father is sure to look on the better side of his son's acts. He had been tardy enough in fulfilling his vow, but it seemed to David that conscience had at last prevailed, and that right was to be done. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/15-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1461;&#1430;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(miq&#183;q&#234;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
