His son, Mica, signifies hope and the preservation of Jonathan's line despite the fall of Saul's house. The name "Mica" means "Who is like God?" which reflects a common theme in Hebrew names that honor God's uniqueness and sovereignty. This phrase highlights the fulfillment of David's promise to Jonathan to show kindness to his descendants (<a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14-17</a>). The presence of Mica also underscores the theme of God's faithfulness in preserving a remnant, even from a fallen dynasty.<p><b>and all who dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants of Mephibosheth</b><br>Ziba was originally a servant of Saul's household, and David appointed him to manage Mephibosheth's estate (<a href="/2_samuel/9-9.htm">2 Samuel 9:9-10</a>). This arrangement reflects the cultural practice of maintaining the estates of noble families through trusted servants. The phrase indicates the restoration of Mephibosheth's status and inheritance, as David honors his covenant with Jonathan by ensuring Mephibosheth's provision and protection. This act of kindness by David can be seen as a type of Christ's grace, where the undeserving are given a place of honor and provision. The loyalty of Ziba's household to Mephibosheth also illustrates the biblical principle of servanthood and stewardship, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>, where faithful service is commended.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mephibosheth.htm">Mephibosheth</a></b><br>The son of Jonathan and grandson of King Saul.

Similar threads appear in <a href="/2_samuel/4-4.htm">2 Samuel 4:4</a>, where Mephibosheth&#8217;s childhood injury is recorded, and in <a href="/1_chronicles/8-34.htm">1 Chronicles 8:34</a>, which echoes the mention of his son, Mica.<p>&#8226; By noting a &#8220;young&#8221; son, Scripture highlights renewed hope and continuity. Though Mephibosheth had suffered crippling loss, the birth of Mica points to God&#8217;s restorative kindness, echoing the covenant David made with Jonathan in <a href="/1_samuel/20-14.htm">1 Samuel 20:14&#8211;17</a>.<p>&#8226; Practically, the verse reminds readers that God&#8217;s promises can reach beyond one generation. Even when circumstances seem broken&#8212;Mephibosheth was lame in both feet (<a href="/2_samuel/9-3.htm">2 Samuel 9:3</a>)&#8212;the Lord brings new life and future through offspring.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And all who dwelt in the house of Ziba</b><p>&#8220;and all who dwelt in the house of Ziba&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Ziba had been Saul&#8217;s servant (<a href="/2_samuel/9-2.htm">2 Samuel 9:2</a>). David appoints him to manage Saul&#8217;s former lands for Mephibosheth (<a href="/2_samuel/9-9.htm">2 Samuel 9:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;All who dwelt&#8221; signals an extensive household&#8212;fifteen sons and twenty servants (<a href="/2_samuel/9-10.htm">2 Samuel 9:10</a>). The sheer size reinforces David&#8217;s lavish fulfillment of his covenant pledge to Jonathan.<p>&#8226; The verse reflects how covenant kindness affects not just individuals but entire households, paralleling Joseph&#8217;s blessing upon Potiphar&#8217;s house for Joseph&#8217;s sake (<a href="/genesis/39-5.htm">Genesis 39:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Were servants of Mephibosheth</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;were servants of Mephibosheth.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The reversal is striking: a once-powerful servant class now serves a previously marginalized, disabled heir. This role reversal mirrors David&#8217;s earlier status as shepherd-turned-king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; By giving Mephibosheth authority over Saul&#8217;s estate, David publicly honors Jonathan&#8217;s son (<a href="/2_samuel/9-7.htm">2 Samuel 9:7</a>). The arrangement safeguards Mephibosheth&#8217;s provision while allowing him to remain at David&#8217;s table &#8220;like one of the king&#8217;s own sons&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/9-11.htm">2 Samuel 9:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail affirms that rightful stewardship stems from covenant faithfulness, not political convenience. It also foreshadows the ultimate Servant-King, Jesus, who elevates the humble (<a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6&#8211;11</a>, <a href="/luke/22-27.htm">Luke 22:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_samuel/9-12.htm">2 Samuel 9:12</a> shows God&#8217;s covenant grace in action. Through David, the Lord preserves Jonathan&#8217;s lineage with the birth of Mica and establishes Mephibosheth as master over Ziba&#8217;s large household. The verse demonstrates that divine promises extend to future generations, elevate the humble, and transform entire households by the power of faithful love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Micha</span>.
