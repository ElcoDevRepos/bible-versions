Known for his cunning nature, he previously advised Amnon on how to fulfill his sinful desire for Tamar (<a href="/2_samuel/13-3.htm">2 Samuel 13:3-5</a>). His presence here highlights his close proximity to the royal family and his influence within the court. The king referred to is David, who is dealing with the aftermath of Amnon's death. This moment underscores the tension and tragedy within David's family, a consequence of his own moral failings and the fulfillment of Nathan's prophecy (<a href="/2_samuel/12-10.htm">2 Samuel 12:10-12</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Look, the sons of the king have arrived!</b><br>The sons of the king refer to David's other sons, who were with Absalom at the time of Amnon's murder. Their arrival is significant as it confirms the news of Amnon's death, which Jonadab had already anticipated. This moment is a turning point, as it brings the reality of the fratricide into David's presence. The phrase also reflects the fulfillment of Jonadab's earlier assurance to David that not all the king's sons were killed, only Amnon (<a href="/2_samuel/13-33.htm">2 Samuel 13:33</a>).<p><b>It is just as your servant said.&#8221;</b><br>Jonadab's words here emphasize his role as a trusted advisor, despite his earlier involvement in Amnon's sin. His statement serves to validate his previous counsel and to reassure David of the limited scope of the tragedy. This phrase also highlights the theme of prophecy and fulfillment, as Jonadab's earlier words come to pass. In a broader biblical context, it reflects the recurring motif of God's sovereignty and the unfolding of His plans, even through human actions and decisions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonadab.htm">Jonadab</a></b><br>A nephew of King David, Jonadab is the son of David's brother Shimeah.

Scripture faithfully records both aspects, teaching that even truthful speech from a morally compromised person does not erase prior wrongdoing (<a href="/james/3-10.htm">James 3:10&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Verse 35 captures the moment when rumor yields to reality: Jonadab&#8217;s announcement confirms that only Amnon has died and the rest of David&#8217;s sons are safe. The line underscores three timeless lessons&#8212;God governs events despite human sin, verified truth outranks fearful speculation, and even flawed messengers can deliver accurate reports. Trust in the Lord&#8217;s unfolding plan, test every claim against observable fact, and remember that Scripture records both sin and salvation to draw us into deeper obedience and faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_samuel/13-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Jonadab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1489;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3122.htm">Strong's 3122: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jonadab</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the king,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1428;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Look,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
