In biblical context, hearing is often associated with obedience and receptivity to God's word. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, known as the Shema, begins with "Hear, O Israel," underscoring the call to listen and obey. In the New Testament, Jesus frequently says, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear" (<a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>), urging listeners to truly understand His teachings. The ability to hear spiritually is a gift from God, enabling believers to discern His voice amidst the noise of the world.<p><b>and eyes that see&#8212;</b><br>Vision in the Bible often symbolizes insight and understanding. The ability to see spiritually is linked to wisdom and revelation from God. In <a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>, Elisha prays for his servant's eyes to be opened to see the spiritual reality around them, revealing the presence of God's protection. Jesus heals the blind in the Gospels, not only restoring physical sight but also symbolizing the opening of spiritual eyes to recognize Him as the Messiah. Spiritual sight allows believers to perceive God's work and truth in their lives and the world.<p><b>the LORD has made them both.</b><br>This phrase acknowledges God's sovereignty and creative power. It affirms that both physical and spiritual faculties are gifts from the Creator. <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a> states that humans are made in the image of God, endowed with the ability to perceive and understand His creation. This acknowledgment of God's handiwork calls believers to use their senses for His glory, aligning with the biblical theme of stewardship. It also serves as a reminder of God's intimate involvement in the details of human life, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-16</a>, where God is described as intricately forming each person.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

(Comp. our Lord's constant warning, "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.") The proverb may also remind us of the admonition in <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm" title="The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.">Proverbs 15:3</a>, and <a href="/psalms/94-9.htm" title="He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?">Psalm 94:9</a>, to remember God's constant watchfulness over us.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of them.</span> This apothegm, which seems to be nothing but a trite truism, brings to notice many important consequences. First, there is the result noted in <a href="/psalms/94-9.htm">Psalm 94:9</a>, "He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see?" Hence we learn the sleepless providence of God. So 'Pirke Aboth,' "Know that which is above thee, an eye that seeth all, an ear that heareth all." We learn also that all things are directed and overruled by God (comp. <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a>). Then there is the thought that these powers of ours, being the gift of God, should be used piously and in God's service. "Mine ears hast thou opened... Lo, I come... I delight to do thy will, O my God" (<a href="/psalms/40-6.htm">Psalm 40:6</a>, etc.). The eye should be blind, the ear deaf, to all that might defile or excite to evil (see <a href="/isaiah/33-15.htm">Isaiah 33:15</a>). But it is the Lord alone that enables the spiritual organs to receive the wondrous things of God's Law; they must be educated by grace to enable them to perform their proper functions. "God hath given us eyes," says St. Chrysostom ('Hom. 22 in 1 Corinthians'), "not that we may look wantonly, but that, admiring his handiwork, we may worship the Creator. And that this is the use of our eyes is evident from the things which are seen. For the lustre of the sun and of the sky we see from an immeasurable distances, but a woman's beauty one cannot discern so far off. Seest thou that for this end our eye was chiefly given? Again, he made the ear, that we should entertain not blasphemous words, but saving doctrines. Wherefore you see, when it receives anything dissonant, both our soul shudders and our very body also. And if we hear anything cruel or merciless, again our flesh creeps; but if anything decorous and kind, we even exult and rejoice." "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." Septuagint, "The ear heareth and the eye sooth, and both are the works of the Lord." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/20-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Ears</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1465;&#1443;&#1494;&#1462;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;zen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_241.htm">Strong's 241: </a> </span><span class="str2">Broadness, the ear</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that hear</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1453;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#183;&#8216;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and eyes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1443;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;a&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5869.htm">Strong's 5869: </a> </span><span class="str2">An eye, a fountain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that see&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1437;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has made</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">them both.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;n&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - mdc &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8147.htm">Strong's 8147: </a> </span><span class="str2">Two (a cardinal number)</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/20-12.htm">Proverbs 20:12 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/20-12.htm">Proverbs 20:12 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/20-12.htm">Proverbs 20:12 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/20-12.htm">Proverbs 20:12 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/20-12.htm">Proverbs 20:12 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/20-12.htm">Proverbs 20:12  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/20-12.htm">Proverbs 20:12 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/20-12.htm">Proverbs 20:12 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/20-12.htm">Proverbs 20:12 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/20-12.htm">Proverbs 20:12 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/20-12.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 20:12 The hearing ear and the seeing eye (Prov.
