It highlights the importance of parental instruction in ancient Israelite culture, where wisdom and knowledge were often passed down through family lines. The father-son relationship is central in biblical teaching, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are instructed to teach God's commandments to their children. This phrase also echoes the relationship between God the Father and Jesus, the Son, emphasizing the divine model of instruction and obedience.<p><b>tender</b><br>The term "tender" suggests a time of vulnerability and impressionability in youth. It indicates a period when a child is most open to learning and being shaped by parental guidance. In biblical times, childhood was seen as a critical phase for instilling values and wisdom, as reflected in <a href="/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a>, which advises training a child in the way they should go. The tenderness of youth is also a metaphor for spiritual receptivity, as seen in Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/18-3.htm">Matthew 18:3</a>, where He calls for a childlike faith.<p><b>and the only child of my mother</b><br>This phrase underscores the unique and cherished position of Solomon in his family, being the only child of Bathsheba at the time. It highlights the special attention and care given to him, which would have included a focused impartation of wisdom and instruction. The mention of the mother is significant, as mothers played a crucial role in the upbringing and education of children in ancient Israel. This phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the "only begotten Son" of the Father in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>, emphasizing His unique and beloved status.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The author of Proverbs, traditionally believed to be King Solomon, the son of David and Bathsheba.

It may be remarked that the notices of Solomon's early years which occur in this and the following verses harmonise well with what we know of him from the historical books of the Bible.<p><span class= "bld">Tender.--</span>The epithet applied to Solomon by his father (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-1.htm" title="Furthermore David the king said to all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God.">1Chronicles 29:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Only beloved.</span>--The word <span class= "ital">y?chid </span>originally signified an "only" (son), as in <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm" title="And I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look on me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.">Zechariah 12:10</a>. Then it came to mean "beloved as an only son," and that appears to be the sense of it in <a href="/genesis/22-2.htm" title="And he said, Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and get you into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.">Genesis 22:2</a>, as applied to Isaac (for Ishmael was then living), and to Solomon here (for Bath-sheba had other children by David, <a href="/1_chronicles/3-5.htm" title="And these were born to him in Jerusalem; Shimea, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, four, of Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel:">1Chronicles 3:5</a>). In Greek translations it is rendered "only-begotten" and "well-beloved," epithets applied in their highest sense to Christ (<a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/3-17.htm" title="And see a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">Matthew 3:17</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I was my father's son.</span> This is more than the mere statement of a physical fact. It indicates that the teacher was in the highest degree an object of endearment to his father, just as he states in the second hemistich that he held a unique position in the affection of his mother. `The statement agrees with the historical record. Solomon would be more than ordinarily dear to his father, as being a child of promise, as "the beloved of the Lord," and as the son whom the Divine will had pointed as the successor to his throne, and the one on whom was to devolve the building of the temple (see <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12, 13</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9</a>). Bertheau explains, "I also once stood in the relation to my (actual) father in which you stand to me your paternal instructor," thus giving prominence rather to the consecution of the passage, and preparing the way for the reception of the father's advice which is to follow. But this rather loses sight of what appears an important element in the instruction, that not only was it "good," but that it was dictated by affection. The writer is fortifying and strengthening his instruction by the authority of his father, showing that what he was laying before others he had had placed before him; and as <span class="accented">his</span> father's advice was the outcome of affection, so he addresses his hearers in the same spirit. Dathe and others connect "tender" <span class="accented">rak</span>) with "son" (<span class="accented">ben</span>), and render, "I was a son dear to my father." So the LXX., which, however, understands "tender" in the sense of "tractable," "obedient:" "For I was an obedient son to my father" - a meaning which the word <span class="accented">rak</span> can only bear as indicating the susceptibility of the young to receive impressions. In general, <span class="accented">rak</span> means "tender," "soft," and has reference to the weakness and helplessness of the young; comp. <a href="/genesis/33-13.htm">Genesis 33:13</a>, "My lord knoweth that the children are tender (<span class="accented">rakkim</span>)." Combined with <span class="accented">yakhid</span>, which follows, it signifies, in the passage before us, that the teacher was an object of tender care or love. The Vulgate <span class="accented">tenellus</span>, the diminutive of <span class="accented">tener</span>, as signifying "somewhat tender or delicate," reproduces the idea of the Hebrew <span class="accented">rak.</span> In the word the teacher recalls his early lifo and the instruction in wisdom which he received in it. <span class="cmt_word">Only beloved;</span> literally, <span class="accented">only</span> (<span class="accented">yakhid</span>), as "beloved" does not occur in the original. The Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">unigenitus</span>; Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "only begotten:" but this was not literally the fact, as Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon, had other sons (<a href="/2_samuel/5-14.htm">2 Samuel 5:14</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>). Both the Hebrew <span class="accented">yakhid</span>, "only," and the Vulgate <span class="accented">unigenitus</span>, "only begotten," consequently signify what is expressed by the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "beloved." Solomon was so beloved of his mother as if he were an only child. So <span class="accented">yakhid</span> is used of Isaac in <a href="/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2, 12</a> in the same way, since at the time that Isaac was so designated, Ishmael, the other son of Abraham, was still living. The word <span class="accented">yakhid</span> occurs in <a href="/psalms/22-20.htm">Psalm 22:20</a>, where it is rendered "darling," and may possibly refer to Solomon. Jennings, in <a href="/psalms/22-20.htm">Psalm 22:20</a>, understands it, however, of the life besides which the psalmist has no other - <span class="accented">unicam meam, as</span> the Vulgate, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "his only life" (cf. <a href="/psalms/35-17.htm">Psalm 35:17</a>; and for the word <span class="accented">yakhid</span>, see <a href="/jeremiah/5-26.htm">Jeremiah 5:26</a>; <a href="/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>; <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the sight of my mother</span> (<span class="accented">liph'ne immi</span>); literally, <span class="accented">ad facies matris meae</span>, or, <span class="accented">before my mother</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">coram matre mea, i.e.</span> in her estimation (cf. <a href="/genesis/17-18.htm">Genesis 17:18</a>). The mention of the mother is probably introduced here for the sake of poetic parallelism; cf. <a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a> (Zockler). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/4-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1461;&#1453;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to my father,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1.htm">Strong's 1: </a> </span><span class="str2">Father</span><br /><br /><span class="word">tender</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1445;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ra&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7390.htm">Strong's 7390: </a> </span><span class="str2">Tender, delicate, soft</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and the only child</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1437;&#1497;&#1464;&#1495;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3173.htm">Strong's 3173: </a> </span><span class="str2">United, sole, beloved, lonely, the life</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(lip&#772;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - common plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6440.htm">Strong's 6440: </a> </span><span class="str2">The face</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my mother,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_517.htm">Strong's 517: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mother, )</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/4-3.htm">Proverbs 4:3 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/4-3.htm">Proverbs 4:3 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/4-3.htm">Proverbs 4:3 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/4-3.htm">Proverbs 4:3 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/4-3.htm">Proverbs 4:3 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/4-3.htm">Proverbs 4:3  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/4-3.htm">Proverbs 4:3 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/4-3.htm">Proverbs 4:3 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/4-3.htm">Proverbs 4:3 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/4-3.htm">Proverbs 4:3 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/4-3.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 4:3 For I was a son to my (Prov.
