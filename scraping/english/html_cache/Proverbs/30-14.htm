In biblical terms, "generation" often refers to a group of people living at the same time or sharing similar characteristics. This can be seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39</a>, where Jesus refers to a "wicked and adulterous generation." The use of "generation" here suggests a recurring pattern of behavior that transcends time, indicating a moral or spiritual decline.<p><b>whose teeth are swords and whose jaws are knives</b><br>This vivid imagery describes the destructive and violent nature of this generation. The metaphor of teeth as swords and jaws as knives suggests aggression and a predatory nature. In the ancient Near Eastern context, such imagery would resonate with the audience familiar with the brutality of warfare and the predatory behavior of wild animals. This metaphor is similar to descriptions found in Psalms and other wisdom literature, where the wicked are often depicted as having sharp tongues or destructive speech (<a href="/psalms/57-4.htm">Psalm 57:4</a>).<p><b>devouring the oppressed from the earth</b><br>The term "devouring" indicates a complete and ruthless consumption, leaving nothing behind. This reflects the exploitation and oppression of the vulnerable, a theme frequently addressed in the Old Testament. The oppressed are often those who are marginalized, such as the poor, widows, and orphans. This aligns with the prophetic literature, where God expresses His concern for justice and the protection of the oppressed (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><b>and the needy from among men</b><br>The "needy" refers to those lacking basic necessities and support. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, the community was expected to care for the needy, as seen in the laws given in the Torah (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>). The failure to do so is a sign of societal decay and moral failure. This phrase underscores the callousness of the generation described, as they not only ignore but actively harm those who are most vulnerable. This is contrary to the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized caring for the least among us (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/agur.htm">Agur</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/30.htm">Proverbs 30</a>, Agur son of Jakeh, is a figure about whom little is known, but he is credited with this collection of sayings that reflect wisdom and observation of human behavior.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oppressed_and_needy.htm">The Oppressed and Needy</a></b><br>These are the vulnerable individuals in society who are often exploited or harmed by those in power or with malicious intent.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_generation.htm">The Generation</a></b><br>This refers to a group or type of people characterized by their destructive and oppressive behavior, as described in the proverb.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words_and_actions.htm">The Power of Words and Actions</a></b><br>Just as swords and knives can cause physical harm, our words and actions can deeply wound others.
