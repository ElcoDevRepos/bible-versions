In biblical context, this can be seen as a call to protect the innocent and vulnerable, reflecting the broader biblical theme of justice and mercy. The imagery of being "led away to death" suggests a situation of imminent danger or judgment, reminiscent of the plight of the Israelites in Egypt, where God intervened to rescue them from slavery and death (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-8</a>). This call to action aligns with the teachings of Jesus, who often spoke of seeking and saving the lost (<a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>). The phrase also echoes the prophetic tradition, where prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah called for justice and the defense of the oppressed (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>).<p><b>and restrain those stumbling toward the slaughter</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the need to prevent harm and guide those who are unaware or unable to see the danger ahead. The term "stumbling" suggests a lack of awareness or understanding, which can be linked to spiritual blindness or ignorance. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, the slaughter could refer to both literal and metaphorical destruction, such as the consequences of sin or societal injustice. The call to "restrain" implies an active effort to prevent harm, akin to the role of a shepherd protecting his flock, a common biblical metaphor for leadership and care (Psalm 23, <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-15</a>). This phrase can also be seen as a type of Christ, who intervenes to save humanity from spiritual death, offering guidance and salvation through His sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rescuer.htm">The Rescuer</a></b><br>This refers to the person who is called to take action, to intervene and save those in peril.

"would that!" So the first hemistich should be rendered, "Deliver them that are haled to death," and the second, "And those that are tottering to slaughter, oh, hold them back!" The sentence is somewhat obscure, but Cheyne well explains it thus: "Some victims of a miscarriage of justice are about to be dragged away to execution, and the disciple of wisdom is exhorted to use his endeavours to deliver them" ('Job and Solomon'). In the case supposed a moral obligation lies on the pious and well-informed to save a human life unjustly imperilled. At the same time, there is nothing in the passage which absolutely, shows that the punishment of the guiltless is here deprecated; it looks rather as if Wisdom had no pleasure in the death of men, innocent or not, and that the victims of an extreme sentence claimed pity at her hands, whatever might be the circumstances of the verdict.
