They served as a place where business transactions, legal disputes, and community decisions were made. The mention of the husband being "known" at the city gates indicates his reputation and standing within the community. This suggests that he is a man of integrity and respect, likely due in part to the virtuous character of his wife, as described in the preceding verses. The city gates were a place of authority and governance, and being known there implies that he holds a position of influence or leadership.<p><b>where he sits among the elders of the land</b><br>Sitting among the elders signifies a role of leadership and wisdom. In biblical times, elders were respected leaders who provided guidance and made important decisions for the community. This phrase indicates that the husband is not only respected but also actively involved in the governance and decision-making processes of the city. The elders were often responsible for interpreting the law and ensuring justice, roles that required discernment and moral character. This connection to the elders highlights the husband's esteemed position and suggests a parallel to the wisdom literature's emphasis on living a life guided by godly principles. The imagery of sitting among the elders can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate wise leader and judge.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/her_husband.htm">Her Husband</a></b><br>The husband of the virtuous woman described in <a href="/bsb/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>.
