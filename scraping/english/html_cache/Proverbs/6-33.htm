In ancient Israel, adultery was not only a personal sin but a violation of the covenant community's moral fabric. The "wounds" can be understood both literally and metaphorically, indicating physical punishment or the emotional and spiritual damage resulting from such sin. The term "dishonor" reflects the loss of reputation and respect within the community, a critical aspect of ancient Near Eastern culture where honor and shame were pivotal social constructs. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching that sin leads to suffering and disgrace, as seen in the story of David and Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11), where David's sin resulted in personal and familial turmoil.<p><b>and his reproach will never be wiped away</b><br>The enduring nature of the "reproach" signifies the lasting impact of sin, particularly sexual immorality, on an individual's life. In the cultural context of the Bible, a person's name and legacy were of utmost importance, and a tarnished reputation could affect one's family for generations. This phrase underscores the idea that while forgiveness is available through repentance, the earthly consequences of sin can persist. The concept of an indelible reproach is echoed in other scriptures, such as in the warnings against sin in <a href="/hebrews/12-16.htm">Hebrews 12:16-17</a>, where Esau's decision led to irreversible consequences. This serves as a sobering reminder of the gravity of sin and the importance of living a life of integrity and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

The verse presses us to treasure purity, respect marriage, and trust God&#8217;s design, knowing that while His grace forgives, sin&#8217;s earthly scars are soberingly real.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</span> Two other things more immediate await the adulterer - personal chastisement and loss of reputation. It seems clear that "a wound" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">negav</span>, "a stroke" or "blow"), used here in the singular, collectively refers to the corporal punishment, which the outraged husband will inflict upon the adulterer (Delitzsch, Zockler. Lapide). (For the word, see <a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8</a>; 21:5.) It may also have reference to the punishment inflicted by the Law. In the LXX. the idea is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "pains," and so gives colour to Lapide's explanation of "afflictions of every kind" The Vulgate gives a moral turn to the meaning, and coordinates the word with "dishonour:" <span class="accented">Turpitudinem et ignominiam congregat sibi</span>, "<span class="accented">Dishonour</span> is the ignominious treatment he will receive on all hands." The second part of the verse states that a brand of disgrace will be attached to his name which will be perpetual, not confined to this life only, but extending beyond it, so that men will never recall it but with this stigma (Patrick, Mercerus). On <span class="accented">shall be ... wiped away</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">timmakeh</span>, the niph. future of <span class="accented">makhah</span>, "to wipe off, or away," and in hiph. "to be blotted out," equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">delere</span>), see <a href="/deuteronomy/25-6.htm">Deuteronomy 25:6</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/6-6.htm">Ezekiel 6:6</a>; <a href="/judges/21-17.htm">Judges 21:17</a>.

The statements of the verse are illustrated by Horace, 'Satires,' lib. 1:2, 37, who describes the dangers and mishaps which befall the adulterer and fornicator. <p><span class="foreign">"Hic se praecipitem tecto dedit; ille flagellis<br />Ad mortem caesus: fugiens hic decidit acrem<br />Praedonum in turbam: dedit hic pro corpore nnmmos."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/6-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Wounds</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1462;&#1469;&#1490;&#1463;&#1506;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ne&#183;&#7713;a&#8216;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5061.htm">Strong's 5061: </a> </span><span class="str2">Mark -- a blow, a spot</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and dishonor</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1500;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;q&#257;&#183;l&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7036.htm">Strong's 7036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Disgrace, the pudenda</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will befall him,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1425;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(yim&#183;&#7779;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4672.htm">Strong's 4672: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come forth to, appear, exist, to attain, find, acquire, to occur, meet, be present</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and his reproach</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1437;&#1495;&#1462;&#1512;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7717;er&#183;p&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2781.htm">Strong's 2781: </a> </span><span class="str2">Contumely, disgrace, the pudenda</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will never</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">be wiped away.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1462;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;im&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#7717;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4229.htm">Strong's 4229: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stroke, rub, to erase, to smooth, grease, make fat, to touch, reach to</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/6-33.htm">Proverbs 6:33 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/6-33.htm">Proverbs 6:33 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/6-33.htm">Proverbs 6:33 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/6-33.htm">Proverbs 6:33 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/6-33.htm">Proverbs 6:33 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/6-33.htm">Proverbs 6:33  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/6-33.htm">Proverbs 6:33 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/6-33.htm">Proverbs 6:33 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/6-33.htm">Proverbs 6:33 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/6-33.htm">Proverbs 6:33 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/6-33.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 6:33 He will get wounds and dishonor (Prov.
