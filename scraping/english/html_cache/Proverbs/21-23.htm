In biblical times, words held significant power, often determining one's reputation and relationships. The wisdom literature, including Proverbs, frequently addresses the tongue's potential for both good and harm (<a href="/proverbs/18-21.htm">Proverbs 18:21</a>). The concept of guarding one's speech is echoed in <a href="/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2-12</a>, where the tongue is described as a small part of the body but capable of great influence. The imagery of guarding suggests vigilance and intentionality, akin to a watchman protecting a city. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of wisdom as a protective force, guiding believers to live righteously.<p><b>keeps his soul from distress</b><br>The term "soul" here refers to one's inner being or life essence, indicating that the consequences of speech extend beyond external circumstances to affect one's spiritual and emotional well-being. Distress can encompass a range of negative outcomes, from personal turmoil to relational conflict. In the ancient Near Eastern context, maintaining harmony within the community was vital, and reckless words could lead to social discord or even legal repercussions. This principle is consistent with teachings found in the New Testament, such as <a href="/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a>, which advises believers to speak only what is helpful for building others up. The promise of peace and protection for those who exercise restraint in speech reflects the biblical understanding of wisdom as a source of life and blessing (<a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13-18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

Like a sentry posted at a gate, we actively decide what enters and exits.<p>- Scripture pictures this vigilant stance elsewhere: &#8220;Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/141-3.htm">Psalm 141:3</a>).<p>- Proverbs returns to the theme again and again&#8212;&#8220;He who guards his mouth protects his life&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/13-3.htm">Proverbs 13:3</a>)&#8212;underscoring that the duty is continuous, not one-time.<p>- Guarding is proactive, not merely reactive. We pre-decide godly boundaries, rather than scrambling after careless words escape.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his mouth</b><p>- The &#8220;mouth&#8221; is the primary outlet of the heart. Jesus reminds us, &#8220;The things that come out of the mouth come from the heart&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/15-18.htm">Matthew 15:18</a>).<p>- A controlled mouth:<p>&#8226; limits word-count&#8212;&#8220;When words are many, sin is unavoidable, but he who restrains his lips is wise&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/10-19.htm">Proverbs 10:19</a>).<p>&#8226; offers life-giving speech&#8212;&#8220;Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul and healing to the bones&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a>).<p>&#8226; chooses timing&#8212;&#8220;A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/25-11.htm">Proverbs 25:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and tongue</b><p>- Solomon doubles the language to stress total verbal self-control; the tongue shapes tone, intensity, and direction of our words.<p>- James illustrates the tongue&#8217;s outsized power: &#8220;The tongue is a small part of the body, but it boasts great things&#8230; The tongue also is a fire&#8221; (<a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-6</a>).<p>- A bridled tongue indicates genuine faith: &#8220;If anyone considers himself religious and yet does not bridle his tongue, he deceives his heart&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-26.htm">James 1:26</a>).<p>- Practical checkpoints for the tongue:<p>&#8226; Is it true?<p>&#8226; Is it loving?<p>&#8226; Is it necessary right now?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>keeps his soul</b><p>- The payoff is internal. Words don&#8217;t just hurt others; reckless speech ricochets and wounds the speaker&#8217;s own soul.<p>- &#8220;The heart of the wise instructs his mouth and adds persuasiveness to his lips&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-23.htm">Proverbs 16:23</a>); wisdom inside produces safety inside.<p>- By guarding speech we protect our testimony, our conscience, and our fellowship with God&#8212;assets far more valuable than momentary verbal victories.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from distress</b><p>- &#8220;Distress&#8221; covers the turmoil that erupts after foolish words: broken relationships, regret, discipline, even danger.<p>- Proverbs paints the contrast: &#8220;An evil man is trapped by his rebellious speech, but a righteous man escapes from trouble&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/12-13.htm">Proverbs 12:13</a>).<p>- Peter echoes the promise for New-Covenant believers: &#8220;Whoever would love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/3-10.htm">1 Peter 3:10</a>).<p>- Guarded speech averts quarrels (<a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>), spares us legal or financial fallout (<a href="/proverbs/17-18.htm">Proverbs 17:18-20</a>), and preserves peace of mind.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/21-23.htm">Proverbs 21:23</a> gives a simple equation: disciplined speech equals protected soul. Setting a vigilant watch over mouth and tongue honors God, shields our inner life, and frees us from needless turmoil. Living this verse means choosing words prayerfully, speaking less but with more purpose, and trusting that God&#8217;s wisdom always spares us the grief our unchecked tongues would invite.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue, &c</span>--See above on <a href="/proverbs/12-13.htm" title="The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the just shall come out of trouble.">Proverbs 12:13</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - We have had similar maxims before (<a href="/proverbs/13-8.htm">Proverbs 13:8</a> and Proverbs 18:21, where see notes). <span class="cmt_word">He keepeth his mouth,</span> who knows when to speak and when to be silent; and he keepeth his tongue, who says only what is to the purpose.
