In ancient Israel, adultery was not only a personal sin but also a violation of the covenant community's moral fabric. The lack of judgment here refers to the failure to discern the long-term consequences of such actions. This phrase echoes the wisdom found in <a href="/proverbs/5.htm">Proverbs 5:1-23</a>, where the dangers of adultery are extensively discussed. The Hebrew term for "lacks judgment" implies a deficiency in understanding or insight, which is a critical aspect of wisdom literature. The act of adultery is seen as a betrayal of trust and a failure to adhere to God's commandments, as outlined in <a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>.<p><b>whoever does so destroys himself.</b><br>The destruction mentioned is both moral and spiritual. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, adultery could lead to severe social and legal repercussions, including the possibility of capital punishment as prescribed in <a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>. Beyond the immediate consequences, this phrase suggests a deeper, spiritual destruction. The act of adultery severs one's relationship with God, as it is a direct violation of His laws. This self-destruction can be seen as a type of spiritual death, aligning with the broader biblical narrative that sin leads to separation from God (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>). The New Testament reinforces this idea, with <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a> describing how desire leads to sin, and sin, when fully grown, brings forth death. This phrase serves as a warning of the ultimate cost of sin, urging believers to seek wisdom and live righteously.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

Scripture consistently names adultery as a direct violation of God&#8217;s moral order (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/5-27.htm">Matthew 5:27-28</a>).<p>&#8226; Adultery is never treated as a mere private indiscretion. In <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a> Paul urges, &#8220;Flee from sexual immorality,&#8221; showing that unfaithfulness is spiritually corrosive and always affects more than the two people involved.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a> underscores the sanctity of marriage, declaring it &#8220;must be honored by all,&#8221; so the act addressed here is a deliberate crossing of a clearly marked boundary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lacks judgment</b><p>&#8226; The proverb moves immediately to the inner problem: adultery exposes a deficit of discernment. In other words, the sinner is acting foolishly, ignoring obvious warnings.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/7-6.htm">Proverbs 7:6-23</a> tells of the &#8220;youth lacking sense&#8221; who walks straight into an adulterous trap; his ignorance is willful, not accidental.<p>&#8226; Compare <a href="/proverbs/5-1.htm">Proverbs 5:1-2</a>, where wisdom&#8217;s purpose is &#8220;to maintain discretion.&#8221; Choosing adultery means rejecting that wisdom.<p>&#8226; This lack of judgment is not intellectual stupidity but moral blindness&#8212;Roman 13:13-14 urges believers to &#8220;behave decently&#8230; not in sexual immorality,&#8221; putting on Christ so the will is ruled by truth, not desire.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Destroys himself</b><p>&#8226; The final phrase shows adultery&#8217;s boomerang effect: the sinner &#8220;destroys himself.&#8221; There are layers to this destruction:<p>&#8211; Physical: <a href="/proverbs/5-11.htm">Proverbs 5:11</a> pictures the adulterer groaning &#8220;at the end of your life when your flesh and body are spent.&#8221;<p>&#8211; Emotional and relational: Broken trust fractures families (<a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14-16</a>) and sows bitterness.<p>&#8211; Spiritual: <a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a> explains that sexual sin is &#8220;against his own body,&#8221; while <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a> warns that sowing to the flesh reaps corruption.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a> traces the downward spiral: desire conceives sin, sin matures, and &#8220;gives birth to death.&#8221; Adultery is not a harmless fling; it is self-inflicted ruin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32</a> starkly exposes adultery&#8217;s true nature. The act violates God&#8217;s clear command, reveals a heart that has traded wisdom for folly, and unleashes destruction on the sinner&#8217;s whole life. Scripture&#8217;s consistent message&#8212;from Sinai&#8217;s commandment to Paul&#8217;s exhortations&#8212;is that marital faithfulness safeguards both individuals and communities, while infidelity dismantles them. God&#8217;s wisdom calls us to cherish the covenant of marriage, exercise discernment before temptation, and flee from sin that only leads to self-destruction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding.</span> The adversative "but" is wanting in the original, but is clearly demanded by the contrast which is instituted. The man who steals from hunger has a motive for so doing, but the adulterer has no such excuse for his crime, which is an unwarrantable invasion of his neighbour's rights. Because there are honest ways for satisfying his desires, he therefore "lacketh understanding." <span class="accented">Committeth adultery with a woman</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">noeph ishshah</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui adulter est</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> an adulterer. The Hebrew <span class="accented">naaph</span>, "to commit adultery," is here followed by an accusative, as in <a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/29-23.htm">Jeremiah 29:23</a>. <span class="accented">Lacketh understanding</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">khasar-lev</span>; <span class="accented">deficit corde</span>. The verb <span class="accented">khaser</span> is "to be devoid of anything," "to lack." The expression, which occurs again in ch. Proverbs 7:7 aud Proverbs 9:4, refers to the brutish and stupid condition to which lust has reduced him. Lust has displaced right reason. He is <span class="accented">expers judicii</span> (Syriac), devoid of judgment, without intelligence, senseless and stupid. In modern phraseology, he has taken leave of his senses. Both the LXX. and Vulgate have combined the two branches of this verse, the former rendering, "But the adulterer, on account of want of intelligence, compasses the loss of his life," and the latter, "But the adulterer, on account of want of intelligence, loses his life." <span class="cmt_word">He that doeth it destroyeth his own soul;</span> or literally, <span class="accented">whoso will destroy his life he will do this, i.e.</span> adultery. So Ariae Montani, Munsterus, Chaldee Targum. The man who commits adultery is a self-murderer. The phrase, <span class="accented">mashkith naph'sho, corrumpens animam suam</span>, may be resolved into the concrete "a self-destroyer," as Delitzsch. The following verses seem to indicate that it is the temporal life which is referred to in <span class="accented">nephesh</span>, but the meaning of the term may be extended to embrace not only physical loss of life, but also moral and spiritual loss. By the Levitical Law adultery was punished by death: "The man that committeth adultery with another man's wife ... the adulterer and adulteress shall surely be put to death" (<a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>; cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/22-22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>; <a href="/john/8-4.htm">John 8:4, 5</a>; see also <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-6.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:6</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/6-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[But] he who commits adultery</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1465;&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#234;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5003.htm">Strong's 5003: </a> </span><span class="str2">To commit adultery, to apostatize</span><br /><br /><span class="word">lacks</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1505;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;sar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2638.htm">Strong's 2638: </a> </span><span class="str2">Needy, lacking, in want of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">judgment;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1461;&#1425;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3820.htm">Strong's 3820: </a> </span><span class="str2">The heart, the feelings, the will, the intellect, centre</span><br /><br /><span class="word">whoever</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">does so</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1469;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;en&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">destroys</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1469;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#353;&#183;&#7717;&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7843.htm">Strong's 7843: </a> </span><span class="str2">Perhaps to go to ruin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">himself.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1437;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(nap&#772;&#183;&#353;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5315.htm">Strong's 5315: </a> </span><span class="str2">A soul, living being, life, self, person, desire, passion, appetite, emotion </span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/6-32.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 6:32 He who commits adultery with a woman (Prov.
