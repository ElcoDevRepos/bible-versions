In biblical context, wisdom is often personified and is seen as an essential aspect of God's character (<a href="/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22-31</a>). The creation account in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a> reflects this wisdom, as God orders chaos into a structured and harmonious universe. The Hebrew word for "wisdom" (&#1495;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;, chokmah) implies skill and expertise, suggesting that creation was an intentional and skillful act. This wisdom is also reflected in the intricate design and order of nature, which is evident in the laws of physics and biology that govern the earth. Theologically, this wisdom is seen as a type of Christ, who is described as the "wisdom of God" in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>, indicating that Christ was integral to the creation process (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>).<p><b>and established the heavens by understanding</b><br>The term "understanding" (&#1514;&#1456;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;, tebunah) in this context refers to discernment and insight, highlighting God's ability to perceive and implement the complex systems that govern the heavens. The heavens, often representing the sky and celestial bodies, are a testament to God's understanding in their precise movements and functions (<a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1-4</a>). Historically, the ancient Near Eastern cultures viewed the heavens as a realm of divine activity, and the biblical narrative asserts that it is the LORD who has established them with purpose and order. This understanding is also prophetic, as it points to the ultimate restoration and new creation described in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>, where the heavens and earth are renewed. The connection to other scripture, such as <a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4-7</a>, further illustrates God's unmatched understanding in laying the earth's foundations and setting the stars in place.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal existence and His relationship with His people.

Wisdom, the creative power of God, exhibited as the protection of those who fear God</span>. The teacher in this discourse presents Wisdom under a new aspect. Wisdom is the Divine power of God, by which he created the world, and by which he sustains the work of his hands and regulates the operations of nature. This eminence of Wisdom, in her intimate association with Jehovah, is made the basis of a renewed exhortation to keep Wisdom steadily in view. The elevated thought that Wisdom has her source in Jehovah might seem in itself an adequate and sufficient reason for the exhortation. But another motive is adduced intimately bound up with this view of Wisdom. Jehovah becomes the ground of confidence and the protection in all conditions of life of those who keep Wisdom. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth.</span> The emphatic position of the word <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, "the Lord," at the beginning of the sentence (cf. <a href="/psalms/27.htm">Psalm 27</a>; <a href="/psalms/97.htm">Psalm 97</a>; <a href="/psalms/99.htm">Psalm 99</a>), as well as the nature of the discourse, indicates a new paragraph. The description of the creative Wisdom of Jehovah may have been suggested to the mind of the teacher by the mention of the tree of life, in ver. 18 (Zockler); but the connection between this and the preceding passage has to be sought for in something deeper. The scope of the teacher is to exhibit, and so to recommend, Wisdom in every respect, and after showing her excellence in man, he now brings her forward as the medium of creation, and hence in her relation to God. <span class="accented">By wisdom</span> (<span class="accented">b'kokhmah</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">sapientia</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>. It is evident that Wisdom is here something more than an attribute of Jehovah. "By Wisdom" means "by, or through, the instrumentality of Wisdom." While the corresponding and parallel expressions, "understanding," "knowledge," militate against the idea of an hypostatizing of Wisdom, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> assigning to Wisdom a concrete and objective personality, yet the language is sufficiently strong, when we connect this passage with ch. 1. and 8, to warrant our regarding Wisdom as something apart from yet intimately connected with Jehovah, as an active agency employed by him, and hence this description may. be looked upon as an anticipation of that which is more fully developed in ch. 8, where the characteristics which are wanting here are there worked out at length. The rabbins evidently connected the passage before us, as well as ch. 1 and 8, with <a href="/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, by rendering <span class="accented">b'reshith</span>, "in the beginning." by <span class="accented">b'kokhmah</span>, "by Wisdom." Our Lord identifies himself with the Divine Sophia, or Wisdom (<a href="/luke/11-49.htm">Luke 11:49</a>). And the language of St. John, "All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made" (<a href="/john/1-3.htm">John 1:3</a>), which assigns to the Logos, or Word of God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Christ, the act of creation (cf. <a href="/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10</a>, and especially the language of St. Paul, in <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16</a>), argues in favour of the view of some commentators who understand Wisdom to refer to the Second Person of the Trinity. The Logos was understood by Alexandrian Judaism to express the <span class="accented">manifestation</span> of the unseen God, the Absolute Being, in the creation and government of the world; and the Christian teachers, when they adopted this term, assigned to it a concrete meaning as indicating the Incarnate Word (see Bishop Lightfoot, in <a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>). For the passage, see <a href="/psalms/33-6.htm">Psalm 33:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-24.htm">Psalm 104:24</a>; <a href="/psalms/136-5.htm">Psalm 136:5</a>; and especially <a href="/jeremiah/10-12.htm">Jeremiah 10:12</a>, "He hath established the world by his wisdom," etc.; Jeremiah 51:55; Ecclus. 24:2, <span class="accented">seq.

While the primary meaning of <span class="accented">yasad</span> is "to give fixity to," "to lay fast," that of <span class="accented">konen</span>, rendered "he hath established," is "to set up," "to erect," and so "to <span class="accented">found</span>," from <span class="accented">kun</span>, or referring to the Arabic and Ethiopic cognate root, "to exist," "to give existence to." The marginal reading, "prepared," corresponds with the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>.
