In the context of ancient Israel, zeal without knowledge could lead to misguided actions, as seen in the story of Saul before he became Paul (<a href="/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3-4</a>). His fervor for the Jewish law led him to persecute Christians until he gained true knowledge through his encounter with Christ. This phrase emphasizes the importance of aligning one's passion with a correct understanding of God's will, as seen in <a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>, where a lack of knowledge leads to destruction. The balance of zeal and knowledge is crucial for living a life that honors God.<p><b>and he who hurries his footsteps misses the mark</b><br>This phrase warns against impulsive actions and decisions. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, haste was often associated with folly. The Hebrew concept of "missing the mark" is akin to sin, as seen in the original meaning of the word "sin" in Hebrew, which is "chata" (to miss the mark). This phrase suggests that rushing into decisions without careful consideration and guidance from God can lead to sin and failure. The story of King Saul's impatience in <a href="/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8-14</a> serves as a historical example, where his hasty decision to offer a sacrifice without waiting for Samuel led to his downfall. This principle is echoed in <a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19</a>, which advises believers to be "quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to become angry," highlighting the value of patience and discernment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

At first sight it looks as if some verse, to which this one was appended, had fallen out; but there is no trace in the versions of any such loss. We have had a verse beginning in the same manner (<a href="/proverbs/17-26.htm">Proverbs 17:26</a>), and here it seems to emphasize what follows - folly is bad, so is ignorance, when the soul lacks knowledge, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when a man does not know what to do, how to act in the circumstances of his life, has in fact no practical wisdom. Other things "not good" are named in <a href="/proverbs/18-5.htm">Proverbs 18:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-23.htm">Proverbs 20:23</a>; <a href="/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23</a>. And he that hasteth with his feet sinneth; misseth his way. Delitzsch confines the meaning of this hemistich to the undisciplined pursuit of knowledge: "He who hasteneth with the legs after it goeth astray," because he is neither intellectually nor morally clear as to his path or object. But the gnome is better taken in a more general sense. The ignorant man, who acts hastily without due deliberation, is sure to make grave mistakes, and to come to misfortune. Haste is opposed to knowledge, because the latter involves prudence and circumspection, while the former blunders on hurriedly, not seeing whither actions lead. We all have occasion to note the proverbs, <span class="accented">Festina lente</span>; "More haste, less speed." The history of Fabius, who, as Ennius said, <p><span class="accented">"Unus homo nobis cunctando restituit rem,"</span> <p>shows the value of deliberation and caution.
