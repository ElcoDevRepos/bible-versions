It acknowledges the value of hard work and diligence, particularly in the context of the virtuous woman described in <a href="/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>. In ancient Israel, a woman's work was often centered around the home, including tasks like weaving, cooking, and managing household affairs. The "fruit of her hands" symbolizes the tangible results of her labor, which in this context, are both material and spiritual blessings. This phrase also reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, where individuals are rewarded for their faithful management of resources and responsibilities (<a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>).<p><b>and let her works praise her at the gates</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, the city gates were not only the entrance to the city but also the place where legal matters were settled and public business was conducted. The gates served as a communal hub where elders and leaders gathered (<a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1-11</a>). The mention of "her works" praising her at the gates suggests public recognition and honor for her contributions, extending beyond her household to the broader community. This public acknowledgment aligns with the biblical theme of honoring those who fear the Lord and live righteously (<a href="/proverbs/22-29.htm">Proverbs 22:29</a>). The virtuous woman's works are a testament to her character and faith, echoing the New Testament teaching that faith without works is dead (<a href="/james/2-26.htm">James 2:26</a>). Her life serves as a type of Christ, who is also praised for His works and whose life exemplifies perfect obedience and service (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_virtuous_woman.htm">The Virtuous Woman</a></b><br>The subject of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>, often referred to as the "Proverbs 31 Woman," is a model of godly womanhood, characterized by her industriousness, wisdom, and fear of the Lord.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_gates.htm">The Gates</a></b><br>In ancient Israel, the city gates were not only a place of commerce but also where community leaders gathered to make decisions and where public recognition was given.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_lemuel.htm">King Lemuel</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>, who shares the wisdom taught to him by his mother, providing a framework for understanding the qualities of a virtuous woman.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_hard_work.htm">The Value of Hard Work</a></b><br>The "fruit of her hands" signifies the tangible results of diligent labor.

When her work is rooted in faithfulness, withholding its fruit would contradict God&#8217;s design.<p>&#8226; This is more than material provision; it is the right to enjoy satisfaction, respect, and personal fulfillment that flow from a life of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/12-14.htm">Proverbs 12:14</a>; 14:23).<p>&#8226; By urging others to &#8220;give&#8221; her that fruit, the verse calls family, community, and leadership to acknowledge her contributions instead of taking them for granted (compare <a href="/ruth/3-11.htm">Ruth 3:11</a>, where Boaz publicly recognizes Ruth&#8217;s noble character).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let her works praise her at the gates</b><p>The verse continues: &#8220;and let her works praise her at the gates&#8221;.<p>&#8226; &#8220;The gates&#8221; were the public square where elders rendered judgments (<a href="/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>).

Jesus echoed this principle: &#8220;Let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Public commendation of godly deeds bolsters community standards (<a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>) and encourages others to follow her example (<a href="/acts/9-36.htm">Acts 9:36</a> speaks of Dorcas, whose good works were acclaimed by all).<p>&#8226; The call to let her works praise her guards against envy or forgetfulness; righteousness should not be hidden under a basket (<a href="/proverbs/12-8.htm">Proverbs 12:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/111-10.htm">Psalm 111:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/31-31.htm">Proverbs 31:31</a> commands the community to reward and honor a virtuous woman both privately (&#8220;the fruit of her hands&#8221;) and publicly (&#8220;praise her at the gates&#8221;).

Septuagint, "Give her of the fruit of her lips." <span class="cmt_word">And let her own works praise her in the gates</span>. She needs no farfetched laudation; her life long actions speak for themselves. Where men most congregate, where the heads of the people meet in solemn assembly, there her praise is sung, and a unanimous verdict assigns to her the highest honour. Septuagint, "Let her husband be praised in the gates." This frequent introduction of the husband is cuprous. St. Gregory thus spiritualizes the passage: "As the entrance of a city is called the gate, so is the day of judgment the gate of the kingdom, since all the elect go in thereby to the glory of their heavenly country.... Of these gates Solomon says, 'Give her of the fruit of her hands, and her own works shall praise her in the gates.' For holy Church then receives of 'the fruit of her hands,' when the recompensing of her labour raises her up to the possession of heavenly blessings; for her 'works then praise her in the gates,' when in the very entrance to his kingdom the words are spoken to his members, 'I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat,' etc." ('Moral.,' 6:9). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/31-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Give</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;n&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">her</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1453;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">the fruit</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(mip&#183;p&#601;&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6529.htm">Strong's 6529: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fruit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of her hands,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1462;&#1425;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;e&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - fdc &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3027.htm">Strong's 3027: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and let her works</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;e&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4639.htm">Strong's 4639: </a> </span><span class="str2">An action, a transaction, activity, a product, property</span><br /><br /><span class="word">praise her</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1500;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#238;&#183;hal&#183;l&#363;&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Conjunctive imperfect - third person masculine plural &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1984.htm">Strong's 1984: </a> </span><span class="str2">To shine</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at the gates.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;a&#353;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8179.htm">Strong's 8179: </a> </span><span class="str2">An opening, door, gate</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/31-31.htm">Proverbs 31:31 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/31-31.htm">Proverbs 31:31 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/31-31.htm">Proverbs 31:31 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/31-31.htm">Proverbs 31:31 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/31-31.htm">Proverbs 31:31 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/31-31.htm">Proverbs 31:31  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/31-31.htm">Proverbs 31:31 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/31-31.htm">Proverbs 31:31 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/31-31.htm">Proverbs 31:31 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/31-31.htm">Proverbs 31:31 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/31-31.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 31:31 Give her of the fruit of her (Prov.
