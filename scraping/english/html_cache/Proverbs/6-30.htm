However, this phrase suggests a nuanced understanding of human behavior and motivation. The cultural context acknowledges that while theft is wrong, there is a degree of empathy for those driven by necessity. This reflects a broader biblical theme of justice tempered with mercy, as seen in the laws of restitution in <a href="/exodus/22.htm">Exodus 22:1-4</a>, where the focus is on restoring what was lost rather than purely punishing the offender.<p><b>if he steals to satisfy his hunger</b><br>This phrase highlights the basic human need for survival, which can sometimes lead individuals to desperate actions. In the agrarian society of ancient Israel, where food security was a constant concern, hunger was a powerful motivator. The Bible often addresses the plight of the poor and the responsibility of the community to care for them, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>, which commands landowners to leave the edges of their fields for the needy. This reflects God's compassion and provision for the marginalized, a theme that is echoed in the teachings of Jesus, who fed the hungry and taught about the importance of caring for "the least of these" (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_thief.htm">The Thief</a></b><br>Represents individuals who resort to stealing due to dire circumstances, such as hunger.

David&#8217;s men ate the consecrated bread and the priest showed understanding (<a href="/1_samuel/21-3.htm">1 Samuel 21:3-6</a>).

Again, the thief can make retribution, while the adulterer can have none to offer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - The teacher continues his argument with another illustration, still keeping in view his object, which is to show that the punishment of the adulterer is a surely impending one and severe in its character. The argument in vers. 30-33 is one <span class="accented">a fortiori</span>. If men do not overlook but severely punish a crime which has been committed under extenuating circumstances, much less will they do so where the crime is of a much graver character and has nothing to excuse it. Theft and adultery are brought into comparison. Theft under all circumstances is a lesser crime than adultery, but here it is minimized to the lowest degree. The case of a man is taken who steals to satisfy his hunger; the extent of the theft cannot be large, but yet he is punished, and called upon to make the amplest restitution. Much more, does the teacher infer, will be the punishment, and equally certain, where adultery is in question, and the crime is of the most heinous character affecting the most precious interests, and indulged in from the lowest of motives. <span class="cmt_word">Men do not despise a thief,</span> etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they do not condemn him under the circumstances, <span class="accented">non grandis est culpa</span> (Vulgate), "the fault is not a great one;" but they do despise an adulterer - him they hold in contempt as one "who lacketh understanding" and destroyeth his own soul (ver. 32). The verb <span class="accented">buz</span> has, however, been otherwise rendered as "to overlook." Zockler and Holden explain, "men do not overlook," though the former gives the literal sense as "men do not despise." Gesenius renders "despise," but explains, "<span class="accented">i.e.</span> they do not let him go unpunished." Vatablus, the Versions, Ariae, Montani, and Munsteri, Hitzig, Delitzsch, and Gesenius, Stuart, Muenscher, and Wordsworth, all agree m regarding the proper meaning of the verb to be "to despise" or "to treat scornfully." The verb <span class="accented">buz</span>, moreover, occurs in this sense in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/11-12.htm">Proverbs 11:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-13.htm">Proverbs 13:13</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-21.htm">Proverbs 14:21</a>; <a href="/proverbs/23-9.htm">Proverbs 23:9</a>; and <a href="/songs/8-1.htm">Song of Solomon 8:1, 7</a>. Michaelis's explanation is as follows: "although a theft is deservedly regarded as infamous in the commonwealth, nevertheless, if it be compared with adultery, it is less wicked." The rendering of the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bb;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "it is not a wonder if any thief be taken," it is difficult to reconcile with the text in the original, though it may be explained as expressing the certainty of arrest which follows theft, and thus gives colour to the secondary meaning attached to the verb, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that of overlooking.
