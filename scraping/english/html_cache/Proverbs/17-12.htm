In the ancient Near East, bears were known to inhabit regions such as the forests of Lebanon and the hills of Israel. The bear, particularly a mother bear, is a symbol of fierce protectiveness and aggression when her young are threatened. This imagery is used elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/2_kings/2-24.htm">2 Kings 2:24</a>, where bears attack those who mock the prophet Elisha. The comparison highlights the extreme danger and irrationality of a bear in such a state, setting the stage for the comparison to follow.<p><b>than a fool in his folly</b><br>The term "fool" in biblical literature often refers to someone who is morally deficient, lacking wisdom and understanding of God's ways. Proverbs frequently contrasts the wise and the foolish, emphasizing the consequences of living without regard for divine instruction. The folly of a fool is not merely ignorance but a willful rejection of wisdom and righteousness. This phrase suggests that the destructive potential of a fool's actions is even more dangerous than the wrath of a bereaved bear. The fool's folly can lead to chaos and harm, not only to themselves but to those around them. This concept is echoed in other parts of Proverbs, such as <a href="/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11</a>, which compares a fool returning to his folly to a dog returning to its vomit, illustrating the repetitive and self-destructive nature of foolishness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bear_robbed_of_her_cubs.htm">Bear Robbed of Her Cubs</a></b><br>This imagery is used to describe a situation of extreme danger and unpredictability. In the natural world, a mother bear separated from her cubs is known for her fierce and aggressive behavior, making her a symbol of imminent threat.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/fool.htm">Fool</a></b><br>In the context of Proverbs, a fool is someone who rejects wisdom and understanding, often characterized by reckless and destructive behavior.

A mother bear robbed of her cubs attacks with unrestrained fury&#8212;strong enough to tear a person apart (<a href="/2_kings/2-24.htm">2 Kings 2:24</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-8.htm">Hosea 13:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The danger is immediate, obvious, and physical. Anyone who sees such a bear would instinctively flee, knowing survival depends on distance.<p>&#8226; Scripture never downplays real, bodily threats (<a href="/psalms/22-12.htm">Psalm 22:12&#8211;13</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34&#8211;37</a>), yet here it is used as a lesser extreme to make a greater point.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>than a fool in his folly</b><p>&#8226; A &#8220;fool&#8221; in Proverbs is not merely ignorant but morally obstinate&#8212;one who &#8220;says in his heart, &#8216;There is no God&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>) and despises wisdom and discipline (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;In his folly&#8221; pictures the fool actively venting his reckless thinking. He spreads strife (<a href="/proverbs/18-6.htm">Proverbs 18:6</a>), rejects correction (<a href="/proverbs/15-5.htm">Proverbs 15:5</a>), drags others into sin (<a href="/proverbs/12-26.htm">Proverbs 12:26</a>), and repeats destructive patterns like &#8220;a dog returning to its vomit&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Unlike the bear, the fool&#8217;s danger is subtle: he wounds minds, relationships, and souls. Exposure can corrode faith (<a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>) and even invite God&#8217;s judgment (<a href="/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The comparison underscores that spiritual and moral peril outweighs physical threat. One might escape a bear with quick feet; escaping a fool often requires decisive separation (<a href="/proverbs/14-7.htm">Proverbs 14:7</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/3-5.htm">2 Timothy 3:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/17-12.htm">Proverbs 17:12</a> teaches that deliberate foolishness is more hazardous than the fiercest animal attack. Physical harm is serious, but the corrupting influence of a fool strikes deeper, distorting truth and luring others into sin. Wisdom therefore calls us to recognize the danger, steer clear of persistent fools, and cling to the Lord, &#8220;for the fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">A bear robbed of her whelps.--</span>Proverbially dangerous then (<a href="/2_samuel/17-8.htm" title="For, said Hushai, you know your father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.">2Samuel 17:8</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-8.htm" title="I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the lobe of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.">Hosea 13:8</a>).

The ferocity of the bear when deprived of its young had become proverbial (see <a href="/2_samuel/17-8.htm">2 Samuel 17:8</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-8.htm">Hosea 13:8</a>; Hart, 'Animals of the Bible,' 28, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Rather than a fool in his folly;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the paroxysm of his passion.

The Greek translators take "bear" as us d metaphorically for terror and anxiety, but go far astray from the Hebrew text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/17-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[It is better]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to meet</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1490;&#1452;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#257;&#183;&#7713;&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6298.htm">Strong's 6298: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in contact with, to concur</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a bear</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1677.htm">Strong's 1677: </a> </span><span class="str2">The bear</span><br /><br /><span class="word">robbed of her cubs</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;ak&#183;k&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7909.htm">Strong's 7909: </a> </span><span class="str2">Childless</span><br /><br /><span class="word">than</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_408.htm">Strong's 408: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a fool</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1437;&#1505;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;s&#238;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3684.htm">Strong's 3684: </a> </span><span class="str2">Stupid fellow, dullard, fool</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in his folly.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1493;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8217;iw&#183;wal&#183;t&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_200.htm">Strong's 200: </a> </span><span class="str2">Silliness</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/17-12.htm">Proverbs 17:12 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/17-12.htm">Proverbs 17:12 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/17-12.htm">Proverbs 17:12 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/17-12.htm">Proverbs 17:12 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/17-12.htm">Proverbs 17:12 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/17-12.htm">Proverbs 17:12  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/17-12.htm">Proverbs 17:12 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/17-12.htm">Proverbs 17:12 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/17-12.htm">Proverbs 17:12 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/17-12.htm">Proverbs 17:12 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/17-12.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 17:12 Let a bear robbed of her cubs (Prov.
