In biblical times, thorns often symbolized sin, curse, and desolation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>, where thorns and thistles are part of the curse on the ground after the Fall. The presence of thorns indicates a failure to maintain spiritual and moral discipline, reflecting the broader biblical theme that spiritual neglect leads to chaos and disorder. The imagery of thorns growing everywhere suggests a pervasive problem, emphasizing the need for vigilance in one's spiritual life.<p><b>Thistles had covered the ground</b><br>Thistles, like thorns, are a sign of neglect and are often associated with barrenness and fruitlessness. In the ancient Near East, thistles were common in neglected fields, symbolizing the result of idleness and lack of stewardship. This imagery is used to convey the idea that without proper care and attention, one's life can become overrun with problems and sin. The covering of the ground with thistles suggests a complete takeover, indicating that once sin and neglect take root, they can dominate one's life, making it difficult to produce good fruit, as seen in the parable of the sower (<a href="/matthew/13-7.htm">Matthew 13:7</a>).<p><b>And the stone wall was broken down</b><br>The stone wall represents protection and boundaries, both physically and spiritually. In ancient Israel, walls were crucial for defense against enemies and wild animals. A broken-down wall signifies vulnerability and exposure to danger. Spiritually, it suggests a lack of discipline and self-control, leading to moral and spiritual decay. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28</a>, which compares a person without self-control to a city with broken-down walls. The broken wall serves as a warning of the consequences of neglecting one's spiritual defenses, highlighting the importance of maintaining strong boundaries to protect against sin and temptation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sluggard's_field.htm">The Sluggard's Field</a></b><br>This verse is part of a larger passage (<a href="/proverbs/24-30.htm">Proverbs 24:30-34</a>) that describes the field of a sluggard, a person characterized by laziness and neglect.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/thorns_and_thistles.htm">Thorns and Thistles</a></b><br>These are symbolic of neglect and the consequences of idleness.

The two verses are thus rendered, or morally applied, in the Septuagint: "A foolish man is as a farm. and a man wanting in sense is as a vineyard; if you leave him, he will be barren, and will be altogether covered with weeds, and he will become deserted, and his fences of stone are broken down." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/24-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Thorns</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(qim&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#347;&#333;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2738.htm">Strong's 2738: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pointed, a bramble, other thorny weed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had grown up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1432;&#1500;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5927.htm">Strong's 5927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ascend, in, actively</span><br /><br /><span class="word">everywhere,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1448;&#1493;&#1465;
