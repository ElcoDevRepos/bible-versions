In biblical times, prudence was highly valued as it demonstrated an ability to foresee potential problems and act accordingly. The concept of seeing danger and taking cover can be likened to the wisdom of Joseph in <a href="/genesis/41.htm">Genesis 41</a>, who prepared Egypt for the coming famine. This phrase emphasizes the importance of foresight and the willingness to act on it, a principle that is echoed in Jesus' teachings about being watchful and prepared (<a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42-44</a>).<p><b>but the simple keep going</b><br>The "simple" are those who lack wisdom and discernment, often characterized by naivety or foolishness. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, simplicity was not merely a lack of intelligence but a failure to apply knowledge in a practical way. This phrase suggests a disregard for warning signs and a tendency to proceed without caution. The simple are contrasted with the prudent, highlighting a recurring theme in Proverbs: the consequences of ignoring wisdom. This is reminiscent of the parable of the ten virgins in <a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>, where the foolish virgins fail to prepare for the bridegroom's arrival.<p><b>and suffer the consequences</b><br>The consequences mentioned here are the natural results of ignoring wisdom and failing to heed warnings. In the historical context, this could refer to physical danger, financial ruin, or moral failure. The Bible often illustrates the principle of sowing and reaping (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>), where actions have inevitable outcomes. This phrase serves as a warning that ignoring wisdom leads to suffering, a theme that is consistent throughout Scripture. The consequences faced by the simple can be seen as a form of divine justice, where God allows individuals to experience the results of their choices, much like the Israelites faced consequences for their disobedience throughout their history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prudent.htm">The Prudent</a></b><br>This refers to individuals who are wise, discerning, and able to foresee potential dangers or challenges.

Noah didn&#8217;t merely recognize the coming flood&#8212;he built the ark (<a href="/genesis/6-13.htm">Genesis 6:13-14</a>).<p>- <a href="/psalms/57-1.htm">Psalm 57:1</a> pictures this refuge language: &#8220;Be merciful to me, O God&#8230; in You my soul takes refuge; in the shadow of Your wings I will take shelter until the danger has passed.&#8221;<p>- Practical expressions today:<p>&#8226; Turning off a screen when temptation pops up (cf. <a href="/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Cutting spending when financial warning lights flash (cf. <a href="/proverbs/21-20.htm">Proverbs 21:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Changing a friendship that drags you toward sin (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But the simple keep going</b><p>- &#8220;Simple&#8221; in Proverbs refers to the na&#239;ve&#8212;those easily led because they refuse wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>).<p>- They press on without pause, like the youth who &#8220;passed along the street near her corner&#8221; in <a href="/proverbs/7-7.htm">Proverbs 7:7-8</a>, blind to moral peril.<p>- This stubborn momentum rejects loving counsel (<a href="/proverbs/12-15.htm">Proverbs 12:15</a>) and ignores the Spirit&#8217;s warnings (<a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And suffer the consequences</b><p>- Choices reap outcomes; &#8220;Do not be deceived&#8230; whatever a man sows, he will reap&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>).<p>- <a href="/proverbs/1-31.htm">Proverbs 1:31</a> states it plainly: &#8220;They will eat the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices.&#8221;<p>- Consequences may arrive as:<p>&#8226; Broken trust and relationships (<a href="/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32-33</a>).<p>&#8226; Financial loss (<a href="/proverbs/21-5.htm">Proverbs 21:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritual dullness or discipline from the Lord (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a> draws a vivid contrast: the discerning believer recognizes approaching harm and wisely seeks shelter in obedience, while the na&#239;ve plows ahead and reaps painful results. Scripture urges us to cultivate prudence, listen to warning signs, and run to God&#8217;s protective wisdom, sparing ourselves needless hardship and honoring the Lord who graciously reveals danger before it strikes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself,</span> as the Israelites hid themselves within their houses from the destroying angel, Noah within the Ark, the Christians before the fall of Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/21-21.htm" title="Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let them which are in the middle of it depart out; and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto.">Luke 21:21</a>) in Pella. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/26-20.htm" title="Come, my people, enter you into your chambers, and shut your doors about you: hide yourself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be over.">Isaiah 26:20</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A prudent man foresesth the evil, and hideth himself.</span> The whole verse is repeated in <a href="/proverbs/27-12.htm">Proverbs 27:12</a>. St. Jerome has <span class="accented">callidus</span>, and the LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> the translation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">arum</span>); but it must be taken in a good sense, as cautions, farseeing, prudent (see note on Proverbs 1:4) Such a man looks around, takes warning from little circumstances which might escape the observation of careless persons, and provides for his safety in good time. Thus the Christians at the siege of Jerusalem, believing Christ's warnings, retired to Pella, and wine saved. A Spanish proverb runs, "That which the fool does in the end, the wise man does at the beginning." <span class="cmt_word">The simple pass on, and are punished.</span> The subject of the former hemistich is in the singular number, for a really prudent man is a comparatively rare bring; the second clause is plural, teaching us, as Hitzig observes, that many simple ones are found for one prudent. These silly persons, blundering blindly on their way, without circumspection or forethought, meet with immediate punishment, incur dangers, suffer less. A Cornish proverb runs, "He who will not be ruled by the rudder must be ruled by the rock." Septuagint, "An intelligent man (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) seeing a wicked man punished is himself forcibly instructed; but fools pass by, and are punished" (comp. <a href="/proverbs/21-11.htm">Proverbs 21:11</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/22-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The prudent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1472;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;r&#363;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6175.htm">Strong's 6175: </a> </span><span class="str2">Crafty, shrewd, sensible</span><br /><br /><span class="word">see</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">danger</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7451.htm">Strong's 7451: </a> </span><span class="str2">Bad, evil</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and take cover,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;nis&#183;t&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Nifal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5641.htm">Strong's 5641: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hide, conceal</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but the simple</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1437;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;&#183;y&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6612.htm">Strong's 6612: </a> </span><span class="str2">Simple, perhaps open-minded</span><br /><br /><span class="word">keep going</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5674.htm">Strong's 5674: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pass over, through, or by, pass on</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and suffer the consequences.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1469;&#1504;&#1462;&#1506;&#1457;&#1504;&#1464;&#1469;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ne&#183;&#8216;&#277;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#353;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Nifal - Conjunctive perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6064.htm">Strong's 6064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To urge, to inflict a, penalty, to fine</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/22-3.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 22:3 A prudent man sees danger and hides (Prov.
