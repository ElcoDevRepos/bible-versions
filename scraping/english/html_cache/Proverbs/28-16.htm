Lacking judgment implies a deficiency in wisdom and discernment, qualities highly valued in leaders like Solomon, who asked God for wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9</a>). This phrase warns against leaders who fail to seek divine guidance, leading to poor decision-making. The Bible often contrasts wise and foolish leaders, emphasizing the importance of wisdom in governance (<a href="/proverbs/8-15.htm">Proverbs 8:15-16</a>).<p><b>is also a great oppressor</b><br>Oppression in the Bible is frequently condemned, as it goes against God's justice and righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/10.htm">Isaiah 10:1-2</a>). A leader without judgment may resort to oppressive tactics to maintain control, reflecting a failure to uphold the principles of justice and mercy. Historical examples include Pharaoh's oppression of the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/1-11.htm">Exodus 1:11-14</a>) and the unjust rulers criticized by the prophets (<a href="/ezekiel/22-29.htm">Ezekiel 22:29</a>). This phrase highlights the destructive impact of poor leadership on society.<p><b>but he who hates dishonest profit</b><br>The Bible consistently denounces dishonest gain, associating it with corruption and moral decay (<a href="/proverbs/11.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>). Leaders are called to act with integrity, avoiding bribes and corruption (<a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>). Hating dishonest profit reflects a commitment to righteousness and fairness, aligning with God's character. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where leaders are urged to be above reproach and not greedy for gain (<a href="/1_timothy/3-3.htm">1 Timothy 3:3</a>).<p><b>will prolong his days</b><br>The promise of prolonged days is often linked to living righteously and following God's commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>). This phrase suggests that leaders who reject corruption and embrace integrity will experience God's favor and longevity. It reflects the biblical principle that righteousness leads to life, while wickedness leads to destruction (<a href="/proverbs/10-27.htm">Proverbs 10:27</a>). This idea is also seen in the blessings and curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where obedience results in blessings, including long life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/leader.htm">Leader</a></b><br>Refers to anyone in a position of authority or governance, whether in a family, community, or nation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/oppressor.htm">Oppressor</a></b><br>Someone who exercises authority in a harsh or unjust manner, often exploiting others for personal gain.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/dishonest_profit.htm">Dishonest Profit</a></b><br>Ill-gotten gains acquired through deceitful or unethical means.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prolonging_days.htm">Prolonging Days</a></b><br>A Hebrew idiom suggesting a long life, often associated with living righteously and in accordance with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_responsibility_of_leadership.htm">The Responsibility of Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders are called to exercise wisdom and discernment.

Comp. the woe pronounced upon Jehoiakim (<a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm" title="Woe to him that builds his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that uses his neighbor's service without wages, and gives him not for his work;">Jeremiah 22:13</a>, <span class= "ital">sqq.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and rich in oppression</span>. Ewald, Delitzsch, Nowack, and others take the verse, not as a statement, but as a warning addressed to the ruler, as we have so many addressed to a son, and as the author of the Book of Wisdom calls upon the judges of the earth to listen to his admonitions. They therefore render thus: "O prince, void of understanding, but rich in oppression!" The wording and accentuation of the passage confirm this view. Caher renders, "A prince that wants understanding increases his exactions." The want of intelligence makes a prince cruel and tyrannical and callous to suffering: not possessing the wisdom and prudence necessary for right government, he defrauds his subjects, treats them unjustly, and causes great misery. See the prophet's denunciation of Shallum and Jehoiakim for these very crimes (<a href="/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13-19</a>). Septuagint, "A king wanting revenues is a great oppresser (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>)." <span class="cmt_word">He that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days</span> (<a href="/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a>). The prince addressed is thus warned that his oppressive acts will be visited upon him judicially; that only a ruler who deals with his subjects liberally and equitably can attain to old age, and that his conduct will shorten his life. An early death is reckoned as a token of God's indignation. The second hemistich Caher translates, "But he who hates lucre shall reign long." Septuagint, "He who hateth iniquity shall live a long time."
