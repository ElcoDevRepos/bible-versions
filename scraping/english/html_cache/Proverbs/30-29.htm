The use of "three" and "four" is a poetic way to emphasize completeness and to draw attention to the list that follows. The term "stately" suggests dignity and grace, qualities that are admired in biblical texts. This can be seen as a reflection of God's creation, where order and beauty are evident. The concept of "stride" implies movement and progress, which can be metaphorically linked to the journey of faith and the walk of a believer in righteousness.<p><b>and four that are impressive in their walk:</b><br>The transition from "three" to "four" adds emphasis and invites the reader to consider the significance of the additional item. The word "impressive" indicates something that commands respect or admiration, which in biblical terms often relates to divine wisdom or the manifestation of God's glory. The "walk" can be understood as a metaphor for one's conduct or way of life, a common theme in Proverbs where the path of wisdom is contrasted with the path of folly. This phrase encourages reflection on the qualities that make one's life pleasing to God, aligning with the broader biblical narrative that calls for a life of integrity and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/agur.htm">Agur</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/30.htm">Proverbs 30</a>, Agur son of Jakeh, is a figure about whom little is known.

This numeric device draws the listener in, signaling a short list that will teach a moral truth (compare <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16</a>; 30:18; 30:21).<p>&#8226; By stating a definite number, the writer assures us that every item is chosen by divine design, reinforcing the precision and reliability of Scripture (<a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that are stately in their stride</b><p>The verse continues, highlighting the dignity of certain creatures.<p>&#8226;
