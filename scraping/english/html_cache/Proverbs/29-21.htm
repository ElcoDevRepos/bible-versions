The term "pampered" suggests excessive indulgence or lack of discipline. In biblical times, a servant's role was to serve and learn discipline, often under the guidance of a master. The idea of pampering a servant from youth implies a lack of proper training and discipline, which was crucial for maintaining order and respect within a household. This phrase can be connected to the broader biblical principle of training and discipline, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a>, which emphasizes the importance of guiding a child in the right way.<p><b>will bring grief in the end</b><br>The consequence of pampering a servant is described as bringing "grief in the end." This suggests that the lack of discipline and proper training will lead to negative outcomes, both for the servant and the master. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a warning against neglecting the importance of discipline and responsibility. The grief mentioned here can be understood as the disruption of household harmony, loss of respect, or even rebellion. This principle is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/19-18.htm">Proverbs 19:18</a>, which advises correcting a child to prevent future regret. The idea of consequences for lack of discipline is a recurring theme in the Bible, emphasizing the importance of wisdom and foresight in leadership and relationships.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/servant.htm">Servant</a></b><br>In the context of ancient Israel, a servant was often someone who worked in a household or estate, sometimes as a bondservant or slave.

A servant&#8217;s role is crucial, but proper boundaries and expectations must exist.<p>&#8226; The verse assumes literal servants, yet by application it also addresses any subordinate&#8212;employees, students, even children&#8212;who receive direction from those in charge (<a href="/luke/12-42.htm">Luke 12:42-44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pampered</b><p>&#8226; To &#8220;pamper&#8221; is to indulge, spare from hardship, or withhold needed discipline. <a href="/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a> warns, &#8220;He who spares the rod hates his son.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Overindulgence erodes character: &#8220;Whoever is slack in his work is brother to him who destroys&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/18-9.htm">Proverbs 18:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Without consistent correction a servant may confuse kindness with license, assuming privileges rather than responsibilities.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From his youth</b><p>&#8226; Early patterns shape lifelong habits: &#8220;Train up a child in the way he should go&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Allowing indulgence &#8220;from his youth&#8221; cements entitlement.

But here the warning seems to be rather against spoiling a slave by over-indulgence, lest he at the last forget his position, just as old and petted servants are apt to become somewhat dictatorial.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/29.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child.</span> The verb <span class="accented">panak</span>, which is not found elsewhere in the Old Testament, is rightly here translated as in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">qui delicate nutrit</span>. It refers to the spoiling a person by over-refinement, luxury, and pampering - a treatment peculiarly unsuitable in the case of a bond servant, and one which makes such forgetful of his dependent position. Septuagint, "He that liveth wantonly (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fb7;</span>) from childhood shall be a servant."

The word rendered "son" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, <span class="accented">manon</span>) is of doubtful meaning, and has been variously understood or misunderstood by interpreters. Septuagint, "And in the end shall have pain (<span class="greek">&#x1f40;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) over himself;" Symmachus, "shall have murmuring (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>);" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Postea sentiet eum contumacem</span>. Ewald translates "ungrateful;" Delitzsch, "place of increase," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. a household of pampered scapegraces; but one does not see how the disaster can be called a place or a house. It seems safest in this uncertainty to adopt the Jewish interpretation of "progeny:" "he will be as a son." The pampered servant will end by claiming the privileges of a son, and perhaps ousting the legitimate children from their inheritance (comp. <a href="/proverbs/17-2.htm">Proverbs 17:2</a>; and the case of Ziba and Mephibosheth, <a href="/2_samuel/16-4.htm">2 Samuel 16:4</a>). "Fodder, a stick, and burdens are for the ass; and bread, correction, and work for a servant. If thou set thy servant to labour, thou shalt find rest; but if thou let him go idle, he will seek liberty" (Ecclus. 33:24, etc.). Spiritual writers have applied this proverb to the pampering of the flesh, which ought to be under the control of its master, the spirit, but which, if gratified and unrestrained, gets the upper hand, and, like a spoiled servant, dictates to its lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/29-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A servant</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1489;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7687;&#183;d&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5650.htm">Strong's 5650: </a> </span><span class="str2">Slave, servant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">pampered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1508;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;p&#772;an&#183;n&#234;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6445.htm">Strong's 6445: </a> </span><span class="str2">To indulge, pamper</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from his youth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(min&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#8216;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5290.htm">Strong's 5290: </a> </span><span class="str2">Youth, early life</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will bring</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(yih&#183;yeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">grief</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1504;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;n&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4497.htm">Strong's 4497: </a> </span><span class="str2">Perhaps thankless one</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the end.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1437;&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_319.htm">Strong's 319: </a> </span><span class="str2">The last, end, the future, posterity</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/29-21.htm">Proverbs 29:21 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/29-21.htm">Proverbs 29:21 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/29-21.htm">Proverbs 29:21 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/29-21.htm">Proverbs 29:21 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/29-21.htm">Proverbs 29:21 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/29-21.htm">Proverbs 29:21  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/29-21.htm">Proverbs 29:21 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/29-21.htm">Proverbs 29:21 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/29-21.htm">Proverbs 29:21 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/29-21.htm">Proverbs 29:21 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/29-21.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 29:21 He who pampers his servant from youth (Prov.
