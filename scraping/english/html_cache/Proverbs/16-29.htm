In biblical context, violence is often associated with sin and rebellion against God's order (<a href="/genesis/6-11.htm">Genesis 6:11-13</a>). The Hebrew word for "violent" can also imply injustice or oppression, suggesting a broader scope of wrongdoing. The Bible consistently warns against aligning with such individuals (<a href="/proverbs/3-31.htm">Proverbs 3:31</a>, <a href="/psalms/11-5.htm">Psalm 11:5</a>), as their actions are contrary to the peace and righteousness God desires.<p><b>entices his neighbor</b><br>Enticement here implies deception or persuasion, often with malicious intent. The neighbor, in biblical terms, is not just a person living nearby but anyone with whom one interacts (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>). This phrase highlights the danger of being led astray by those who do not have one's best interests at heart. The Bible frequently warns against being misled by others, emphasizing the importance of discernment and wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>).<p><b>and leads him down a path</b><br>The imagery of a path is common in Scripture, symbolizing one's way of life or moral direction (<a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>, <a href="/proverbs/4-14.htm">Proverbs 4:14</a>). A path can lead to righteousness or destruction, depending on the choices made. This phrase suggests a deliberate guiding or influencing of another's life choices, often away from God's intended path. The Bible encourages believers to seek the path of wisdom and righteousness (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><b>that is not good</b><br>This phrase underscores the negative outcome of following the violent man's influence. In biblical terms, "not good" often equates to sin, folly, or actions that lead away from God's will (<a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>). The Bible contrasts the way of the wicked with the way of the righteous, urging believers to pursue what is good and pleasing to God (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>). This serves as a warning to remain vigilant and steadfast in one's faith and moral convictions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/v/violent_man.htm">Violent Man</a></b><br>This refers to an individual who uses force or aggression to achieve their goals.
