In biblical context, this behavior is contrasted with the generosity encouraged throughout Scripture. The Bible frequently warns against greed and selfishness, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, which states that the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. The character of a stingy person is often depicted as lacking trust in God's provision, which is a recurring theme in Proverbs.<p><b>hastens after wealth</b><br>This phrase suggests a frantic pursuit of riches, often at the expense of ethical considerations or spiritual well-being. The Bible consistently warns against the dangers of prioritizing wealth over righteousness. In <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, Jesus teaches about storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth, emphasizing the temporary nature of earthly wealth. The haste implies impatience and a lack of contentment, which are contrary to the virtues of patience and trust in God's timing.<p><b>and does not know</b><br>This indicates a lack of awareness or understanding, often associated with spiritual blindness or ignorance. In the biblical narrative, wisdom and knowledge are highly valued, and the lack thereof can lead to one's downfall. <a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a> states, "My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge," highlighting the importance of understanding God's ways and the consequences of ignoring them.<p><b>that poverty awaits him</b><br>The outcome of a life driven by greed and stinginess is ultimately poverty, not just in material terms but also spiritually and relationally. This reflects the biblical principle of sowing and reaping, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>, where it is stated that one reaps what they sow. The pursuit of wealth without regard for righteousness leads to spiritual impoverishment, aligning with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a>, where He warns against all kinds of greed, stating that life does not consist in an abundance of possessions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/stingy_man.htm">Stingy Man</a></b><br>This refers to an individual characterized by greed and a lack of generosity. The Hebrew word used here can imply someone who is narrow-minded or selfish in their pursuit of wealth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/wealth.htm">Wealth</a></b><br>In this context, wealth represents material riches or financial gain that the stingy man is pursuing. The pursuit is driven by a desire for more, often at the expense of ethical considerations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/poverty.htm">Poverty</a></b><br>This is the eventual outcome for the stingy man. Despite his efforts to accumulate wealth, he is unaware that his greed will lead to a lack of true prosperity, both materially and spiritually.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_deceptive_nature_of_greed.htm">The Deceptive Nature of Greed</a></b><br>Greed can blind individuals to the true consequences of their actions. The pursuit of wealth for its own sake often leads to spiritual and sometimes material poverty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/true_wealth_in_godliness.htm">True Wealth in Godliness</a></b><br>True prosperity is found in godliness and contentment, not in the accumulation of material wealth.

The man of evil eye (<a href="/proverbs/23-6.htm">Proverbs 23:6</a>) is the envious and covetous man; such a one tries to improve his position and raise himself speedily to the height of him whom he envies, and is quite unscrupulous as to the means which he uses to effect his purpose, and keeps all that he gains selfishly to himself.

His grasping greed brings no blessing with it (<a href="/proverbs/11-25.htm">Proverbs 11:25</a>), excites others to defraud him, and in the end consigns him to merited poverty. The LXX. here reads somewhat differently, and translates, "An envious man hasteth to be rich, and knows not that the merciful man (<span class="accented">chasid</span> instead of <span class="accented">cheser</span>) will I,ave the mastery over him," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. will take his wealth, as ver. 8.

Here are a few more: Spanish, "Who would be rich in a year gets hanged in half a year;" Italian, "The river does not become swollen with clear water;" says a Scotch proverb, "Better a wee fire to warm as than a meikle fire to burn us." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/28-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A stingy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(ra&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7451.htm">Strong's 7451: </a> </span><span class="str2">Bad, evil</span><br /><br /><span class="word">man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1453;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">hastens</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1469;&#1489;&#1459;&#1492;&#1464;&#1445;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(ni&#183;&#7687;o&#183;h&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_926.htm">Strong's 926: </a> </span><span class="str2">To tremble inwardly, be, alarmed, agitated, to hasten anxiously</span><br /><br /><span class="word">after wealth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1492;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#183;h&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1952.htm">Strong's 1952: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wealth, sufficiency</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and does not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">know</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1461;&#1437;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#234;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">poverty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1462;&#1445;&#1505;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;e&#183;ser)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2639.htm">Strong's 2639: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lack, destitution</span><br /><br /><span class="word">awaits him.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1489;&#1465;&#1488;&#1462;&#1469;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;en&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/28-22.htm">Proverbs 28:22 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/28-22.htm">Proverbs 28:22 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/28-22.htm">Proverbs 28:22 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/28-22.htm">Proverbs 28:22 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/28-22.htm">Proverbs 28:22 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/28-22.htm">Proverbs 28:22  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/28-22.htm">Proverbs 28:22 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/28-22.htm">Proverbs 28:22 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/28-22.htm">Proverbs 28:22 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/28-22.htm">Proverbs 28:22 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/28-22.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 28:22 A stingy man hurries after riches (Prov.
