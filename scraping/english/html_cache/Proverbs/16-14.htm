This phrase highlights the seriousness of a king's anger, which could result in immediate and irreversible punishment. The imagery of a "messenger of death" underscores the swift and often lethal nature of royal decrees. Historically, monarchs like Pharaoh in Egypt or Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon exemplified this power, where their anger could lead to executions or wars. Biblically, this is seen in <a href="/esther/7-7.htm">Esther 7:7-10</a>, where King Xerxes' wrath leads to Haman's execution. Theologically, it reflects the ultimate authority of God as King, whose righteous wrath against sin is a serious matter, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>.<p><b>but a wise man will pacify it</b><br>Wisdom, in this context, involves understanding, discernment, and the ability to act prudently to avert disaster. A wise man, through humility, tact, and diplomacy, can calm the king's anger, preventing the dire consequences of his wrath. This is exemplified in the story of Abigail in <a href="/1_samuel/25.htm">1 Samuel 25</a>, who wisely intervenes to pacify David's anger, preventing bloodshed. Culturally, this reflects the high value placed on wisdom and counsel in ancient courts, where advisors played crucial roles in guiding kings. Spiritually, it points to the role of Jesus Christ as the ultimate peacemaker, who through His wisdom and sacrifice, pacifies the wrath of God against sin, as seen in <a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king.htm">King</a></b><br>Represents authority and power.

The murder of Thomas a Becket will occur as an illustration (comp. <a href="/esther/7-8.htm">Esther 7:8</a>, etc). The LXX. translates, "The king's wrath is a messenger of death," taking the plural as put by enallage for the singular; but possibly the plural may intimate the many agents who are prepared to perform the ruler's behests, and the various means which he possesses for punishing offenders. This first clause implies, without expressly saying, that, such being the case, none but a fool will excite the monarch's resentment (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:4</a>); then the second clause comes in naturally. <span class="cmt_word">But a wise man will pacify it.</span> He will take care not to provoke that anger which gluts its resentment so quickly and so fatally (<a href="/proverbs/19-12.htm">Proverbs 19:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-2.htm">Proverbs 20:2</a>).
