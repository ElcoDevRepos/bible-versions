In biblical context, the idea of being "caught" reflects the divine justice system where God sees all actions, even those done in secret (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). The concept of being caught also aligns with the principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p><b>he must pay sevenfold;</b><br>The number seven in the Bible often symbolizes completeness or perfection. In this context, paying "sevenfold" suggests a complete restitution, emphasizing the seriousness of the offense. This principle of restitution is seen in the Mosaic Law, where a thief must repay multiple times what was stolen (<a href="/exodus/22.htm">Exodus 22:1</a>). The sevenfold repayment underscores the gravity of sin and the need for full restitution.<p><b>he must give up all the wealth of his house.</b><br>This phrase highlights the costliness of sin and the potential for total loss as a consequence of wrongdoing. It reflects the biblical principle that sin can lead to severe consequences, affecting one's entire household (<a href="/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24-25</a>). The idea of losing all wealth also serves as a warning against the pursuit of ill-gotten gains, reminding believers of the value of integrity and righteousness over material wealth (<a href="/proverbs/15-16.htm">Proverbs 15:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_thief.htm">The Thief</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing someone who steals out of necessity or desire.

"Sevenfold" signifies full restitution. (Comp. <a href="/genesis/4-24.htm" title="If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.">Genesis 4:24</a> : <a href="/leviticus/26-28.htm" title="Then I will walk contrary to you also in fury; and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.">Leviticus 26:28</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But if he be taken, he shill restore sevenfold.</span> Men do not despise the thief, but yet they apprehend him and insist on fullest restitution. <span class="accented">Be found</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> seized (Delitzsch), or legally convicted (Gejerus). <span class="accented">He shall restore</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he must restore (Zockler). Delitzsch, however, understands the future, <span class="accented">y'shalem</span>, as potential, "he may restore." <span class="accented">Sevenfold</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">siv'athayim</span>; <span class="accented">LXX.</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">septulum.</span> On this word Geier remarks, "Haec vox nullibi in sacris ponitur pio numero definito;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "It is nowhere put in Scripture for a definite number." It is therefore to be understood indefinitely of complete restitution, or, as it is expressed in the second and parallel clauses, "all the substance of his house." The word is used in this sense in <a href="/genesis/4-24.htm">Genesis 4:24</a>; <a href="/leviticus/26-28.htm">Leviticus 26:28</a>; <a href="/job/5-19.htm">Job 5:19</a> (Lapide). Theft under the Mosaic Law was punishable by a fivefold, fourfold, and twofold restitution (<a href="/exodus/22-1.htm">Exodus 22:1-4, 9</a>), and, in the event of this not forthcoming, the delinquent was to be sold into slavery (Leviticus 25:89). In <a href="/2_samuel/12-6.htm">2 Samuel 12:6</a> a fourfold restitution is mentioned, and in the New Testament Zacchaeus promises to restore fourfold if he could be convicted of fraud (<a href="/luke/19-8.htm">Luke 19:8</a>). In the attempts to reconcile the "sevenfold" of our passage with the requirements of the Mosaic Law, Aben Ezra says that the combined penalties for two cases of theft are contemplated, and others that in the time of the writer the penalties had been increased. But proof of this is wanting. Grotius's explanation is more curious than correct, viz. that if the theft be repeated seven times, and he be "taken" seven times, the thief should only be punished by being forced to make restitution with some addition. Both the Greek and Roman law demanded a twofold restitution. Selden maintains that theft would have been subjected to the usual punishment (Selden, 'De Jure Not. et Gent.,' 6, 100, 6). We may therefore come to the conclusion that "sevenfold" is used in the sense indicated above. As to any objection which may be raised on the seem of inconsistency in talking of a man malting restitution, and giving all his substance when he steals to satisfy his hunger, it may be remarked that he need not necessarily be without substance of some sort or other, and he could acquire subsequently sufficient to satisfy the demand. On the question whether a person is justified by extreme want in stealing, see Grotius, 'De Jure Belli et Pacis,' 2, 100, 2, &sect; 6; Puffendorf, 'De Jure Not. et Gent,' 2, 100, 6, &sect; 5; Blackstone, 'Commentary,' 4:2 &sect; 4. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/6-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Yet if caught,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1453;&#1504;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;nim&#183;&#7779;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Nifal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4672.htm">Strong's 4672: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come forth to, appear, exist, to attain, find, acquire, to occur, meet, be present</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he must pay</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#353;al&#183;l&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7999.htm">Strong's 7999: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be safe, to be, completed, to be friendly, to reciprocate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sevenfold;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;i&#7687;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;&#183;yim)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - fd<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7659.htm">Strong's 7659: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sevenfold, seven times</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he must give up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1469;&#1503;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(yit&#183;t&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the wealth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1952.htm">Strong's 1952: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wealth, sufficiency</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of his house.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/6-31.htm">Proverbs 6:31 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/6-31.htm">Proverbs 6:31 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/6-31.htm">Proverbs 6:31 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/6-31.htm">Proverbs 6:31 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/6-31.htm">Proverbs 6:31 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/6-31.htm">Proverbs 6:31  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/6-31.htm">Proverbs 6:31 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/6-31.htm">Proverbs 6:31 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/6-31.htm">Proverbs 6:31 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/6-31.htm">Proverbs 6:31 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/6-31.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 6:31 But if he is found he shall (Prov.
