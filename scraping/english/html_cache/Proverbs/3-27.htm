In the biblical context, "good" can refer to acts of kindness, justice, or material assistance. The deserving are those who have a rightful claim to such goodness, whether through their need, their relationship, or their righteousness. This aligns with the broader biblical principle of justice and mercy, as seen in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, which calls believers to act justly and love mercy. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a strong emphasis on community and mutual support, reflecting God's covenantal relationship with His people.<p><b>when it is within your power to act</b><br>This phrase highlights personal responsibility and the importance of using one's resources and abilities to benefit others. The biblical narrative often underscores the stewardship of resources, as seen in the Parable of the Talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where individuals are accountable for how they use what they have been given. The historical context of this proverb suggests a society where social justice was a communal responsibility, and individuals were expected to contribute to the welfare of others. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers (<a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

Scripture repeatedly calls the believer to active generosity&#8212;see <a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>, &#8220;Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone.&#8221; <a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15-16</a> warns against the hypocrisy of merely wishing someone well while refusing practical help. The &#8220;good&#8221; can be tangible (money, food, shelter) or intangible (encouragement, time, advocacy). In each case the verse assumes we recognize the need and possess a suitable remedy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the deserving</b><p>The word &#8220;deserving&#8221; points to people who have a legitimate claim on our help&#8212;neighbors, employees, family members, brothers and sisters in Christ, even strangers God places in our path (<a href="/luke/10-30.htm">Luke 10:30-37</a>). It does not promote blind enablement; rather, it mirrors <a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>, which ties obligation to recognized responsibility. By naming them &#8220;deserving,&#8221; Solomon reminds us that withholding would be an injustice, not mere stinginess. Our Lord&#8217;s teaching in <a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a> reinforces this: what we do &#8220;for one of the least of these brothers of Mine&#8221; He counts as done to Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when it is within your power to act</b><p>God never commands impossibilities. The verse assumes we have the resources or influence to make a difference&#8212;money in hand, a skill to share, a position to speak up, or simply time and energy. <a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6</a> illustrates Peter giving what he had (&#8220;Silver or gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you&#8221;). Conversely, <a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a> defines sin as &#8220;knowing the right thing to do and failing to do it.&#8221; Our capacity sets our responsibility: the greater the ability, the greater the accountability (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27</a> calls believers to prompt, practical, and proportional generosity. When God makes us aware of a need belonging to someone with a rightful claim, and we possess the means to meet it, we must not delay or withhold. In doing so we reflect the character of our heavenly Father, who never withholds any good thing from those who walk uprightly (<a href="/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(f) <span class= "ital">Sixth Discourse:</span>--<span class= "ital">Exhortation to Charity, Peace, Contentment </span>(<a href="/context/proverbs/3-27.htm" title="Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.">Proverbs 3:27-35</a>).<p>(27) <span class= "bld">Them to whom it is due--</span><span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the poor and needy.

The discourse differs from the preceding in consisting of detached proverbs, and may be divided into two main sections - the first (vers. 27-30) enjoining benevolence, that love to one's neighbour which is the fulfilling of the Law; the second warning against emulating the oppressor and associating with him, because of the fate of the wicked (vers. 31-35). It is observable that all the maxims have a negative form, and thus present a striking contrast to the form adopted by our Lord in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5</a>.), and to the admonitions at the close of St. Paul's Epistles. In one instance in particular (ver. 30), the teaching does not reach the high moral standard of the gospel (see Delitzsch and Lange). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Withhold not good from them to whom it is due.</span> This precept indicates the general principle of beneficence, and not merely, as the words at first sight seem to imply, restitution (as Cajet.). We are to do good to those who are in need or deserving of it, whenever we have the means and opportunity. <span class="accented">From them to whom it is due</span> (<span class="accented">nib'alayv</span>); literally, <span class="accented">from its owner</span>, from <span class="accented">baal, dominus</span>, "lord" or owner of a thing. Cf. <a href="/proverbs/16-22.htm">Proverbs 16:22</a>, "Prudence is a fountain of life to its owner (<span class="accented">b'alayv</span>);" 1:19; 17:8; and also <a href="/ecclesiastes/8-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 8:8</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:12</a>; - in all of which passages proprietorship in the thing or quality mentioned is expressed. The owners of good are those to whom good is due or belongs either by law or by morality, whether by desert or need. The latter qualification is the one emphasized in the LXX, <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fc6;</span>, "Abstain not from doing good to the needy." So the Arabic <span class="accented">pauperi.</span> The Targum and Syriac put the precept in more general terms, "Cease not to do good," without indicating in particular anyone who is to be the recipient of the good. But the Jewish interpreters generally (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ben Ezra) understand it of the poor, <span class="accented">egentibus.</span> The Vulgate puts an entirely different interpretation on the passage: <span class="accented">Noli prohibere benefacere eum qui potest</span>; <span class="accented">si vales, et ipse benefac</span>, "Do not prohibit him who can from doing good; if you are able, do good also yourself." It thus implies that we are to put no impediment in the way of any one who is willing to do good to others, and enjoins the duty on ourselves also. <span class="accented">Good</span> (<span class="accented">tov</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "<span class="accented">good"</span> under any form, any good deed or act of beneficence. The principle brought forward in this passage is that what we possess and is seemingly our own is in reality to be regarded as belonging to others. We are only stewards of our wealth. <span class="cmt_word">In the power of thine hand</span> (<span class="accented">lel yad'yka</span>); literally, <span class="accented">in the power of thine hands.</span> For the dual, <span class="accented">yad'yka</span>, the Keri substitutes the singular, <span class="accented">yad'ka</span>, to harmonize it with the similar expression, <span class="accented">lel yadi</span>, "in the power of thy hand," which occurs in <a href="/genesis/31-27.htm">Genesis 31:27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-32.htm">Deuteronomy 28:32</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/5-5.htm">Nehemiah 5:5</a>; <a href="/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1</a>. But there is no grammatical need for the emendation. Both the LXX. and Targum employ the singular, "thy hand." <span class="accented">Power</span> (<span class="accented">el</span>); here "strength" in the abstract. Usually it means "the strong," and is so used as an appellation of Jehovah. though, as Gesenius says, those little understand the phrase who would render <span class="accented">el</span> here "by God." The <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;</span> prefixed to <span class="accented">el</span> indicates the condition. The meaning of the phrase is, "While it is practicable, and you have the opportunity and means of doing good, do it." Do not defer, but do good promptly. The passage receives a remarkable illustration in the language of St. Paul, "While we have opportunity, let us do good unto all men" (<a href="/galatians/6-10.htm">Galatians 6:10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/3-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_408.htm">Strong's 408: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">withhold</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(tim&#183;na&#8216;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4513.htm">Strong's 4513: </a> </span><span class="str2">To debar, from benefit, injury</span><br /><br /><span class="word">good</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2896.htm">Strong's 2896: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pleasant, agreeable, good</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from those who deserve it,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1425;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(mib&#183;b&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;l&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1167.htm">Strong's 1167: </a> </span><span class="str2">A master, a husband, owner</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when it is</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1448;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(bih&#183;y&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">within your</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1443;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3027.htm">Strong's 3027: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">power</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - fdc &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_410.htm">Strong's 410: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strength -- as adjective, mighty, the Almighty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to act.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/3-27.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 3:27 Don't withhold good from those to whom (Prov.
