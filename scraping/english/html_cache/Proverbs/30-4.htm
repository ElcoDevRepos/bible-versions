In biblical context, only God is described as having such power and knowledge. This can be connected to <a href="/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>, where Jesus speaks of the Son of Man who has ascended and descended from heaven, indicating His divine origin and authority.<p><b>Who has gathered the wind in His hands?</b><br>The imagery of gathering the wind signifies control over creation, a power attributed to God alone. In <a href="/job/38-24.htm">Job 38:24</a>, God questions Job about the paths of the wind, emphasizing His sovereignty over nature. This phrase highlights God's omnipotence and mastery over the elements.<p><b>Who has bound up the waters in His cloak?</b><br>Binding the waters suggests containment and control over the chaotic forces of nature, reminiscent of God's actions in <a href="/genesis/1-6.htm">Genesis 1:6-10</a> during the creation. This imagery is also seen in <a href="/psalms/104-6.htm">Psalm 104:6-9</a>, where God sets boundaries for the waters, further illustrating His authority over creation.<p><b>Who has established all the ends of the earth?</b><br>This phrase underscores God's role as the Creator who has laid the foundations of the earth. <a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a> speaks of the everlasting God who created the ends of the earth, reinforcing the idea of His eternal power and wisdom in establishing the world.<p><b>What is His name, and what is the name of His Son&#8212;surely you know!</b><br>The mention of both a name and a Son points to a deeper revelation of God's nature. In the Old Testament, God's name is often associated with His character and deeds. The reference to His Son can be seen as a prophetic hint of the Messiah, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a> and <a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, where God acknowledges Jesus as His beloved Son.

This should lead us to trust in His supreme authority over our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_mystery.htm">Divine Mystery</a></b><br>The rhetorical questions in this verse highlight the mystery and majesty of God. We should approach God with humility, acknowledging that His ways are higher than ours.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ's_divinity.htm">Christ's Divinity</a></b><br>The mention of "His Son" points to the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ. Understanding Christ's divine nature should deepen our faith and commitment to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/human_limitation.htm">Human Limitation</a></b><br>The questions posed by Agur remind us of our limitations and the need for divine wisdom.

We may compare <a href="/job/38.htm">Job 38</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended?</span> Who is he that hath his seat in heaven, and doeth works on earth? Who is he whose universal providence is felt and experienced? Where is this mysterious Being who hides himself from human ken? Christ has said something like this, "No man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven" (<a href="/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>); and St. Paul (<a href="/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a>). In biblical language God is said to come down from heaven in order to punish, to aid, to reveal his will, etc. (<a href="/genesis/11-7.htm">Genesis 11:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>, etc.); and he returns to heaven when this intervention is finished (<a href="/genesis/17-22.htm">Genesis 17:22</a>; <a href="/genesis/35-13.htm">Genesis 35:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Who hath gathered the wind in his fists?</span> Who hath the control of the viewless wind, so as to restrain it or release it at his pleasure? (<a href="/psalms/135-7.htm">Psalm 135:7</a>; <a href="/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>). Septuagint, "Who hath gathered the winds in his bosom (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x1ff3;</span>)?" <span class="cmt_word">Who hath bound the waters in a garment?</span> The waters are the clouds which cover the vault of heaven, and are held, as it were, in a garment, so that, in spite of the weight which they contain, they fall not upon the earth. As Job says (<a href="/job/26-8.htm">Job 26:8</a>), "He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them." And again (<a href="/job/38-37.htm">Job 38:37</a>), "Who can number the clouds by wisdom? or who can pour out the bottles of heaven?" So the psalmist, "Thou coveredst it [the earth] with the deep as with a vesture" (<a href="/psalms/104-6.htm">Psalm 104:6</a>). (See above, <a href="/proverbs/8-27.htm">Proverbs 8:27</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">Who hath established all the ends of the earth?</span> Who hath consolidated the foundations, and defined the limits, of the remotest regions of the earth? (comp. <a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4</a>, etc.). The answer to these four questions is "Almighty God." He alone can order and control the forces of nature. <span class="cmt_word">What is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?</span> or, <span class="accented">if thou knowest</span>. It is not enough to acknowledge the power and operation and providence of this mysterious Being; Agur longs to know more of his nature, his essence. He must have personality; he is not an abstraction, a force, a quality; he is a Person. What, then, is his name, the name which expresses what he is in himself? Men have different appellations for this Supreme Being, according as they regard one or other of his attributes: is there one name that comprehends all, which gives an adequate account of the incomprehensible Creator? The question cannot be answered affirmatively in this life. "We know that if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is" (<a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>). The further question, "What is his son's name?" has given some difficulty. The LXX. has, "What is the name of his children (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>)?" as if there was reference to Israel, the special children of God. But the original does not bear out this interpretation, which is also opposed to the idea of the enigma proposed. The inquiry might mean - Are we to apply to the Supreme Being the same notion of natural relationship with which we are familiar in the human family? But this seems a low and unworthy conception. Or the "son" might be primeval man (<a href="/job/15-7.htm">Job 15:7</a>) or the sage; but the answer would not be satisfactory, and would not tend to solve the great question. There are two replies which can be made to Agur's interrogation. Looking to the marvellous description of Wisdom in <a href="/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22</a>, etc., we may consider Wisdom to be a denotation of the Son of God, and the inquirer desires to know the name and nature of this personage, of whose existence he was certified. Or he may have arrived at a knowledge of the only begotten Son of God, as the idea of the Logos is more or less developed in the Book of Wisdom, in Philo's treatises, and in the Alexandrian school; and longs for more perfect knowledge. This, indeed, is hidden: "He hath name written, which no one knoweth but he himself" (<a href="/revelation/19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>). It is useless to put such question to a fellow man; no human mind can fathom the nature of the Godhead, or trace out its operations (Ecclus. 18:4, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/30-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has ascended</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;l&#257;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5927.htm">Strong's 5927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ascend, in, actively</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to heaven</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1448;&#1497;&#1460;&#1501;
