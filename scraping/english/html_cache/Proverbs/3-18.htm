The "tree of life" is a powerful biblical symbol, first appearing in <a href="/genesis/2-9.htm">Genesis 2:9</a>, representing eternal life and divine blessing. In the context of Proverbs, wisdom is portrayed as life-giving and sustaining, much like the tree in the Garden of Eden. Embracing wisdom leads to spiritual vitality and moral integrity. The imagery of a tree also suggests stability, growth, and nourishment, which are the benefits of living a life guided by divine wisdom. This connection to the tree of life also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of wisdom in Jesus Christ, who offers eternal life to those who believe in Him (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p><b>and those who lay hold of her are blessed</b><br>The act of "laying hold" implies a deliberate and active pursuit of wisdom. In the ancient Near Eastern context, wisdom was highly valued and often associated with success and prosperity. The blessing here is not merely material but encompasses a holistic sense of well-being, including peace, joy, and fulfillment. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that true blessing comes from living in accordance with God's will. The idea of being blessed echoes the Beatitudes in <a href="/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5</a>, where Jesus describes the blessedness of those who embody kingdom values. The pursuit of wisdom, therefore, is not just an intellectual endeavor but a spiritual journey that leads to a life of divine favor and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

No mention is made of it except in Proverbs (<a href="/proverbs/11-30.htm" title="The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that wins souls is wise.">Proverbs 11:30</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-12.htm" title="Hope deferred makes the heart sick: but when the desire comes, it is a tree of life.">Proverbs 13:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-4.htm" title="A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit.">Proverbs 15:4</a>) and Revelation (<a href="/proverbs/2-7.htm" title="He lays up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.">Proverbs 2:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/22-2.htm" title="The rich and poor meet together: the LORD is the maker of them all.">Proverbs 22:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A tree of life</span> (<span class="accented">ets-khayyim</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">lignum vitae</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3be;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>. This expression obviously refers to "the tree of life" (<span class="accented">ets-hakayyim</span>), which was placed in the midst of the garden of Eden, and conferred immortality on those who ate of its fruit (Genisis 2:9; 3:22). So Wisdom becomes equally life giving to those who lay hold on her, who taste of her fruit. She communicates life in its manifold fulness and richness (so the plural "lives" indicates) to those who seize her firmly. What is predicated of Wisdom here is predicated in other passages (<a href="/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30</a>; <a href="/proverbs/13-12.htm">Proverbs 13:12</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-4.htm">Proverbs 15:4</a>) of the fruit of the righteous, the fulfilment of desire, and a wholesome tongue. Each of these, the teacher says, is "a tree of life." Elster denies that there is any reference to "the tree of life," and classes the expression among those other figurative expressions - a "fountain of life," in <a href="/proverbs/13-4.htm">Proverbs 13:4</a> and Proverbs 14:27, and a "well of life." in <a href="/proverbs/10-11.htm">Proverbs 10:11</a>; but if it be once admitted that there is such a reference, and it be remembered also that Wisdom is the same as "the fear of the Lord," the point insisted on in the Proverbs and in Job, it seems difficult to deny that the teacher has in view the blessed immortality of which the tree of life in Paradise as the symbol. In this higher sense the term is used in the Revelation (<a href="/revelation/2-7.htm">Revelation 2:7</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-2.htm">Revelation 22:2, 14</a>). Wisdom restores to her worshippers the life which was lost in Adam (Cartwright). It is remarkable that the imagery here employed is confined to these two hooks. After the historical record in Genesis, no other sacred writers refer to the tree of life. Old ecclesiastical writers saw in the expression a reference to Christ's redeeming work. "The tree of life is the cross of Christ," <span class="accented">lignum vitae crux Christi</span> (quoted by Delitzsch). The symbol, Plumptre remarks, entered largely into the religious imagery of Assyria, Egypt, and Persia. <span class="cmt_word">To them that lay hold upon</span> (<span class="accented">lam-makhazikim</span>, hiph. participle); Vulgate, <span class="accented">his, qui apprehenderint</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. The Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d6;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span> (<span class="accented">khazak</span>), "to tie fast," is in hiph. with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span> (<span class="accented">b</span>)<span class="accented"></span>," to take hold of," "to seize any one." Happy is every one that retaineth her. In the original, the participle, "they retaining her" (<span class="accented">tom'keyah</span>), is plural, and the predicate, "happy" or "blessed" (<span class="accented">m'ushshar</span>), is singular. The latter is used distributively, and the construction is common (cf. <a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>). The Authorized Version aptly renders the original. The necessity for "retaining" as well as "laying hold" of Wisdom is pointed out. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> (<span class="accented">tamak</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> "to hold fast something taken." Such will be blessed who hold Wisdom tenaciously and perseveringly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/3-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">She</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1453;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is a tree</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1461;&#1509;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#234;&#7779;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6086.htm">Strong's 6086: </a> </span><span class="str2">Tree, trees, wood</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of life</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;ay&#183;y&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2416.htm">Strong's 2416: </a> </span><span class="str2">Alive, raw, fresh, strong, life</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to those who embrace her,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1494;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(lam&#183;ma&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;z&#238;&#183;q&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124; Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2388.htm">Strong's 2388: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fasten upon, to seize, be strong, obstinate, to bind, restrain, conquer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and those who lay hold of her</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1469;&#1514;&#1465;&#1502;&#1456;&#1499;&#1462;&#1445;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#7733;e&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8551.htm">Strong's 8551: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sustain, to obtain, keep fast, to help, follow close</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are blessed.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1467;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1512;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#8217;u&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Pual - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_833.htm">Strong's 833: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be straight, to go forward, be honest, proper</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/3-18.htm">Proverbs 3:18 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/3-18.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 3:18 She is a tree of life to (Prov.
