In biblical times, fire was a common symbol for both divine presence and judgment (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>). The imagery suggests that engaging in sin is as dangerous as physically holding fire. The rhetorical question implies the impossibility of escaping harm when one willingly engages in sinful behavior. This aligns with the biblical principle that sin has inherent consequences (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p><b>and his clothes not be burned?</b><br>Clothing in the Bible often symbolizes one's actions or righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>, <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>). The burning of clothes signifies the inevitable damage and shame that result from sin. In ancient cultures, clothing was a valuable possession, and its destruction would be a significant loss, symbolizing the personal and social consequences of sin. This phrase underscores the certainty of repercussions when one indulges in sinful acts, reinforcing the biblical teaching that actions have consequences (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>). The imagery also serves as a warning to avoid temptation and maintain purity, reflecting the call to holiness found throughout Scripture (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

The meaning of the verses is plain enough, viz. that as it is in vain to suppose that a person's garment will not be burnt or his feet not be scorched if fire is brought near them, so it is equally inconceivable that a person indulging in adultery can escape its consequences or the retribution that follows. The two questions in vers. 27 and 28 imply a strong negative, and so prepare for the conclusion in ver. 30. <span class="accented">Take fire.</span> The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">khathah</span> signifies "<span class="accented">to take</span> burning or live coals <span class="accented">from the hearth"</span> (Placater); and hence is used here in a pregnant sense "to take from the hearth and place in" (cf. <a href="/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22</a>, "For thou wilt take coals ['and heap them:' Hebrew, <span class="accented">gekhalim khotheh</span>] on his head"). The fuller expression is met with in <a href="/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a>, "So that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth (<span class="accented">lakh'toth esh miyyakud</span>).'" The Vulgate renders by <span class="accented">abscondere</span>," to hide: <span class="accented">Numquid potest homo absconders ignem</span>; and the LXX. by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">alligare</span> "to tie or bind fast." Wordsworth explains "to take and heap up, as in a firepan or censer." <span class="cmt_word">In his</span> <span class="cmt_word">bosom;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">b'kheyko</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1ff3;</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">in sinu suo</span>. The word <span class="accented">kheyk</span> is properly "an undulation" (Delitzsch). not the <span class="accented">lap</span>, but as in the Authorized Version here, "the bosom," and "the bosom of a garment" as in ch. 16:33; 17:23; 21:14. The answer to the question of this and the next verse is of course a decided negative, but we may note that the teacher compares adultery to a burning fire in its consequences. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/6-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Can a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1427;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">embrace</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;ya&#7717;&#183;teh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2846.htm">Strong's 2846: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lay hold of, to pick up fire</span><br /><br /><span class="word">fire</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1452;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_784.htm">Strong's 784: </a> </span><span class="str2">A fire</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and his clothes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1437;&#1489;&#1456;&#1490;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1431;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7713;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_899.htm">Strong's 899: </a> </span><span class="str2">A covering, clothing, treachery, pillage</span><br /><br /><span class="word">not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">be burned?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1469;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;i&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;rap&#772;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - third person feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8313.htm">Strong's 8313: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be, on fire</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/6-27.htm">Proverbs 6:27 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/6-27.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 6:27 Can a man scoop fire into his (Prov.
