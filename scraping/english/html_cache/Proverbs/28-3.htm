In biblical times, leaders were expected to be shepherds of their people, providing guidance and protection. The oppression of the poor by such a leader is a grave injustice, as leaders are called to uphold righteousness and justice (<a href="/proverbs/29-14.htm">Proverbs 29:14</a>). The Bible consistently emphasizes God's concern for the poor and marginalized, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/82-3.htm">Psalm 82:3-4</a> and <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>. The failure of a leader to care for the poor is a violation of divine principles and reflects a lack of wisdom and understanding.<p><b>is like a driving rain</b><br>The imagery of a "driving rain" suggests a forceful and destructive storm. In the agricultural context of ancient Israel, rain was generally seen as a blessing, essential for crops and sustenance (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>). However, a driving rain implies excessive and uncontrolled force, which can lead to destruction rather than nourishment. This metaphor underscores the destructive impact of a leader who abuses power, causing harm rather than fostering growth and prosperity.<p><b>that leaves no food</b><br>The result of such a destructive rain is a barren land, devoid of the sustenance needed for survival. This outcome symbolizes the consequences of oppressive leadership: instead of providing for the needs of the people, it results in scarcity and suffering. The Bible often uses agricultural metaphors to illustrate spiritual truths, as seen in passages like <a href="/amos/4-7.htm">Amos 4:7-8</a>, where God withholds rain as a form of judgment. Similarly, a leader who fails to nurture and protect the people leads to a community that lacks the essentials for life and well-being. This serves as a warning against the misuse of power and the importance of righteous leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/poor_man.htm">Poor Man</a></b><br>In this context, the "poor man" refers to someone who lacks wealth or resources but still holds a position of power or influence over others who are even more disadvantaged.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lowly.htm">The Lowly</a></b><br>These are individuals who are already in a vulnerable or disadvantaged position, often lacking power, resources, or social standing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/driving_rain.htm">Driving Rain</a></b><br>This metaphor represents a force that is expected to bring nourishment and growth but instead causes destruction and leaves nothing beneficial behind.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_irony_of_oppression_by_the_oppressed.htm">The Irony of Oppression by the Oppressed</a></b><br>It is a tragic irony when those who have experienced hardship themselves become oppressors.

In <a href="/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3&#8211;5</a> Samuel contrasts his own blameless leadership with the self-serving sons of Eli who &#8220;took bribes and perverted justice&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/8-3.htm">1 Samuel 8:3</a>).<p>&#8226; A needy spirit, unanchored in God&#8217;s provision, becomes grasping and exploitative. Without the internal riches that come from righteousness (<a href="/proverbs/15-16.htm">Proverbs 15:16</a>), a leader quickly turns to unjust gain to fill the void.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who oppresses the poor</b><p>&#8226; Instead of identifying with the vulnerable, this leader exploits them. Proverbs repeatedly condemns such oppression: &#8220;Whoever oppresses the poor taunts their Maker&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>); &#8220;A ruler who lacks understanding is a great oppressor&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/28-16.htm">Proverbs 28:16</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law protects the disadvantaged: &#8220;You must not mistreat any widow or orphan&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22</a>). Ignoring that command invites divine judgment (<a href="/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; The poor already struggle; when their ruler adds weight instead of relief, the very one tasked with care becomes the source of pain (<a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is like a driving rain</b><p>&#8226; Heavy rain can be a blessing when it waters seed (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>), but &#8220;driving&#8221; rain speaks of a storm&#8212;pounding, uncontrolled, and destructive (<a href="/job/37-6.htm">Job 37:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/7-27.htm">Matthew 7:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Such leadership promises refreshment yet delivers ruin, much like &#8220;clouds and wind without rain&#8221; that disappoint (<a href="/proverbs/25-14.htm">Proverbs 25:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Instead of nurturing growth, the storm strips the land. <a href="/amos/4-7.htm">Amos 4:7-8</a> records God withholding or directing rain as discipline; here, the rain comes in harmful excess, a picture of leadership gone wild.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that leaves no food</b><p>&#8226; Crops beaten down mean empty granaries and hungry bellies. A ruler&#8217;s oppression creates socioeconomic famine: confiscated wages, unjust taxes, squandered resources.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-24.htm">Deuteronomy 28:24</a> warns that covenant unfaithfulness will make the sky &#8220;bronze&#8221; and the ground &#8220;iron,&#8221; ending in scarcity. Likewise, this proverb shows that injustice at the top trickles down into real loss for ordinary people.<p>&#8226; <a href="/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4-12</a> describes locusts erasing harvests&#8212;another vivid metaphor for leaders whose actions devour what should sustain the populace. When stewardship is replaced by self-interest, provision disappears.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/28-3.htm">Proverbs 28:3</a> paints a sober picture: a leader who is inwardly impoverished becomes outwardly oppressive, pounding the already needy like a ruinous storm until sustenance is gone. God intends authority to protect and provide (<a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>), yet when rulers abandon righteousness, they bring devastation instead of blessing. The verse therefore calls every person with influence&#8212;whether in the home, workplace, church, or nation&#8212;to seek the true riches of wisdom and to use power for the flourishing, not the crushing, of those under their care.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">A poor man that oppresseth the poor.--</span>If the recollection of his own former troubles has not softened his heart towards his poor neighbours, he will be rendered more callous to their sufferings.<p><span class= "bld">Is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.</span>--That sweeps away grain and soil, instead of bringing plenty with it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A poor man that oppresseth the poor.</span> The words rendered "poor" are different. The former is rash, "needy," the latter <span class="accented">dal</span>, "feeble" (see on Proverbs 10:15). Delitzsch notes that, in accordance with the accents in the Masoretic text, we should translate, "A poor man and an oppressor of the lowly - a sweeping rain without bringing bread," which would mean that a tyrant who oppresses the lowly bears the same relation to the poor that a devastating rain does to those whom it deprives of their food. But it is pretty certain that "the poor" and "the oppressor" designate the same person (though the vocalization is against it); hence the gnome refers to a usurper who, rising to power from poor estate, makes the very worst and most tyrannical ruler. Such a one has learned nothing from his former condition but callous indifference, and now seeks to exercise on others that power which once galled him. Thus among schoolboys it is found that the greatest bully is one who has himself been bullied; and needy revolutionists make the most rapacious and iniquitous demagogues. Of such tyrants the prophets complain (see <a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a>, etc.; <a href="/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a>). Wordsworth refers, as an illustration, to Catiline and his fellow conspirators, who were moved by selfish interests to overthrow the commonwealth. Many modern commentators (<span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Hitzig, Delitzsch, Nowack), in view of the present text, regarding the combination <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d1;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5e8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, and noting that elsewhere the oppressor and the poor are always introduced in opposition (comp. <a href="/proverbs/29-13.htm">Proverbs 29:13</a>), read <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, or consider <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> as equivalent to it - <span class="accented">rosh</span>, "the head," in the signification of "master," "ruler." The gnome thus becomes concinnous, the ruler who ought to benefit his dependents, but injures them, corresponding to the rain which, instead of fertilizing, devastates the crops. The LXX. had a different reading, as it readers, "A bold man in his impieties (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>) calumniates the poor." <span class="cmt_word">Is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food;</span> literally, <span class="accented">and</span> <span class="accented">not</span> <span class="accented">bread</span>. A violent storm coming at seed time and washing away soil and seed, or happening at harvest time and destroying the ripe corn. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Similis est imbri vehementi</span>, <span class="accented">in quo paratur fames</span>. Ewald supposes that such proverbs as these and the following belong to the time of Jeroboam II, when the prosperity of the people induced luxury and arrogance, and was accompanied with much moral evil, oppression, and perversion of justice ('Hist. of Israel,' 3:126, Eng. transl.). The Bengalee compares the relation of the rich oppressor to the poor, not with the rainstorm, but with that of the carving knife to the pumpkin. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/28-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A destitute</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1453;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7326.htm">Strong's 7326: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be in want or poor</span><br /><br /><span class="word">leader</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1443;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ge&#183;&#7687;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1397.htm">Strong's 1397: </a> </span><span class="str2">A valiant man, warrior, a person simply</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who oppresses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1443;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;&#353;&#234;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6231.htm">Strong's 6231: </a> </span><span class="str2">To press upon, oppress, defraud, violate, overflow</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the poor</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(dal&#183;l&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1800.htm">Strong's 1800: </a> </span><span class="str2">Dangling, weak, thin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is like a driving</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1465;&#1437;&#1495;&#1461;&#1431;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#333;&#183;&#7717;&#234;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5502.htm">Strong's 5502: </a> </span><span class="str2">To scrape off</span><br /><br /><span class="word">rain</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1496;&#1464;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;&#7789;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4306.htm">Strong's 4306: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that leaves no</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_369.htm">Strong's 369: </a> </span><span class="str2">A non-entity, a negative particle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">food.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1469;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7717;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3899.htm">Strong's 3899: </a> </span><span class="str2">Food, bread, grain</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/28-3.htm">Proverbs 28:3 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/28-3.htm">Proverbs 28:3 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/28-3.htm">Proverbs 28:3 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/28-3.htm">Proverbs 28:3 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/28-3.htm">Proverbs 28:3 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/28-3.htm">Proverbs 28:3  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/28-3.htm">Proverbs 28:3 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/28-3.htm">Proverbs 28:3 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/28-3.htm">Proverbs 28:3 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/28-3.htm">Proverbs 28:3 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/28-3.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 28:3 A needy man who oppresses the poor (Prov.
