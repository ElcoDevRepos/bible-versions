Its acidic nature can erode enamel, causing discomfort and damage to teeth. This imagery suggests something that is irritating and harmful. In biblical symbolism, vinegar is sometimes associated with bitterness or sourness, as seen in the offering of vinegar to Jesus on the cross (<a href="/matthew/27-48.htm">Matthew 27:48</a>). The comparison here highlights the unpleasantness and detrimental effects of a slacker's behavior on those who rely on him.<p><b>and smoke to the eyes</b><br>Smoke is a frequent irritant, causing discomfort and tears, and can obscure vision. In the ancient Near East, where open fires were common for cooking and heating, smoke would have been a familiar nuisance. This imagery conveys the idea of something that is not only irritating but also obstructive. The Bible often uses smoke as a symbol of judgment or divine presence (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>), but here it emphasizes the immediate, personal discomfort caused by a slacker's unreliability.<p><b>so is the slacker to those who send him</b><br>A slacker, or lazy person, is someone who fails to fulfill responsibilities, causing frustration and disappointment. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, where community and family roles were vital, a slacker would disrupt the social and economic fabric. This proverb warns against entrusting important tasks to unreliable individuals. The New Testament echoes this sentiment, urging believers to work diligently as unto the Lord (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>). The slacker's impact is likened to the irritation of vinegar and smoke, underscoring the importance of faithfulness and responsibility in one's duties.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_slacker.htm">The Slacker</a></b><br>This term refers to a lazy or negligent person who fails to fulfill their responsibilities, particularly in the context of being sent on a task or mission.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sender.htm">The Sender</a></b><br>This is the person or authority who entrusts the slacker with a task, expecting it to be completed efficiently and effectively.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/vinegar.htm">Vinegar</a></b><br>In ancient times, vinegar was a common household item, known for its sour taste and potential to cause discomfort to the teeth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/smoke.htm">Smoke</a></b><br>Smoke is a byproduct of fire, often causing irritation and discomfort to the eyes, symbolizing the frustration caused by the slacker.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/proverbs.htm">Proverbs</a></b><br>A book in the Old Testament, traditionally attributed to King Solomon, known for its wisdom literature that provides practical guidance for righteous living.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_laziness.htm">The Consequences of Laziness</a></b><br>Laziness leads to frustration and disappointment for those who rely on us.
