The "adulteress" represents not only literal infidelity but also spiritual unfaithfulness, a recurring theme in the Bible. In the historical context of ancient Israel, adultery was a serious offense, punishable by death (<a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>). The warning against the adulteress can also be seen as a metaphor for idolatry, which is often depicted as spiritual adultery in the Old Testament (<a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-10</a>). The wisdom literature, including Proverbs, frequently uses the image of an adulteress to illustrate the dangers of straying from God's commandments and the covenant relationship with Him.<p><b>from the stranger with seductive words</b><br>The "stranger" here refers to someone outside the covenant community, often associated with foreign influences that could lead the Israelites away from their faith. In the cultural context of the time, foreign women were sometimes seen as a threat to the purity of Israel's worship and social order, as seen in the accounts of Solomon's foreign wives leading him into idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-4</a>). The "seductive words" highlight the power of persuasion and the danger of being led astray by smooth and enticing speech. This echoes the warnings found in other parts of Proverbs about the power of words and the need for discernment (<a href="/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3-4</a>). The New Testament also warns against false teachings and the importance of holding fast to sound doctrine (<a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_adulteress.htm">The Adulteress</a></b><br>Represents temptation and sin, often personified as a woman who leads others astray with her seductive words.

In Hebrew, the word "z?r" can mean foreign or strange, emphasizing the danger of unfamiliar and ungodly influences.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon is known for his wisdom.
