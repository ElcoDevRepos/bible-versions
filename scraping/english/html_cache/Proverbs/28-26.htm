Throughout Scripture, reliance on one's own understanding is consistently discouraged. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, wisdom was highly valued, and it was understood that true wisdom comes from God (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). Trusting in oneself implies a rejection of divine guidance, which is seen as foolishness. This is echoed in <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, which describes the heart as deceitful. The historical context of Israel, surrounded by nations that often relied on human wisdom and strength, further underscores the importance of trusting in God rather than oneself.<p><b>but one who walks in wisdom will be safe</b><br>Walking in wisdom implies living a life guided by God's principles and understanding. In biblical terms, wisdom is not merely intellectual knowledge but a practical application of God's truth. The safety mentioned here is not just physical protection but also spiritual security. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that those who follow God's ways are under His protection (<a href="/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91:1-2</a>). The concept of walking in wisdom is also seen in the life of Jesus Christ, who perfectly embodied divine wisdom and provided a model for believers to follow. The promise of safety is both a present reality and a future hope, as seen in the ultimate salvation offered through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was known for his wisdom, which he received from God.
