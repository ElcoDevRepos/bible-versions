In the biblical context, "knowledge" often refers to a deep, experiential understanding of God's ways and His laws. The Hebrew word for "knowledge" (&#1491;&#1463;&#1468;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;, da'at) implies more than just intellectual awareness; it suggests a relational and moral comprehension. This rejection is not merely passive ignorance but an active disdain for divine truth. In Proverbs, wisdom is personified and calls out to people, yet many choose to ignore her (<a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20-22</a>). This reflects a broader biblical theme where humanity often turns away from God's revelation, as seen in <a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18-23</a>, where people suppress the truth in unrighteousness.<p><b>and chose not to fear the LORD</b><br>The "fear of the LORD" is a central theme in Proverbs and is considered the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). This fear is not about terror but reverence, awe, and respect for God's holiness and authority. Choosing not to fear the LORD indicates a willful decision to live independently of God's guidance and moral order. Historically, Israel's covenant relationship with God required them to fear Him and keep His commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12-13</a>). This choice reflects a heart posture that is rebellious and self-reliant, akin to the attitude of the Israelites during periods of apostasy, such as in the time of the Judges when "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). Theologically, this rejection of the fear of the LORD is seen as a root cause of moral and spiritual decay, leading to judgment and separation from God's blessings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
