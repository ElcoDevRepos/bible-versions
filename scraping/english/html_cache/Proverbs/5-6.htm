In biblical context, the "path of life" often refers to a way of living that aligns with God's commandments and leads to spiritual fulfillment and eternal life. The failure to consider this path suggests a disregard for divine guidance and moral principles. In Proverbs, wisdom is frequently personified as a woman who calls out to people to follow the righteous path (<a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20-33</a>). This contrast between wisdom and folly is a recurring theme, emphasizing the importance of choosing a life that honors God. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a high value on wisdom as a means to live a prosperous and righteous life, and this verse warns against neglecting such wisdom.<p><b>she does not know that her ways are unstable.</b><br>The instability of her ways indicates a life built on poor choices and a lack of foundation in truth. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of the consequences of sin and folly. In <a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>, Jesus speaks of the wise and foolish builders, illustrating the importance of building one's life on the solid foundation of His teachings. The instability here can also be seen as a warning against the seductive nature of sin, which may appear appealing but ultimately leads to destruction. Historically, the wisdom literature of the Bible, including Proverbs, served as a guide for living a life that is stable and secure, rooted in the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). This verse serves as a cautionary reminder of the dangers of ignoring divine wisdom and the resulting instability that affects all aspects of life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_adulterous_woman.htm">The Adulterous Woman</a></b><br>The primary subject of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/5.htm">Proverbs 5</a> is the adulterous or immoral woman, representing temptation and the dangers of straying from the path of righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon imparts wisdom to his son, warning against the seduction of immorality.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_path_of_life.htm">The Path of Life</a></b><br>A metaphorical concept representing the way of righteousness and obedience to God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_ignorance.htm">The Danger of Ignorance</a></b><br>Ignorance of the consequences of sin leads to instability.

It may also be rendered, "Far from smoothing for herself the path of life, her steps wander without her observing it." By these words is described the reckless career of a vicious woman, who at last dares not think whither her steps are leading her, but as it were with eyes shut, totters on till she falls to rise no more.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are movable, that thou canst not know them.</span> This verse should be rather rendered, <span class="accented">she walks not in the path of life, her ways fiuctuate, she knows not.</span> It consists of a series of independent proposiyions or statements, all of which are descriptive of the singularly fatuous conduct of "the strange woman." In the previous verse the teacher has said that her conduct leads to ruin; he here further emphasizes the idea by putting forward the same truth from the opposite, or, as we may say, from the negative point of view, and so completes the picture. "The words," as Plumptre remarks, "describe with terrible vividness the state of heart and soul which prostitution brings on its victims." Her course is one o(persistent, wilful, headstrong, blind folly and wickedness. <span class="accented">Lest</span>; <span class="accented">pen</span>; here "not," equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d0;</span> (<span class="accented">lo</span>). So the LXX., Vulgate, Targum, Syriac. The use of <span class="accented">pen</span>, in this sense is, however, unique (Gesenius). Delitzsch and Zockler, following Luther, Geier, Holden, etc., assign to it an emphatic negative force, as, "She is <span class="accented">far removed from</span> entering," or, "she <span class="accented">never</span> treadeth." Others take <span class="accented">pen</span> as a dependent prohibitive particle, equivalent to the Latin <span class="accented">ne</span> <span class="accented">forte</span>, "lest," as in the Authorized Version, and employed to connect the sentence which it introduces either with the preceding verse (as Schultens) or with the second hemistich, on which it is made dependent (Holden, Wordsworth, Aben Ezra, <span class="accented">loc</span>., Michaelis, etc.). <span class="accented">Thou shouldest ponder</span>; <span class="accented">t'phalles</span>, connected by makkeph with <span class="accented">pen</span>, as usual (Lee), is either second person masculine or third person feminine. The latter is required here, the subject of the sentence being "the strange woman," as appears clearly from the second hemistich, "<span class="accented">her</span> ways," etc. The verb <span class="accented">patas</span> (cf. <a href="/proverbs/14-26.htm">Proverbs 14:26</a>) here means "to prepare," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to walk in, or to travel over. Thus Gesenius renders, "She (the adulteress) prepareth not (for herself) the way of life:" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she does not walk in the way of life; cf. the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, Vulgate <span class="accented">ambulant</span> (sc. <span class="accented">gressus ejus</span>), and other ancient versions, all of which understand the verb in this sense. The meaning of the phrase, <span class="accented">pen t'phalles</span>, is, therefore, "she walks not" in the way of life - the way that has life for its object, and which in itself is full of life and safety. Far from doing this, the teacher goes on to say, <span class="accented">her ways are movable</span>; literally, <span class="accented">go to and fro</span>, or <span class="accented">fluctuate</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they wilfully stagger hither and thither, like the steps of a drunkard, or like the uncertain steps of the blind, for the verb <span class="accented">nua</span> is so used in the former sense in <a href="/isaiah/24-20.htm">Isaiah 24:20</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-9.htm">Isaiah 29:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/107-27.htm">Psalm 107:27</a>; and in the latter in <a href="/lamentations/4-14.htm">Lamentations 4:14</a>. Her steps are slippery (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), or wander (Vulgate, <span class="accented">vagi</span>); they are without any definite aim; she is always straying in the vagrancy of sin (Wordsworth); cf. <a href="/proverbs/7-12.htm">Proverbs 7:12</a>. <span class="accented">That thou canst not know them</span> (<span class="accented">lo theda</span>); literally, <span class="accented">she knows not</span>. The elliptical form of this sentence in the original leaves it open to various interpretations. It seems to refer to the way of life; she knows not the way of life, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she does not regard or perceive the way of life. The verb <span class="accented">yada</span> often has this meaning. The meaning may be obtained by supplying <span class="accented">mah</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">quicquam</span>, "anything," as in <a href="/proverbs/9-13.htm">Proverbs 9:13</a>, "She knows not anything," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she knows nothing. The objection to this is that it travels unnecessarily out of the sentence to find the object which ought rather to be supplied from the context. The object may possibly be the staggering of her feet: she staggers hither and thither without her perceiving it (Delitzsch); or it may, lastly, be indefinite: she knows not whittler her steps conduct her (Wordsworth and Zockler). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/5-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">She does not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(pen-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6435.htm">Strong's 6435: </a> </span><span class="str2">Removal, lest</span><br /><br /><span class="word">consider</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1508;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1425;&#1505;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;p&#772;al&#183;l&#234;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6424.htm">Strong's 6424: </a> </span><span class="str2">To roll flat, prepare, to revolve, weigh</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the path</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1465;&#1443;&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;ra&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_734.htm">Strong's 734: </a> </span><span class="str2">A well-trodden road, a caravan</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of life;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1453;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;ay&#183;y&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2416.htm">Strong's 2416: </a> </span><span class="str2">Alive, raw, fresh, strong, life</span><br /><br /><span class="word">she does not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">know that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1461;&#1491;&#1469;&#1464;&#1506;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;&#234;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">her ways</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1437;&#1506;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1514;&#1462;&#1431;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#8216;&#183;g&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;&#7791;e&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4570.htm">Strong's 4570: </a> </span><span class="str2">An entrenchment, track</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are unstable.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1506;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5128.htm">Strong's 5128: </a> </span><span class="str2">To quiver, wave, waver, tremble, totter</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/5-6.htm">Proverbs 5:6 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/5-6.htm">Proverbs 5:6 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/5-6.htm">Proverbs 5:6 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/5-6.htm">Proverbs 5:6 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/5-6.htm">Proverbs 5:6 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/5-6.htm">Proverbs 5:6  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/5-6.htm">Proverbs 5:6 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/5-6.htm">Proverbs 5:6 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/5-6.htm">Proverbs 5:6 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/5-6.htm">Proverbs 5:6 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/5-6.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 5:6 She gives no thought to the way (Prov.
