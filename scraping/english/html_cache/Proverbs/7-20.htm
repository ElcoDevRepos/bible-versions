In ancient times, carrying a bag of money was a sign of wealth and provision, necessary for travel and trade. This detail highlights the husband's trust in his wife, leaving her with resources, and underscores the betrayal of that trust. Biblically, money is often associated with transactions and exchanges, and here it symbolizes the transactional nature of the adulterous relationship. The absence of the husband provides the opportunity for the wife&#8217;s infidelity, a theme echoed in other scriptures warning against the dangers of idleness and temptation (e.g., <a href="/2_samuel/11.htm">2 Samuel 11:1-4</a>, the story of David and Bathsheba).<p><b>and will not return</b><br>The certainty of the husband's absence is emphasized, creating a window of opportunity for the adulterous affair. This phrase reflects the cultural context of the time, where travel was unpredictable and often lengthy due to the limitations of ancient transportation. The husband's delayed return is a critical element in the narrative, as it provides the adulteress with the assurance needed to seduce the young man. This situation is a cautionary tale about the dangers of assuming security in sin, as echoed in other biblical warnings about the deceitfulness of sin (<a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a>).<p><b>till the moon is full.</b><br>The reference to the full moon indicates a specific time frame, likely about a month, which was a common way to measure time in ancient cultures. The lunar calendar was widely used in biblical times, and the full moon marked a significant point in the month. This detail not only provides a temporal setting but also symbolizes the completeness or fullness of the husband's absence, giving the adulteress ample time to carry out her plans. The full moon can also be seen as a metaphor for the culmination of sin, as it reaches its peak before consequences ensue. This aligns with the biblical theme of hidden sins eventually being brought to light (<a href="/luke/8-17.htm">Luke 8:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_adulterous_woman.htm">The Adulterous Woman</a></b><br>In the context of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/7.htm">Proverbs 7</a>, she is a symbol of temptation and unfaithfulness, luring the young man into sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_young_man.htm">The Young Man</a></b><br>Represents those who are naive or lacking wisdom, easily swayed by temptation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_husband.htm">The Husband</a></b><br>The absent figure in the account, whose journey and return are used to illustrate the time frame of the young man's temptation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house.htm">The House</a></b><br>The setting where the seduction takes place, symbolizing a place of moral danger.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_full_moon.htm">The Full Moon</a></b><br>Represents a specific time frame, indicating the duration of the husband's absence and the opportunity for sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_temptation.htm">The Danger of Temptation</a></b><br>Temptation often presents itself when we are least prepared.

The husband&#8217;s distance does not erase the moral law or God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Till the moon is full</b><p>&#8226; A &#8220;full moon&#8221; marks roughly a month on the Hebrew calendar (cf. <a href="/psalms/81-3.htm">Psalm 81:3</a>). She is promising a lengthy window&#8212;plenty of nights, plenty of secrecy.<p>&#8226; Time, rather than softening sin, here magnifies it: &#8220;Stolen water is sweet&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/9-17.htm">Proverbs 9:17</a>), yet prolonged opportunity only deepens guilt.<p>&#8226; Her timeline ignores the Lord&#8217;s timeline; God can interrupt any moment (<a href="/job/34-21.htm">Job 34:21&#8211;22</a>). The supposed safe interval is an illusion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The verse portrays the seductive woman&#8217;s calculated assurance: her husband&#8217;s well-funded journey grants her a season of hidden sin. She trusts in distance, money, and the lunar calendar; but Proverbs exposes that false security. God sees, truth endures, and sin&#8217;s consequences will arrive long before&#8212;or at&#8212;the next full moon.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath taken a bag of money with him;</span> not only to defray the expenses of the journey (a fact which need not be dwelt upon), but because he has some pecuniary business to transact which will occupy his time, and prevent his return before the appointed hour.
