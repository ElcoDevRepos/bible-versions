In biblical times, making bed coverings was a task that required skill and diligence, reflecting her commitment to providing for her household. The coverings could include blankets, quilts, or tapestries, often crafted from wool or linen. This act of making bed coverings signifies care and attention to the comfort and well-being of her family. It also suggests a sense of order and beauty within the home, aligning with the biblical principle of stewardship and the importance of managing one's household effectively (<a href="/proverbs/14.htm">Proverbs 14:1</a>).<p><b>her clothing is fine linen and purple.</b><br>Fine linen and purple were materials associated with wealth, nobility, and high status in ancient cultures. Linen was a prized fabric in the ancient Near East, known for its quality and durability. Purple dye, often extracted from the murex shellfish, was rare and expensive, symbolizing royalty and luxury (<a href="/judges/8-26.htm">Judges 8:26</a>, <a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19</a>). The virtuous woman's clothing reflects not only her family's prosperity but also her wisdom in managing resources. This attire signifies dignity and honor, qualities that are esteemed in a woman of virtue. The use of fine linen and purple can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is clothed in majesty and righteousness (<a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>), pointing to the spiritual richness and honor bestowed upon those who walk in God's wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_virtuous_woman.htm">The Virtuous Woman</a></b><br>The subject of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>, often referred to as the "Proverbs 31 Woman," is an idealized figure representing wisdom, diligence, and virtue.

The wife dresses herself in a way becoming her station, avoiding the extremes of sordid simplicity and ostentatious luxury. "For my own part," says St. Francois de Sales, quoted by Lesetre, "I should wish any devout man or woman always to be the best dressed person in the company, but at the same time, the least fine and affected, and adorned, as it is said, with the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit. St. Louis said that every one ought to dress according to his position, so that good and sensible people should not be able to say you are overdressed, nor the younger under dressed" ('Vie Devot.,' 3:25). So the Church is clothed in fine linen, clean and white, even the righteousness which Christ bestows (<a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>), and invested in her Lord's royal robe, who hath made her children kings and priests unto God (<a href="/revelation/1-6.htm">Revelation 1:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/5-10.htm">Revelation 5:10</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/31-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">She makes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1469;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">coverings for her bed;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mar&#183;&#7687;ad&#183;d&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4765.htm">Strong's 4765: </a> </span><span class="str2">A spread, coverlet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">her clothing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3830.htm">Strong's 3830: </a> </span><span class="str2">A garment, clothing, raiment</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is fine linen</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1430;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#234;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8336.htm">Strong's 8336: </a> </span><span class="str2">Bleached stuff, white linen, marble</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and purple.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;ar&#183;g&#257;&#183;m&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_713.htm">Strong's 713: </a> </span><span class="str2">Purple, red-purple</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/31-22.htm">Proverbs 31:22 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/31-22.htm">Proverbs 31:22 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/31-22.htm">Proverbs 31:22 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/31-22.htm">Proverbs 31:22 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/31-22.htm">Proverbs 31:22 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/31-22.htm">Proverbs 31:22  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/31-22.htm">Proverbs 31:22 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/31-22.htm">Proverbs 31:22 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/31-22.htm">Proverbs 31:22 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/31-22.htm">Proverbs 31:22 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/31-22.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 31:22 She makes for herself carpets of tapestry (Prov.
