In biblical context, greed is often condemned as it leads individuals away from righteousness and towards sin (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>). The Hebrew culture emphasized community and sharing, contrasting with the self-centered nature of greed. The fate mentioned here is a warning, echoing the wisdom literature's theme that actions have consequences. Greed is portrayed as a destructive force, aligning with Jesus' teachings in <a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a>, where He warns against covetousness.<p><b>whose unjust gain</b><br>Unjust gain refers to wealth acquired through dishonest or immoral means. The Bible consistently denounces such practices, as seen in passages like <a href="/micah/2.htm">Micah 2:1-2</a>, where those who covet and seize property are condemned. In ancient Israel, economic justice was a significant concern, with laws designed to protect the vulnerable (<a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>). This phrase serves as a reminder that God values integrity and justice over material wealth. The pursuit of unjust gain is contrary to the character of God, who is just and righteous.<p><b>takes the lives of its possessors</b><br>This phrase suggests that the consequences of greed and unjust gain are not merely spiritual but can be physical and existential. The idea that such pursuits can lead to one's downfall is a common theme in wisdom literature, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-19.htm">Proverbs 11:19</a>, which contrasts righteousness with the pursuit of evil. Historically, the pursuit of wealth at the expense of others often led to social unrest and personal ruin. This warning is prophetic in nature, illustrating the self-destructive path of sin. It also serves as a type of Christ, who, in contrast, offers life through selflessness and sacrifice (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
