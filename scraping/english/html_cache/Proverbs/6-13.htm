It was a non-verbal gesture used to communicate secretive or dishonest intentions. In the context of Proverbs, winking the eyes can be seen as a subtle way of signaling to others to join in on a deceitful plan. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of warning against deceit and the importance of integrity, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/101-7.htm">Psalm 101:7</a>, which emphasizes the rejection of deceitful behavior. The act of winking as a form of communication highlights the cultural understanding of body language in ancient times, where such gestures could convey complex messages without words.<p><b>speaking with his feet</b><br>The phrase "speaking with his feet" suggests a form of communication through actions rather than words. In the ancient Near Eastern context, this could imply moving stealthily or using one's movements to convey intentions, often of a deceptive nature. This aligns with the biblical emphasis on the importance of one's walk or way of life, as seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26-27</a>, which advises careful consideration of one's path. The imagery of feet in scripture often symbolizes one's journey or conduct, and here it underscores the idea that actions can reveal one's true character and intentions, even when words do not.<p><b>and pointing with his fingers</b><br>Pointing with fingers in this context is another non-verbal gesture that indicates directing or signaling others, often in a conspiratorial or accusatory manner. In the cultural and historical setting of the Bible, such gestures could be used to manipulate or control situations without overt speech. This aligns with the biblical warnings against sowing discord and the destructive power of divisive actions, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/6-14.htm">Proverbs 6:14-19</a>, which lists behaviors that the Lord detests, including sowing discord among brothers. The act of pointing can also be seen as a metaphor for assigning blame or directing attention away from oneself, a behavior contrary to the humility and truthfulness encouraged in scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked_person.htm">The Wicked Person</a></b><br>The verse describes the actions of a deceitful person, often referred to as a "wicked" or "worthless" person in the broader context of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/6.htm">Proverbs 6</a>.

"To wink with the eye (<span class="accented">karats ayin</span>)<span class="accented"></span>," as in <a href="/proverbs/10-10.htm">Proverbs 10:10</a> and <a href="/psalms/35-19.htm">Psalm 35:19</a>, or "with the eyes (<span class="accented">karats b'eynayim</span>)," is properly to compress or nip them together, and so to wink, and give the signal to others not to interfere (Gesenius and Delitzsch); cf. the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x1ff7;</span>; and the Vulgate, <span class="accented">annuit oculis.</span> Aquila and Theodoret, however, read, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, "he <span class="accented">vexes</span> or <span class="accented">annoys."</span> The observation of the teacher in <a href="/proverbs/10-10.htm">Proverbs 10:10</a> is, "He that winketh with his eyes causeth sorrow." The same verb <span class="accented">karuts</span> is also used of the compression or closing of the lips in <a href="/proverbs/16-30.htm">Proverbs 16:30</a>. <span class="accented">He speaketh with his feet</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he conveys signs by them to his companion; cf. the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f76;</span>, and the Vulgate, <span class="accented">terit pede</span>, which conveys much the same meaning. <span class="accented">He teacheth with his fingers</span>; or, as more fully expressed in the LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "he teacheth by the signs of his fingers." Symmachus has <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, which, however, in its strictly classical use (see Demosthenes, 790, 20) is pointing at with the finger. "Teaching" is only the secondary meaning of the Hebrew participle <span class="accented">moreh</span>, which is here used. The verb <span class="accented">yarah</span>, to which it belongs, means properly to extend or stretch out the hand for the purpose of pointing out the way (compare the Hebrew <span class="accented">shalakh yod</span>, and the Latin <span class="accented">monstrare</span>), and hence came to mean "to teach." The crafty and deceitful character which is here <span class="accented">presented to as</span> is strikingly reproduced in Ecclesiasticus: "He that winketh with the eyes worketh evil: and he that knoweth him will depart from him. When thou art present, he will speak sweetly, and will admire thy words: but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and slander thy sayings. I have hated many things, but nothing like him; for the Lord will hate him" (Ecclus. 27:22-24). The heathen poet Naevius says of the impudent woman - <p><span class="foreign">"Allium tenet, alii adnutat, alibi manus<br />Est occupata: est alii percellit pedem."</span> Compare also Ovid's words ('Amor.,' 1:4, 16) - <p><span class="foreign">"Clam mihi tange pedem:<br />Me specta, mutusque meos, vultumque loquacem...<br />Verba superciliis sine voce loquentia dicam;<br />Verba leges digitis."</span> So Tibullus, 1:12 - <p><span class="foreign">"Illa viro coram nutus conferre loquaces<br />Blandaque compositis abdere verba notis."</span> The lesson which we may learn from this verse is not to abuse the members of our bodies, by employing them for the purposes of deceit and hypocrisy, and so to promote evil, but to put them to their natural and legitimate use. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/6-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">winking</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1465;&#1512;&#1461;&#1443;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#333;&#183;r&#234;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7169.htm">Strong's 7169: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pinch, to bite the lips, blink the eyes, to squeeze off</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his eyes,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1453;&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1493;&#8234;&#8236;&#8234;&#8236;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;n&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - cdc &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5869.htm">Strong's 5869: </a> </span><span class="str2">An eye, a fountain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">speaking</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1500;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;l&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4448.htm">Strong's 4448: </a> </span><span class="str2">To speak, utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with his feet,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1425;&#1493;&#8234;&#8236;&#8234;&#8236;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;ra&#7713;&#183;l&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7272.htm">Strong's 7272: </a> </span><span class="str2">A foot, a step, the pudenda</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and pointing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1437;&#1512;&#1462;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;reh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3384.htm">Strong's 3384: </a> </span><span class="str2">To flow as water, to lay, throw, to point out, to teach</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with his fingers.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1469;&#1497;&#1493;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#7779;&#183;b&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - feminine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_676.htm">Strong's 676: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something to sieze with, a finger, a toe</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/6-13.htm">Proverbs 6:13 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/6-13.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 6:13 Who winks with his eyes who signals (Prov.
