The suddenness of the destruction implies an unexpected and swift judgment, reminiscent of the sudden downfall of the wicked in other parts of Scripture, such as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>). The idea of sudden destruction is also echoed in the New Testament, where Paul warns of the suddenness of the Day of the Lord (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>). This serves as a reminder of the unpredictability of divine judgment and the importance of living righteously.<p><b>Who knows what ruin they can bring?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the uncertainty and potential severity of the consequences of aligning with those who oppose God's ways. The unpredictability of the ruin suggests that it could be more extensive and devastating than anticipated. This echoes the wisdom literature's theme of the limits of human understanding and the need for reliance on God's wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>). The phrase also serves as a caution against complacency, urging believers to remain vigilant and discerning in their associations and actions. The ruin brought by the wicked can be both physical and spiritual, affecting not only individuals but entire communities, as seen in the historical accounts of Israel's disobedience leading to exile (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6-23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

When a person defiantly opposes that authority, the Lord warns that &#8220;sudden destruction&#8221; is the certain outcome.<p>- &#8220;Sudden&#8221; underscores how quickly consequences can fall. Just as in <a href="/proverbs/6-15.htm">Proverbs 6:15</a> (&#8220;Therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in an instant he will be broken beyond remedy,&#8221;), discipline may seem delayed, yet it strikes without warning once God&#8217;s limit is reached.<p>- Historical examples reinforce the point:<p>&#8226; Korah and his followers&#8212;&#8220;the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31-33</a>).<p>&#8226; King Uzziah&#8212;instantly stricken with leprosy when he usurped priestly authority (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Herod Agrippa&#8212;&#8220;an angel of the Lord struck him&#8221; immediately after he accepted blasphemous praise (<a href="/acts/12-21.htm">Acts 12:21-23</a>).<p>- In each case, rebellion against God-ordained rule produced immediate, unmistakable judgment, validating the literal truth of Solomon&#8217;s warning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who knows what ruin they can bring?</b><p>- The question is rhetorical, driving home that the scope of the fallout is unpredictable and potentially limitless (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:12</a>).<p>- Rebellion rarely harms only the rebel:<p>&#8226; Achan&#8217;s secret sin led to Israel&#8217;s defeat and the death of his entire family (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1-26</a>).<p>&#8226; Absalom&#8217;s conspiracy triggered civil war, costing thousands of lives (<a href="/2_samuel/18-6.htm">2 Samuel 18:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; False teachers &#8220;secretly introduce destructive heresies,&#8221; bringing &#8220;swift destruction upon themselves&#8221; and misguiding many (<a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>).<p>- &#8220;Who knows&#8221; invites humble self-examination.

Otherwise, we must give another signification to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5dd;</span>, and, with the Syriac and many modern commentators, take it in the sense of "years," which <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5dd;</span> will bear, as <a href="/job/36-11.htm">Job 36:11</a>, and translate, "The destruction [equivalent to 'end'] of their years, who knoweth?" No one can tell when the crisis of their fate shall come; but it will arrive some day, and then the time of their prosperity will be at an end. Septuagint, "For they (God and the king) will suddenly punish the ungodly; and who shall know the vengeance of both (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)?" After this the LXX. inserts three proverbs not found now in the Hebrew, which, however, Ewald ('Jahrb. der Bibl. Wissensch.,' 11:17, etc.) considers to have been translated from a Hebrew original: "A son that keepeth the commandment shall be safe from destruction (<a href="/proverbs/29-27.htm">Proverbs 29:27</a>, Vulgate), and he hath fully received it (the word). Let no lie be spoken by the tongue of the king; and no he shall proceed from his tongue. The king's tongue is a sword, and not of flesh; and whosoever shall be delivered unto it shall be destroyed; for if his anger be inflamed, he consumes men with their nerves, and devours men's bones, and burns them up as a flame, so that they are not food for the young eagles." The allusion at the end is to animals killed by lightning. Here follows the series of proverbs (<a href="/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1-14</a>) called in the Hebrew, "The words of Agur." The second part of "the words of Agur," and "the words of Lemuel" (<a href="/proverbs/30-15.htm">Proverbs 30:15-31:9</a>) follow in the Greek after <a href="/proverbs/24-34.htm">Proverbs 24:34</a> of the Hebrew. Delitzsch explains the matter thus: In the copy from which the Alexandrines translated, the appendix (<a href="/proverbs/30.htm">Proverbs 30-31:9</a>) was divided into two parts, half of it standing after "the words of the wise" (<a href="/proverbs/22-17.htm">Proverbs 22:17-24:22</a>), and half after the supplement containing further sayings of wise men (<a href="/proverbs/24-23.htm">Proverbs 24:23-34</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/24-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[those two] will bring</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1511;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;q&#363;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6965.htm">Strong's 6965: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arise, stand up, stand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sudden</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1460;&#1453;&#1514;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;i&#7791;&#183;&#8217;&#333;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6597.htm">Strong's 6597: </a> </span><span class="str2">Suddenness, suddenly</span><br /><br /><span class="word">destruction;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1491;&#1464;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_343.htm">Strong's 343: </a> </span><span class="str2">Oppression, misfortune, ruin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">knows</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1461;&#1469;&#1506;&#1463;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7695;&#234;&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">what ruin</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6365.htm">Strong's 6365: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruin, disaster</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[they] can bring?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1437;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - mdc &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8147.htm">Strong's 8147: </a> </span><span class="str2">Two (a cardinal number)</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/24-22.htm">Proverbs 24:22 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/24-22.htm">Proverbs 24:22 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/24-22.htm">Proverbs 24:22 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/24-22.htm">Proverbs 24:22 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/24-22.htm">Proverbs 24:22 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/24-22.htm">Proverbs 24:22  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/24-22.htm">Proverbs 24:22 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/24-22.htm">Proverbs 24:22 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/24-22.htm">Proverbs 24:22 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/24-22.htm">Proverbs 24:22 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/24-22.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 24:22 For their calamity will rise suddenly (Prov.
