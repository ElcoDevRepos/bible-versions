The process involved intense heat to separate impurities from the desired metal. This imagery is used throughout the Bible to describe purification and testing (e.g., <a href="/malachi/3-3.htm">Malachi 3:3</a>). The crucible's purpose is to refine, symbolizing how trials and challenges can purify a person's character.<p><b>and a furnace for gold</b><br>Similar to the crucible, a furnace was used to refine gold, requiring even higher temperatures due to gold's melting point. The furnace represents a more intense form of testing and purification. In biblical terms, gold often symbolizes purity and value (<a href="/revelation/3-18.htm">Revelation 3:18</a>). The refining process is a metaphor for spiritual growth and maturity, as seen in <a href="/job/23-10.htm">Job 23:10</a>, where Job speaks of coming forth as gold after being tested.<p><b>but a man is tested by the praise accorded him</b><br>This phrase shifts the focus from physical refinement to the testing of a person's character through praise. Praise can reveal a person's true nature, as it may lead to pride or humility. The Bible warns against the dangers of pride (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>) and emphasizes the importance of humility (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>). Jesus exemplified humility, despite receiving praise and adoration (<a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>). The way a person responds to praise can indicate their spiritual maturity and reliance on God rather than self.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/crucible_and_furnace.htm">Crucible and Furnace</a></b><br>These are tools used in metallurgy to refine metals by exposing them to high temperatures.

So the image immediately teaches that God ordains a refining process for what He values.<p>&#8226; Just as craftsmen trust the crucible to do its work, the believer can trust that every trial permitted by the Lord has a refining purpose (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>; <a href="/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; The word order places &#8220;crucible&#8221; first, stressing the necessity of heat before beauty appears. Life&#8217;s difficulties are not accidents; they are part of God&#8217;s intentional craftsmanship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And a furnace for gold</b><p>&#8226; Gold demands an even hotter environment than silver for its impurities to be removed. This heightens the illustration: the nobler the metal, the more intense the fire (<a href="/job/23-10.htm">Job 23:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/48-10.htm">Isaiah 48:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse pairs the two metals to underline that all precious material requires purification. Nothing of lasting worth is produced apart from testing.<p>&#8226; While silver speaks of general usefulness, gold symbolizes supreme value (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-12.htm">1 Corinthians 3:12-13</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-18.htm">Revelation 3:18</a>). In both cases, the refining process is indispensable.<p>&#8226; The imagery assures believers that God&#8217;s refining fires are precisely calibrated&#8212;never random, never excessive, always aimed at producing Christlike character (<a href="/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But a man is tested by the praise accorded him</b><p>&#8226; The shift from metals to a person shows that human character is revealed not merely by hardship but by how one handles honor. Compliments, acclaim, and success bring hidden motives to the surface just as heat draws out dross (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10-14</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-15.htm">2 Chronicles 26:15-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Praise can tempt us toward pride (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>) or push us toward humility and gratitude (<a href="/psalms/115-1.htm">Psalm 115:1</a>). The reaction exposes whether we worship the Giver or the gift.<p>&#8226; Notice the passive voice&#8212;&#8220;is tested.&#8221; The test is automatic; whenever praise arrives, evaluation begins.<p>&#8226; Practical indicators that praise is refining us well:<p>&#8211; We redirect credit to God (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-10.htm">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>).<p>&#8211; We rejoice when others are praised (<a href="/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a>).<p>&#8211; We remain teachable, avoiding self-exaltation (<a href="/proverbs/11-2.htm">Proverbs 11:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Failing the test shows up in self-promotion, envy, or neglect of the Lord. Passing it produces deeper purity than ever, just as refined gold shines brightest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Trials may come through fire or through applause. Both are God&#8217;s tools to reveal and refine what lies within. As silver and gold emerge purer after intense heat, so believers emerge stronger when they respond to praise with humility and to hardship with trust. Recognizing every circumstance as the Lord&#8217;s refining crucible keeps the heart anchored in Him, ensuring that the glow people see is His workmanship, not our own.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">So is a man to his praise--</span><span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, as the fining-pot and furnace test the metals put into them, so does that on which a man prides or boasts himself. Observe what this is--<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>wealth, or show, or popularity, or duty--and you will see what sort of a man he is. Or it may mean, praise--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>popularity, is as great a trial to a man as the fining-pot to silver; he must be of good metal if he comes unhurt out of this. Or, again, it may signify, let a man test his praise--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>examine by whom and for what he is praised, and be sure it is genuine and well deserved<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fining pot</span>, etc. (see on Proverbs 17:3; comp. also <a href="/proverbs/25-4.htm">Proverbs 25:4</a>). So is a man to his praise. The Hebrew is literally, <span class="accented">The crucible for silver</span>, <span class="accented">and the furnace for gold</span>, <span class="accented">and a man according</span>, <span class="accented">to his praise; i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. as the processes of metallurgy test the precious metals, so a man's public reputation shows what he is really worth, as is stated in <a href="/proverbs/12-8.htm">Proverbs 12:8</a>. As the crucible brings all impurities to the surface, so public opinion drags forth all that is bad in a man, and he who stands this test is generally esteemed. Certainly praise is a stimulus to exertion, an incentive to try to make one's self worthy of the estimation in which one is held, especially if he purifies it from the dross and earthliness mixed with it, and takes to himself only what is genuine and just. But public opinion is very commonly false end is always a very unsafe criterion of moral excellence. Hence other interpretations have been proposed. Ewald renders, "and a man according to his boasting," that is, according to that which he most praises in himself and others. So virtually Hitzig, Bottcher, Zockler, and others. In this view the gnome denotes that a man's real character is best examined by the light cast upon it by his usual line of thought, what he most prides himself upon, what he admires most in other men. Plumptre, after Gesenius and Fleischer, has, "So let a man be to his praise," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to the mouth which praises him; let him test this commendation, to see what it is worth, before he accepts it as his due. The explanation first given seems on the whole most suitable, when we reflect that the highest morality is not always enunciated, and that secondary motives are widely recognized as factors in action and judgment. There are not wanting men in modern days who uphold the maxim, <span class="accented">Vox populi</span>, <span class="accented">vox Dei</span>. Septuagint, "The action of fire is a test for silver and gold, so a man is tested by the mouth of them that praise him." No surer test of a man's true character can be found than his behaviour under praise; many men arc spoiled by it. If a man comes forth from it without injury, not rendered vain, or blind to his defects, or disdainful of others, his disposition is good, and the commendation lavished upon him may be morally and spiritually beneficial. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Sic probatur homo ore laudantis</span>, "So is a man proved by the mouth of him that praises him." The following passage from St. Gregory, commenting on this, is worth quoting, "Praise of one's self tortures the just, but elates the wicked. But while it tortures, it purifies the just; and while it pleases the wicked, it proves them to be reprobate. For these revel in their own praise, because they seek not the glory of their Maker. But they who seek the glory of their Maker are tortured with their own praise, lest that which is spoken of without should not exist within them; lest, if that which is said really exists, it should be made void in the sight of God by these very honours; lest the praise of men should soften the firmness of their heart, and should lay it low in self-satisfaction; and lest that which ought to aid them to increase their exertions, should be even now the recompense of their labour. But when they see that their own praises tend to the glory of God, they even long for and welcome them. For it is written, "That they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven" ('Moral.,' 26:62, Oxford transl.). The LXX. adds a verse which is not found in the Hebrew, but occurs in some manuscripts of the Latin Version, "The heart of the transgressor seeketh out evils, but an upright heart seeketh knowledge." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/27-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A crucible</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1510;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1443;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#7779;&#183;r&#234;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4715.htm">Strong's 4715: </a> </span><span class="str2">A crucible</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for silver</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1453;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1505;&#1462;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(lak&#183;ke&#183;sep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3701.htm">Strong's 3701: </a> </span><span class="str2">Silver, money</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and a furnace</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#363;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3564.htm">Strong's 3564: </a> </span><span class="str2">Smelting pot or furnace</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for gold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1425;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(laz&#183;z&#257;&#183;h&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2091.htm">Strong's 2091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gold, something gold-colored, as oil, a clear sky</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but a man [is tested]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1437;&#1488;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by the praise</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1500;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#183;ha&#774;&#183;l&#257;&#183;l&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4110.htm">Strong's 4110: </a> </span><span class="str2">Praise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">accorded him.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6310.htm">Strong's 6310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The mouth, edge, portion, side, according to</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/27-21.htm">Proverbs 27:21 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/27-21.htm">Proverbs 27:21 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/27-21.htm">Proverbs 27:21 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/27-21.htm">Proverbs 27:21 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/27-21.htm">Proverbs 27:21 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/27-21.htm">Proverbs 27:21  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/27-21.htm">Proverbs 27:21 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/27-21.htm">Proverbs 27:21 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/27-21.htm">Proverbs 27:21 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/27-21.htm">Proverbs 27:21 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/27-21.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 27:21 The crucible is for silver and (Prov.
