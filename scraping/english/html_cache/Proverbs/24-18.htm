In biblical context, God is portrayed as the ultimate judge who sees all actions and intentions (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>). The idea of God seeing and disapproving aligns with His nature as holy and just, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4-5</a>, where God examines the righteous and the wicked. The disapproval of God is significant because it reflects His standards of righteousness, which are consistent throughout Scripture. This phrase warns against gloating over the downfall of others, as it is contrary to God's character of mercy and justice.<p><b>and turn His wrath away from him</b><br>This part of the verse suggests a divine response to human attitudes. Theologically, it implies that God's wrath, which is often depicted as a righteous response to sin (<a href="/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>), can be redirected based on human behavior. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, retribution was a common expectation, but this verse challenges that notion by suggesting that God may choose to withhold punishment if He sees inappropriate rejoicing over an enemy's misfortune. This reflects a broader biblical theme of God's mercy and the call for believers to emulate His compassion (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44-45</a>). The turning away of wrath can also be seen as a type of Christ, who through His sacrifice, turns away the wrath of God from sinners (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-10.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing God's omniscience and justice.

Bode considers "his wrath" to be the enemy's ill will against thee, which God by his grace changes to love, and thou art thus covered with confusion and shame for thy former vindictiveness. But the point is not so much the removal of God's displeasure from the enemy as the punishment of the malignant man, either mentally or materially.
