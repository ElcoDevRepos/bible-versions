The concept of foolishness in Proverbs is not merely about lack of intelligence but a willful disregard for God's commandments and wisdom. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that true wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). The foolish son is contrasted with the wise son who brings joy and honor to his parents (<a href="/proverbs/10.htm">Proverbs 10:1</a>).<p><b>brings grief to his father</b><br>The grief of a father over a foolish son is a recurring theme in Proverbs, highlighting the deep emotional impact of a child's actions on their parents. In ancient Israelite culture, the family was a central unit, and a son's behavior could affect the family's honor and social standing. The father's grief is not only personal but also communal, as the family's reputation could be tarnished. This reflects the biblical principle of generational blessings and curses, where the actions of one generation impact the next (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5-6</a>).<p><b>and bitterness to her who bore him</b><br>The mention of the mother emphasizes the dual parental impact of a child's folly. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, mothers were deeply involved in the upbringing and moral education of their children. The term "bitterness" suggests a profound emotional pain, akin to the sorrow experienced by Hannah before Samuel's birth (<a href="/1_samuel/1-10.htm">1 Samuel 1:10</a>). This phrase underscores the biblical view of the family as a unit where each member's actions affect the whole, and it echoes the pain of Eve in <a href="/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>, where the consequences of sin bring sorrow to motherhood.<br><br>The verse as a whole serves as a warning and a call to pursue wisdom, aligning with the broader biblical narrative that emphasizes the importance of living according to God's statutes to bring joy and peace to one's family and community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/foolish_son.htm">Foolish Son</a></b><br>Represents an individual who acts unwisely or without regard for moral or spiritual guidance. In the context of Proverbs, a foolish son is often one who rejects wisdom and instruction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/father.htm">Father</a></b><br>Symbolizes the parental figure who experiences grief due to the actions of the foolish son.

A son who chooses rebellion, mocks authority, and follows his own impulses is called &#8220;foolish&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>; 15:5). That pattern shows up in:<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/10-1.htm">Proverbs 10:1</a>&#8212;&#8220;A wise son makes a glad father, but a foolish son is grief to his mother.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-18.htm">Deuteronomy 21:18-21</a>&#8212;Israel&#8217;s law for the &#8220;stubborn and rebellious son.&#8221;<p>The verse warns every reader&#8212;parent or child&#8212;that life apart from God&#8217;s guidance injures the family first.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>brings grief to his father</b><p>The word picture is heavy sorrow settling on a dad&#8217;s heart.
