In biblical times, the role of a mother in teaching and guiding her children was crucial. The rhetorical question suggests a moment of reflection and the weight of responsibility in conveying important truths. This echoes the broader biblical theme of parental guidance found in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are instructed to diligently teach their children God's commandments.<p><b>What, O son of my womb?</b><br>The reference to "son of my womb" highlights the intimate and natural bond between mother and child. It underscores the personal investment and emotional connection a mother has with her child, which is a recurring theme in Scripture. This phrase also alludes to the sanctity of life and the miracle of birth, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-14</a>, where the psalmist praises God for being "knit together" in the mother's womb. The maternal imagery here can also be seen as a type of God's nurturing and caring nature.<p><b>What, O son of my vows?</b><br>This phrase suggests a dedication or promise made to God concerning the child. In ancient Israel, vows were serious commitments, often involving a promise to raise a child in the fear and knowledge of the Lord. This can be compared to the story of Hannah and Samuel in <a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>, where Hannah vows to dedicate her son to the Lord's service. The concept of vows also points to the covenantal relationship between God and His people, emphasizing faithfulness and devotion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_speaker.htm">The Speaker (Mother of King Lemuel)</a></b><br>The speaker is traditionally understood to be the mother of King Lemuel, offering wisdom and guidance to her son.
