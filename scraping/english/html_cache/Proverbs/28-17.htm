In biblical law, bloodguilt was a grave offense, often requiring the death penalty (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>). The concept of bloodguilt is deeply rooted in the Old Testament, where the shedding of innocent blood defiles the land (<a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>). The burden of guilt is not just a legal issue but a spiritual and moral one, indicating a heavy conscience and the weight of sin. The Hebrew understanding of guilt involved both the act and its consequences, affecting the individual and the community.<p><b>will flee into the Pit</b><br>The "Pit" is often a metaphor for Sheol, the realm of the dead, or a place of destruction and judgment (<a href="/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a>). In this context, it suggests that the person burdened by guilt will ultimately face death or divine judgment. The imagery of fleeing indicates a sense of desperation and inevitability, as the guilty person cannot escape the consequences of their actions. This aligns with the biblical principle that sin leads to death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). The Pit also symbolizes separation from God, as sin creates a barrier between humanity and the divine.<p><b>let no one support him</b><br>This phrase advises against aiding or abetting someone guilty of such a serious crime. In ancient Israel, harboring a murderer was against the law, as justice was a communal responsibility (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-11.htm">Deuteronomy 19:11-13</a>). The call to not support the guilty underscores the importance of upholding justice and righteousness. It reflects the biblical theme that sin must be confronted and dealt with, not concealed or ignored (<a href="/proverbs/24-24.htm">Proverbs 24:24-25</a>). This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are urged to expose deeds of darkness rather than participate in them (<a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_burdened_by_bloodguilt.htm">The Man Burdened by Bloodguilt</a></b><br>This refers to an individual who has committed murder or a serious crime resulting in bloodshed.

This reflects the inner turmoil and external consequences of their actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a></b><br>Represents the inevitable end of the fugitive's journey.

Cain lamented, &#8220;My guilt is too great to bear&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/4-13.htm">Genesis 4:13</a>), showing how the inner load becomes a torment even before any human court speaks.<p>&#8226; God considers innocent blood precious (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>; <a href="/proverbs/6-17.htm">Proverbs 6:17</a>), and He personally holds the murderer accountable. <a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a> warns, &#8220;Blood defiles the land, and no atonement can be made&#8230; except by the blood of the one who shed it.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The proverb assumes the literal reality of guilt&#8212;no self-justification, therapy, or societal change erases it. Only divine justice or mercy can address the stain (<a href="/psalms/51-14.htm">Psalm 51:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will flee into the Pit</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The Pit&#8221; points first to earthly consequences: ancient law allowed the avenger of blood to pursue the murderer until the culprit reached a city of refuge (<a href="/numbers/35-19.htm">Numbers 35:19</a>). Many chose flight over repentance, yet they rarely found safety.<p>&#8226; Beyond temporal judgment, the phrase stretches to ultimate ruin&#8212;Sheol, the realm of the dead. <a href="/psalms/55-23.htm">Psalm 55:23</a> echoes, &#8220;You, O God, will bring them down to the Pit of destruction.&#8221; Proverbs balances daily life wisdom with eternal reality; those who spurn God&#8217;s ways run headlong toward both physical death and everlasting separation (<a href="/revelation/21-8.htm">Revelation 21:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Flight signals unresolved sin. Rather than turning to the Lord like David did after his crime (<a href="/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>), the guilty man doubles down on self-preservation, accelerating his fall.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let no one support him</b><p>&#8226; Scripture forbids aiding or concealing violent evil. &#8220;Keep yourself far from a false charge, and do not kill the innocent or the righteous, for I will not acquit the guilty&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/23-7.htm">Exodus 23:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical implications:<p>&#8211; Do not provide shelter, funds, or testimony that hinders lawful justice (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-13.htm">Deuteronomy 19:13</a>).<p>&#8211; Refuse moral complicity: &#8220;Do not share in the sins of others&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/5-22.htm">1 Timothy 5:22</a>).<p>&#8211; Confront rather than enable. <a href="/ezekiel/3-18.htm">Ezekiel 3:18</a> warns that silence toward a wicked man&#8217;s peril makes the silent one accountable.<p>&#8226; Godly non-support is not vengeance but participation with divine justice. <a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a> affirms governing authority as &#8220;an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer.&#8221; Withholding help allows that God-ordained process to proceed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/28-17.htm">Proverbs 28:17</a> teaches that murder fastens an unbearable load on the soul. In attempting to escape, the offender races toward earthly judgment and eternal destruction. God calls His people to stand clear of any aid that would shield unrepentant killers from justice. The verse underscores the sanctity of life, the certainty of accountability, and the necessity of aligning with God&#8217;s righteous standards rather than human sentimentality.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person.--</span>Rather, <span class= "ital">that is burdened with his blood, </span>has wilfully murdered any one.<p><span class= "bld">Shall flee to the pit.--</span>Fulfilling the curse of <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm" title="Whoever sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.">Genesis 9:6</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Let no man stay him</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>attempt to rescue him from the punishment he has deserved.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit.</span> This should be, <span class="accented">a man oppressed</span> (<a href="/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>), <span class="accented">burdened</span>, <span class="accented">with the blood of anyone</span>. The wilful murderer, with his guilt upon his soul, flies in vain from remorse; his crime pursues him even to the grave. For inadvertent manslaughter the cities of refuge offered an asylum, but for deliberate murder there was no safe refuge, either from the stings of conscience or from the avenger of blood, but death. The homicide, like Cain (<a href="/genesis/4-14.htm">Genesis 4:14</a>), must be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth. "Pit" (<span class="accented">bor</span>), some take to mean any hiding place, "a cave, or well;" but it is very commonly found in the sense of sepulchre (<a href="/psalms/28-1.htm">Psalm 28:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>, etc.), and is so explained here by most commentators. <span class="cmt_word">Let no man stay him.</span> We had in <a href="/proverbs/24-11.htm">Proverbs 24:11</a>, etc., an injunction to save human life; but the case was quite different from this of wilful murder. Here it is directed that no one attempt to save him from the punishment which he has incurred, or to comfort him under the remorse which he suffers. Let him be left alone to meet the fate which he has merited. The LXX. gives a different idea to the gnome, "He who becomes bail for a man charged with murder shall be banished and shall not be in safety." They add a verse which we shall meet again, almost in the same words (<a href="/proverbs/29-17.htm">Proverbs 29:17, 18</a>), "Chasten thy son, and he will love thee, and will give honour to thy soul; he shall not obey a sinful nation." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/28-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1453;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">burdened</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1443;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#353;uq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6231.htm">Strong's 6231: </a> </span><span class="str2">To press upon, oppress, defraud, violate, overflow</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by bloodguilt</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7695;am-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1818.htm">Strong's 1818: </a> </span><span class="str2">Blood, of man, an animal, the juice of the grape, bloodshed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will be a fugitive</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1437;&#1504;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;n&#363;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5127.htm">Strong's 5127: </a> </span><span class="str2">To flit, vanish away</span><br /><br /><span class="word">until</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5704.htm">Strong's 5704: </a> </span><span class="str2">As far as, even to, up to, until, while</span><br /><br /><span class="word">death;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_953.htm">Strong's 953: </a> </span><span class="str2">A pit, cistern, well</span><br /><br /><span class="word">let no one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_408.htm">Strong's 408: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">support</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1502;&#1456;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#7791;&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8551.htm">Strong's 8551: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sustain, to obtain, keep fast, to help, follow close</span><br /><br /><span class="word">him.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/28-17.htm">Proverbs 28:17 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/28-17.htm">Proverbs 28:17 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/28-17.htm">Proverbs 28:17 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/28-17.htm">Proverbs 28:17 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/28-17.htm">Proverbs 28:17 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/28-17.htm">Proverbs 28:17  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/28-17.htm">Proverbs 28:17 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/28-17.htm">Proverbs 28:17 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/28-17.htm">Proverbs 28:17 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/28-17.htm">Proverbs 28:17 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/28-17.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 28:17 A man who is tormented by life (Prov.
