In the cultural context of ancient Israel, a wife's role was crucial in maintaining the household's well-being. The Hebrew word for "good" (&#1496;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;, tov) encompasses prosperity, happiness, and moral goodness, suggesting that her actions contribute positively to her husband's life. This aligns with the biblical principle found in <a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>, where God creates a helper suitable for Adam, emphasizing partnership and mutual support. The virtuous woman exemplifies the wisdom and industriousness praised throughout Proverbs, embodying the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p><b>and not harm</b><br>The commitment to avoid causing harm underscores the importance of trust and integrity in a marital relationship. In biblical times, a wife's betrayal or negligence could lead to significant social and economic consequences for the family. The Hebrew word for "harm" (&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;, ra) often denotes evil or misfortune, indicating that her actions are consistently aimed at preventing any negative impact on her husband. This reflects the broader biblical theme of love and faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/13-4.htm">1 Corinthians 13:4-7</a>, where love is described as patient, kind, and not self-seeking. The virtuous woman's dedication to her husband's well-being mirrors the covenantal faithfulness God shows to His people.<p><b>all the days of her life</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the lifelong commitment and consistency of the virtuous woman's actions. Her dedication is not temporary or conditional but extends throughout her entire life. This mirrors the biblical concept of covenant, which is enduring and steadfast, as seen in God's promises to His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>). The phrase also suggests a type of Christ, as Jesus is the ultimate example of one who brings good and not harm to His bride, the Church, throughout eternity. The virtuous woman's unwavering commitment serves as a model for believers, encouraging them to live lives marked by faithfulness and integrity, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>, which urges believers not to grow weary in doing good.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_virtuous_woman.htm">The Virtuous Woman</a></b><br>The subject of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>, often referred to as the "Proverbs 31 Woman," is an idealized figure representing the epitome of virtue, wisdom, and diligence in a wife.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/her_husband.htm">Her Husband</a></b><br>The recipient of the good that the virtuous woman brings.
