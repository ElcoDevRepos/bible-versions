In ancient Israelite culture, as in many societies, the first speaker in a legal or public dispute could sway opinions simply by being the first to articulate their argument. This reflects the human tendency to accept initial information as truth, a concept also seen in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a> when Eve is persuaded by the serpent's first argument. The importance of discernment and wisdom in judgment is emphasized throughout Proverbs, underscoring the need for careful evaluation of all sides of a matter.<p><b>until another comes</b><br>The arrival of another party introduces the necessity of hearing multiple perspectives. This aligns with the biblical principle of establishing truth through multiple witnesses, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>, which states that a matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses. This principle is foundational in both Old and New Testament teachings, emphasizing the importance of thorough examination and fairness in judgment.<p><b>and cross-examines him</b><br>Cross-examination is a critical component of justice, ensuring that claims are tested and verified. This practice was integral to the judicial processes in ancient Israel, where elders and judges would hear cases at the city gates, as described in <a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1-11</a>. The process of cross-examination serves as a metaphor for spiritual discernment, encouraging believers to test all things and hold fast to what is good, as instructed in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and truth revealed in Jesus Christ, who is described as the faithful and true witness in <a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom. His insights into human behavior and justice are reflected in this proverb.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_israel.htm">Ancient Israel</a></b><br>- The cultural and judicial context of ancient Israel, where disputes were often settled at the city gates by elders, provides the backdrop for understanding the importance of hearing both sides of a account.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judicial_proceedings.htm">Judicial Proceedings</a></b><br>- The process of cross-examination in legal settings, which is implied in this proverb, highlights the importance of thorough investigation and fairness in judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_discernment.htm">The Importance of Discernment</a></b><br>In a world filled with information, discernment is crucial.

Thus the maxims, "One story is good till the other is told," and "Audi alteram partem," receive confirmation. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Justus prior est accusator sui.</span> So Septuagint, "The righteous is his own accuser in opening the suit (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>)." He cuts the ground from under the adversary's feet by at once owning his fault. St. Gregory more than once, in his 'Moralia,' adduces this rendering. Thus on <a href="/job/7-11.htm">Job 7:11</a>, "To put the mouth to labour is to employ it in the confession of sin done, but the righteous man doth not refrain his mouth, in that, forestalling the wrath of the searching Judge, he falls wroth upon himself in words of self-confession. Hence it is written, 'The just man is first the accuser of himself'" (so lib. 22:33). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/18-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The first</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;ri&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7223.htm">Strong's 7223: </a> </span><span class="str2">First, in place, time, rank</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to state his case</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;r&#238;&#183;&#7687;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7379.htm">Strong's 7379: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strife, dispute</span><br /><br /><span class="word">seems right</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;ad&#183;d&#238;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6662.htm">Strong's 6662: </a> </span><span class="str2">Just, righteous</span><br /><br /><span class="word">until another</span><br /><span class="heb">0</span> <span class="translit">(0)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">comes forward</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and examines him.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;q&#257;&#183;r&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2713.htm">Strong's 2713: </a> </span><span class="str2">To penetrate, to examine intimately</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/18-17.htm">Proverbs 18:17 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/18-17.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 18:17 He who pleads his cause first seems (Prov.
