In the biblical context, wisdom is often depicted as a woman calling out in public places, urging people to follow her ways (<a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20-21</a>). The refusal of this call signifies a rejection of God's guidance and instruction. Historically, the Israelites were often warned by prophets to heed God's call, yet they frequently turned away, leading to consequences such as exile. This refusal can be seen as a parallel to the rejection of Jesus Christ, who is described as the embodiment of wisdom (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>). The call of wisdom is akin to the call of the Gospel, inviting people to repentance and a relationship with God.<p><b>and no one took my outstretched hand</b><br>The imagery of an outstretched hand is significant in biblical literature, often symbolizing an offer of help, mercy, or salvation. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, extending a hand was a gesture of friendship and assistance. This phrase suggests that despite the availability of divine help and guidance, people chose to ignore it. The outstretched hand can also be seen as a type of Christ, who offers salvation to all but is often rejected (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>). This rejection is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God's offers of grace and redemption are frequently spurned by humanity. The outstretched hand is a powerful symbol of God's persistent love and desire for reconciliation with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom.htm">Wisdom</a></b><br>Personified as a woman calling out to the simple and foolish, offering guidance and instruction.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_simple_and_foolish.htm">The Simple and Foolish</a></b><br>Those who lack understanding and reject wisdom's call, choosing ignorance over knowledge.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city.htm">The City</a></b><br>The setting where wisdom raises her voice, symbolizing the public and accessible nature of divine wisdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_of_wisdom.htm">The Call of Wisdom</a></b><br>An event where wisdom actively reaches out to people, offering them the opportunity to learn and grow.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rejection_of_wisdom.htm">Rejection of Wisdom</a></b><br>The response of those who ignore or refuse the guidance and instruction offered by wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_responding_to_wisdom.htm">The Urgency of Responding to Wisdom</a></b><br>Ignoring wisdom's call leads to consequences.
