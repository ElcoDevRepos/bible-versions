In biblical times, animals were essential for agriculture, transportation, and daily life, making their well-being crucial. The righteous man's care reflects God's command in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a> to have dominion over the earth responsibly. This care for animals can be seen as a reflection of God's own compassion, as seen in <a href="/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a>, where the Lord is described as good to all, with mercy over all His works. The righteous person's actions mirror the character of God, who values all His creation.<p><b>but the tender mercies of the wicked are only cruelty</b><br>This phrase contrasts the genuine compassion of the righteous with the superficial kindness of the wicked. The term "tender mercies" suggests an outward appearance of kindness, yet the underlying intent is harmful. This reflects the deceitful nature of the wicked, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, which describes the heart as deceitful above all things. The wicked's actions, though seemingly merciful, ultimately lead to harm and suffering, revealing their true nature. This contrast serves as a warning against hypocrisy and encourages genuine compassion, aligning with the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15-20</a>, where He warns against false prophets who appear harmless but are inwardly dangerous.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/righteous_man.htm">Righteous Man</a></b><br>Represents individuals who live according to God's standards, showing compassion and care for all of God's creation, including animals.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/wicked.htm">Wicked</a></b><br>Refers to those who live contrary to God's ways, often characterized by cruelty and lack of genuine compassion.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/animals.htm">Animals</a></b><br>In this context, animals are part of God's creation, deserving of care and respect, reflecting the broader principle of stewardship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, known for his wisdom and understanding of God's laws.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_israel.htm">Ancient Israel</a></b><br>The cultural and historical backdrop of Proverbs, where agricultural life was common, and animals were integral to daily living.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/compassionate_stewardship.htm">Compassionate Stewardship</a></b><br>As stewards of God's creation, believers are called to treat animals with kindness and respect, reflecting God's love and care.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/character_reflection.htm">Character Reflection</a></b><br>The way we treat animals can be a reflection of our character and our relationship with God.

It is not a passing sentiment but an active watchfulness.<p>- God calls His people to thoughtful stewardship: &#8220;The LORD God took the man and placed him in the Garden of Eden to work it and keep it&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>).<p>- Real care shows itself in practical steps:<p>&#8226; Feeding, sheltering, and protecting the creature.<p>&#8226; Avoiding needless pain or neglect.<p>- This careful regard echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>, &#8220;Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain&#8221;, emphasizing that productivity never trumps compassion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of his animal</b><p>- Scripture does not confine compassion to humans alone. Even beasts belong to the Lord: &#8220;For every beast of the forest is Mine&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10</a>).<p>- <a href="/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a> links Sabbath rest to livestock, proving God&#8217;s concern for their well-being.<p>- Acting kindly toward an animal reflects the Creator&#8217;s heart, demonstrating that dominion (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>) is responsible care, not exploitation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but the tender mercies</b><p>- &#8220;Tender mercies&#8221; is an ironic phrase here.

The righteous, transformed by God, extend genuine, practical care even to animals, mirroring the Creator&#8217;s own kindness. The wicked, lacking that new heart, can offer only a counterfeit mercy that ends in cruelty. God measures compassion not by sentimental words but by selfless, consistent action flowing from a righteous heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Regardeth the life of his beast.--</span>Rather, <span class= "ital">knows their feelings </span>(comp. <a href="/exodus/23-9.htm" title="Also you shall not oppress a stranger: for you know the heart of a stranger, seeing you were strangers in the land of Egypt.">Exodus 23:9</a>), and so can feel for them.

The LXX. translates "pitieth." The care for the lower animals, and their kind treatment, are not the produce of modern sentiment and civilization. Mosaic legislation and various expressions in Scripture recognize the duty. God's mercies are over all his works; he saves both man and beast; he hateth nothing that he hath made (<a href="/psalms/36-6.htm">Psalm 36:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a>; <a href="/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>; Wisd. 11:24). So he enacted that the rest of the sabbath should extend to the domestic animals (<a href="/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>); that a man should help the over-burdened beast, even of his enemy (<a href="/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4, 5</a>); that the unequal strength of the ox and the ass should not be yoked together in the plough (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-10.htm">Deuteronomy 22:10</a>); that the ox should not be muzzled when he was treading out the corn (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>): that the sitting bird should not be taken from her little brood (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-6.htm">Deuteronomy 22:6</a>), nor a kid seethed in its mother's milk (<a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>). Such humane injunctions were perhaps specially needed at a time when man's life was little regarded, and animal sacrifices had a tendency to make men cruel and unfeeling, when their symbolical meaning was obscured by long familiarity. These enactments regarding animals, and the mysterious significance affixed to the blood (<a href="/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>), afforded speaking lessons of tenderness and consideration for the inferior creatures, and <span class="accented">a fortiori</span> taught regard for the happiness and comfort of fellow men. Our blessed Lord has spoken of God's ears of flowers and the lower creatures of his hand. <span class="cmt_word">But the tender mercies;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the bowels</span>, regarded as the seat of feeling. The wicked cannot be supposed to have "tender mercies;" hence it is best to take the word in the sense of "feelings," "affections." What should be mercy and love are in an evil man only hard-heartedness and cruelty. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/12-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A righteous [man]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1463;&#1453;&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;ad&#183;d&#238;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6662.htm">Strong's 6662: </a> </span><span class="str2">Just, righteous</span><br /><br /><span class="word">regards</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1461;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7695;&#234;&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the life</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1462;&#1443;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(ne&#183;p&#772;e&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5315.htm">Strong's 5315: </a> </span><span class="str2">A soul, living being, life, self, person, desire, passion, appetite, emotion </span><br /><br /><span class="word">of his animal,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1462;&#1502;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;hem&#183;t&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_929.htm">Strong's 929: </a> </span><span class="str2">A dumb beast, any large quadruped, animal</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but the tender mercies</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1469;&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ra&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;m&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7356.htm">Strong's 7356: </a> </span><span class="str2">Compassion, the womb, a maiden</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the wicked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1437;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7563.htm">Strong's 7563: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wrong, an, bad person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are only cruelty.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1499;&#1456;&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7733;&#183;z&#257;&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_394.htm">Strong's 394: </a> </span><span class="str2">Terrible</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 12:10 A righteous man regards the life (Prov.
