The father-son dynamic is a common motif in Proverbs, emphasizing the importance of passing down wisdom through generations. This reflects the broader biblical theme of instruction and discipleship, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are commanded to teach God's laws to their children.<p><b>Let your heart lay hold of my words</b><br>The heart in Hebrew thought is the center of one's being, encompassing mind, will, and emotions. To "lay hold" suggests an active, intentional effort to internalize and embrace wisdom. This aligns with the biblical emphasis on internal transformation, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>, where the psalmist treasures God's word in his heart to avoid sin. The heart's role in understanding and wisdom is further highlighted in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God promises to write His law on the hearts of His people.<p><b>keep my commands and you will live</b><br>This phrase underscores the connection between obedience to divine wisdom and life. In the Old Testament, life is often associated with blessings, prosperity, and longevity, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19-20</a>, where choosing life involves loving and obeying God. The concept of life here is not merely physical but encompasses spiritual well-being and alignment with God's purposes. This anticipates the New Testament teaching of Jesus, who offers eternal life through obedience to His commands, as seen in <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a> and <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>, where He speaks of giving life abundantly.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- The author of Proverbs, traditionally believed to be King Solomon, who is imparting wisdom to his son.

His object in doing so is to show that his own teaching was in harmony with it, and therefore worthy of attention. His precepts, admonitions, and warnings are not his only, but those of his father. Other examples of David's instructions to Solomon are found in <a href="/1_kings/2-2.htm">1 Kings 2:2</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/22-12.htm">1 Chronicles 22:12, 13</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And he taught;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> his father, for <span class="accented">vayyoreni</span> is masculine.
