Known for his wisdom, Solomon's reign is often considered a golden age in Israel's history. His proverbs are part of the wisdom literature in the Bible, which includes Job, Psalms, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon. These writings are designed to impart practical and moral guidance. Solomon's wisdom was a gift from God, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/3-5.htm">1 Kings 3:5-14</a>, where God grants him unparalleled wisdom. This introduction sets the stage for the collection of sayings that follow, emphasizing their divine inspiration and authority.<p><b>A wise son brings joy to his father:</b><br>In ancient Israelite culture, family was central, and the behavior of children directly impacted the family's honor and reputation. A wise son, one who lives according to God's commandments and exercises discernment, brings joy and pride to his father. This reflects the biblical principle that wisdom leads to life and prosperity, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13-18</a>. The joy of a father in a wise son can also be seen as a reflection of God's joy in His obedient children, drawing a parallel to the relationship between God the Father and Jesus Christ, who is described as the embodiment of wisdom in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>.<p><b>But a foolish son grief to his mother:</b><br>The contrast here highlights the pain and sorrow a mother experiences when her child acts foolishly, disregarding wisdom and moral instruction. In the cultural context, a mother's role often included nurturing and teaching children, so a foolish son would be seen as a failure to uphold family values and divine commandments. This grief is not just emotional but can also have social and economic repercussions, as foolishness often leads to destructive behavior. The Bible frequently warns against folly, equating it with sin and separation from God, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/14.htm">Proverbs 14:1 and 15</a>:20. The grief of a mother can also be seen as a metaphor for the sorrow God feels when His people turn away from Him, as expressed in passages like <a href="/hosea/11.htm">Hosea 11:1-4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The son of King David and Bathsheba, Solomon was the third king of Israel and is traditionally credited with writing the Book of Proverbs.

Unlike temporary disappointments, a child&#8217;s persistent rebellion pierces a parent&#8217;s heart day after day.<p>&#8226; The warning is clear: choices made by children reverberate through the family, either refreshing or wounding those who love them most.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/10-1.htm">Proverbs 10:1</a> introduces Solomon&#8217;s collection of concise, Spirit-inspired truths.

(See above, in the <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>) Each verse is distinct and complete in itself; but the collector appears to have endeavoured to throw together such as touched on the same subject.

FIRST GREAT COLLECTION (375) OF SOLOMONIC PROVERBS. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1-ch. 12:28.</span> - First section. The sections are noted by their commencing usually with the words, "a wise son." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The proverbs of Solomon.</span> This is the title of the new part of the book; it is omitted in the Septuagint. There is some kind of loose connection in the grouping of these proverbs, but it is difficult to follow. "Ordo frustra quaeritur ubi nullus fuit observatus," says Mart. Geier. Wordsworth considers the present chapter to contain exemplifications of the principles and results of the two ways of life displayed in the preceding nine chapters. The antithetical character of the sentences is most marked and well sustained. As the book is specially designed for the edification of youth, it begins with an appropriate saying. <span class="cmt_word">A wise son maketh a glad father.</span> As wisdom comprises all moral excellence, and folly is vice and perversity, the opposite characters attributed to the son are obvious. The mother is introduced for the sake of parallelism; though some commentators suggest that as the father would be naturally elated by his son's virtues, which would conduce to honour and high estate, so the mother would be grieved at vices which her training had not subdued, and her indulgence had fostered. If this seems somewhat far-fetched, we may consider that the father in the maxim includes the mother, and the mother the father, the two being separated for the purpose of contrast (see on Proverbs 26:3). The word for heaviness occurs in <a href="/proverbs/14-13.htm">Proverbs 14:13</a> and Proverbs 17:21. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/10-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The proverbs</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;l&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4912.htm">Strong's 4912: </a> </span><span class="str2">A pithy maxim, a simile</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Solomon:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1451;&#1502;&#1465;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;m&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8010.htm">Strong's 8010: </a> </span><span class="str2">Solomon -- David's son and successor to his throne</span><br /><br /><span class="word">A wise</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1453;&#1499;&#1464;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2450.htm">Strong's 2450: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">brings joy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#347;am&#183;ma&#7717;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8055.htm">Strong's 8055: </a> </span><span class="str2">To brighten up, be, blithe, gleesome</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to his father,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1425;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1.htm">Strong's 1: </a> </span><span class="str2">Father</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but a foolish</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1437;&#1505;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;s&#238;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3684.htm">Strong's 3684: </a> </span><span class="str2">Stupid fellow, dullard, fool</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1461;&#1445;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
