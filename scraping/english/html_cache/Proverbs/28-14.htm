The idea of reverence here implies a continual awareness and respect for God's presence and commandments. This aligns with the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, where the fear of the Lord is described as the beginning of knowledge. Reverence is not merely an emotional response but a lifestyle of obedience and humility before God. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, reverence was demonstrated through adherence to the Law and participation in religious practices. This phrase suggests that a life marked by consistent reverence leads to divine favor and protection.<p><b>but he who hardens his heart falls into trouble</b><br>The imagery of a "hardened heart" is frequently used in Scripture to describe a state of spiritual insensitivity and rebellion against God. This phrase echoes the narrative of Pharaoh in Exodus, whose hardened heart led to his downfall. In a broader biblical context, a hardened heart is often associated with pride and stubbornness, as seen in <a href="/psalms/95-8.htm">Psalm 95:8</a> and <a href="/hebrews/3-15.htm">Hebrews 3:15</a>. The consequences of such a condition are severe, leading to spiritual and often physical trouble. The historical context of this proverb reflects the wisdom literature's emphasis on the consequences of one's choices. In a society where community and covenant with God were central, a hardened heart would lead to alienation and divine judgment. This phrase serves as a warning that rejecting God's guidance results in inevitable difficulties and distress.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_reverent_man.htm">The Reverent Man</a></b><br>This refers to an individual who maintains a constant attitude of reverence and fear of the Lord.
