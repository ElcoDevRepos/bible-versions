The term "perverse" refers to those who are morally twisted or corrupt, indicating a heart that is not aligned with God's righteousness. In biblical context, the heart is often seen as the center of one's being, encompassing thoughts, intentions, and will. The use of "abomination" signifies something that is utterly repulsive to God, similar to the strong language used in <a href="/leviticus/18-22.htm">Leviticus 18:22</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/25-16.htm">Deuteronomy 25:16</a>, where certain practices are described as abominations. This reflects God's holiness and His intolerance for sin. The emphasis on the heart suggests that God is concerned not just with outward actions but with the inner motivations and attitudes of individuals.<p><b>but the blameless in their walk are His delight</b><br>In contrast to the perverse, those who are "blameless" are described as being a source of joy to God. The term "blameless" does not imply sinlessness but rather integrity and uprightness in one's conduct. This aligns with the biblical theme of walking in righteousness, as seen in <a href="/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>, where Noah is described as a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time. The "walk" refers to one's way of life or conduct, suggesting a consistent pattern of living that aligns with God's commandments. This phrase underscores the biblical principle that God delights in those who strive to live according to His will, as seen in <a href="/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>, where the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord, and He delights in his way. The contrast between the perverse and the blameless highlights the moral choices that individuals must make and the corresponding divine response.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature.

Jesus said, &#8220;For out of the heart come evil thoughts&#8230; These are what defile a man&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/15-19.htm">Matthew 15:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Jeremiah confirms the problem: &#8220;The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Are an abomination to the LORD</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Abomination&#8221; is strong language&#8212;God&#8217;s settled, holy revulsion toward sin (compare <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>, a list of actions the LORD hates).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/5-4.htm">Psalm 5:4-6</a> underscores this: &#8220;You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness&#8230; You hate all workers of iniquity&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The point is not mere dislike; it is absolute moral opposition.
