In biblical context, "woe" often signifies deep distress or calamity, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11-12</a>, where those who pursue strong drink are warned of impending judgment. The term sets the stage for understanding the broader implications of a lifestyle that leads away from wisdom and towards self-destruction.<p><b>Who has sorrow?</b><br>Sorrow here refers to the emotional and spiritual pain that accompanies a life of indulgence. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, sorrow was often linked to the consequences of sin and disobedience to God's commandments. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that contrasts the fleeting pleasures of sin with the lasting joy found in obedience to God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/32-10.htm">Psalm 32:10-11</a>.<p><b>Who has contentions?</b><br>Contentions, or strife, are a natural outcome of a lifestyle marked by excess and lack of self-control. Proverbs frequently warns against the dangers of quarrelsome behavior (<a href="/proverbs/17-14.htm">Proverbs 17:14</a>). In the historical context, such behavior would disrupt community harmony, which was vital for survival and prosperity in ancient societies.<p><b>Who has complaints?</b><br>Complaints arise from dissatisfaction and unrest, often stemming from unmet desires and the consequences of poor choices. Biblically, murmuring and complaining are seen as signs of a lack of faith and gratitude, as demonstrated by the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-2.htm">Exodus 16:2-3</a>). This phrase serves as a warning against the discontent that follows a life not aligned with God's wisdom.<p><b>Who has needless wounds?</b><br>Needless wounds suggest self-inflicted harm resulting from reckless behavior. In the ancient world, physical injuries could have severe consequences due to limited medical knowledge and resources. This phrase underscores the tangible, physical dangers of a lifestyle characterized by excess, drawing a parallel to the spiritual wounds caused by sin.<p><b>Who has bloodshot eyes?</b><br>Bloodshot eyes are a visible sign of overindulgence, particularly in alcohol. This imagery would have been easily understood in the ancient Near Eastern context, where wine was a common part of daily life but also a potential source of moral and physical decline. The phrase serves as a vivid reminder of the outward manifestations of inner folly, echoing the biblical theme that one's actions and choices are ultimately revealed in their countenance and health.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wise_author.htm">The Wise Author</a></b><br>Traditionally, King Solomon is credited with writing the Proverbs.

Woe signals misery that is deeper than momentary pain&#8212;an ongoing heaviness of soul. Scripture often joins woe to the misuse of alcohol. Isaiah laments, &#8220;Woe to those who rise early in the morning to pursue strong drink&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11</a>). Solomon agrees: &#8220;Wine is a mocker, strong drink is a brawler&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>). In other words, the one who lets wine master him invites a pit of trouble that God never intended for His people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who has sorrow?</b><p>Sorrow naturally follows woe, the way night follows dusk. When a person &#8220;lingers over wine&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/23-30.htm">Proverbs 23:30</a>), regret piles up: broken promises, violated consciences, damaged relationships. Solomon warns, &#8220;In the end it bites like a snake and stings like a viper&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/23-32.htm">Proverbs 23:32</a>). Noah&#8217;s post-flood fall (<a href="/genesis/9-21.htm">Genesis 9:21</a>) shows how a single night of drunkenness can cast a shadow over an otherwise righteous life. Alcohol-driven choices leave a hangover of grief that lasts far beyond the empty glass.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who has contentions?</b><p>Contention speaks to the quarrels, fights, and drama that alcohol stirs up. Drunkenness loosens tongues and lowers restraints; the result is &#8220;brawling&#8221; (again <a href="/proverbs/20-1.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>). James reminds us that &#8220;wars and fights&#8221; erupt from desires at war within (<a href="/james/4-1.htm">James 4:1</a>), and alcohol inflames those desires. Where Christ calls believers to &#8220;pursue peace with everyone&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-14.htm">Hebrews 12:14</a>), intoxication multiplies conflict instead.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who has complaints?</b><p>Complaints picture the chronic grumbling that flows from unmet expectations and foggy thinking. Israel&#8217;s wilderness whining (<a href="/numbers/11-1.htm">Numbers 11:1</a>) shows how complaining offends God, but alcohol makes it habitual. Paul urges, &#8220;Do everything without complaining or arguing&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-14.htm">Philippians 2:14</a>). A drink-soaked life, however, swaps gratitude for grumbling, poisoning homes and friendships with negativity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who has needless wounds?</b><p>The phrase literally points to injuries that never had to happen. Solomon illustrates it a few verses later: &#8220;They struck me, but I feel no pain! &#8230; When will I wake up to find another drink?&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/23-35.htm">Proverbs 23:35</a>). From banged-up knuckles to wrecked cars, intoxication writes a catalogue of avoidable harm. God designed bodies as temples of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>); needless wounds deface that temple and testify to self-inflicted folly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who has bloodshot eyes?</b><p>Bloodshot eyes reveal the physical toll&#8212;sleeplessness, dehydration, and internal strain. Solomon warns, &#8220;Your eyes will see strange things&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/23-33.htm">Proverbs 23:33</a>). Paul draws the contrast: &#8220;Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to reckless indiscretion. Instead, be filled with the Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>). Spirit-filled eyes stay clear; wine-clouded eyes grow red and dim, advertising inward disorder.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/23-29.htm">Proverbs 23:29</a> strings together six vivid symptoms that all point to one culprit: the person enslaved to drink. Woe, sorrow, strife, grumbling, injury, and weary eyes are not random&#8212;they are predictable fruits of alcohol abuse. God records these warnings not to rob joy but to protect it. Choosing His Spirit over the bottle spares us needless heartache and opens the door to lasting peace, clear vision, and genuine fellowship with Him and with others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Wounds without cause?</span>--Which might have been avoided, and which serve no good end.<p><span class= "bld">Redness of eyes?</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">dimness.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29-35.</span> - Here follows a mashal ode or song on the subject of drunkenness, which is closely connected with the sin mentioned in the previous lines. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who hath woe? who hath sorrow?</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">lemi oi, lemi aboi</span>, where <span class="accented">oi</span> and <span class="accented">aboi</span> are interjections of pain or grief.
