The idea that God sees all human actions is echoed in passages like <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>, where David acknowledges that God knows every movement and thought. In the ancient Near Eastern context, this understanding of a deity's omnipresence was unique to the Israelites, contrasting with the localized gods of surrounding cultures. The phrase also serves as a moral reminder that nothing is hidden from God, encouraging believers to live righteously. This aligns with the wisdom literature's focus on living a life that honors God, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>, which states that God will bring every deed into judgment.<p><b>and the LORD examines all his paths</b><br>The term "examines" suggests a thorough and discerning observation, indicating that God not only sees but also evaluates human actions. This reflects the biblical theme of divine judgment, where God assesses the moral quality of human behavior. The concept of "paths" symbolizes the choices and directions one takes in life, a common metaphor in Proverbs. This examination is not merely punitive but also protective, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23-3.htm">Psalm 23:3</a>, where God leads in paths of righteousness. Theologically, this underscores God's role as both judge and shepherd, guiding and correcting His people. The phrase also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of Christ as the way (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), where Jesus embodies the path to righteousness and eternal life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal presence and omniscience.

Nothing is outside the scope.<p>- Proverbs often links &#8220;ways&#8221; with moral direction: &#8220;All a man&#8217;s ways are innocent in his own sight, but his motives are weighed by the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-2.htm">Proverbs 16:2</a>).<p>- The context of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/5.htm">Proverbs 5</a> warns a son about adultery, reminding us that even the most secret rendezvous is still part of our &#8220;ways.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/psalms/139-3.htm">Psalm 139:3</a> echoes this all-encompassing reach: &#8220;You search out my path and my lying down; You are aware of all my ways&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are before the eyes of the LORD</b><p>- &#8220;Before&#8221; means in full view.

Comfort, because <a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a> promises, &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous.&#8221; Caution, because <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a> reminds us, &#8220;Nothing in all creation is hidden from God&#8217;s sight&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the LORD examines all his paths</b><p>- God not only sees; He &#8220;examines,&#8221; weighing motives, judging direction, discerning destination.<p>- <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a> puts it plainly: &#8220;I, the LORD, search the heart; I examine the mind, to reward a man according to his ways&#8221;.<p>- <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a> contrasts human and divine vision: &#8220;Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart&#8221;.<p>- <a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a> points to the coming day when &#8220;He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men&#8217;s hearts&#8221;.<p>- In <a href="/bsb/proverbs/5.htm">Proverbs 5</a> this scrutiny underlines why flirtation with sin is perilous: the Judge already knows every step toward it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/5-21.htm">Proverbs 5:21</a> assures us that every road we travel lies wide open under God&#8217;s watchful eyes.

Living with that awareness steers us away from secret sin and toward wholehearted devotion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">For the ways of man </span>. . .--Another reason for avoiding sin is the certainty of detection by the Judge, whose "eyes run to and fro through the whole earth" (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm" title="For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him. Herein you have done foolishly: therefore from now on you shall have wars.">2Chronicles 16:9</a>), comp. <a href="/psalms/11-4.htm" title="The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.">Psalm 11:4</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the ways of man are before the eyes of the Lord.</span> The obvious meaning here is that as "the eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good" (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>), there is no possibility of any act of immorality escaping God's notice. The consciousness of this fact is to be the restraining motive, inasmuch as he who sees will also punish every transgression. The great truth acknowledged here is the omniscience of God, a truth which is borne witness to in almost identical language in Job: "For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings" (<a href="/job/34-21.htm">Job 34:21</a>; cf. 24:23 and Job 31:4). So Hanani the seer says to Asa King of Judah, "For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth" (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>); and Jehovah says, in Jeremiah, "For mine eyes are upon all their ways, they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes" (<a href="/jeremiah/16-17.htm">Jeremiah 16:17</a>; cf. 32:29); and again, in Hosea, "They are before my face" (<a href="/hosea/7-2.htm">Hosea 7:2</a>), and the same truth is re-echoed in the Epistle to the Hebrews, in all probability gathered from our passage, "All things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do" (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>)<span class="accented">. The ways of man</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the conduct of any individual man or woman; <span class="accented">ish</span>, "man," being used generically. <span class="accented">Are before the eyes of the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> are an object on which Jehovah fixes his gaze and scrutiny. And he pondereth all his goings. The word "he pondereth" is in the original <span class="accented">m'phalles</span>, the piel participle <span class="accented">of philles</span>, piel of the unused kal, <span class="accented">palas</span>, and appears to be properly rendered in the Authorized Version. This verb, however, has various meanings: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to make level, or prepare, as in <a href="/proverbs/4-26.htm">Proverbs 4:26</a> and Proverbs 5:6; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to weigh, or consider accurately, in which sense it is used here. <p>So Gesenius, Lee, Buxtorf, and Davidson. Jehovah not only sees, but weighs all that a man does, wheresoever he be, and will apportion rewards and punishments according to a man's actions (Patrick). The German commentators, Delitzsch and Zockler, however, look upon the word as indicating the overruling providence of God, just as the former part of the verse refers to his omniscience, and render, "he marketh out," in the sense that the Lord makes it possible for a man to walk in the way of uprightness and purity. There is nothing inherently objectionable in this view, since experience shows that the world is regulated by the Divine government, but it loses sight to some extent of the truth upon which the teacher appears to be insisting, which is that evil actions are visited with Divine retribution. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/5-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">ways</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(dar&#183;&#7733;&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1870.htm">Strong's 1870: </a> </span><span class="str2">A road, a course of life, mode of action</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are before</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1465;&#1448;&#1499;&#1463;&#1495;
