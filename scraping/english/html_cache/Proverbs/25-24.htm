The "corner of the roof" suggests a place of isolation and discomfort, emphasizing the extremity of the situation. This phrase highlights the value of peace and tranquility over physical comfort and material wealth. The imagery of the roof corner is also a metaphor for seeking solitude to avoid conflict, reflecting the wisdom literature's emphasis on the importance of peace in one's life. This idea is echoed in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/proverbs/21-9.htm">Proverbs 21:9</a>, which similarly contrasts the value of peace over domestic strife.<p><b>than to share a house with a quarrelsome wife</b><br>The "quarrelsome wife" represents ongoing conflict and discord within the home. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, the household was the center of daily life and social structure. A contentious environment would disrupt not only personal peace but also the broader family and community harmony. This phrase underscores the biblical principle of seeking harmony and understanding in relationships, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-33</a>, which discusses the roles and mutual respect between husbands and wives. The emphasis on a "quarrelsome wife" serves as a caution against allowing strife to dominate one's home life, advocating instead for a household characterized by love, respect, and cooperation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
