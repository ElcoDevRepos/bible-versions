In biblical context, the "upright" are those who live according to God's commandments and principles. Their presence and actions bring prosperity and stability to a community. This concept is echoed in <a href="/genesis/18-32.htm">Genesis 18:32</a>, where Abraham intercedes for Sodom, suggesting that the presence of righteous people can preserve a city. Historically, cities in ancient Israel were often built around a central place of worship, emphasizing the importance of spiritual and moral leadership. The idea of a city being "built up" suggests not only physical prosperity but also social and spiritual well-being, aligning with the biblical principle that righteousness exalts a nation (<a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>).<p><b>but by the mouth of the wicked it is torn down</b><br>The "mouth of the wicked" symbolizes the destructive power of evil speech, including lies, slander, and deceit. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, words held significant power, capable of influencing public opinion and inciting actions. The wicked, through their words, can sow discord and division, leading to the downfall of a community. This is reminiscent of <a href="/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6</a>, which describes the tongue as a fire that can corrupt the whole body. The historical context of Israel includes numerous examples where the words of false prophets or corrupt leaders led to national calamity, such as the division of the kingdom after Solomon's reign. The contrast between the constructive power of the upright and the destructive potential of the wicked underscores the biblical theme of the consequences of one's words and actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upright.htm">The Upright</a></b><br>Refers to those who live righteously and in accordance with God's commandments.
