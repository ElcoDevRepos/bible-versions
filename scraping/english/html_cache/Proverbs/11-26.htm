Hoarding grain during times of scarcity was seen as an act of selfishness and greed, leading to widespread suffering. The biblical context emphasizes the importance of community welfare and condemns actions that harm others for personal gain. This principle is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/james/5.htm">James 5:1-6</a>, which warns the rich about hoarding wealth at the expense of others. The act of hoarding grain can be seen as a metaphor for withholding any form of good that could benefit others, aligning with the broader biblical theme of generosity and stewardship.<p><b>but blessing will crown the one who sells it</b><br>Selling grain, especially during times of need, is portrayed as an act of righteousness and generosity. In the historical context, selling rather than hoarding grain would ensure that the community had access to necessary resources, promoting social stability and goodwill. This aligns with the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor and providing for those in need, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>. The imagery of a "crown" suggests honor and divine favor, indicating that God blesses those who act justly and selflessly. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate provider and sustainer, offering spiritual nourishment to all who seek Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hoarder.htm">The Hoarder</a></b><br>This person is characterized by selfishness and greed, withholding resources that could benefit others, especially in times of need.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seller.htm">The Seller</a></b><br>This individual is generous and willing to share resources, thus earning the community's blessing and favor.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people.htm">The People</a></b><br>The community or society that reacts to the actions of the hoarder and the seller, either with curses or blessings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_marketplace.htm">The Marketplace</a></b><br>While not explicitly mentioned, it is implied as the setting where the exchange of goods, such as grain, takes place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event_of_famine_or_need.htm">The Event of Famine or Need</a></b><br>The context suggests a time of scarcity when the actions of hoarding or selling grain have significant impacts on the community.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_dangers_of_greed.htm">The Dangers of Greed</a></b><br>Hoarding resources can lead to societal disapproval and divine disfavor.

The avaricious have always been found ready to buy corn and other necessary articles of consumption when plentiful, and wait till there was dearth in the market or scarcity in the land, and then sell them at famine prices. Amos sternly reproves this iniquity (<a href="/amos/8-4.htm">Amos 8:4</a>, etc.). It is a sin against justice and charity, and it is said of him who is guilty of it, <span class="cmt_word">the people shall curse him</span> (<a href="/proverbs/24-24.htm">Proverbs 24:24</a>). Such selfishness has often given rise to tumult and bloodshed, and has been punished in a signal manner. The legend of Bishop Hatto shows the popular feeling concerning these Dardanarians, as they were called by Ulpian ('Digest. Justin.,' 47:11.6). Such a one St. Chrysostom ('Hom. in 1 Cor.,' 39) calls "a common enemy of the blessings of the world, and a foe to the liberality of the Lord of the world, and a friend of mammon, or rather his slave." The Septuagint gives a curious rendering: "He who hohleth corn may he leave it for the peoples!" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> may neither he nor his heirs be benefited by his store, but may it be distributed among others far and near! <span class="cmt_word">That selleth it;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that breaketh it</span>, as it is said of Joseph when he sold corn to the Egyptians (<a href="/genesis/41-56.htm">Genesis 41:56</a>; <a href="/genesis/42-6.htm">Genesis 42:6</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/11-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3816.htm">Strong's 3816: </a> </span><span class="str2">A community</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will curse</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1467;&#1443;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(yiq&#183;q&#601;&#183;&#7687;u&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5344.htm">Strong's 5344: </a> </span><span class="str2">To puncture</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the hoarder</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1443;&#1504;&#1461;&#1469;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;n&#234;&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4513.htm">Strong's 4513: </a> </span><span class="str2">To debar, from benefit, injury</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of grain,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1453;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1250.htm">Strong's 1250: </a> </span><span class="str2">Grain, the open country</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but blessing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1437;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1293.htm">Strong's 1293: </a> </span><span class="str2">Benediction, prosperity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will crown</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;r&#333;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7218.htm">Strong's 7218: </a> </span><span class="str2">The head</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the one who sells it.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1512;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#353;&#183;b&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7666.htm">Strong's 7666: </a> </span><span class="str2">To deal in grain</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/11-26.htm">Proverbs 11:26 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/11-26.htm">Proverbs 11:26 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/11-26.htm">Proverbs 11:26 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/11-26.htm">Proverbs 11:26 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/11-26.htm">Proverbs 11:26 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/11-26.htm">Proverbs 11:26  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/11-26.htm">Proverbs 11:26 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/11-26.htm">Proverbs 11:26 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/11-26.htm">Proverbs 11:26 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/11-26.htm">Proverbs 11:26 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/11-26.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 11:26 People curse someone who withholds grain (Prov.
