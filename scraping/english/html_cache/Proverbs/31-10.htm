In the biblical context, the term "noble character" is often associated with wisdom and fear of the Lord, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>. The Hebrew word "chayil" used here can also mean strength or valor, suggesting that this woman is not only morally upright but also strong and capable. This aligns with the biblical portrayal of women like Ruth, who is described as a woman of noble character (<a href="/ruth/3-11.htm">Ruth 3:11</a>).<p><b>who can find?</b><br>This rhetorical question implies rarity and value. In ancient Israel, a woman of such character was considered a treasure, not easily found. The scarcity of such a woman underscores the importance of seeking wisdom and virtue, as emphasized throughout the book of Proverbs. This echoes the search for wisdom itself, which is portrayed as a precious and rare commodity (<a href="/proverbs/2-4.htm">Proverbs 2:4-5</a>).<p><b>She is far more precious than rubies.</b><br>Rubies, along with other precious stones, were highly valued in the ancient Near East for their beauty and rarity. This comparison elevates the worth of a virtuous woman above material wealth, suggesting that her value is immeasurable and eternal. This sentiment is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/8-11.htm">Proverbs 8:11</a>, where wisdom is also described as more precious than rubies. The comparison to rubies also points to the eternal value of spiritual and moral qualities over temporal riches, aligning with New Testament teachings on the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit (<a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_virtuous_woman.htm">The Virtuous Woman</a></b><br>The central figure in <a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10</a>, representing an ideal of godly womanhood characterized by strength, dignity, and wisdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_lemuel.htm">King Lemuel</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>, receiving wisdom from his mother, though not much is known about him outside of this chapter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_setting_of_proverbs.htm">The Setting of Proverbs</a></b><br>The book of Proverbs is a collection of wise sayings and teachings, often attributed to King Solomon, and is set in ancient Israel, providing moral and practical guidance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_noble_character.htm">The Value of Noble Character</a></b><br>The Hebrew word for "noble" (chayil) implies strength, capability, and valor.

Such a woman reflects the fear of the LORD that &#8220;brings great confidence&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/14-26.htm">Proverbs 14:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Her character aligns with the New Testament portrait of a godly wife whose beauty is &#8220;the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in God&#8217;s sight&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who can find?</b><p>&#8226; The rhetorical question underscores rarity. As with &#8220;many a man proclaims his loving devotion, but who can find a trustworthy man?&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/20-6.htm">Proverbs 20:6</a>), so a noble wife is not located by accident; she is sought, valued, and recognized by spiritual discernment.<p>&#8226; Finding her is portrayed as a gift from the Lord: &#8220;He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The search imagery also encourages men to prize character above charm or appearance (<a href="/proverbs/31-30.htm">Proverbs 31:30</a>), and it affirms that such women do exist&#8212;Ruth was called &#8220;a woman of noble character&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/3-11.htm">Ruth 3:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Far more precious than rubies</b><p>&#8226; Rubies, among the costliest gems of the ancient world, symbolize wealth and splendor; yet Scripture repeatedly teaches that moral and spiritual riches outshine material ones: wisdom &#8220;is more precious than rubies&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/3-15.htm">Proverbs 3:15</a>; 8:11).<p>&#8226; The verse elevates the wife&#8217;s worth above earthly treasure because she brings:<p>&#8211; Steadfast trust (<a href="/proverbs/31-11.htm">Proverbs 31:11-12</a>)<p>&#8211; Provision and industriousness (<a href="/proverbs/31-13.htm">Proverbs 31:13-19</a>)<p>&#8211; Compassion for the poor (<a href="/proverbs/31-20.htm">Proverbs 31:20</a>)<p>&#8211; Strength and dignity that laugh at the days to come (<a href="/proverbs/31-25.htm">Proverbs 31:25</a>)<p>&#8211; Instruction marked by kindness (<a href="/proverbs/31-26.htm">Proverbs 31:26</a>)<p>&#8226; Her value is therefore intrinsic, enduring, and grounded in her relationship with the Lord, just as eternal treasures are stored &#8220;where neither moth nor rust destroy&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10</a> opens the celebrated portrait of the virtuous wife by declaring that her God-shaped character is rare and exceeds the worth of the finest jewels.

(<a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm" title="Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.">Proverbs 31:10</a>, <span class= "ital">sqq.</span>)<p>This is written in the form of an acrostic, the twenty-two verses composing it each commencing with a letter of the Hebrew alphabet. This may have been done, as in the case of several of the psalms, which are of a didactic character (e.g., 25, 34, 37, 119), to render it more easy for committal to memory. By some writers the acrostic form has been supposed to argue a late date for the poem, but there is no evidence for this. One psalm, at all events, of which there seems no reason to doubt the Davidic authorship--the 9th--is cast in this form.<p>(10) <span class= "bld">Who can find a virtuous woman?</span>--Various mystical interpretations of the person here implied have been held at different times. She has been supposed to signify the Law, the Church, the Holy Spirit.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-31.</span> - Part IX. THIRD APPENDIX TO THE SECOND COLLECTION. This section contains an ode in praise of the virtuous woman, derived from a different source from that of the words of Agur, and belonging to a different age (see Introduction). It is an acrostic; that is, each verse begins with one of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, arranged in the usual order. We may compare this <span class="accented">mashal</span> with the alphabetical psalms, "Psalmi abcedarii," which are, more or less, of similar structure, but of which one only, the hundred and nineteenth, is so marked in the English versions. Other examples are <a href="/psalms/9.htm">Psalm 9, 10, 25, 34, 37, 111, 112, 145</a>; also <a href="/lamentations/1.htm">Lamentations 1, 2</a>, and 3. One object of this artificial construction was to render the matter easier to commit to memory. The spiritual expositors see in this description of the virtuous woman a prophetic representation of the Church of Christ in her truth and purity and influence. Thus Bode: "Hic sapientissimus regum Salomon laudes sanctae Ecclesiae versibus paucis sed plenissima veritate depingit.... Cujus (carminis) ordine perfectissimo alphabeti typice innuitur, quam plenissime hic vel animae cujusque fidelis, vel totius sanctae Ecclesiae, quae ex omnibus electis animabus una perficitur Catholica, virtutes ac praemia describantur." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - ALEPH. <span class="cmt_word">Who can find a virtuous woman?</span> The expression, <span class="accented">ishshah chayil</span>, "woman of force," has occurred in ch. 12:4 (where see note). <span class="accented">Mulierem</span> <span class="accented">fortem</span>, St. Jerome terms her; <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> is the rendering of the LXX., which places this section as the end of the whole Book of Proverbs. The expression combines the ideas of moral goodness and bodily vigour and activity. It is useless to try to fix the character upon any particular person. The representation is that of an ideal woman - the perfect housewife, the chaste helpmate of her husband, upright, God-fearing, economical, wise. See an anticipation of this character (<a href="/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22</a>; <a href="/proverbs/19-14.htm">Proverbs 19:14</a>); and a very different view (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-26.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:26</a>). It is very remarkable to meet with such a delineation of woman in the East, where the female generally occupies a most degraded position, and is cut off from all sphere of activity and administration. To paint such a portrait needed inspiration of some sort. Such a one is hard to find. <span class="cmt_word">Her price is far above rubies;</span> or, <span class="accented">pearls</span> (see on Proverbs 20:15 and Proverbs 3:15). Septuagint, "Such a one is more valuable than precious stones." There may be allusion to the custom of giving treasure in exchange for a wife, purchasing her, as it were, from her friends (comp. <a href="/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2</a>). At any rate, few only are privileged to meet with this excellent wife, and her worth cannot be estimated by any material object, however costly. St. Jerome, with a slight difference in the reading, has, <span class="accented">Procul, et de ultimis finibus pretium ejus</span>. You may go to the ends of the earth to find her equal in value. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/31-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">can find</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1425;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(yim&#183;&#7779;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4672.htm">Strong's 4672: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come forth to, appear, exist, to attain, find, acquire, to occur, meet, be present</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a wife</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1469;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;&#353;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of noble character?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1453;&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#183;yil)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2428.htm">Strong's 2428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A force, an army, wealth, virtue, valor, strength</span><br /><br /><span class="word">She is far</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1495;&#1465;&#1430;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#333;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7350.htm">Strong's 7350: </a> </span><span class="str2">Remote, of place, time, precious</span><br /><br /><span class="word">more precious</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7733;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4377.htm">Strong's 4377: </a> </span><span class="str2">Merchandise, value</span><br /><br /><span class="word">than rubies.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1504;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mip&#183;p&#601;&#183;n&#238;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6443.htm">Strong's 6443: </a> </span><span class="str2">A pearl</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 31:10 Who can find a worthy woman?
