In the ancient Near Eastern context, wisdom was highly valued and often associated with skill in living, moral discernment, and the ability to make sound decisions. The phrase suggests that pursuing wisdom is an act of self-love, as it leads to a better life and aligns with God's will. This aligns with the biblical principle that true wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The idea of loving oneself through wisdom can be connected to Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>, where loving one's neighbor as oneself implies a healthy self-regard rooted in God's truth.<p><b>one who safeguards understanding will find success.</b><br>Safeguarding understanding implies not only acquiring knowledge but also preserving and applying it wisely. In the biblical context, understanding is more than intellectual comprehension; it involves insight and discernment that guide one's actions. The promise of success for those who protect understanding reflects the biblical principle that God's wisdom leads to prosperity and well-being (<a href="/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a>). This success is not merely material but encompasses spiritual and relational prosperity. The concept of safeguarding understanding can be seen in the life of Jesus, who embodied perfect wisdom and understanding, leading to the ultimate success of fulfilling God's redemptive plan (<a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

Compare <a href="/ephesians/5-29.htm">Ephesians 5:29</a>, where Paul observes that no one &#8220;ever hated his own body, but he nourishes and cherishes it.&#8221; Seeking wisdom is the highest form of that nourishing care.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13</a> calls the person &#8220;blessed&#8221; who finds wisdom; <a href="/proverbs/8-35.htm">Proverbs 8:35</a> adds, &#8220;Whoever finds me finds life and obtains the favor of the LORD.&#8221; Favor, life, blessing&#8212;those are the fruits of wisdom, the very things everyone wishes for himself.<p>&#8226; Why is gaining wisdom an act of love toward ourselves?<p>&#8211; It steers us away from choices that wound body, mind, and spirit (<a href="/proverbs/4-5.htm">Proverbs 4:5-6</a>).<p>&#8211; It aligns our hearts with God&#8217;s design, sparing us the misery that flows from sin (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>).<p>&#8211; It equips us to love others better, fulfilling the second great commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>).<p>&#8226; So, buying wisdom&#8212;at the cost of time in Scripture, prayer, and godly counsel&#8212;is the surest investment we can make in our own well-being.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>One who safeguards understanding will find success</b><p>&#8226; The second line deepens the thought: &#8220;one who safeguards understanding will find success&#8221;.

"Wisdom" is, in the Hebrew, <span class="accented">leb.</span> "heart;" it is a matter, not of intellect only. but of will and affections (see on Proverbs 15:32). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1fb7;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "loveth himself." The contrary, "hateth his own soul," occurs in <a href="/proverbs/29-24.htm">Proverbs 29:24</a>. By striving to obtain wisdom a man shows that he has regard for the welfare of his soul and body. Hence St. Thomas Aquinas ('Sum. Theol.,' 1:2, qu. 25, art. 7, quoted by Corn. a Lapide) takes occasion to demonstrate that only good men are really lovers of themselves, while evil men are practically self-haters, proving his position by a reference to Arislotle's numeration of the characteristics of friendship, which the former exhibit, and none of which the latter can possess ('Eth. Nic.,' 9:4). <span class="cmt_word">He that keepeth understanding shall find</span> <span class="cmt_word">good</span> (<a href="/proverbs/16-20.htm">Proverbs 16:20</a>). A man must not only strive hard and use all available means to get wisdom and prudence, he must guard them like a precious treasure, not lose them for want of care or let them lie useless; and then he will find that they bring with themselves innumerable benefits. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/19-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He who acquires</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1465;&#1469;&#1504;&#1462;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#333;&#183;neh-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7069.htm">Strong's 7069: </a> </span><span class="str2">To erect, create, to procure, by purchase, to own</span><br /><br /><span class="word">wisdom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1468;&#1461;&#1453;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3820.htm">Strong's 3820: </a> </span><span class="str2">The heart, the feelings, the will, the intellect, centre</span><br /><br /><span class="word">loves</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;h&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_157.htm">Strong's 157: </a> </span><span class="str2">To have affection f</span><br /><br /><span class="word">himself;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(nap&#772;&#183;&#353;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5315.htm">Strong's 5315: </a> </span><span class="str2">A soul, living being, life, self, person, desire, passion, appetite, emotion </span><br /><br /><span class="word">one who safeguards</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1502;&#1461;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#333;&#183;m&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8104.htm">Strong's 8104: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hedge about, guard, to protect, attend to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">understanding</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1437;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8394.htm">Strong's 8394: </a> </span><span class="str2">Intelligence, an argument, caprice</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will find</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(lim&#183;&#7779;&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4672.htm">Strong's 4672: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come forth to, appear, exist, to attain, find, acquire, to occur, meet, be present</span><br /><br /><span class="word">success.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2896.htm">Strong's 2896: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pleasant, agreeable, good</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/19-8.htm">Proverbs 19:8 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/19-8.htm">Proverbs 19:8 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/19-8.htm">Proverbs 19:8 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/19-8.htm">Proverbs 19:8 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/19-8.htm">Proverbs 19:8 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/19-8.htm">Proverbs 19:8  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/19-8.htm">Proverbs 19:8 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/19-8.htm">Proverbs 19:8 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/19-8.htm">Proverbs 19:8 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/19-8.htm">Proverbs 19:8 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/19-8.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 19:8 He who gets wisdom loves his own (Prov.
