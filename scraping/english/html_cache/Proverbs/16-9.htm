In biblical context, the heart often represents the center of one's thoughts, emotions, and will. The Bible frequently acknowledges human agency and the ability to make choices, as seen in passages like <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>, where the Israelites are urged to choose whom they will serve. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed significant value on wisdom and planning, as seen in the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, including Proverbs itself. However, this phrase also implies the limitations of human understanding, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, which describes the heart as deceitful. <p><b>but the LORD determines his steps</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes God's sovereignty and ultimate control over human affairs. The use of "LORD" refers to Yahweh, the covenant name of God, indicating a personal and relational aspect of His guidance. Throughout Scripture, God's providence is a recurring theme, as seen in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>, where Joseph acknowledges God's hand in his life's events. Theologically, this reflects the belief in divine providence, where God orchestrates events according to His will and purpose. This concept is also echoed in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>, which assures believers that God works all things for good. The phrase suggests a balance between human responsibility and divine guidance, encouraging trust in God's plan, as seen in the life of Jesus Christ, who submitted to the Father's will in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
