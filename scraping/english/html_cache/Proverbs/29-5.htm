In the ancient Near Eastern context, flattery was a common tactic used to gain favor or manipulate others. The Bible frequently warns against flattery, as it can lead to deception and false security. In <a href="/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2-3</a>, the psalmist speaks against those who use flattering lips, highlighting the danger of deceitful speech. Flattery contrasts with the biblical call for honesty and integrity in relationships, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a>, which encourages speaking truthfully to one's neighbor.<p><b>spreads a net for his feet.</b><br>The imagery of spreading a net is a metaphor for setting a trap, often used in the Bible to describe deceitful or harmful intentions. In the ancient world, nets were commonly used for hunting and fishing, symbolizing entrapment and capture. This phrase suggests that flattery can lead to entrapment, both for the one who flatters and the one who is flattered. <a href="/proverbs/26-28.htm">Proverbs 26:28</a> also warns that a flattering mouth works ruin, indicating the destructive potential of such behavior. The concept of a "net" is used throughout Scripture to describe the consequences of sin and deceit, as seen in <a href="/psalms/140-5.htm">Psalm 140:5</a>, where the wicked lay snares for the righteous. This imagery serves as a caution against the dangers of manipulation and the importance of maintaining sincerity and truthfulness in relationships.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flatterer.htm">The Flatterer</a></b><br>This person uses insincere praise to manipulate or deceive others.
