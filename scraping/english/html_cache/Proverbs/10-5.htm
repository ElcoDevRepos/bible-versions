In ancient agrarian societies, summer was the critical time for gathering crops. A wise son is one who understands the seasons and acts accordingly, ensuring that the family has enough provisions. This wisdom is not just practical but also moral, reflecting a heart aligned with God's principles of stewardship and responsibility. The concept of wisdom here is deeply rooted in the fear of the Lord, as seen throughout Proverbs (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). The wise son can be seen as a type of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled His mission on earth, gathering His people and preparing them for the kingdom of God.<p><b>but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgraceful son</b><br>Sleeping during harvest is a metaphor for laziness and neglect. In the cultural context of the Bible, harvest time was a period of intense labor and opportunity. Failing to work during this time would not only bring shame to the individual but also to the family, as it could lead to a lack of food and resources. This disgrace is not merely social but also spiritual, as it reflects a failure to live according to God's design for work and provision. The disgraceful son contrasts with the diligent ant in <a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-8</a>, who prepares and gathers at the appropriate time. This phrase serves as a warning against spiritual complacency, urging believers to be vigilant and active in their faith, much like the parable of the ten virgins in <a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>, where preparedness is key to entering the kingdom of heaven.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wise_son.htm">Wise Son</a></b><br>Represents an individual who acts with foresight and diligence, making the most of opportunities.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disgraceful_son.htm">Disgraceful Son</a></b><br>Symbolizes someone who is lazy or negligent, failing to act when it is most crucial.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/summer.htm">Summer</a></b><br>The season of opportunity and preparation, a time when resources are gathered.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/harvest.htm">Harvest</a></b><br>A critical period for reaping the benefits of prior labor, symbolizing the culmination of efforts.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, known for his wisdom and teachings on practical living.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/diligence_and_foresight.htm">Diligence and Foresight</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of working diligently and preparing for the future.
