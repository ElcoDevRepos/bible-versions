Snow is rare in many parts of Israel, suggesting a metaphor for difficult or challenging times. The mention of snow can symbolize trials or adversity that the virtuous woman anticipates and prepares for, reflecting her wisdom and foresight. In biblical literature, snow is often used to denote purity (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>) or the cleansing power of God (<a href="/psalms/51-7.htm">Psalm 51:7</a>).<p><b>she has no fear for her household</b><br>The absence of fear highlights the woman's confidence and trust in her preparations and in God's provision. Her diligent work and planning ensure that her family is secure, reflecting the biblical principle of stewardship and responsibility. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/proverbs/3-25.htm">Proverbs 3:25-26</a>, where trust in the Lord provides security and peace.<p><b>for they are all clothed in scarlet</b><br>Scarlet, a rich and costly dye, signifies wealth, honor, and protection. The use of scarlet implies that the household is not only prepared for the cold but is also adorned with dignity and care. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who clothes believers in righteousness (<a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>). The color also connects to the blood of Christ, symbolizing redemption and covering. Historically, scarlet was a color associated with royalty and high status, indicating the woman's ability to provide well for her family.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_virtuous_woman.htm">The Virtuous Woman</a></b><br>The subject of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>, often referred to as the "Proverbs 31 Woman," is an idealized figure representing wisdom, diligence, and godly character.

Yet there are sometimes very snowy winters. That of 1879, for example, left behind it seventeen inches of snow, even where there was no drift, and the strange spectacle of snow lying unmelted for two or three weeks was seen in the hollows on the hillsides. Thousands of years have wrought no change in this aspect of the winter months, for Bennaiah, one of David's mighty men, 'slew a lion in the midst of a pit in the time of snow' (<a href="/2_samuel/23-20.htm">2 Samuel 23:20</a>)." She has no fears concerning the comfort and health of her family even in the severest winter. <span class="cmt_word">For all her household are clothed with scarlet;</span> with warm garments. The word used is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">shanim</span>), derived from a verb meaning "to shine," and denoting a crimson or deep scarlet colour. This colour was supposed, and rightly, to absorb and retain heat, as white to repel it; being made of wool, the garments would be warm as well as stately in appearance. St. Jerome has <span class="accented">duplicibus</span> (<span class="accented">shenaim</span>), "with double garments," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with one over the other. Warm garments were the more necessary as the only means of heating rooms was the introduction of portable chafing dishes containing bunting charcoal (see <a href="/jeremiah/36-22.htm">Jeremiah 36:22</a>, etc). The Septuagint has taken liberties with the text, "Her husband is not anxious concerning domestic matters when he tarries anywhere [<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;</span> for which Delitzsch suggests <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;</span>], for all her household are well clothed." Spiritually, the Church fears not the severity of temptation or the chill of unbelief, when her children take refuge in the blood of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/31-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When it snows,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1500;&#1462;&#1490;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;le&#7713;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7950.htm">Strong's 7950: </a> </span><span class="str2">Snow</span><br /><br /><span class="word">she is not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">afraid</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;&#238;&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3372.htm">Strong's 3372: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fear, to revere, caus, to frighten</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for her household;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[they are] all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">clothed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1489;&#1467;&#1445;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;&#7687;u&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3847.htm">Strong's 3847: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wrap around, to put on a, garment, clothe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in scarlet.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8144.htm">Strong's 8144: </a> </span><span class="str2">Crimson, the insect, its color, stuff dyed with it</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/31-21.htm">Proverbs 31:21 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/31-21.htm">Proverbs 31:21 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/31-21.htm">Proverbs 31:21 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/31-21.htm">Proverbs 31:21 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/31-21.htm">Proverbs 31:21 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/31-21.htm">Proverbs 31:21  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/31-21.htm">Proverbs 31:21 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/31-21.htm">Proverbs 31:21 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/31-21.htm">Proverbs 31:21 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/31-21.htm">Proverbs 31:21 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/31-21.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 31:21 She is not afraid of the snow (Prov.
