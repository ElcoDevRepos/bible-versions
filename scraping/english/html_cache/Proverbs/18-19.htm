In ancient times, fortified cities were known for their strong defenses, often surrounded by thick walls and guarded gates, making them difficult to conquer. Similarly, a person who feels betrayed or wronged may build emotional defenses that are hard to penetrate. The Bible frequently emphasizes the importance of maintaining harmonious relationships, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23-24</a>, where Jesus instructs believers to reconcile with their brothers before offering gifts at the altar. The imagery of a fortified city underscores the strength and resilience of emotional barriers, suggesting that once trust is broken, it requires significant effort and sincerity to restore it.<p><b>and disputes are like the bars of a castle</b><br>This part of the verse uses the metaphor of a castle's bars to describe the entrenchment and rigidity that can result from unresolved conflicts. In biblical times, castles were fortified structures with bars that provided security and protection. Similarly, disputes can create barriers between individuals, preventing reconciliation and fostering division. The Bible warns against allowing disputes to fester, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26-27</a>, which advises believers not to let the sun go down on their anger. The comparison to castle bars suggests that unresolved disputes can become entrenched, making it difficult to restore relationships. This imagery serves as a caution to address conflicts promptly and seek peace, reflecting the biblical call to be peacemakers as in <a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/offended_brother.htm">Offended Brother</a></b><br>This refers to a person who has been wronged or hurt, particularly someone with whom you have a close relationship, such as a family member or friend.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/fortified_city.htm">Fortified City</a></b><br>In ancient times, cities were often surrounded by strong walls to protect against invaders.

So we may understand "resists more," or something similar. A brother or a once close friend, when injured or deceived, becomes a potent and irreconcilable enemy. The idea of the preceding verses is carried on, and the primary thought is still concerning lawsuits and matters brought before a judge. This is shown in the second clause by the use of the word "contentions" (<span class="accented">midyanim</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>And their contentions are like the bars of a castle.</span> They close the door against reconciliation, shut the heart against all feeling of tenderness.

Aristotle also writes thus ('De Republ.,' 7:7): "If men receive no return from those to whom they have shown kindness, they deem themselves, not only defrauded of due gratitude, but actually injured. Whence it is said, 'Bitter are the quarrels of friends;' and, 'Those who love beyond measure also hate beyond measure.'" An English maxim gloomily decides, "Friendship once injured is forever lost." Pliny ('Hist. Nat.,' 37:4), "Ut adamas, si frangi contingat malleis, in minutissimas dissidit crustas, adeo ut vix oculis cerni queant: ita arctissima necessitudo, si quando contingat dirimi, in summam vertitur simultatem, et ex arctissimis foederibus, si semel rumpantur, maxima nascuntur dissidia." Ecclus. 6:9, "There is a friend, who being turned to enmity will also discover thy disgraceful strife," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> will disclose the quarrel which according to his representation will redound to thy discredit. The Vulgate and Septuagint have followed a different reading from that of the present Hebrew text: "Brother aided by brother is like a strong and high city, and he is powerful as a well founded palace," Septuagint. The last clause is rendered in the Vulgate. <span class="accented">Et judicia quasi vectes urbium</span>; where <span class="accented">judicia</span> means "lawsuits," legal disputes; these bar out friendship. The first member of the sentence in the Greek and Latin recalls <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9</a>, etc., "Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour," etc. St. Chrysostom, commenting on <a href="/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a> ('Hom.,' 9.), writes, "A glorious bond is this; with this bond let us bind ourselves together alike to one another and to God. This is a bond that bruises not, nor cramps the hands it binds, but it leaves them free, and gives them ample play and greater energy than those which are at liberty. The strong, if he be bound to the weak, will support him, and not suffer him to perish; and if again he be tied to the indolent, he will rather rouse and animate. 'Brother helped by brother,' it is said, 'is as a strong city.' This chain no distance of place can interrupt, neither heaven, nor earth, nor death, nor anything else, but it is more powerful and stronger than all things." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/18-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">An offended</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1445;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(nip&#772;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6586.htm">Strong's 6586: </a> </span><span class="str2">To break away, trespass, apostatize, quarrel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">brother [is harder to win]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1431;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_251.htm">Strong's 251: </a> </span><span class="str2">A brother, )</span><br /><br /><span class="word">than a fortified</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1465;&#1425;&#1494;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;z)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5797.htm">Strong's 5797: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strength, might</span><br /><br /><span class="word">city,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1497;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(miq&#183;qir&#183;ya&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7151.htm">Strong's 7151: </a> </span><span class="str2">A town, city</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and disputes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1437;&#1502;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1504;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;mi&#7695;&#183;y&#257;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4066.htm">Strong's 4066: </a> </span><span class="str2">A contest, quarrel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are like the bars</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(ki&#7687;&#183;r&#238;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1280.htm">Strong's 1280: </a> </span><span class="str2">A bolt</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of a castle.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;m&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_759.htm">Strong's 759: </a> </span><span class="str2">A citadel</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/18-19.htm">Proverbs 18:19 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/18-19.htm">Proverbs 18:19 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/18-19.htm">Proverbs 18:19 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/18-19.htm">Proverbs 18:19 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/18-19.htm">Proverbs 18:19 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/18-19.htm">Proverbs 18:19  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/18-19.htm">Proverbs 18:19 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/18-19.htm">Proverbs 18:19 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/18-19.htm">Proverbs 18:19 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/18-19.htm">Proverbs 18:19 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/18-19.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 18:19 A brother offended is more difficult than (Prov.
