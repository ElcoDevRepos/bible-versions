In the ancient Near Eastern culture, public declarations of loyalty were often made to establish one's reputation and social standing. This is similar to the modern concept of virtue signaling, where individuals express certain values to gain approval. The Bible frequently warns against empty words and encourages genuine actions (<a href="/james/2-14.htm">James 2:14-17</a>). The Hebrew word for "loving devotion" here is "chesed," which implies steadfast love and faithfulness, qualities that God Himself embodies (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>). This sets a high standard for human relationships, reflecting God's covenantal love.<p><b>but who can find a trustworthy man?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the rarity of true faithfulness and integrity among people. In biblical times, as today, trustworthiness was a highly valued trait, essential for maintaining social and familial bonds. The scarcity of such individuals is lamented in other scriptures as well, such as in <a href="/micah/7-2.htm">Micah 7:2</a>, where the faithful have vanished from the land. This phrase also points to the ultimate fulfillment of trustworthiness in Jesus Christ, who is described as "faithful and true" (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>). The search for a trustworthy person can be seen as a type of the search for Christ, the only one who perfectly embodies these qualities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

So Ewald and others, Hitzig and Kamphausen translate, "Many a man one names his dear friend;" Delitzsch and Nowack prefer, "Most men meet a man who is gracious to them;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it is common enough to meet a man who seems benevolent and well disposed. Vulgate, "Many men are called merciful;" Septuagint, "Man is a great thing, and a merciful man is a precious thing." The renderings of most modern commentators imply the statement that love and mercy are common enough, at least in outward expression. The Authorized Version pronounces that men are ready enough to parade and boast of their liberality, like the hypocrites who were said proverbially to sound a trumpet when they performed their almsdeeds (<a href="/matthew/6-2.htm">Matthew 6:2</a>). Commenting on the Greek rendering of the clause given above, St. Chrysostom observes, "This is the true character of man to be merciful; yea, rather the character of God to show mercy... Those who answer not to this description, though they partake of mind, and are never so capable of knowledge, the Scripture refuses to acknowledge them as men, but calls them dogs, and horses, and serpents, and foxes, and wolves, and if there be any animals more contemptible" ('Hom. 4 in Phil.' and 'Hom. 13 in 1 Tim.,' Oxford transl.). The contrast between show, or promise, and performance is developed in the second clause. <span class="cmt_word">But a faithful man who can find?</span> The faithfulness intended is fidelity to promises, the practical execution of the vaunted benevolence; this is rare indeed, so that a psalmist could cry, "I said in my haste, All men are liars" (<a href="/psalms/116-11.htm">Psalm 116:11</a>; comp. <a href="/romans/3-4.htm">Romans 3:4</a>). Lesetre refers to Massillon's sermon, 'Sur la Gloire Humaine,' where we read (the preacher, of course, rests on the Latin Version), "Ces hommes vertueux dont le monde se fait tant d'honneur, n'ont au fond souvent pour eux que l'erreur publique. Amis fideles, je le veux; mais c'est le gout, la vanite ou Pin teret, qui les lie; et dans leur amis, ils n'amient qu' eux-memes En un mot, dit l'Ecriture, on les appelle misericordieux, ils ont toutes les vertus pour le public; mais n'etant pas fideles a Dieu, ils n'en ont pas une seule pour eux-memes." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/20-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Many</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#7687;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7230.htm">Strong's 7230: </a> </span><span class="str2">Multitude, abundance, greatness</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">proclaims</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1453;&#1511;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(yiq&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7121.htm">Strong's 7121: </a> </span><span class="str2">To call, proclaim, read</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">loving devotion,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;as&#183;d&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
