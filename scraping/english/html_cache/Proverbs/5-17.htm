In biblical times, marriage was a covenantal relationship, reflecting God's covenant with His people. The exclusivity here can be seen as a reflection of God's desire for a devoted relationship with His followers. The idea of "yours alone" underscores the sanctity and intimacy intended in marriage, aligning with the biblical principle of two becoming one flesh (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>). This exclusivity is a safeguard against the moral and spiritual dangers of infidelity, which is a recurring theme in Proverbs.<p><b>never to be shared with strangers</b><br>The term "strangers" in this context refers to those outside the covenant relationship of marriage. In ancient Israel, the community was tightly knit, and the concept of a "stranger" often implied someone outside the faith community or covenant. Sharing intimate aspects of one's life with strangers could lead to spiritual and moral compromise. This phrase warns against the dilution of the marital bond and the potential consequences of infidelity, which can lead to personal and communal discord. The warning against sharing with strangers also echoes the broader biblical theme of remaining separate from pagan practices and influences, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14-18</a>, which calls believers to be distinct from the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

Promiscuous and unlawful intercourse throws doubt upon the paternity of children. Thy children may be thine, they may belong to another. The natural pride which is felt in a legitimate offspring is the motive put forward to commend the husband to confine himself exclusively to his wife. Grotius on this verse remarks, "Ibi sere ubi prolem metas" - "Sow there where you may reap an offspring." <span class="accented">Them</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the children referred to figuratively in the preceding verse, from which the subject of this verse is supplied. The repetition of the pronoun which occurs in the original, "let them belong to thee, to thee," is emphatic, and exclusive of others. The latter clause of the verse, "and not strangers' with thee," covers the whole ground. The idea of their being strangers' is repulsive, and so gives further point to the exhortation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/5-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Let them be</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1469;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(yih&#183;y&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">yours</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1445;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">alone,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1425;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7687;ad&#183;de&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_905.htm">Strong's 905: </a> </span><span class="str2">Separation, a part of the body, branch of a, tree, bar for, carrying, chief of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">never</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_369.htm">Strong's 369: </a> </span><span class="str2">A non-entity, a negative particle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to be shared</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1498;&#1456;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;it&#183;t&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_854.htm">Strong's 854: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nearness, near, with, by, at, among</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with strangers.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1494;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;z&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2114.htm">Strong's 2114: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn aside, to be a, foreigner, strange, profane, to commit adultery</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/5-17.htm">Proverbs 5:17 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/5-17.htm">Proverbs 5:17 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/5-17.htm">Proverbs 5:17 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/5-17.htm">Proverbs 5:17 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/5-17.htm">Proverbs 5:17 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/5-17.htm">Proverbs 5:17  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/5-17.htm">Proverbs 5:17 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/5-17.htm">Proverbs 5:17 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/5-17.htm">Proverbs 5:17 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/5-17.htm">Proverbs 5:17 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/5-17.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 5:17 Let them be for yourself alone not (Prov.
