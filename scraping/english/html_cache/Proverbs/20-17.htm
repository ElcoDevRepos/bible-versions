In biblical times, food was a primary necessity, and acquiring it through deceit could provide immediate satisfaction. The sweetness symbolizes the temporary pleasure or benefit one might feel from dishonest actions. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/9-17.htm">Proverbs 9:17</a>, where stolen water is described as sweet, emphasizing the deceptive appeal of sin. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a high value on honesty and integrity, as seen in the Mosaic Law, which condemned deceit and theft (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15-16</a>). The temporary sweetness of fraudulent gain is a common theme in wisdom literature, warning against the fleeting nature of sin's pleasures.<p><b>but later his mouth is full of gravel</b><br>The imagery of a mouth full of gravel starkly contrasts with the initial sweetness, symbolizing the eventual consequences of deceit. Gravel represents discomfort, pain, and the destruction of satisfaction. This reflects the biblical principle that sin ultimately leads to negative outcomes, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, which states that a man reaps what he sows. The historical context of this proverb would resonate with an agrarian society familiar with the unpleasantness of having grit in one's mouth, illustrating the inevitable bitterness and regret that follow dishonest actions. This phrase serves as a warning that the initial pleasure of sin is short-lived and ultimately leads to ruin, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of the consequences of sin and the call to righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_deceptive_person.htm">The Deceptive Person</a></b><br>This individual seeks to gain through dishonest means, finding temporary satisfaction in their deceit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_victim.htm">The Victim</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned, the victim is implied as the one who suffers loss due to the deceptive actions of another.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequence.htm">The Consequence</a></b><br>The metaphorical "mouth full of gravel" represents the inevitable negative outcome of deceitful actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_illusion_of_immediate_gratification.htm">The Illusion of Immediate Gratification</a></b><br>Deceptive gains may seem sweet initially, but they are fleeting and lead to regret.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inevitable_consequences_of_deceit.htm">The Inevitable Consequences of Deceit</a></b><br>Just as gravel is unpleasant and harmful in the mouth, so are the outcomes of dishonest actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_integrity.htm">The Call to Integrity</a></b><br>Christians are called to live with integrity, trusting that God will provide for their needs without resorting to deceit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_long-term_perspective.htm">The Importance of Long-term Perspective</a></b><br>Focusing on eternal values rather than temporary pleasures helps believers avoid the pitfalls of dishonesty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_repentance_and_restoration.htm">The Role of Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>When one has engaged in deceit, repentance and seeking to make amends are crucial steps in restoring integrity.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Proverbs_20_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Proverbs 20:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_20_17_s_warning_on_deceitful_gain.htm">How does Proverbs 20:17 warn against deceitful gain in our daily lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_20_17_on_deceit_s_outcomes.htm">What are the consequences of deceitful actions according to Proverbs 20:17?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Proverbs_20_17_to_You_shall_not_steal.htm">How does Proverbs 20:17 connect with the Eighth Commandment, "You shall not steal"?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_ensure_honest_Godly_gains.htm">In what ways can we ensure our gains are honest and God-honoring?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_20_17_Resist_deceit_how.htm">How can Proverbs 20:17 guide us in resisting the temptation of deceit?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_bread_gained_by_deceit.htm">What does Proverbs 20:17 mean by "bread gained by deceit"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_20_17_and_business_honesty.htm">How does Proverbs 20:17 relate to the concept of honesty in business?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_deceitful_gain_like_gravel.htm">Why does Proverbs 20:17 compare deceitful gain to "gravel" in the mouth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_proverbs_20.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Proverbs 20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'sanctify_the_lord'_mean.htm">What does 'Stolen Water is Sweet' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'stolen_water_is_sweet'_mean.htm">What does "Stolen Water is Sweet" mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_proverbs_9_17_suggest_theft's_allure.htm">Proverbs 9:17 suggests stolen water is sweet.

Here, the scene moves from an initial thrill (&#8220;sweet&#8221;) to an ugly, unexpected result (&#8220;mouth is full of gravel&#8221;). This verse sits in a chapter filled with warnings against deception and shortcuts (see <a href="/proverbs/20-10.htm">Proverbs 20:10, 23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Food gained by fraud is sweet to a man&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Sweet&#8221; hints at an immediate, sensual payoff.
