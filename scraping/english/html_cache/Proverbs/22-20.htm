It implies a direct relationship between the writer and the reader, emphasizing the importance of the teachings. In the context of ancient Israel, written communication was a significant means of preserving wisdom and instruction, often used by leaders and teachers to guide their people.<p><b>thirty sayings</b><br>The reference to "thirty sayings" may allude to a structured collection of wisdom, similar to other ancient Near Eastern wisdom literature, such as the Egyptian "Instruction of Amenemope," which also contains thirty chapters. This connection highlights the shared cultural practice of compiling wisdom teachings in a systematic way. The number thirty could symbolize completeness or a comprehensive set of teachings.<p><b>about counsel and knowledge</b><br>Counsel and knowledge are central themes in wisdom literature, emphasizing the importance of guidance and understanding in living a righteous life. In the biblical context, counsel often refers to advice that aligns with God's will, while knowledge implies a deeper understanding of God's laws and principles. These concepts are echoed throughout Proverbs and other wisdom books, such as Ecclesiastes and Job, underscoring their significance in the pursuit of a godly life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

The Khetib has <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dc;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5dd;</span>, "the day before yesterday, formerly;" but the word occurs nowhere alone, and, as Nowack says, can hardly have been the original reading. However, Ewald, Bertheau, and others, adopting it, suppose that the author refers to some earlier work. Cheyne cites Bickell's rendering, "Now, years before now, have I written unto thee long before with counsels and knowledge," and considers the words to mean either that the compiler took a long time over his work, or that this was not the first occasion of his writing. One does not see why stress should be here laid on former instruction, unless, perhaps, as Plumptre suggests, in contrast to "this day" of the previous verse. The LXX. renders the word <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span> thus, "And do thou record them for thyself triply for counsel and knowledge upon the table of thine heart." St. Jerome has, <span class="accented">Ecce descripsi eam tibi tripliciter, in cogitationibus et scientiis.</span> Other versions have also given a numerical explanation to the term. In it is seen an allusion to the three supposed works of Solomon - Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles - which is absurd; others refer it to the threefold division of the Testament - Law, Prophets, and Hagiographa; others, to three classes of youths for whom the admonitious were intended; others, again, think it equivalent to "oftentimes," or "in many forms." But the reading is as doubtful as the explanations of it are unsatisfactory. The genuine word is doubtless preserved in the Keri, which gives <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">shalishim</span>), properly a military term, applied to chariot fighters and men of rank in the army. The LXX. translates the word by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/exodus/14-7.htm">Exodus 14:7</a>; <a href="/exodus/15-4.htm">Exodus 15:4</a>), which is equivalent to "chieftain." Hence the Hebrew term, understood in the neuter gender, is transferred to the chief among proverbs - "choice proverbs," as Delitzsch calls them. The Venetian, by a happy turn, gives <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>.
