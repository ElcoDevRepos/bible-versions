This imagery is rooted in the agricultural context of ancient Israel, where a stiff-necked ox would resist the yoke and refuse to be guided by the farmer. This phrase is frequently used in the Old Testament to describe the Israelites' resistance to God's commands (<a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6</a>). It highlights a heart condition that is resistant to change and repentance, a theme that is echoed throughout Scripture.<p><b>after much reproof</b><br>Reproof refers to correction or criticism intended to lead to improvement. In the biblical context, reproof often comes from God through His prophets, His Word, or through wise counsel. <a href="/proverbs/1-23.htm">Proverbs 1:23-25</a> emphasizes the importance of responding to reproof, warning that ignoring it leads to calamity. The repeated nature of the reproof indicates God's patience and desire for repentance, aligning with His character as described in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, where He is patient, not wanting anyone to perish.<p><b>will suddenly be shattered</b><br>The suddenness of the shattering indicates a swift and unexpected judgment. This reflects the biblical principle that God's patience has limits, and persistent rebellion leads to inevitable consequences. The imagery of shattering suggests a complete and irreversible destruction, similar to the potter's vessel in <a href="/jeremiah/19-11.htm">Jeremiah 19:11</a>, which, once broken, cannot be made whole again. This serves as a warning of the seriousness of ignoring divine correction.<p><b>beyond recovery</b><br>The phrase "beyond recovery" underscores the finality of the judgment. In biblical terms, this can be seen as a spiritual death or separation from God, as seen in the warnings of eternal consequences in passages like <a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26-27</a>. It emphasizes the gravity of persistent disobedience and the ultimate cost of rejecting God's reproof. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of the need for repentance and the dire consequences of a hardened heart, as illustrated in the parables of Jesus, such as the parable of the rich man and Lazarus in <a href="/luke/16-19.htm">Luke 16:19-31</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_stiff-necked_man.htm">The Stiff-Necked Man</a></b><br>This refers to an individual who is stubborn and resistant to correction or reproof.

Compare "a man of sorrows" (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). The hardening of the neck is a metaphor derived from obstinate draught animals who will not submit to the yoke (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/27-8.htm">Jeremiah 27:8</a>). Christ calls his yoke easy, and bids his followers to bear it bravely (<a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>. etc.). The reproofs may arise from the Holy Spirit and the conscience, from the teaching of the past, or from the counsel of friends. The LXX. (as some other Jewish interpreters) takes the expression in the text actively, "A man who reproves (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) is better than one of stiff neck." <span class="cmt_word">Shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy</span> (<a href="/proverbs/6-15.htm">Proverbs 6:15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/15-10.htm">Proverbs 15:10</a>).

And there is no hope in their end; despising all correction, they can have no possibility of restoration. We may refer, as an illustration, to that terrible passage in the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4</a>, etc.), and to the fate of the Jews unto the present day.
