In the cultural context of ancient Israel, women typically did not take the initiative in romantic or sexual encounters, making this action particularly bold and indicative of her intentions. The act of coming out to meet someone suggests premeditation and purpose. This mirrors the way temptation often presents itself&#8212;actively seeking out individuals rather than passively waiting. Theologically, this can be seen as a warning about the aggressive nature of sin, which often pursues individuals rather than waiting to be pursued.<p><b>I sought you,</b><br>The seeking here implies a deliberate and intentional pursuit. In the broader biblical context, seeking is often associated with a diligent search, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>, where Jesus encourages believers to "seek, and you will find." However, in this context, the seeking is for sinful purposes, contrasting with the righteous seeking of God. This highlights the dual nature of seeking in Scripture&#8212;one can seek good or evil. The seductress's pursuit is a perversion of the noble pursuit of wisdom and righteousness, which Proverbs frequently advocates.<p><b>and I have found you.</b><br>The culmination of the search is the finding, which in this context, represents the success of temptation. This phrase can be seen as a cautionary note about the dangers of being found by sin when one is not vigilant. In biblical terms, being "found" often implies being caught or ensnared, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, which warns believers to be sober and vigilant because the devil prowls like a roaring lion. Theologically, this serves as a reminder of the importance of spiritual alertness and the need to guard one's heart against the enticements of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_adulterous_woman.htm">The Adulterous Woman</a></b><br>In <a href="/bsb/proverbs/7.htm">Proverbs 7</a>, the woman represents temptation and the seductive allure of sin.

<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8211; Her appearance &#8220;outside&#8221; contrasts with the safeguard of staying inside the boundaries of God&#8217;s wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/7-6.htm">Proverbs 7:6&#8211;9</a>;

The phrase flatters the young man, suggesting he is uniquely desired, when in truth he is just the next target (<a href="/proverbs/7-26.htm">Proverbs 7:26</a>).<p>&#8211; Temptation personalizes its appeal: David saw &#8220;a woman bathing&#8221; and felt singled out (<a href="/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8211; Sin&#8217;s lure often feels tailor-made: &#8220;Each one is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14</a>).<p>&#8211; By &#8220;meeting&#8221; him, she imitates counterfeit intimacy, promising what only covenant love can rightly provide (Song of Songs 2:3&#8211;4 vs. <a href="/proverbs/5-15.htm">Proverbs 5:15&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I sought you</b><p>&#8211;

The young man might feel honored, but her pursuit is predatory&#8212;much like the &#8220;way of an eagle in the sky&#8230; and the way of a man with a maiden&#8221; in <a href="/proverbs/30-19.htm">Proverbs 30:19</a>, where mystery masks danger.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and I have found you</b><p>&#8211;
