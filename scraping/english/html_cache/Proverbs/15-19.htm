In biblical times, a "slacker" or lazy person was often seen as someone who failed to fulfill their responsibilities, leading to poverty and hardship (<a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-11</a>). The "hedge of thorns" symbolizes obstacles and difficulties that arise from neglect and inaction. In ancient Israel, thorns were common in uncultivated fields, representing neglect and barrenness (<a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>). This imagery suggests that a slacker's life is filled with unnecessary challenges and frustrations, much like trying to navigate through a dense, thorny hedge.<p><b>but the path of the upright is a highway</b><br>In contrast, the "upright" refers to those who live righteously and with integrity. Their "path" is described as a "highway," indicating a clear, direct, and unobstructed route. In the ancient Near East, highways were essential for trade and communication, often well-maintained and safe for travel. This metaphor suggests that the upright experience a life of ease and progress, free from the self-imposed barriers that hinder the slacker. The concept of a straight path is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a>, which promises that God will make the paths of the righteous straight. This imagery also points to the spiritual journey of believers, where living according to God's principles leads to a blessed and prosperous life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_slacker.htm">The Slacker</a></b><br>This term refers to a lazy or idle person who avoids work and responsibility.

The word for "thorn" here is <span class="accented">chedek.</span> It occurs elsewhere only in <a href="/micah/7-4.htm">Micah 7:4</a>, where the Authorized Version has "briar;" but the particular plant intended is not ascertained. Most writers consider it to be some spinous specimen of the <span class="accented">solanum.</span> The word refers, it is thought, to a class of plants the name of one of which, at least, the miscalled "apple of Sodom," is well known in poetry, and is a proverbial expression for anything which promises fair but utterly disappoints on trial. "This plant, which is really a kind of potato, grows everywhere in the warmer parts of Palestine, rising to a widely branching shrub from three to five feet high; the wood thickly set with spines; the flower like that of the potato, and the fruit, which is larger than the potato apple, perfectly round, and changing from yellow to bright red as it ripens.... The <span class="accented">osher</span> of the Arab is the true apple of Sodom. A very tropical-looking plant, its fruit is like a large smooth apple or orange, and hangs in clusters of three or four together. When ripe, it is yellow, and looks fair and attractive, and is soft to the touch, but if pressed, it bursts with a crack, and only the broken shell and a raw of small seeds in a half-open pod, with a few dry filaments, remain in the hand" (Geikie, 'Holy Land and Bible,' 2:74, 117). Cato, 'Dist.,' 54:3, 5 - <p><span class="foreign">"Segnitiem fugito, quae vitae ignavia fertur;<br />Nam quum animus languet, consumit inertia corpus."</span> To the sluggard is opposed the righteous in the second member, because indolence is a grievous sin, and the greatest contrast to the active industry of the man who fears God and does his duty. <span class="cmt_word">The way of the righteous is made plain;</span> "is a raised causeway;" <span class="accented">selulah</span>, as <a href="/proverbs/16-17.htm">Proverbs 16:17</a>: <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-11.htm">Isaiah 49:11</a>. The upright man, who treads the path appointed for him resolutely and trustfully, finds all difficulties vanish; before him the thorns yield a passage; and that which the sluggard regarded as dangerous and impassable becomes to him as the king's highway.
