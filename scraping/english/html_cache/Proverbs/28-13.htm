In biblical context, the act of concealing sin is often associated with pride and self-deception. The story of King David's sin with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11-12) serves as a poignant example; his initial attempt to hide his wrongdoing led to further sin and turmoil. The Hebrew culture placed a strong emphasis on community and accountability, making the concealment of sin not only a personal issue but one that affected the entire community. Theologically, this phrase underscores the principle that God sees all (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>) and that unconfessed sin disrupts one's relationship with Him, hindering spiritual and sometimes material prosperity.<p><b>but whoever confesses and renounces them will find mercy</b><br>Confession and renunciation of sin are central themes in both the Old and New Testaments. The act of confession is not merely an admission of guilt but a turning away from sin, which is essential for receiving God's mercy. In <a href="/leviticus/5-5.htm">Leviticus 5:5</a>, confession is linked with atonement, and in the New Testament, 1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a> assures believers that if they confess their sins, God is faithful to forgive. The cultural practice of confession in ancient Israel often involved public acknowledgment and restitution, reflecting a sincere commitment to change. This phrase also points to the merciful nature of God, who desires repentance and offers forgiveness through Jesus Christ, the ultimate fulfillment of God's mercy (<a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4-5</a>). The concept of mercy here is not just a passive pardon but an active restoration of the sinner to a right relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

It is when the sinner acknowledges his transgression, and turns from it to newness of life, that God heals his backsliding, and turns away his auger and renews the tokens of his love (<a href="/hosea/14-4.htm">Hosea 14:4</a>). Confession is made to God, against whom all sin is committed (<a href="/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>; <a href="/job/31-33.htm">Job 31:33</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-8.htm">1 John 1:8</a>, etc.): and to man, if one has transgressed against him, or if he be in a position to give spiritual counsel.

Among the Jews, the high priest, acting as the mouthpiece of the people on the great Day of Atonement, confessed their iniquities, laying them on the scapegoat; and particular confession was also enjoined, and was part of the ritual accompanying a sacrifice for sin, by which legal purification was obtained (<a href="/numbers/5-6.htm">Numbers 5:6, 7</a>, "When a man or woman shall commit any sin... then they shall confess their sin which they have done;" so <a href="/leviticus/5-5.htm">Leviticus 5:5</a>).
