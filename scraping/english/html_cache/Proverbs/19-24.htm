In ancient Near Eastern culture, meals were often communal, with shared dishes. The act of burying one's hand in the dish suggests an initial effort or intention to partake in the meal. However, the slacker's inability to follow through highlights a deeper issue of slothfulness. This imagery is consistent with other biblical references to laziness, such as <a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-11</a>, which admonishes the sluggard to learn from the ant's diligence. The communal meal setting also underscores the social implications of laziness, as it affects not only the individual but also the community.<p><b>he will not even bring it back to his mouth.</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the extreme nature of the slacker's laziness. Despite having the means and opportunity to satisfy his hunger, he lacks the motivation to complete the simple task of feeding himself. This hyperbolic expression serves as a warning against the dangers of complacency and the failure to act. It echoes the broader biblical theme of the consequences of sloth, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/24-30.htm">Proverbs 24:30-34</a>, where neglect leads to ruin. The inability to bring the hand back to the mouth can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual laziness, where one fails to nourish their soul with God's word, as encouraged in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sluggard.htm">The Sluggard</a></b><br>A recurring character in the Book of Proverbs, representing laziness and a lack of initiative.

The &#8220;slacker&#8221; label is never neutral; it carries moral weight because God created work before the fall (<a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>) and calls it &#8220;very good.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>buries his hand in the dish</b><p>- The image is almost humorous: dinner is served, the hand goes into the bowl, then stalls.<p>- In ancient meals each guest reached into a common dish, so stopping halfway exposes the sluggard before everyone.<p>- The picture reinforces how laziness can be public and embarrassing:<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/15-19.htm">Proverbs 15:19</a> compares the sluggard&#8217;s path to a &#8220;hedge of thorns.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/26-13.htm">Proverbs 26:13-15</a> repeats the same scene, emphasizing comic absurdity.<p>- The hand already has access to food.
