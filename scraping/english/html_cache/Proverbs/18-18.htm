This method involved using stones, sticks, or other objects to determine an outcome believed to be divinely guided. The practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the division of the Promised Land among the tribes of Israel (<a href="/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>) and the selection of Saul as king (<a href="/1_samuel/10-20.htm">1 Samuel 10:20-24</a>). Casting lots was considered a way to remove human bias and allow God to reveal His choice, reflecting a deep trust in divine sovereignty.<p><b>ends quarrels</b><br>The use of lots to resolve disputes highlights the importance of seeking impartiality and divine guidance in conflict resolution. In a society where personal honor and family reputation were paramount, quarrels could escalate quickly. By casting lots, parties involved in a dispute could accept the outcome as God's decision, thus maintaining peace and preventing further discord. This practice underscores the biblical principle of seeking peace and reconciliation, as echoed in <a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God."<p><b>and separates strong opponents</b><br>The phrase "strong opponents" suggests individuals or groups with significant power or influence, potentially leading to prolonged and intense conflicts. In the context of ancient Israel, such disputes could involve tribal leaders, family heads, or even nations. By using lots, these powerful figures could be separated or distinguished in a manner that was seen as fair and divinely ordained. This reflects the biblical theme of God's ability to bring order and justice, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>, "The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the LORD." The resolution of conflicts through divine intervention foreshadows the ultimate peace and justice brought by Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

Joshua divided the land by lot (<a href="/joshua/18-6.htm">Joshua 18:6-10</a>), Nehemiah used lots to repopulate Jerusalem (<a href="/nehemiah/11-1.htm">Nehemiah 11:1</a>), and the apostles chose Matthias by lot (<a href="/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>). Each occasion points to the same truth: God rules the outcome. In <a href="/proverbs/18-18.htm">Proverbs 18:18</a>, the simple act of casting lots acknowledges that final authority belongs to the Lord, not to personal preference, power, or persuasion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ends quarrels</b><p>Arguments can escalate when pride, partiality, or emotion cloud judgment. The proverb says, &#8220;Casting the lot ends quarrels,&#8221; because an impartial decision removes personal bias. Think of Abraham and Lot choosing separate territories (<a href="/genesis/13-8.htm">Genesis 13:8-11</a>) or Solomon threatening to divide a child so the real mother would yield (<a href="/1_kings/3-24.htm">1 Kings 3:24-27</a>); both scenes show that a decisive, outside solution stops strife. <a href="/proverbs/17-14.htm">Proverbs 17:14</a> warns that starting a quarrel is like breaching a dam; a swift, objective ruling prevents the flood of conflict.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Separates strong opponents</b><p>The second half, &#8220;and separates strong opponents,&#8221; pictures two entrenched sides&#8212;powerful, stubborn, unwilling to back down. By submitting to a divinely guided lot, those &#8220;strong opponents&#8221; are separated, each accepting the outcome without further hostility. When Saul sought the guilty party after Jonathan&#8217;s forbidden taste of honey, the lot pointed unerringly to Jonathan (<a href="/1_samuel/14-41.htm">1 Samuel 14:41-45</a>). In a raging storm, sailors cast lots and the lot fell to Jonah (<a href="/jonah/1-7.htm">Jonah 1:7</a>); the result exposed sin and preserved the crew. In every case, God&#8217;s verdict cut through human resistance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/18-18.htm">Proverbs 18:18</a> teaches that when believers face conflicts too heated for personal resolution, they can appeal to God&#8217;s sovereign justice. An objective, God-directed decision&#8212;symbolized by the casting of lots&#8212;halts disputes and diffuses even the strongest opposition. By recognizing the Lord&#8217;s hand in the outcome, we trade contention for peace, knowing He will always render a fair and final verdict.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">The lot causeth contentions to cease, </span>as being the judgment of God (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm" title="The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.">Proverbs 16:33</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And parteth between the mighty, </span>who would otherwise settle their differences by blows.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The lot causeth contentions to cease</span> (comp. <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>). If this verse is taken in connection with the preceding, it refers to the decision in doubtful cases, where the evidence is conflicting and ordinary investigation fails to elicit the truth satisfactorily. The lot, being considered to show the judgment of God, settled the question. <span class="cmt_word">And parteth between the mighty.</span> If it were not for the decision by lot, persons of eminence and power would settle their differences by violent means. This peaceful solution obviates all such contentions. The Septuagint, in place of "lot" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), reads now <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, "silent;" but it is evidently originally a clerical error, perpetuated by copyists.
