This sudden calamity is a divine response to persistent sin, reflecting the biblical principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). The suddenness of the calamity emphasizes the unexpected nature of divine judgment, akin to the sudden destruction mentioned in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>. This reflects the biblical theme that God's judgment can come without warning, as seen in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19).<p><b>in an instant he will be shattered beyond recovery.</b><br>The phrase "in an instant" underscores the immediacy and totality of the judgment. The imagery of being "shattered" suggests complete ruin, similar to the potter's vessel in <a href="/jeremiah/19-11.htm">Jeremiah 19:11</a>, which cannot be made whole again. This irrevocable destruction highlights the seriousness of sin and the finality of divine judgment. The concept of being "beyond recovery" aligns with the idea of eternal separation from God, as seen in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus (<a href="/luke/16-26.htm">Luke 16:26</a>), where a great chasm prevents crossing from one side to the other. This serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of a life lived in opposition to God's ways.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked_person.htm">The Wicked Person</a></b><br>This verse refers to a person who engages in deceitful and malicious behavior, as described in the preceding verses of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/6.htm">Proverbs 6</a>. This individual is characterized by a heart that devises wicked plans and feet that are swift to run to evil.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/calamity.htm">Calamity</a></b><br>The sudden disaster or misfortune that befalls the wicked person as a consequence of their actions.

For whatever a man sows, he will reap&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p>- By using &#8220;therefore,&#8221; Solomon teaches a cause-and-effect certainty: deliberate, unrepentant wickedness always leads to God&#8217;s just response.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Calamity will come upon him</b><p>- &#8220;Calamity&#8221; speaks of real, tangible disaster&#8212;whether moral, relational, physical, or eternal.<p>- Proverbs opens with the same theme: wisdom warns that ruin will come &#8220;like a storm&#8221; on those who refuse her (<a href="/proverbs/1-26.htm">Proverbs 1:26-27</a>).<p>- This is not merely the natural fallout of bad choices; it is also the righteous judgment of God (<a href="/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Suddenly</b><p>- The timing is unexpected.

This character of a malicious mischief-maker would seem to be especially hateful to God; it is described in like terms in Psalms 64 and a similar fate foretold of it; in <a href="/proverbs/6-19.htm" title="A false witness that speaks lies, and he that sows discord among brothers.">Proverbs 6:19</a> also it is held up as the very worst of the seven detestable things there mentioned.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.</span> Great sins, as Muffet, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>, observes, have great punishments; neither only great, but sudden. <span class="accented">Therefore</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">al-ken</span>.

The idea seems to be taken from the shattered fragments of a potter's vessel, which it is impossible to reunite. So in the case of the man whose life has been one of fraud, deceit, and malice, there is for him no hope of any recovery. The language may seem exaggerated, but the picture is painted with this high colouring to exhibit a strong deterrent to such a line of conduct, and further, it may be remarked that, in the present day, only the most confiding would again put trust in a man who has wilfully and maliciously deceived them (cf. <a href="/isaiah/30-14.htm">Isaiah 30:14</a>).
