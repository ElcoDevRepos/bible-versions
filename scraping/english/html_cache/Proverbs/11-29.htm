In biblical times, the family unit was central to society, and the actions of one member could significantly impact the entire household. The concept of bringing trouble can be linked to sin, poor leadership, or foolish decisions. In the Old Testament, Achan's sin (Joshua 7) brought trouble upon Israel, illustrating how individual actions can affect a larger group. The idea of a household extends beyond immediate family to include servants and extended kin, emphasizing the broad impact of one's behavior.<p><b>will inherit the wind</b><br>Inheriting the wind implies receiving nothing substantial or beneficial. Wind is often used in Scripture to symbolize emptiness or futility (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a>). This phrase warns that those who cause strife or act foolishly will ultimately gain nothing of value. The imagery of wind suggests a lack of permanence and stability, contrasting with the biblical ideal of a lasting legacy or inheritance. This can be seen as a moral lesson on the importance of wisdom and righteousness in securing a meaningful future.<p><b>and the fool will be servant to the wise of heart</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the biblical theme of wisdom's superiority over folly. The fool, often characterized by a lack of discernment and understanding, finds themselves in a position of subservience to those who are wise. This reflects the broader biblical principle that wisdom leads to honor and authority, while folly results in subjugation and shame (<a href="/proverbs/3-35.htm">Proverbs 3:35</a>). The "wise of heart" refers to those who possess not only knowledge but also the ability to apply it rightly, a quality highly esteemed in biblical literature. This phrase underscores the value of wisdom in achieving true freedom and leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_troublemaker.htm">The Troublemaker</a></b><br>This person is characterized by actions that bring discord or harm to their household.

The other side of the question is given by the Son of Sirach: "Unto the servant that is wise shall they that are free do service" (Ecclus. 10:25).
