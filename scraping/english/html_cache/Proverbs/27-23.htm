In ancient Israel, flocks were a primary source of wealth and sustenance, providing wool, milk, and meat. The shepherd's role was crucial, requiring constant vigilance and care. This reflects a broader biblical principle of stewardship, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where humanity is given dominion over the earth. The shepherd metaphor is also significant in Scripture, with God often depicted as a shepherd (<a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>) and Jesus referring to Himself as the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>). This phrase encourages believers to be attentive and proactive in their responsibilities, mirroring God's care for His people.<p><b>and pay close attention to your herds;</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the need for careful oversight and management. In the historical context, herds included cattle and other livestock, which were vital for agricultural societies. The phrase suggests a proactive approach to leadership and management, ensuring that resources are not only maintained but also thrive. This aligns with the wisdom literature's broader theme of prudence and foresight, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-8</a>, which advises learning from the ant's diligence. The call to "pay close attention" can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual vigilance, as believers are urged to watch over their spiritual lives and communities (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). This reflects the biblical call to be faithful stewards of all that God has entrusted to us.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

He is speaking to people who literally lived by the health of their animals, yet the principle reaches far beyond sheep and goats.<p>&#8226; Know means more than a passing glance. It is intentional, regular assessment. When David shepherded for his father, he &#8220;went back and forth from Saul to tend his father&#8217;s sheep at Bethlehem&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-15.htm">1 Samuel 17:15</a>); he never assumed the flock was fine&#8212;he checked.<p>&#8226; God models this careful oversight. Jesus says, &#8220;I am the good shepherd; I know My own and My own know Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>). His intimate knowledge of every believer sets the standard for our stewardship of any trust He gives.<p>&#8226; In family life, parents are told to &#8220;manage their own household well&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/3-5.htm">1 Timothy 3:5</a>). That requires real-time awareness, not distant guesswork.<p>&#8226; In ministry, elders are charged to &#8220;be shepherds of God&#8217;s flock that is among you, watching over them&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2</a>). The verb &#8220;watching&#8221; mirrors Solomon&#8217;s call to know the flock&#8217;s condition.<p>&#8226; Even our vocations carry this demand: &#8220;Prepare your work outside; get your fields ready&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/24-27.htm">Proverbs 24:27</a>). Planning assumes we have first gathered accurate information.<p>Takeaway: Whatever God has placed under your care&#8212;children, finances, employees, a ministry team&#8212;learn its true condition. Truthful assessment is the first act of faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and pay close attention to your herds</b><p>Knowing is step one; the verse pushes further to sustained, hands-on diligence.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Pay close attention&#8221; speaks of ongoing vigilance. Jacob described decades of guarding Laban&#8217;s herds, facing heat, frost, and sleepless nights (<a href="/genesis/31-38.htm">Genesis 31:38-40</a>). Faithful stewardship is rarely glamorous; it is persistent.<p>&#8226; Proverbs immediately explains why: &#8220;for riches are not forever&#8221; (27:24). Assets&#8212;whether livestock in ancient Israel or a modern portfolio&#8212;can vanish. Careful oversight guards against loss and positions us to bless others when lean times come (<a href="/proverbs/27-25.htm">Proverbs 27:25-27</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus commends such diligence in <a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>: &#8220;Whoever is faithful with very little will also be faithful with much.&#8221; Attention to today&#8217;s &#8220;herds&#8221; proves readiness for greater responsibilities tomorrow.<p>&#8226; Paul echoes this in <a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>, urging overseers, &#8220;Keep watch over yourselves and the entire flock.&#8221; Leadership&#8212;spiritual or otherwise&#8212;requires eyes open to dangers, needs, and opportunities.<p>&#8226; Our work ethic reflects our witness: &#8220;Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as for the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>). Close attention is an act of worship, acknowledging that every resource ultimately belongs to Him (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p>Practical steps:<p>&#8211; Schedule regular reviews&#8212;of budgets, family goals, ministry health.<p>&#8211; Keep simple records; clarity prevents drift.<p>&#8211; Respond quickly to warning signs: relational tension, spiritual dryness, financial red flags.<p>&#8211; Celebrate progress; joy fuels perseverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23</a> calls believers to informed, watchful stewardship. First, know the true condition of what God has entrusted to you; second, maintain steady, caring oversight. This pattern mirrors the Lord&#8217;s own shepherd-heart and equips us to honor Him in every sphere of life, from household to workplace to church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Be</span> <span class= "bld">thou diligent </span>to <span class= "bld">know the state of thy herds. . . .</span>--In the last five verses of this chapter the peace and security of the pastoral life are described as being far superior to the uncertainty attending other sources of wealth and the regal power.
