In ancient Israel, hospitality was a significant cultural value, but it was also understood that overstepping these bounds could lead to strained relationships. The wisdom literature often advises moderation and discernment in social interactions. This principle is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/27-14.htm">Proverbs 27:14</a>, which warns against being overly intrusive or loud in the morning. The idea is to maintain healthy relationships by being considerate and not imposing on others.<p><b>lest he grow weary</b><br>The concept of weariness here refers to the emotional and mental fatigue that can result from constant or unwelcome presence. In biblical times, as today, relationships required balance and mutual respect. The weariness mentioned can be likened to the burden of dealing with someone who does not recognize social cues or boundaries. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching on loving one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>) by being mindful of their needs and limits.<p><b>and hate you</b><br>Hatred in this context is the potential outcome of failing to respect boundaries. The Bible frequently warns against actions that can lead to discord and enmity. Jesus taught about the importance of reconciliation and maintaining peace with others (<a href="/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23-24</a>). The wisdom here is preventative, advising against behaviors that could lead to animosity. This reflects the broader biblical theme of living in harmony with others and avoiding actions that could lead to sin or division.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbor.htm">Neighbor</a></b><br>In the context of this proverb, a neighbor refers to anyone with whom you have a relationship or regular interaction.

Do not pay too frequent visits to your neighbors' house, or make yourself too much at home there. The Son of Sirach has an utterance on a somewhat similar subject, "Give place, thou stranger, to an honourable man; my brother cometh to be lodged, and I have need of mine house. Those things are grievous to a man of understanding; the upbraiding of house room, and reproaching of the lender" (Ecclus. 29:27, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee.</span> Such a result might easily arise from too constant intercourse.
