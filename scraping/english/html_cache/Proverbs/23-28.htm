In biblical times, robbers often hid along roadsides or in secluded areas to attack travelers, reflecting the perilous nature of ancient travel. This imagery is used to describe the seductive and destructive nature of certain temptations, particularly those related to immorality. The comparison to a robber highlights the stealth and cunning involved, as well as the potential for spiritual and moral harm. This aligns with other biblical warnings against deceit and temptation, such as in <a href="/proverbs/7-12.htm">Proverbs 7:12</a>, where the adulteress is described as lurking at every corner.<p><b>and multiplies the faithless among men</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the corrupting influence of such temptations, leading many to stray from faithfulness. The term "faithless" refers to those who abandon their commitments, whether to God, family, or community. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, faithfulness was a core value, integral to one's relationship with God and others. The multiplication of the faithless suggests a widespread impact, where one person's fall can lead to a ripple effect, influencing others to follow suit. This is reminiscent of the warnings in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>, which cautions that bad company corrupts good character. The verse serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance and the potential consequences of moral compromise.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seductress.htm">The Seductress</a></b><br>This verse personifies the seductress as a dangerous figure, akin to a robber, who lies in wait to ensnare the unsuspecting.
