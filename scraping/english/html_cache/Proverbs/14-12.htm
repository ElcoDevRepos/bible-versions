In biblical context, this reflects the broader theme of human fallibility and the limitations of human wisdom. The Book of Proverbs frequently contrasts human understanding with divine wisdom, emphasizing the need for reliance on God&#8217;s guidance (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>). Historically, this reflects the ancient Near Eastern context where wisdom literature often warned against self-reliance. Culturally, it underscores the importance of seeking counsel and wisdom from God rather than solely trusting in one's own perspective.<p><b>but its end is the way of death</b><br>This part of the verse serves as a stark warning about the consequences of relying solely on human judgment. The "way of death" can be understood both literally and spiritually. Biblically, death often symbolizes separation from God, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a> and <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative of sin leading to death, contrasting with the life offered through obedience to God. Theologically, it points to the ultimate consequence of sin and the need for redemption, which is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who offers the way to eternal life (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). This serves as a prophetic reminder of the necessity of choosing the path of life through Christ, rather than the deceptive paths that lead away from God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

But it seems better to take it as a warning against following a perverted or uninstructed conscience. Conscience needs to be informed by God's Word and ruled by God's will to make it a safe guide. When properly regulated, it is able to pronounce a verdict upon contemplated action, and its verdict must always he obeyed. But warped by prejudice, weakened by disuse and disobedience, judicially blinded in punishment and in consequence of sin, it loses all power of moral judgment, and becomes inoperative of good; and then, as to the way that seemed at the moment right, <span class="cmt_word">the end thereof are the ways of death</span> (<a href="/proverbs/5-5.htm">Proverbs 5:5</a>). The man is following a false light, and is led astray, and goes headlong to destruction (comp. <a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-2.htm">1 Timothy 4:2</a>; see on ver. 13). St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 5:12) has some words on this subject: "There are times when we are ignorant whether the very things which we believe we do aright, are rightly done in the strict Judge's eye. For it often happens that an action of ours, which is cause for our condemnation, passes with us for the aggrandizement of virtue. Often by the same act whereby we think to appease the Judge, he is urged to anger when favourable Hence, while holy men are getting the mastery over their evil habits, their very good practices even become an object of dread to them, lest, when they desire to do a good action, they be decoyed by a semblance of the thing, lest the baleful canker of corruption lurk under the fair appearance of a goodly colour. For they know that they are still charged with the burden of corruption, and cannot exactly discern the things that be good" (Oxford transl.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/14-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">There is</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1461;&#1444;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#234;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3426.htm">Strong's 3426: </a> </span><span class="str2">Being, substance, existence, is</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a way</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(de&#183;re&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1870.htm">Strong's 1870: </a> </span><span class="str2">A road, a course of life, mode of action</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that seems right</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1453;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3477.htm">Strong's 3477: </a> </span><span class="str2">Straight, right</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(lip&#772;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6440.htm">Strong's 6440: </a> </span><span class="str2">The face</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but its end</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1437;&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_319.htm">Strong's 319: </a> </span><span class="str2">The last, end, the future, posterity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is the way</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(dar&#183;&#7733;&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1870.htm">Strong's 1870: </a> </span><span class="str2">A road, a course of life, mode of action</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of death.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1469;&#1493;&#1462;&#1514;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;we&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4194.htm">Strong's 4194: </a> </span><span class="str2">Death, the dead, their place, state, pestilence, ruin</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 14:12 There is a way which seems right (Prov.
