In biblical times, wine was a common beverage, but drunkenness was condemned (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>). The lack of pain awareness signifies a loss of self-control and discernment, which is a recurring theme in Proverbs. This can be compared to the spiritual numbness that sin can cause, dulling one's sensitivity to God's guidance.<p><b>They beat me, but I did not know it!</b><br>The imagery of being beaten without awareness highlights the self-destructive nature of addiction. In the ancient Near East, physical discipline was a common corrective measure, but here it illustrates the folly of ignoring consequences. This can be linked to the spiritual blindness described in <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where people hear but do not understand, see but do not perceive.<p><b>When can I wake up to search for another drink?</b><br>This phrase captures the cycle of addiction, where the desire for alcohol becomes a consuming pursuit. It reflects the insatiable nature of sin, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:8</a>, where the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear with hearing. The longing for another drink symbolizes the deeper spiritual thirst that only God can quench, as Jesus offers living water in <a href="/john/4-13.htm">John 4:13-14</a>.

The Lord records this with perfect precision so that we see the folly of intoxication, flee the slavery of sin, and seek the true satisfaction that comes only from being filled with His Spirit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">They have stricken me, and I was not sick.--</span>The drunken man feels no blows or ill usage.<p><span class= "bld">When shall I awake?</span>--He longs to rouse himself from his slumber that he may return to his debauch.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - The drunkard is represented as speaking to himself. The LXX. inserts, "and thou shelf say" as the Authorized Version does: They have stricken me, shall thou say, and <span class="cmt_word">I was not sick;</span> or, <span class="accented">I was not </span>hurt. The drunken man has been beaten (perhaps there is a reference to the "contentions," ver. 29), but the blows did not pain him; his condition has rendered him insensible to pain. He has some vague idea the he has suffered certain rough treatment at the hands of his companions, but it has made no impression on him. They have beaten me, and I felt it not; did not even know it. Far from recognizing his degradation and profiting by the merzed chastisement which he has incurred, he is represented as looking forward with pleasure to a renewal of his debauch, when his drunken sleep shall be over. <span class="cmt_word">When shall I awake? I will seek it</span> (wine) <span class="cmt_word">yet again.</span> Some take <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5ea;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;</span> (<span class="accented">mathai</span>) as the relative conjunctive: "When I awake I will seek it again;" but it is always used interrogatively, and the expression thus becomes more animated, as Delitzsch observes. It is as though the drunkard has to yield to the effects of his excess and sleep off his intoxication, but he is. as it were, all the time longing to be able to rouse himself and recommence his orgies. We have had words put into the mouth of the sluggard (<a href="/proverbs/6-10.htm">Proverbs 6:10</a>). The whole verse is rendered by the LXX thus: "Thou shalt say, They smote me, and I was not pained, and they mocked me, and I knew it not. When will it be morning, that I may go and seek those with whom I may consort?" The author of the 'Tractutus de Conscientia' appended to St. Bernard's works, applies this paragraph to the cuss of an evil conscience indurated by wicked habits and insensible to correction. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/23-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;They struck me,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(hik&#183;k&#363;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person common plural &#124;
