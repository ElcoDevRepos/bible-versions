In the biblical context, this warning is often associated with the dangers of engaging in relationships with women who may lead one away from God&#8217;s commandments. Solomon, the attributed author of Proverbs, had personal experience with this issue, as his many marriages to foreign women led him to idolatry (<a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-4</a>). The phrase underscores the importance of maintaining purity and devotion to God, echoing the wisdom found in other scriptures such as <a href="/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3-5</a>, which warns against the seductive nature of the adulteress.<p><b>or your vigor on those who ruin kings</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the potential for personal relationships to lead to the downfall of leaders. Historically, many kings in the Bible, such as David and Solomon, faced significant challenges due to their relationships with women. The phrase serves as a cautionary reminder of the destructive power of such entanglements. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of the importance of wise and godly leadership, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>, where kings are advised not to take many wives, lest their hearts be led astray. The warning is prophetic in nature, as it anticipates the consequences of ignoring divine wisdom, and it points to the need for leaders to seek strength and guidance from God rather than from worldly pleasures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_lemuel.htm">King Lemuel</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>, traditionally understood to be a king receiving wisdom from his mother.

Women are meant; and the prince is enjoined not to surrender his life, conduct, and actions to the influence of women, who, both by the dissipation and sensuality which they occasion, and the quarrels which they provoke, and the evil counsels which they give, often ruin kings and states (see the injunction, <a href="/deuteronomy/17-11.htm">Deuteronomy 17:11</a>). The Vulgate rendering, <span class="accented">ad delendos reges</span>, looks as if the warning was against making wars of conquest against neighbouring kings; but this is not a satisfactory parallel to the former clause. Septuagint, "Give not thy wealth unto women, nor thy mind, nor thy life unto remorse (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>).
