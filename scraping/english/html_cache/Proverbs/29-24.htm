In biblical context, the soul represents one's life and spiritual well-being. By partnering with a thief, an individual is engaging in sin, which is destructive to their spiritual state. The Bible consistently warns against forming alliances with those who practice evil (<a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>, <a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>). The idea of hating one's own soul suggests a self-destructive behavior, as sin ultimately leads to spiritual death (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). This reflects the broader biblical principle that sin separates individuals from God, who is the source of life and goodness.<p><b>he receives the oath but does not testify.</b><br>In ancient Israel, legal proceedings often involved oaths to ensure truthfulness (<a href="/exodus/22-10.htm">Exodus 22:10-11</a>). This phrase suggests a scenario where an individual, despite being aware of the truth, chooses to remain silent, thus failing to uphold justice. This act of withholding testimony is seen as complicit in the crime, aligning with the biblical principle that silence in the face of wrongdoing is itself a form of participation in sin (<a href="/leviticus/5.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>). The failure to testify can be seen as a breach of the commandment against bearing false witness (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>), as silence can perpetuate falsehood. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the importance of truth and justice, as seen in the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the need for integrity and honesty (<a href="/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/partner_to_a_thief.htm">Partner to a Thief</a></b><br>This refers to someone who is complicit in theft, either by direct involvement or by association.

In Scripture, partnership implies shared responsibility (<a href="/exodus/23-1.htm">Exodus 23:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/50-18.htm">Psalm 50:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Proverbs repeatedly warns, &#8220;My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10-19</a>). The moment we join hands with wrongdoing, we become participants in the guilt.<p>&#8226; God calls us to separate from deeds of darkness (<a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>). Choosing the thief&#8217;s side is choosing against the Lord&#8217;s.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hates his own soul</b><p>&#8226; By siding with evil, a person is not merely harming others; he is attacking his own life. &#8220;He who sins against me wrongs his own soul&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/8-36.htm">Proverbs 8:36</a>; see also 6:32; 15:32).<p>&#8226; Sin always boomerangs. What appears like quick gain ends in self-destruction (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; The hate here is practical, not emotional: it is hatred expressed through self-endangering choices.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He receives the oath</b><p>&#8226; Under Israel&#8217;s law, witnesses were summoned to testify &#8220;if someone hears a public charge to testify and fails to do so, he will bear the guilt&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-16.htm">Deuteronomy 19:16-19</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Receives the oath&#8221; pictures the moment the partner is formally put under oath in court. Truth is demanded; God Himself is listening (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p>&#8226; At that point neutrality is impossible. Silence equals siding with falsehood (<a href="/proverbs/24-11.htm">Proverbs 24:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But does not testify</b><p>&#8226; The accomplice chooses self-preservation over truth, refusing to speak. Yet his silence neither protects him from God&#8217;s justice nor shields his soul from ruin (<a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Perjury by omission is still perjury. Jesus warned that every careless word will meet judgment (<a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36</a>).<p>&#8226; Thus the verse exposes two sins: theft and the cowardice of covering it up. Both flow from the same heart of unbelief.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Teaming up with a thief ruins a person from the inside out. By sharing in the crime, he shows contempt for his own soul; by refusing to testify when sworn, he compounds his guilt. <a href="/proverbs/29-24.htm">Proverbs 29:24</a> is a sober reminder that complicity and silence before wrongdoing are self-destructive.

This is explained by what follows: <span class="cmt_word">He heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not</span>; better, <span class="accented">he heareth the adjuration</span>, <span class="accented">and telleth not</span>. This refers to the course of proceeding defined by <a href="/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>, and intimated in <a href="/judges/17-2.htm">Judges 17:2</a>. When a theft was committed, the person wronged or the judge pronounced an imprecation on the thief and on any one who was privy to the crime, and refrained from giving information; a witness who saw and knew of it, and was silent under this formal adjuration, has to bear his iniquity; he is not only an accomplice of a criminal, he is also a perjurer; one sin leads to another. Some commentators explain the first hemistich as referring only to the crime of receiving or using stolen goods, by which a man commits a crime and exposes himself to punishment; but it is best taken, as above, in connection with the second clause, and as elucidated thereby. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/29-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A partner</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1461;&#1443;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#234;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2505.htm">Strong's 2505: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be smooth, to apportion, separate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5973.htm">Strong's 5973: </a> </span><span class="str2">With, equally with</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a thief</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1453;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(gan&#183;n&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1590.htm">Strong's 1590: </a> </span><span class="str2">A stealer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">hates</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8130.htm">Strong's 8130: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his own soul;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(nap&#772;&#183;&#353;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
