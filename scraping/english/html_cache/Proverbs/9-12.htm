The book of Proverbs often contrasts wisdom with folly, emphasizing that true wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). Wisdom is personified in <a href="/proverbs/8.htm">Proverbs 8</a>, where it is depicted as calling out to humanity, offering guidance and understanding. This phrase suggests that wisdom is a personal choice and responsibility.<p><b>you are wise to your own advantage;</b><br>The benefits of wisdom are personal and direct. In ancient Israel, wisdom was seen as a path to a prosperous and fulfilling life. The Hebrew culture valued wisdom as a means to live in harmony with God's creation and His laws. This phrase implies that the pursuit of wisdom leads to personal growth, protection, and blessings, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13-18</a>, where wisdom is described as more precious than jewels and a source of long life and peace.<p><b>but if you scoff,</b><br>Scoffing is a form of mockery or derision, often directed at wisdom or divine instruction. In the biblical narrative, scoffers are those who reject God's truth and guidance, choosing instead to follow their own understanding. This attitude is condemned throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>, which warns against walking in the counsel of the wicked or sitting in the seat of scoffers. The cultural context of the time viewed scoffing as a serious offense against community values and divine order.<p><b>you alone will bear the consequences.</b><br>The consequences of rejecting wisdom are personal and inevitable. This reflects the biblical principle of sowing and reaping, as outlined in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>, where individuals are warned that they will reap what they sow. In the historical context of Proverbs, this would have been understood as a natural outcome of one's choices, affecting not only the individual but potentially their family and community. The phrase underscores the personal responsibility each person has in choosing wisdom over folly, with eternal implications as seen in the broader biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was known for his wisdom, which he received from God.

In support of our text we may quote <a href="/job/22-2.htm">Job 22:2</a>, "Can a man be profitable unto God?

And then is added the following paragraph, which may possibly be derived from a Hebrew original, but seems more like a congeries made up from other passages, and foisted by some means into the Greek text: "He that stayeth himself on lies shepherdeth winds, and himself pursueth flying birds; for he hath left the ways of his own vineyard, and hath gone astray with the wheels of his own husbandry; and he goeth through a waterless desert, and over a land set in thirsty places, and with his hands he gathereth unfruitfulness." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/9-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you are wise,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1453;&#1499;&#1463;&#1502;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7733;am&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2449.htm">Strong's 2449: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be wise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you are wise</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1499;&#1463;&#1443;&#1502;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7733;am&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2449.htm">Strong's 2449: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be wise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to your own advantage;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">but if you scoff,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1437;&#1500;&#1463;&#1431;&#1510;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;la&#7779;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3887.htm">Strong's 3887: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ambassador, have in derision, interpreter, make a mock, mocker</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you alone</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1469;&#1489;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1445;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7687;ad&#183;d&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_905.htm">Strong's 905: </a> </span><span class="str2">Separation, a part of the body, branch of a, tree, bar for, carrying, chief of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will bear [the consequences].</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;i&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5375.htm">Strong's 5375: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lift, carry, take</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/9-12.htm">Proverbs 9:12 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/9-12.htm">Proverbs 9:12 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/9-12.htm">Proverbs 9:12 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/9-12.htm">Proverbs 9:12 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/9-12.htm">Proverbs 9:12 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/9-12.htm">Proverbs 9:12  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/9-12.htm">Proverbs 9:12 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/9-12.htm">Proverbs 9:12 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/9-12.htm">Proverbs 9:12 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/9-12.htm">Proverbs 9:12 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/9-12.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 9:12 If you are wise you are wise (Prov.
