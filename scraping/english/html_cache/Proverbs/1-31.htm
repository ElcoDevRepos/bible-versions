In the context of Proverbs, it highlights the consequences of rejecting wisdom and choosing a path of folly. The "fruit" symbolizes the outcomes or results of one's actions. In ancient Israel, agriculture was a central part of life, and the metaphor of eating the fruit of one's labor would have been easily understood. This concept is echoed in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, "Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows." The idea is that individuals are responsible for their choices and will experience the natural consequences of their actions, whether good or bad.<p><b>and be filled with their own devices</b><br>The term "devices" refers to plans or schemes, often with a negative connotation of cunning or deceit. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, wisdom literature often warned against relying on one's own understanding or cleverness apart from divine guidance. This phrase suggests that those who reject God's wisdom will ultimately be overwhelmed by the outcomes of their own misguided plans. It serves as a warning against self-reliance and pride, which are frequently condemned in Scripture. This is reminiscent of <a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28-32</a>, where Paul describes how God gives people over to their depraved minds when they choose to reject Him. The filling with their own devices implies a saturation or overwhelming presence of the consequences of their choices, underscoring the seriousness of turning away from divine wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
