In ancient Israel, the poor were often landless laborers or those who had fallen into debt. The Law of Moses explicitly forbade the oppression of the poor (<a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21-27</a>, <a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>). Prophets like Amos and Isaiah also spoke against such injustices, emphasizing God's concern for the marginalized (<a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6-7</a>, <a href="/isaiah/10.htm">Isaiah 10:1-2</a>). The act of oppressing the poor to gain wealth is seen as a violation of God's justice and mercy, which are central to His character. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus warns against storing up treasures on earth at the expense of others (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><b>or giving gifts to the rich</b><br>In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, giving gifts to the rich was often a means of currying favor or securing one's social standing. This practice is criticized here as it perpetuates inequality and ignores the needs of the poor. The Bible consistently teaches that true generosity is directed towards those who cannot repay (<a href="/luke/14-12.htm">Luke 14:12-14</a>). The act of giving to the rich is seen as futile and counterproductive, as it does not align with God's heart for justice and equity. This principle is further illustrated in the parable of the rich fool (<a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>), where hoarding wealth and seeking favor with the affluent is shown to be ultimately worthless.<p><b>will surely lead to poverty</b><br>The outcome of such actions is a divine reversal, where those who exploit or seek favor with the wealthy will themselves face poverty. This reflects the biblical principle of sowing and reaping (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>). The wisdom literature often presents a moral order where actions have consequences, and God's justice ensures that the oppressor will not ultimately prosper (<a href="/proverbs/11-24.htm">Proverbs 11:24-25</a>). This is not only a spiritual truth but also a practical one, as societies that ignore the needs of the poor often face instability and decline. The warning serves as a reminder that true wealth is found in righteousness and generosity, aligning with the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized storing up treasures in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor.htm">The Poor</a></b><br>In the context of Proverbs, the poor often represent those who are vulnerable and marginalized in society.

The Authorized Version says that he who oppresseth the poor to enrich himself, and he who wastes his means by giving to those who do not need it, will come to poverty. But the antithesis of this distich is thus lost. The Hebrew literally rendered brings out the contrast, <span class="accented">Whosoever oppresseth the poor, it is for his gain</span>; <span class="accented">whosoever giveth to the rich, it is for his loss.</span> Delitzsch explains the sentence thus: "He who enriches himself by extortion from the poor, at any rate gains what he desires; but he who gives to the rich impoverishes himself in vain, has no thanks, reaps only disappointment." One cannot but feel that the maxim thus interpreted is poor and unsatisfactory. The interpretation in the 'Speaker's Commentary' is more plausible: The oppressor of the poor will himself suffer in a similar mode, and will have to surrender his ill-gotten gains to some equally unscrupulous rich man. But the terse antithesis of the original is wholly obscured by this view of the distich. It is far better, with Hitzig, Ewald, and others, to take the gain in the first hemistich as that of the poor man, equivalent to "doth but bring him gain;" though the sentence is not necessarily to be explained as suggesting that the injustice which the poor man suffers at the hand of his wealthy neighbour is a stimulus to him to exert himself in order to better his position, and thus indirectly tends to his enrichment. The maxim is really conceived in the religious style of so many of these apparently worldly pronouncements, and states a truth in the moral government of God intimated elsewhere, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>; <a href="/proverbs/28-8.htm">Proverbs 28:8</a>; and that truth is that the riches extorted from the poor man will in the end redound to his benefit, that by God's providential control the oppression and injustice from which he has suffered shall work to his good. In the second hemistich the loss is that of the rich man. By adding to the wealth of the rich the donor increases his indolence, encourages his luxury, vice, and extravagance, and thus leads to his ruin - "bringeth only to want. Septuagint, "He that calumniates (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>) the poor increaseth his own substance, but giveth to the rich at a loss (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span>)" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> so as to lessen his substance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/22-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Oppressing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1465;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1469;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;&#353;&#234;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6231.htm">Strong's 6231: </a> </span><span class="str2">To press upon, oppress, defraud, violate, overflow</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the poor</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1453;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1800.htm">Strong's 1800: </a> </span><span class="str2">Dangling, weak, thin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to enrich oneself,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;har&#183;b&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Hifil - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7235.htm">Strong's 7235: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be or become much, many or great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">or giving gifts</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1465;&#1514;&#1461;&#1445;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the rich,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1437;&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6223.htm">Strong's 6223: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rich</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[will] surely lead</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7733;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_389.htm">Strong's 389: </a> </span><span class="str2">A particle of affirmation, surely</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to poverty.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1505;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;ma&#7717;&#183;s&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4270.htm">Strong's 4270: </a> </span><span class="str2">A need, thing needed, poverty</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/22-16.htm">Proverbs 22:16 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/22-16.htm">Proverbs 22:16 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/22-16.htm">Proverbs 22:16 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/22-16.htm">Proverbs 22:16 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/22-16.htm">Proverbs 22:16 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/22-16.htm">Proverbs 22:16  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/22-16.htm">Proverbs 22:16 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/22-16.htm">Proverbs 22:16 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/22-16.htm">Proverbs 22:16 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/22-16.htm">Proverbs 22:16 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/22-16.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 22:16 Whoever oppresses the poor for his own (Prov.
