In ancient Israelite society, adultery was not only a personal betrayal but also a violation of the covenantal relationship, reflecting the seriousness of sin against God. The concept of a ransom, often used in the Old Testament to describe a payment for redemption or release (<a href="/exodus/21-30.htm">Exodus 21:30</a>), underscores that some offenses are beyond monetary compensation. This mirrors the idea that certain spiritual debts cannot be settled by human means, pointing to the need for divine intervention and forgiveness.<p><b>or persuaded by lavish gifts</b><br>The mention of "lavish gifts" suggests attempts to placate or bribe, which were common practices in ancient Near Eastern cultures to resolve disputes or gain favor. However, the text emphasizes that material wealth cannot mend the deep emotional and relational damage caused by adultery. This reflects the biblical theme that true reconciliation and forgiveness require more than external gestures; they demand genuine repentance and transformation of the heart. The inability of gifts to persuade also parallels the biblical teaching that God desires obedience and a contrite heart over sacrifices (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, <a href="/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16-17</a>). This phrase can be seen as a type pointing to Christ, who offers the ultimate gift of reconciliation through His sacrifice, which cannot be matched by any human offering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_adulterer.htm">The Adulterer</a></b><br>This verse is part of a passage warning against adultery.

Once trust is broken, repairs are costly and uncertain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/6-35.htm">Proverbs 6:35</a> teaches that adultery unleashes a righteous, unrelenting anger no payment can soothe. Money and gifts&#8212;normally able to mend lesser offenses&#8212;are powerless here because the sin strikes at a covenant designed by God. The verse warns against underestimating the gravity of sexual sin and reminds us that neither human wealth nor outward religion can replace wholehearted faithfulness and repentance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</span> No recompense or atonement, nor any gifts however great, will buy him off. These are supposed to be offered by the adulterer to the enraged husband, who, however, will never rest till he effects the utter ruin of his injurer. The literal rendering of the first hemistich is, "He will not accept the face of any ransom." The phrase <span class="accented">nasa phanim</span>, is equivalent to the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and signifies "to give a favourable reception to the outward expression of any one." The figure is taken from lifting up the face of a suppliant, the radical meaning of the verb <span class="accented">nasa</span> being "to take up," "to lift up." The <span class="accented">ransom</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">kopher</span> (the word usually applied to designate the price of redemption, mulct, or line demanded for expiation of a crime; see <a href="/exodus/21-30.htm">Exodus 21:30</a>; <a href="/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12</a>; <a href="/numbers/35-31.htm">Numbers 35:31, 32</a>); here the bribe offered by the adulterer to be let off will be altogether rejected, however alluring, the word <span class="accented">p'ney</span>, "face," carrying with it the idea of something recommendatory.

(On the verb <span class="accented">avah</span>, "to consent to," or "to be willing," see <a href="/proverbs/1-10.htm">Proverbs 1:10</a>.) Many gifts, each increasing in value, may be offered, but he will not be willing to forego his right of revenge. <span class="accented">Though thou givest many gifts.</span> It is noticeable that the address, which has been adapted to the third person, here becomes personal, and so takes up the form originally employed in vers. 20-25. A hypothetical case has been imagined in vers. 26-35, but still with the thought underlying it that it applies to the person addressed. "Though <span class="accented">thou</span> givest many gifts," or more literally, "though thou multipliest the gift," brings the matter homo to the young man. <span class="accented">Gifts</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">shokad</span>, "the gift," is the word usually employed to designate the bribe offered to corrupt a judge (see <a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-25.htm">Deuteronomy 27:25</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/8-3.htm">1 Samuel 8:3</a>). Here it refers to the money offered to free from punishment. The Vulgate gives the idea that these gifts or bribes are offered by a third party on behalf of the adulterer: <span class="accented">Nec acquiescet cujusquam precibus, nec suscipiet pro redemptione dona plurima.</span> On these two last verses Lange remarks, "Just as little as the adulterer, taken in his adultery, is left unpunished by the injured husband, so little, yea, even less, wilt the spiritual adulterer remain unpunished of the Lord (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-17.htm">1 Corinthians 3:17</a>)." <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/6-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He will not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">be appeased</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1453;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5375.htm">Strong's 5375: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lift, carry, take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by any</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">ransom,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1425;&#1508;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;&#183;p&#772;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3724.htm">Strong's 3724: </a> </span><span class="str2">A cover, a village, bitumen, the henna plant, a redemption-price</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[or]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">persuaded</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1437;&#1488;&#1489;&#1462;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;&#7687;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_14.htm">Strong's 14: </a> </span><span class="str2">To breathe after, to be acquiescent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by lavish</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;ar&#183;beh-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7235.htm">Strong's 7235: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be or become much, many or great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">gifts.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1469;&#1495;&#1463;&#1491;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#333;&#183;&#7717;a&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7810.htm">Strong's 7810: </a> </span><span class="str2">A present, bribe</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/6-35.htm">Proverbs 6:35 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/6-35.htm">Proverbs 6:35 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/6-35.htm">Proverbs 6:35 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/6-35.htm">Proverbs 6:35 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/6-35.htm">Proverbs 6:35 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/6-35.htm">Proverbs 6:35  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/6-35.htm">Proverbs 6:35 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/6-35.htm">Proverbs 6:35 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/6-35.htm">Proverbs 6:35 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/6-35.htm">Proverbs 6:35 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/6-35.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 6:35 He won't regard any ransom neither will (Prov.
