In ancient Israel, sacrifices were a central part of worship, as outlined in Leviticus. However, God consistently emphasized that He desires obedience and righteousness over sacrifices (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>). The term "wicked" refers to those who live in rebellion against God's commands, suggesting that their offerings are insincere. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>, where He criticizes the Pharisees for their outward religiosity but inward corruption. The Hebrew word for "detestable" is often used in the context of idolatry, indicating that God views insincere worship as an abomination.<p><b>but the prayer of the upright is His delight</b><br>In contrast to the sacrifices of the wicked, the prayers of the upright are pleasing to God. The "upright" are those who live in accordance with God's will, demonstrating integrity and righteousness. This reflects the biblical principle that God values a contrite heart and genuine relationship over external rituals (<a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a>). Prayer, as a form of communication with God, is accessible to all and does not require the elaborate rituals associated with sacrifices. This is further emphasized in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches about the power and importance of sincere prayer (<a href="/matthew/6-5.htm">Matthew 6:5-8</a>). The delight God takes in the prayers of the upright underscores His desire for a personal and authentic relationship with His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing God, who is the ultimate judge of human actions and intentions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Individuals who live in opposition to God's commands and whose sacrifices are not pleasing to Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upright.htm">The Upright</a></b><br>Those who live righteously and in accordance with God's will, whose prayers are a delight to Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart_of_worship.htm">The Heart of Worship</a></b><br>God values the condition of our hearts over the external acts of worship.

The worthlessness of sacrifice without obedience (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm" title="And Samuel said, Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.">1Samuel 15:22</a>) may be here especially mentioned, because men are apt to think that what involves cost and trouble must be pleasing to God, even when not accompanied with what alone He cares for, a loving heart.<p><span class= "bld">The prayer of the upright is his delight.--</span>Even when offered by itself, without sacrifice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination unto the Lord.</span> The costly sacrifice of the wicked is contrasted with <span class="cmt_word">the prayer</span>, unaccompanied with sacrifice, <span class="cmt_word">of the upright</span>. The first clause occurs again in <a href="/proverbs/21-27.htm">Proverbs 21:27</a>, and virtually in <a href="/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9</a>. But in the latter passage the prayer of the wicked is denounced as abomination. Sacrifice, as legal and ceremonial, would be more naturally open to the charge of deadness and unreality; while prayer, as spontaneous and not legally enjoined, might be deemed less liable to for realism; all the more hateful, therefore, it is if not offered from the heart. The worthlessness of external worship without obedience and devotion of the heart is often urged by the prophets (see <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11</a>, etc.; <a href="/jeremiah/6-20.htm">Jeremiah 6:20</a>; <a href="/hosea/5-6.htm">Hosea 5:6</a>; <a href="/amos/5-22.htm">Amos 5:22</a>; see also Ecclus. 31:18, etc.). The lesson was needed that the value of sacrifice depended upon the mind and disposition of the offerer, the tendency being to rest in the <span class="accented">opus operatum</span>, as if the external action was all that was necessary to make the worshipper accepted. This text was wrested by the Donatists to support their notion of the inefficacy of heretical baptism. St. Augustine replied that the validity of the sacrament depended not on the spiritual condition of the minister, but on the appointment of Christ. The text has also been applied to confirm the opinion that all the acts of unjustified man are sin. The truer view is that God's grace does act beyond the limits of his visible Church, and that the inspiration of the Holy Spirit concurs with the free will of man before he is formally justified. The second clause recurs virtually in ver. 29. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/15-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The sacrifice</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1462;&#1443;&#1489;&#1463;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(ze&#183;&#7687;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2077.htm">Strong's 2077: </a> </span><span class="str2">A slaughter, the flesh of an animal, a sacrifice</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the wicked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1453;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7563.htm">Strong's 7563: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wrong, an, bad person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is detestable</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1463;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8441.htm">Strong's 8441: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something disgusting, an abhorrence, idolatry, an idol</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but the prayer</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1456;&#1508;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7791;&#601;&#183;p&#772;il&#183;la&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8605.htm">Strong's 8605: </a> </span><span class="str2">Intercession, supplication, a hymn</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the upright</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3477.htm">Strong's 3477: </a> </span><span class="str2">Straight, right</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is His delight.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1510;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#7779;&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7522.htm">Strong's 7522: </a> </span><span class="str2">Goodwill, favor, acceptance, will</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/15-8.htm">Proverbs 15:8 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/15-8.htm">Proverbs 15:8 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/15-8.htm">Proverbs 15:8 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/15-8.htm">Proverbs 15:8 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/15-8.htm">Proverbs 15:8 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/15-8.htm">Proverbs 15:8  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/15-8.htm">Proverbs 15:8 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/15-8.htm">Proverbs 15:8 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/15-8.htm">Proverbs 15:8 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/15-8.htm">Proverbs 15:8 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/15-8.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 15:8 The sacrifice made by the wicked (Prov.
