The imagery of "lying in wait" suggests an ambush, a tactic often used by enemies in ancient warfare, indicating a deliberate and malicious intent. Biblically, this echoes the warnings against deceit and treachery found throughout the Psalms and Proverbs. The wicked man is often portrayed as one who schemes and plots against the innocent, reflecting the broader biblical theme of the conflict between good and evil. This warning is a call to righteousness, urging individuals to avoid the path of the wicked, as seen in <a href="/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12-13</a>, where the wicked plot against the righteous, but the Lord laughs at them, knowing their day is coming.<p><b>near the dwelling of the righteous</b><br>The "dwelling of the righteous" symbolizes a place of safety, peace, and divine favor. In ancient Israel, one's home was not just a physical structure but a representation of one's life and standing before God. The righteous are those who live in accordance with God's laws and are often promised protection and blessing. This phrase underscores the sanctity and security of the righteous person's home, which should not be violated. The concept of God as a protector of the righteous is prevalent throughout scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91</a>, where those who dwell in the shelter of the Most High are assured of His protection.<p><b>do not destroy his resting place</b><br>The "resting place" refers to a place of peace and repose, both physically and spiritually. In the cultural context of the Bible, rest is a significant theme, often associated with God's provision and blessing. The Sabbath, for example, is a day of rest instituted by God. The destruction of a resting place implies not just physical harm but also the disruption of peace and divine order. This phrase can be connected to the broader biblical narrative of God as a refuge and fortress for His people, as seen in <a href="/psalms/46.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>. The warning against destroying the resting place of the righteous serves as a reminder of the divine justice that protects the innocent and punishes the wicked.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wicked_man.htm">Wicked Man</a></b><br>Represents those who plot evil or harm against others, particularly against the righteous.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/dwelling_of_the_righteous.htm">Dwelling of the Righteous</a></b><br>Symbolizes the home or life of a person who lives according to God's ways and principles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/righteous.htm">Righteous</a></b><br>Individuals who strive to live in accordance with God's laws and maintain a moral and ethical lifestyle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/resting_place.htm">Resting Place</a></b><br>A metaphor for the peace and security that the righteous find in their relationship with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, known for his wisdom and understanding.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/protection_of_the_righteous.htm">Protection of the Righteous</a></b><br>God is the ultimate protector of those who live righteously.
