In ancient times, dogs were not typically domesticated pets as they are today; they were often wild or semi-wild animals. Grabbing a dog by the ears would provoke an aggressive response, putting the person at risk of being bitten. This imagery underscores the peril of unwarranted involvement in conflicts. The Bible often uses animals to convey lessons, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/17-12.htm">Proverbs 17:12</a>, which warns against meeting a fool in his folly.<p><b>is a passerby</b><br>The term "passerby" suggests someone who is not directly involved or invested in the situation. This highlights the idea of an outsider who lacks the necessary context or relationship to intervene wisely. In biblical times, community and familial ties were strong, and outsiders were often viewed with suspicion. The concept of a passerby meddling in affairs is akin to a stranger intruding into a close-knit community's issues, which could lead to misunderstanding and conflict.<p><b>who meddles in a quarrel not his own</b><br>Meddling in disputes that do not concern us is portrayed as unwise and potentially harmful. The Bible frequently advises against unnecessary involvement in others' conflicts, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:11</a>, which encourages believers to lead a quiet life and mind their own business. This principle is rooted in the understanding that only those directly involved in a situation have the full context and authority to resolve it. Meddling can exacerbate tensions and lead to unintended consequences, much like the chaos that ensues when grabbing a dog by the ears.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/passerby.htm">Passerby</a></b><br>This refers to an individual who is not directly involved in a situation or conflict but chooses to intervene or interfere.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/dog.htm">Dog</a></b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, dogs were often seen as wild and potentially dangerous animals, unlike the domesticated pets we know today.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/q/quarrel.htm">Quarrel</a></b><br>A dispute or conflict between two or more parties, which in this context, the passerby is not a part of.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/proverbs.htm">Proverbs</a></b><br>A book in the Old Testament, traditionally attributed to King Solomon, known for its wisdom literature.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_near_east.htm">Ancient Near East</a></b><br>The cultural and historical context in which the Book of Proverbs was written, influencing its imagery and teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/avoid_unnecessary_conflict.htm">Avoid Unnecessary Conflict</a></b><br>Just as grabbing a dog by the ears is likely to result in harm, meddling in others' disputes can lead to unnecessary trouble and conflict.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_boundaries.htm">Respect Boundaries</a></b><br>Recognize and respect the boundaries of others' relationships and conflicts.

In Solomon&#8217;s day, dogs were scavengers (cf. <a href="/1_kings/14-11.htm">1 Kings 14:11</a>); nobody cuddled them. The action is reckless, needless, and entirely self-inflicted.<p>&#8226; Scripture often links foolish danger with animals: &#8220;Better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs than a fool in his folly&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/17-12.htm">Proverbs 17:12</a>). Grabbing the ears of a bear or a dog puts you in the same senseless category.<p>&#8226; Stepping into hazardous territory when you don&#8217;t have to violates God&#8217;s call to prudence (<a href="/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>). Instead of courting harm, the wise person &#8220;walks securely&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is a passerby who meddles in a quarrel not his own</b><p>&#8226; A passerby has no stake, no invitation, and no responsibility in the dispute&#8212;yet he inserts himself anyway. Scripture names this &#8220;busy&#173;bodying&#8221; and forbids it. &#8220;Let none of you suffer as a murderer or thief or evildoer or as a meddler&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/4-15.htm">1 Peter 4:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Meddling inflames conflict, just as grabbing ears inflames a dog. &#8220;He who repeats a matter separates close friends&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/17-9.htm">Proverbs 17:9</a>). The intruder often escalates the fight, drawing blow-back that could have been avoided.<p>&#8226; Jesus modeled non-interference in purely civil disputes: when asked to divide an inheritance He replied, &#8220;Man, who appointed Me a judge or executor between you?&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-14.htm">Luke 12:14</a>). His example accords with Paul&#8217;s counsel: &#8220;Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: you should mind your own business&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Wisdom respects boundaries: &#8220;Do not accuse a man without cause, when he has done you no harm&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/3-30.htm">Proverbs 3:30</a>). When genuine peacemaking is needed, Scripture calls for gentle restoration (<a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>), not intrusive meddling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/26-17.htm">Proverbs 26:17</a> paints a vivid warning: unnecessary interference invites unnecessary pain. Grabbing a dog&#8217;s ears guarantees a bite; sticking your nose into someone else&#8217;s quarrel guarantees trouble.

Is like one that taketh a dog by the ears, and thus needlessly provokes him to bark and bite. Regarding the position of the two participles in this verse, without any connecting link, Delitzsch takes "passing by" as attributed to the dog, thus: "He seizes by the ears a dog passing by, who is excited by a strife that concerns him not." The stray dog corresponds to the quarrel with which one has nothing to do. The present accentuation does not support this view; otherwise it is suitable and probable. Septuagint, "As he who lays hold of a dog's tail, so is he who sets himself forth as champion in another's cause." Ecclus. 11:9, "Strive not in a matter that concerns thee not."

The Telugu compares such interference to a monkey holding a snake in his paw; it is hard to hold, dangerous to let go (Lane). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/26-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Like one who grabs</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1494;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;z&#238;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2388.htm">Strong's 2388: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fasten upon, to seize, be strong, obstinate, to bind, restrain, conquer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a dog</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1464;&#1425;&#1500;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#257;&#183;le&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3611.htm">Strong's 3611: </a> </span><span class="str2">A dog, a male prostitute</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by the ears</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1494;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;z&#601;&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - fdc<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_241.htm">Strong's 241: </a> </span><span class="str2">Broadness, the ear</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is a passer-by</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1465;&#1489;&#1461;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;&#7687;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5674.htm">Strong's 5674: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pass over, through, or by, pass on</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who meddles</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1437;&#1514;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1431;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7791;&#183;&#8216;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5674.htm">Strong's 5674: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pass over, through, or by, pass on</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a quarrel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#238;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7379.htm">Strong's 7379: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strife, dispute</span><br /><br /><span class="word">not his own.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1468;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/26-17.htm">Proverbs 26:17 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/26-17.htm">Proverbs 26:17 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/26-17.htm">Proverbs 26:17 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/26-17.htm">Proverbs 26:17 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/26-17.htm">Proverbs 26:17 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/26-17.htm">Proverbs 26:17  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/26-17.htm">Proverbs 26:17 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/26-17.htm">Proverbs 26:17 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/26-17.htm">Proverbs 26:17 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/26-17.htm">Proverbs 26:17 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/26-17.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 26:17 Like one who grabs a dog's ears (Prov.
