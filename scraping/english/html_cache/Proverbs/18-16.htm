In biblical times, gifts were often used to gain favor or access, as seen in the story of Jacob sending gifts to Esau to appease him (<a href="/genesis/32-13.htm">Genesis 32:13-21</a>). The concept of gifts opening doors is also reflected in the New Testament, where spiritual gifts are given by the Holy Spirit to build up the church (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-11</a>). Theologically, this can be seen as a principle of divine providence, where God uses the abilities He has given individuals to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>and brings him before great men</b><br>In ancient cultures, presenting a gift was a common practice to gain an audience with someone of higher status, such as a king or ruler. This is exemplified in the story of the Queen of Sheba bringing gifts to Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/10.htm">1 Kings 10:1-2</a>). The phrase implies that a person's abilities or offerings can lead to recognition and influence, allowing them to stand before leaders and decision-makers. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who, through His ultimate gift of sacrifice, brings believers into the presence of God (<a href="/hebrews/10-19.htm">Hebrews 10:19-22</a>). The verse underscores the importance of using one's God-given talents wisely to impact the world and fulfill one's calling.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>The author of Proverbs, known for his wisdom, wealth, and writings.

Some consider it to mean a bribe offered for underhand or fraudulent purposes; but the context does not lead to this conclusion, and the parallel passage mentioned above makes against it. Hitzig sees in it a spiritual gift, equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; but such a meaning is not elsewhere attached to the word. The term here signifies the present which duty or friendship offers to one whom one wishes to please. This paves a man's way to a great person's presence. <span class="cmt_word">Bringeth him before great men.</span> The Oriental custom of offering suitable gifts to one in authority, when a favour or an audience is desired, is here alluded to (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/10-27.htm">1 Samuel 10:27</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>; <a href="/1_kings/10-25.htm">1 Kings 10:25</a>). So the Magi brought gifts so the newborn King at Bethlehem (<a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>). In a spiritual sense, the right use of riches opens the way to eternal life, evincing a man's practical love of God and man; as Christ says (<a href="/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>), "Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles" (Revised Version). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/18-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A man&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1453;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">gift</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(mat&#183;t&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4976.htm">Strong's 4976: </a> </span><span class="str2">A present</span><br /><br /><span class="word">opens doors</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(yar&#183;&#7717;&#238;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7337.htm">Strong's 7337: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be or grow wide or large</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for him,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">and brings</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1495;&#1462;&#1469;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(yan&#183;&#7717;en&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5148.htm">Strong's 5148: </a> </span><span class="str2">To guide, to transport</span><br /><br /><span class="word">him before</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;lip&#772;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124; Noun - common plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6440.htm">Strong's 6440: </a> </span><span class="str2">The face</span><br /><br /><span class="word">great men.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1456;&#1491;&#1465;&#1500;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7713;&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;l&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1419.htm">Strong's 1419: </a> </span><span class="str2">Great, older, insolent</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/18-16.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 18:16 A man's gift makes room for him (Prov.
