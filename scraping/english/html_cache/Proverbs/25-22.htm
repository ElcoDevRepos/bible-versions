The context is about responding to hostility with benevolence, which is a recurring theme in biblical teachings. This approach is countercultural, especially in ancient times when retribution was a common response to enmity. The idea of overcoming evil with good is also echoed in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20-21</a>.<p><b>you will heap burning coals on his head,</b><br>This metaphorical expression has been interpreted in various ways. One interpretation is that it signifies causing the enemy to feel shame and remorse, potentially leading to repentance. The imagery of "burning coals" may also relate to ancient purification rituals, where fire symbolizes cleansing and transformation. In Egyptian culture, carrying coals on the head was a sign of repentance. Thus, the act of kindness could lead the adversary to a change of heart, aligning with the biblical principle of loving one's enemies.<p><b>and the LORD will reward you.</b><br>This assurance of divine reward underscores the biblical principle that God honors those who act righteously, even when it is difficult. The promise of reward is a common motif in Scripture, encouraging believers to trust in God's justice and provision. This aligns with teachings found in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44-48</a>), where Jesus emphasizes loving enemies and trusting in God's ultimate reward. The concept of divine recompense is also seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>, which speaks of God rewarding those who earnestly seek Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>Refers to God, who is central to the teachings of Proverbs, emphasizing His role in rewarding righteous behavior.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_enemy.htm">The Enemy</a></b><br>The verse implies an adversary or someone who has wronged you, highlighting the context of interpersonal conflict.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_with_kindness.htm">Responding with Kindness</a></b><br>The act of heaping burning coals symbolizes a transformative kindness that can lead to repentance or change in the adversary.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_reward.htm">Divine Reward</a></b><br>Trust in God's justice and reward system, knowing that He sees and honors acts of mercy and kindness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/overcoming_evil_with_good.htm">Overcoming Evil with Good</a></b><br>Embrace the power of good to overcome evil, reflecting Christ's teachings and example.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_forgiveness.htm">The Power of Forgiveness</a></b><br>Forgiveness and kindness can disarm hostility and open the door to reconciliation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_love.htm">Practical Love</a></b><br>Demonstrate love in practical ways, even to those who oppose you, as a testament to your faith and obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Proverbs_25_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Proverbs 25:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_25_22_Kindness_to_enemies.htm">How does Proverbs 25:22 encourage us to treat our enemies with kindness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Symbolism_of_heap_coals_in_Proverbs.htm">What does "heap burning coals on his head" symbolize in Proverbs 25:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Romans_12_20_to_Proverbs_25_22.htm">How does Romans 12:20 connect with the teachings in Proverbs 25:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_use_Proverbs_25_22_in_conflicts.htm">In what ways can you apply Proverbs 25:22 in daily conflicts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/God_s_reward_for_Proverbs_25_22.htm">How does God reward us for following Proverbs 25:22's guidance on enemies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_heaping_burning_coals.htm">What does Proverbs 25:22 mean by "heaping burning coals on his head"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_25_22_and_Christian_forgiveness.htm">How does Proverbs 25:22 align with the concept of forgiveness in Christianity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Proverbs_25_22.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Proverbs 25:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_proverbs_25.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Proverbs 25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_it_sinful_to_lie.htm">Is it sinful to lie?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/does_'heap_coals'_conflict_with_forgiveness.htm">Proverbs 25:21&#8211;22 &#8211; Does instructing believers to &#8220;heap burning coals&#8221; on an enemy&#8217;s head conflict with later biblical teachings on compassion and forgiveness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_marriage_imply_singles_lack_blessing.htm">Proverbs 18:22: Does finding 'favor from the Lord' by marrying imply that the single or the divorced lack divine blessing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'turn_the_other_cheek'_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 'turn the other cheek'?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Proverbs 25:22 Mean</div><b>For in so doing</b><p>The line looks back to the command in verse 21&#8212;feeding and watering an enemy.

Thus, to bring a sinner to repentance is well-pleasing to the Lord, who shall reward thee for it. This is better far than to indulge resentment, which must bring sorrow to oneself, punishment from God--whose prerogative of vengeance (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm" title="Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place to wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, said the Lord.">Romans 12:19</a>) has been usurped--and only serve to harden the offender in his hostility.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.</span> This expression has been taken in various senses. It has been thought to mean that the forgiveness of the injured person brings to the cheek of the offender the burning blush of shame. But heaping coals on the head cannot naturally be taken to express such an idea. St. Chrysostom and other Fathers consider that Divine vengeance is implied, as in <a href="/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>, "Upon the wicked he shall rain snares; fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be their portion;" and <a href="/psalms/140-10.htm">Psalm 140:10</a>, "Let burning coals fall upon them." Of course, in one view, kindness to an evil man only gives him occasion for fresh ingratitude and hatred, and therefore increases God's wrath against him. But it would be a wicked motive to act this beneficent part only to have the satisfaction of seeing your injurer humbled or punished. And the gnome implies that the sinner is benefited by the clemency shown to him, that the requital of evil by good brings the offender to a better mind, and aids his spiritual life. "Coals of fire" are a metaphor for the penetrating pain of remorse and repentance. The unmerited kindness which he receives forces upon him the consciousness of his ill doing, which is accompanied by the sharp rain of regret. St. Augustine, "Ne dubitaveris figurate dictum...ut intelligas carbones ignis esse urentes poenitentiae gemitus, quibus superbia sanatur ejus, qui dolit se inimicum fuisse hominis, a quo ejus miseriae subvenitur" ('De Doctr. Christ.,' 3:16). Lesetre quotes St. Francis de Sales, who gives again a different view, "You are not obliged to seek reconciliation with one who has offended you; it may be rather his part to seek you; yet nevertheless go and follow the Saviour's counsel, prevent him with good, render him good for evil: heap coals of fire on his head and on his heart, which may burn up all ill will and constrain him to love you" ('De l'Am. de Dieu,' 8:9). <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord shall reward thee.</span> This consideration can scarcely be regarded as the chief motive for the liberality enjoined, though it would be present to the kind person's mind, and be a support and comfort to him in a course of conduct repugnant to the natural man. He would remember the glorious reward promised to godliness by the prophet (<a href="/isaiah/58-8.htm">Isaiah 58:8</a>, etc.), and how Saul had expressed his consciousness of David's magnanimity in sparing his life. "Thou art more righteous than I; for thou hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil... wherefore the Lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day" (<a href="/1_samuel/24-17.htm">1 Samuel 24:17, 19</a> and 1 Sam 26:21). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/25-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For [in so doing],</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1453;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_859.htm">Strong's 859: </a> </span><span class="str2">Thou and thee, ye and you</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will heap</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1465;&#1514;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#333;&#183;&#7791;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2846.htm">Strong's 2846: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lay hold of, to pick up fire</span><br /><br /><span class="word">burning coals</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1462;&#1469;&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7713;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;l&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1513.htm">Strong's 1513: </a> </span><span class="str2">An ember</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his head,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#333;&#183;&#353;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7218.htm">Strong's 7218: </a> </span><span class="str2">The head</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1469;&#1463;&#1437;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3069.htm">Strong's 3069: </a> </span><span class="str2">YHWH</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will reward you.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#353;al&#183;lem-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7999.htm">Strong's 7999: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be safe, to be, completed, to be friendly, to reciprocate</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/25-22.htm">Proverbs 25:22 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/25-22.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 25:22 For you will heap coals of fire (Prov.
