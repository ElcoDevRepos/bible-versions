A city without walls was vulnerable and defenseless, symbolizing chaos and disorder. This imagery is used throughout the Bible, such as in Nehemiah, where the rebuilding of Jerusalem's walls signifies restoration and security. The broken walls metaphorically represent a lack of self-control, leaving one open to spiritual and moral dangers. The imagery also connects to the fall of Jericho, where the walls collapsed, leading to the city's defeat (Joshua 6).<p><b>is a man who does not control his temper</b><br>Self-control is a fruit of the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>) and is essential for living a life that honors God. The lack of temperance can lead to destructive behavior, as seen in the lives of biblical figures like Saul, whose unchecked anger led to his downfall (1 Samuel 18-19). The New Testament frequently warns against anger, urging believers to be slow to anger and quick to listen (<a href="/james/1-19.htm">James 1:19-20</a>). Jesus exemplified perfect self-control, even when provoked, demonstrating how believers should respond to anger-inducing situations (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).

St. Jerome, by the addition of the words, <span class="accented">in loquendo</span>, applies the proverb to intemperance in language, "So is he who is not able to restrain his spirit in speaking." Commenting on this, St. Gregory ('Moral,' 7:59) says, "Because it is without the wall of silence, the city of the mind lies open to the darts of the enemy, and when it casts itself forth in words, it exhibits itself exposed to the adversary, and he gets the mastery of it without trouble, in proportion as the soul that he has to overcome combats against its own self by much talking" (Oxford transl.). <p>  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/25-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Like a city</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5892.htm">Strong's 5892: </a> </span><span class="str2">Excitement</span><br /><br /><span class="word">whose walls</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1493;&#1465;&#1502;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#333;&#183;w&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2346.htm">Strong's 2346: </a> </span><span class="str2">A wall of protection</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are broken down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1453;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#601;&#183;r&#363;&#183;&#7779;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - QalPassParticiple - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6555.htm">Strong's 6555: </a> </span><span class="str2">To break through</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1437;&#1431;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">does not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_369.htm">Strong's 369: </a> </span><span class="str2">A non-entity, a negative particle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">control</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#8216;&#183;&#7779;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4623.htm">Strong's 4623: </a> </span><span class="str2">Subjectively, control</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his temper.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;r&#363;&#183;&#7717;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - common singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7307.htm">Strong's 7307: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wind, breath, exhalation, life, anger, unsubstantiality, a region of the sky, spirit</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/25-28.htm">Proverbs 25:28 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/25-28.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 25:28 Like a city that is broken down (Prov.
