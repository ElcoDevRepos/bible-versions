The term "servant" here can be understood as someone under authority, not necessarily in a demeaning sense but as a part of the social structure. The phrase suggests that verbal instruction or correction is insufficient for someone who is in a position of servitude. This reflects the broader biblical principle that actions often speak louder than words, as seen in <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>, where faith without works is dead. The need for more than words implies the importance of discipline and practical demonstration, aligning with the biblical theme of wisdom being applied knowledge.<p><b>though he understands,</b><br>Understanding here implies intellectual comprehension. The servant may grasp the instructions or corrections given but lacks the motivation or will to act upon them. This highlights a common biblical theme where knowledge alone is not enough; it must be accompanied by action. This is reminiscent of the parable of the two sons in <a href="/matthew/21-28.htm">Matthew 21:28-31</a>, where the son who initially refuses to work in the vineyard but later goes is commended over the one who agrees but does not go. The emphasis is on the heart's response and the willingness to act, not just intellectual assent.<p><b>he will not respond.</b><br>The lack of response indicates a deeper issue of the heart or will. In biblical terms, this can be seen as a reflection of the human condition post-Fall, where understanding does not always lead to obedience. This is echoed in <a href="/romans/7-15.htm">Romans 7:15-20</a>, where Paul discusses the struggle between knowing what is right and doing it. The phrase suggests that correction must be accompanied by consequences or incentives to elicit a change in behavior. This aligns with the biblical principle of discipline, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12-11.htm">Hebrews 12:11</a>, where discipline is described as painful at the time but ultimately producing a harvest of righteousness. The need for more than words points to the necessity of transformation, a theme central to the message of the Gospel and the work of the Holy Spirit in believers' lives.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/servant.htm">Servant</a></b><br>In the context of ancient Israel, a servant was often someone who worked under the authority of a master. This could include hired workers, bondservants, or slaves. The term here is used to illustrate someone under authority who requires more than verbal instruction to change behavior.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the king of Israel known for his wisdom.

Septuagint, "By words a stubborn (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>) slave will not be instructed." The next clause gives an explanation of this necessity. <span class="cmt_word">For though he understand he will not answer.</span> The answer is not merely the verbal response to a command, as, "I go, sir;" but it implies obedience in action. The reluctant slave thoroughly understands the order given, but he pays no heed to it, will not trouble himself to execute it, and therefore must meet with stern treatment (comp. ver. 15; <a href="/proverbs/23-13.htm">Proverbs 23:13</a>, etc.; Proverbs 26:3).
