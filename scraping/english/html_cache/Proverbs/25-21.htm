In the ancient Near Eastern context, hospitality was a significant cultural value, often extended to strangers and travelers. However, extending such care to an enemy would have been countercultural and challenging. This instruction aligns with the broader biblical theme of loving one's enemies, as seen in Jesus' teachings in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>). It reflects the character of God, who provides for all people, regardless of their relationship with Him.<p><b>give him food to eat,</b><br>Providing food to an enemy is a tangible expression of love and mercy. In biblical times, sharing a meal was a sign of fellowship and peace. This act of kindness could potentially transform a hostile relationship into one of reconciliation. The act of feeding an enemy is reminiscent of God's provision for all humanity, regardless of their spiritual state, as seen in the manna provided to the Israelites in the wilderness (Exodus 16). It also prefigures the ultimate act of love and provision in Jesus Christ, who offers Himself as the bread of life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>and if he is thirsty,</b><br>Thirst in the biblical context often symbolizes a deep need or longing, both physically and spiritually. Providing water to an enemy not only meets a basic physical need but also symbolizes offering peace and reconciliation. Water is a recurring symbol in Scripture, representing life, cleansing, and the Holy Spirit. Jesus' encounter with the Samaritan woman at the well (John 4) highlights the transformative power of offering "living water" to those who are spiritually thirsty, regardless of their past enmity or social status.<p><b>give him water to drink.</b><br>This act of giving water to an enemy underscores the call to overcome evil with good, as echoed in <a href="/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20-21</a>. It reflects the heart of God, who desires reconciliation and peace among all people. The provision of water can also be seen as a type of Christ, who offers Himself as the source of living water, quenching the deepest thirst of the human soul (<a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-38</a>). This command challenges believers to reflect Christ's love and grace, breaking down barriers of hostility and extending the invitation of peace and salvation to all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
