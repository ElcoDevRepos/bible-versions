In biblical context, it reflects the idea that people often believe their actions and intentions are righteous, even when they are not. This is seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes," indicating a lack of divine guidance and moral relativism. The cultural context of ancient Israel, where community and divine law were central, contrasts with the individualistic perspective suggested here. This phrase warns against relying solely on personal judgment without seeking God's wisdom.<p><b>but his motives are weighed out by the LORD</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes God's omniscience and His ability to discern the true intentions behind human actions. The Hebrew concept of "weighing" suggests a careful and just evaluation, akin to a judge assessing evidence. This aligns with <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God tells Samuel that He looks at the heart, not outward appearances. Theologically, it underscores the belief in God's ultimate authority and justice, as He alone can see beyond outward actions to the heart's true motives. This also points to the need for humility and repentance, recognizing that human understanding is limited and flawed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

Scripture consistently treats the course of life as a &#8220;way&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; The breadth is total&#8212;nothing we do escapes this statement. Like <a href="/proverbs/21-2.htm">Proverbs 21:2</a>, God addresses &#8220;all&#8221; our ways, not just the obviously religious ones.<p>&#8226; Our schedules, friendships, work habits, spending patterns, entertainment choices&#8212;each road we walk fits under this phrase.<p>&#8226; Because the Bible speaks literally, the verse does not allow an exception clause: every direction a person takes is under consideration, echoing Jesus&#8217; words that a tree is known by its fruit (<a href="/matthew/7-17.htm">Matthew 7:17&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are pure in his own eyes</b><p>Most people naturally assume moral innocence about their decisions. <a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a> shows Israel&#8217;s downfall when &#8220;everyone did what was right in his own eyes.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Self-deception is real. <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a> calls the heart &#8220;deceitful above all things,&#8221; explaining why people can sin while feeling virtuous.<p>&#8226; Even King Saul said, &#8220;I have obeyed the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-13.htm">1 Samuel 15:13</a>), while blatantly disobedient.<p>&#8226; Jesus exposed the Pharisee in <a href="/luke/18-11.htm">Luke 18:11&#8211;12</a> who congratulated himself on his righteousness. The verse uncovers how easy it is to grade ourselves on a curve and pass.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but his motives are weighed out</b><p>God&#8217;s evaluation penetrates beneath visible behavior to the inner impulse.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a> states, &#8220;Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a> adds that all things are &#8220;laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;weighed&#8221; pictures a balance scale. Every hidden intention&#8212;whether pride, greed, love, or faith&#8212;is measured with perfect accuracy, as <a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a> promises when the Lord &#8220;will expose the motives of men&#8217;s hearts.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by the LORD</b><p>The final authority belongs to the covenant God whose personal name appears.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1&#8211;4</a> celebrates that the LORD has searched and known us; no thought is missed.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/14-10.htm">Romans 14:10&#8211;12</a> reminds believers and unbelievers alike that &#8220;we will all stand before God&#8217;s judgment seat.&#8221;<p>&#8226; His weighing is not a vague cosmic force but a personal, holy assessment. <a href="/revelation/2-23.htm">Revelation 2:23</a> records Jesus declaring, &#8220;I am He who searches hearts and minds.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Because His verdict is decisive, <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a> counsels us to submit our planning to Him, and <a href="/james/4-15.htm">James 4:15</a> teaches us to say, &#8220;If the Lord wills.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every path we choose feels acceptable to us, yet God alone reads the heart behind each step. <a href="/proverbs/16-2.htm">Proverbs 16:2</a> calls us to distrust self-approval and submit our plans, motives, and desires to the searching gaze of the LORD, whose judgment is precise, personal, and final.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes.</span>--Yet that does not excuse his faults in God's sight.

So much the more reason is there for anxious self-examination and testing the conduct by God's word, and, when this has been done to the best of our power, still to pray for cleansing from faults which have escaped our notice. (<a href="/psalms/19-12.htm" title="Who can understand his errors? cleanse you me from secret faults.">Psalm 19:12</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes</span> (<a href="/proverbs/21-2.htm">Proverbs 21:2</a>).
