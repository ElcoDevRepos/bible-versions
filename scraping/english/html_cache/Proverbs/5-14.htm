In the context of Proverbs, it reflects the consequences of ignoring wisdom and engaging in immoral behavior, particularly adultery. The "brink of utter ruin" suggests a point of no return, emphasizing the severity of the situation. Biblically, this aligns with the warnings found throughout Proverbs about the dangers of folly and sin (<a href="/proverbs/1-32.htm">Proverbs 1:32-33</a>). The imagery of a "brink" suggests a precipice, a place where one can fall into destruction, reminiscent of the warnings in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a> about choosing life over death.<p><b>in the midst of the whole assembly.</b><br>This phrase indicates public exposure and shame. In ancient Israelite culture, community and reputation were of utmost importance. Being disgraced "in the midst of the whole assembly" implies a loss of honor and standing within the community. This public aspect of sin's consequences is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>, which warns that sin will find you out. The assembly, or congregation, was central to Israelite life, serving as a place for worship, judgment, and communal decision-making. The fear of public disgrace would have been a powerful deterrent against sin, highlighting the communal nature of sin and its repercussions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_speaker.htm">The Speaker</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse is a person who has realized the consequences of their actions, particularly in the context of ignoring wisdom and falling into immorality.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly.htm">The Assembly</a></b><br>This refers to the community or congregation, possibly indicating a public setting where the speaker's shame and ruin are evident to others.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_context_of_proverbs_5.htm">The Context of Proverbs 5</a></b><br>This chapter is a warning against adultery and the consequences of straying from the path of wisdom.

Like the prodigal who &#8220;came to his senses&#8221; (<a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17</a>), the speaker finally admits his condition.<p>- Proverbs has been warning about immoral choices since 5:3&#8211;13. Now the one who ignored wisdom owns the result, echoing <a href="/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a>: &#8220;For my iniquities have overwhelmed me.&#8221;<p>- Scripture presents confession as the first step to restoration (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>), but here it is voiced in anguish rather than repentance&#8212;showing how long silence has lasted (<a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the brink</b><p>- &#8220;On the brink&#8221; pictures a foot slipping at the edge of a cliff, similar to <a href="/proverbs/4-19.htm">Proverbs 4:19</a> where &#8220;the way of the wicked is like deep darkness.&#8221;<p>- Disaster has not fully arrived, yet it is imminent&#8212;just as Samson did not realize &#8220;the LORD had left him&#8221; until it was too late (<a href="/judges/16-20.htm">Judges 16:20</a>).<p>- Paul&#8217;s warning applies: &#8220;So the one who thinks he is standing firm should be careful not to fall&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of utter ruin</b><p>- &#8220;Utter ruin&#8221; conveys total destruction&#8212;physical, financial, relational, spiritual (<a href="/proverbs/6-32.htm">Proverbs 6:32&#8211;33</a>; 7:22&#8211;27).<p>- Choices that seemed private now threaten everything: health (<a href="/proverbs/5-11.htm">Proverbs 5:11</a>), wealth (5:10), honor (5:9).<p>- <a href="/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18</a> pictures the same sudden collapse: &#8220;You set them on slippery ground; You cast them down to destruction.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the midst</b><p>- Sin promised secret pleasure, yet exposure happens &#8220;in the midst&#8221; of others. <a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a> warns, &#8220;Be sure your sin will find you out.&#8221;<p>- Public fallout magnifies grief; David&#8217;s hidden affair led to national scandal (<a href="/2_samuel/12-12.htm">2 Samuel 12:12</a>).<p>- Jesus affirmed that &#8220;there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-26.htm">Matthew 10:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the whole assembly</b><p>- &#8220;Assembly&#8221; points to the covenant community gathered for worship or judgment, much like <a href="/deuteronomy/19-20.htm">Deuteronomy 19:20</a> where public discipline deters further evil.<p>- Corporate shame compounds personal loss; elders who sin &#8220;are to be rebuked before everyone, so that the others may fear&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/5-20.htm">1 Timothy 5:20</a>).<p>- The verse underscores accountability: life is lived before God and His people, not in isolation (<a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/5-14.htm">Proverbs 5:14</a> captures the moment an unrepentant sinner realizes he has reached the very edge of complete destruction, with everyone watching.

The verse is a sober reminder that disregarding God&#8217;s wisdom leads inevitably from secret compromise to open collapse, urging us to heed His voice before we, too, stand at that precipice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">I was almost in all evil </span>. . .--Rather, <span class= "ital">I had almost fallen into every sin: I was so infatuated that I might have committed any sin, and that openly before all. </span>Or, <span class= "ital">I</span> <span class= "ital">might have been visited with extremest punishment at the hands of the congregation, death by stoning </span>(<a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm" title="And the man that commits adultery with another man's wife, even he that commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.">Leviticus 20:10</a>, <a href="/john/8-5.htm" title="Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what say you?">John 8:5</a>). The offender's eyes are now opened, and he shudders at the thought of the still greater troubles into which he might, in his infatuation, have fallen.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> such was my shamelessness that there was scarcely any wickedness which I did not commit, unrestrained even by the presence of the congregation and assembly. The fact which the ruined youth laments is the extent and audacity of his sins. It is not that he accuses himself of hypocrisy in religion (Delitzsch), but he adds another clement in his career of vice. He has disregarded the warnings and reproofs of his teachers and friends; but more, the presence of the congregation of God's people, a silent but not a less impressive protest, had no restraining effect upon him. The words, "the congregation and assembly" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">kahal v'edah</span>), seem to be used to heighten the conception, rather than to express two distinct and separate ideas, since we find them both used interchangeably to designate the congregation of the Israelites. The radical conception of <span class="accented">kahal</span> ("congregation") is the same as that of the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span> and Vulgate <span class="accented">ecclesia</span>, viz. the congregation looked upon from the point of its being called together, <span class="accented">kahal</span> being derived from <span class="accented">kahal</span>, which in hiph. is equivalent to "to call together," while that of <span class="accented">edah</span> is the congregation looked at from the point of its having assembled <span class="accented">edah</span> being derived from <span class="accented">yaad</span>, in niph. equivalent to "to come together." The latter will therefore stand for any assembly of people specially convened or coming together for some definite object, like the LXX. <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;</span> and the Vulgate <span class="accented">synagoga</span>. The term <span class="accented">edah</span> is, however, used in a technical sense as signifying the <span class="accented">seventy elders</span>, or senators, who judged the people (see <a href="/numbers/25-7.htm">Numbers 25:7</a>; <a href="/numbers/35-12.htm">Numbers 35:12</a>). Rabbi Salomon so explains <span class="accented">haedah</span> as "the congregation," in <a href="/joshua/20-6.htm">Joshua 20:6</a> and <a href="/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>. Other explanations, however, have been given of these words. Zockler takes <span class="accented">kahal</span> as the convened council of elders acting as judges (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-4.htm">Deuteronomy 33:4, 5</a>), and <span class="accented">edah</span> as the concourse (<span class="accented">coetus</span>) of the people executing the condemning sentence (<a href="/numbers/15-15.htm">Numbers 15:15</a>; cf. <a href="/psalms/7-7.htm">Psalm 7:7</a>), and renders, "Well nigh had I fallen into utter destruction in the midst of the assembly and the congregation." Fleischer, Vatablus, and Bayne take much the same view, looking upon <span class="accented">ra</span> ("evil," Authorized Version) as "punishment," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the evil which follows as a consequence of sin - a usage supported by <a href="/2_samuel/16-18.htm">2 Samuel 16:18</a>; <a href="/exodus/5-19.htm">Exodus 5:19</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/7-23.htm">1 Chronicles 7:23</a>; <a href="/psalms/10-6.htm">Psalm 10:6</a> - rather than as evil <span class="accented">per se, i.e.</span> that which is morally bad, as in <a href="/exodus/32-22.htm">Exodus 32:22</a>. Aben Ezra considers that the <span class="accented">perfect</span> is used for the <span class="accented">future</span>; "In a little time I shall be involved in all evil;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> punishment, which is looked forward to prospectively. For "almost" (<span class="accented">ki</span>-<span class="accented">mat</span>, equivalent to "within a little," "almost," "nearly"), see <a href="/genesis/26-10.htm">Genesis 26:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/73-2.htm">Psalm 73:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/119-87.htm">Psalm 119:87</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/5-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I am</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on the brink</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1453;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(kim&#183;&#8216;a&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4592.htm">Strong's 4592: </a> </span><span class="str2">A little, fewness, a few</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of utter</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">ruin</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7451.htm">Strong's 7451: </a> </span><span class="str2">Bad, evil</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the midst</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1514;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#333;&#183;w&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8432.htm">Strong's 8432: </a> </span><span class="str2">A bisection, the centre</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the whole assembly.&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#257;&#183;h&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6951.htm">Strong's 6951: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assembly, convocation, congregation</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/5-14.htm">Proverbs 5:14 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/5-14.htm">Proverbs 5:14 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/5-14.htm">Proverbs 5:14 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/5-14.htm">Proverbs 5:14 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/5-14.htm">Proverbs 5:14 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/5-14.htm">Proverbs 5:14  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/5-14.htm">Proverbs 5:14 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/5-14.htm">Proverbs 5:14 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/5-14.htm">Proverbs 5:14 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/5-14.htm">Proverbs 5:14 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/5-14.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 5:14 I have come to the brink (Prov.
