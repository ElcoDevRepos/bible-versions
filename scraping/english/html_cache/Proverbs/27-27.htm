In ancient Israel, goats were a common livestock, valued for their milk, which was a staple in the diet. The mention of "plenty" suggests a blessing of abundance, often seen as a reward for wise management and hard work, as reflected in <a href="/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23-26</a>, which speaks of knowing the condition of your flocks. This abundance can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual blessings that come from living a life aligned with God's wisdom.<p><b>food for your household&#8212;</b><br>The household in ancient times extended beyond the immediate family to include servants and sometimes even extended family members. Providing for one's household was a significant responsibility, and having enough food was a sign of God's favor and the head of the household's diligence. This phrase underscores the biblical principle of stewardship and responsibility, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>, which emphasizes the importance of providing for one's family. It also reflects the cultural context where the family unit was central to societal structure.<p><b>and nourishment for your maidservants.</b><br>Maidservants were part of the extended household and their well-being was a reflection of the master's integrity and care. In biblical times, servants were often considered part of the family unit, and their treatment was a reflection of one's faithfulness to God's commands, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14-15</a>, which instructs fair treatment of workers. This phrase highlights the importance of justice and kindness in leadership, echoing the biblical theme of caring for those who serve us, as Jesus exemplified in His teachings on servant leadership (<a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42-45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/goats.htm">Goats</a></b><br>Domesticated animals that were common in ancient Israel, providing milk, meat, and other resources.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/household.htm">Household</a></b><br>Refers to the family unit and those living under the care and provision of the head of the family.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/maidservants.htm">Maidservants</a></b><br>Female servants who were part of the household, indicating a broader community beyond the immediate family.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_israel.htm">Ancient Israel</a></b><br>The cultural and historical context in which Proverbs was written, where agriculture and livestock were central to daily life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>Trust in God's ability to provide for all your needs, just as He provides for the household in <a href="/proverbs/27-27.htm">Proverbs 27:27</a>.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship.htm">Stewardship</a></b><br>Be diligent and wise in managing the resources God has given you, ensuring that your household is well cared for.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_care.htm">Community Care</a></b><br>Recognize the importance of providing not only for your immediate family but also for those who are part of your extended household or community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/contentment.htm">Contentment</a></b><br>Find satisfaction in the provision God grants, understanding that He knows what is sufficient for your needs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>Demonstrate your faith by actively working and trusting in God's provision, balancing prayer with practical effort.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Proverbs_27_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Proverbs 27:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_27_27_on_resource_stewardship.htm">How does Proverbs 27:27 encourage stewardship of God's provided resources in our lives?

And maintenance for thy maidens; who milk the goats, etc., and tend the cattle, and do the household work. There is no mention of the use of animal flesh as food. It was only on great occasions, as high festivals, or the presence of an honoured guest, that kids, lambs, and calves were killed and eaten. This picture of rural peace and plenty points to a time of security and prosperity, free alike from internal commotion and external danger. The famous passage in Cicero, 'De Senect.,' 15, on the pleasures and advantages of the agricultural life. will occur to all classical readers. So also Horace ('Epod.,' 2), "Beatus ille qui procul negotiis," etc. The LXX. makes short work of this verse, "My son, thou hast from me sayings mighty for thy life and for the life of thy servants." <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/27-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You will have plenty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497; &#1472;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1767.htm">Strong's 1767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sufficiency, enough</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of goats&#8217;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1494;&#1468;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;iz&#183;z&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5795.htm">Strong's 5795: </a> </span><span class="str2">Female goat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">milk</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1452;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;l&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2461.htm">Strong's 2461: </a> </span><span class="str2">Milk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to feed you&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1469;&#1453;&#1500;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1502;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;la&#7717;&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3899.htm">Strong's 3899: </a> </span><span class="str2">Food, bread, grain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">food</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1500;&#1462;&#1443;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;le&#183;&#7717;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3899.htm">Strong's 3899: </a> </span><span class="str2">Food, bread, grain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for your household</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1462;&#1425;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;&#7791;e&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and nourishment</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1437;&#1495;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7717;ay&#183;y&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2416.htm">Strong's 2416: </a> </span><span class="str2">Alive, raw, fresh, strong, life</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for your maidservants.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1462;&#1469;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;na&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;r&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;e&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - feminine plural construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5291.htm">Strong's 5291: </a> </span><span class="str2">A girl, maiden</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/27-27.htm">Proverbs 27:27 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/27-27.htm">Proverbs 27:27 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/27-27.htm">Proverbs 27:27 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/27-27.htm">Proverbs 27:27 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/27-27.htm">Proverbs 27:27 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/27-27.htm">Proverbs 27:27  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/27-27.htm">Proverbs 27:27 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/27-27.htm">Proverbs 27:27 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/27-27.htm">Proverbs 27:27 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/27-27.htm">Proverbs 27:27 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/27-27.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 27:27 There will be plenty of goats' milk (Prov.
