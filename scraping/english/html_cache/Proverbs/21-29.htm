In biblical context, the "face" often symbolizes one's attitude or disposition. A hardened face indicates a refusal to acknowledge wrongdoing or to repent. This imagery is consistent with other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/48-4.htm">Isaiah 48:4</a>, which speaks of Israel's obstinacy: "Because I know that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew and your forehead brass." The hardening of one's face can also be seen as a metaphor for pride and defiance against God, similar to Pharaoh's hardened heart in Exodus. Culturally, in ancient Near Eastern societies, facial expressions were significant indicators of one's inner state, and a hardened face would be perceived as a sign of rebellion or defiance.<p><b>but the upright man makes his way sure</b><br>In contrast, the upright man is characterized by integrity and righteousness. The phrase "makes his way sure" implies careful consideration and a commitment to walking in accordance with God's will. This aligns with the wisdom literature's emphasis on the path of righteousness, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>: "Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight." The upright man's way is secure because it is founded on divine guidance and moral principles. This reflects the biblical theme of the righteous being blessed and protected by God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1-6.htm">Psalm 1:6</a>: "For the LORD watches over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked leads to destruction." The upright man's life is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate example of righteousness and whose path was ordained by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wicked_man.htm">Wicked Man</a></b><br>Represents those who are morally corrupt or evil, often characterized by stubbornness and defiance against righteousness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/u/upright_man.htm">Upright Man</a></b><br>Symbolizes individuals who live in accordance with God's laws, demonstrating integrity and righteousness in their actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_nature_of_wickedness.htm">The Nature of Wickedness</a></b><br>The hardening of the face signifies a deliberate choice to resist correction and persist in sin.
