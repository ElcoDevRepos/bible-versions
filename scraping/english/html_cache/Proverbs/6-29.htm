In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, marriage was a sacred covenant, and adultery was seen as a grave sin against God and the community. The seventh commandment explicitly prohibits adultery (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>). The act of sleeping with another man's wife is not only a betrayal of trust but also a violation of the divine order established by God for marriage. The consequences of such actions are severe, as seen in the story of David and Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11), where David's adultery led to a series of tragic events, including the death of their child and ongoing strife within David's family.<p><b>no one who touches her will go unpunished.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the certainty of divine justice. In biblical terms, "touching" is often a euphemism for sexual relations, and the warning here is clear: those who engage in adultery will face consequences. The punishment may not always be immediate or visible, but it is assured by God's righteous standards. <a href="/proverbs/5-3.htm">Proverbs 5:3-5</a> warns of the bitter end of adultery, describing it as a path leading to death. The New Testament also reinforces this principle, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>, which states that God will judge the adulterer. This reflects the broader biblical theme that sin, particularly sexual immorality, has serious repercussions both in this life and in the life to come. The certainty of punishment serves as a deterrent and a call to uphold the sanctity of marriage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
