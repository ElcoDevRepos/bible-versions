In biblical context, folly often refers to a lack of wisdom or moral insight, which leads to poor decision-making. The Book of Proverbs frequently contrasts wisdom and folly, emphasizing that wisdom leads to life and prosperity, while folly leads to destruction (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7, 9</a>:6). The idea of one's way being subverted suggests a path that is disrupted or led astray, which aligns with the biblical theme of the "way" as a metaphor for one's life journey or moral conduct (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>). The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a high value on wisdom, often seen as a divine gift, and folly was viewed as a rejection of God's guidance.<p><b>yet his heart rages against the LORD</b><br>This part of the verse addresses the human tendency to blame God for the consequences of one's own actions. The heart, in biblical terms, often represents the center of one's emotions and will. The act of raging against the LORD indicates anger or frustration directed at God, despite the individual's own responsibility for their situation. This reflects a common biblical theme where people fail to acknowledge their own sinfulness and instead question God's justice or goodness (<a href="/job/1-22.htm">Job 1:22</a>, <a href="/isaiah/45-9.htm">Isaiah 45:9</a>). Theologically, this can be seen as a failure to recognize God's sovereignty and the moral order He has established. The connection to other scriptures, such as <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a>, shows a pattern of humanity's inclination to turn away from God and the resulting spiritual and moral decline.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_foolish_man.htm">The Foolish Man</a></b><br>Represents individuals who act unwisely or make poor decisions, leading to negative consequences in their lives.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>Refers to God, the Creator and Sustainer, who is often blamed by individuals for the outcomes of their own foolish actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_folly.htm">Understanding Folly</a></b><br>Recognize that folly, or foolishness, is often a result of ignoring wisdom and guidance.

Say not thou, He has caused me to err; for he hath no need of the sinful man," etc. The latter part of this important passage St. Augustine quotes thus: "Item apud Salomonem: Deus ab initio constituit hominem et reliquit eum in manu consilii sui: adjecit ei mandata et praecepta; si voles praecepta servare, servabunt te, et in posterum fidem placitam facere. Apposuit tibi aquam et ignem, ad quod vis porrige manum tuam. Ante hominem bonum et malum, vita et mors, paupertas et honestas a Domino Deo sunt" ('De Per. Just. Hom.,' cap. 19, &sect; 41). And again, "Manifestum est, quod si ad ignem manum mittit, et malum ac mors ei placet, id votuntas hominis operatur; si autem bonum et vitam diligit, non solum voluntas id agit, sed divinitus adjuvatur" ('De Gest. Pelag.,' cap. 3, &sect; 7).
