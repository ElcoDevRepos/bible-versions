It is depicted as insatiable, always consuming but never full. This concept is echoed in other scriptures such as <a href="/isaiah/5-14.htm">Isaiah 5:14</a> and <a href="/habakkuk/2-5.htm">Habakkuk 2:5</a>, where Sheol is portrayed as having an unending appetite. Theologically, it represents the inevitability of death and the grave, a reminder of human mortality and the need for redemption.<p><b>the barren womb</b><br>In ancient cultures, including Israel, barrenness was often seen as a source of shame and distress for women, as children were considered a blessing from God (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>). The barren womb symbolizes unfulfilled desire and longing. This theme is seen in the stories of Sarah, Rachel, and Hannah, who experienced barrenness before God intervened. It highlights the deep yearning for life and continuation, reflecting humanity's desire for legacy and purpose.<p><b>land never satisfied with water</b><br>This phrase refers to the arid and dry regions common in the Near East, where water is a precious and often scarce resource. The land's thirst for water symbolizes the constant need for sustenance and the unending cycle of nature. Biblically, water is also a symbol of life and spiritual renewal, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, where Jesus speaks of living water. The insatiable land parallels the human soul's need for spiritual nourishment.<p><b>and fire that never says, &#8216;Enough!&#8217;</b><br>Fire is a powerful biblical symbol of both destruction and purification. It consumes everything in its path, representing judgment and the refining process. In the context of Proverbs, fire's insatiability underscores the destructive nature of unchecked desires and passions. This imagery is consistent with other biblical references, such as <a href="/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6</a>, where the tongue is likened to a fire, capable of great harm. Fire's unending appetite serves as a warning against the dangers of greed and lust.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_grave.htm">The Grave (Sheol)</a></b><br>In Hebrew, "Sheol" refers to the realm of the dead.

Until He opens the womb, the yearning remains insistent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>land never satisfied with water</b><p>Parched ground soaks up rain yet soon thirsts again. <a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10</a> describes water falling to make the earth &#8220;bud and sprout,&#8221; but the process must repeat. <a href="/jeremiah/14-4.htm">Jeremiah 14:4</a> shows cracked soil because rain stopped.

The burning desire for children, characteristic of an Israelitish wife, is here denoted, like the passionate cry of Rachel to Jacob, "Give me children, or else I die" (<a href="/genesis/30-1.htm">Genesis 30:1</a>). The barren woman, says Corn. a Lapide, " concubitus magis est avida quam ceterae tum propter desiderium habendae prolis, tum quod foecundae et gravidae naturaliter non appetant concubitum." The third insatiable thing is <span class="cmt_word">the earth that is not filled</span> (<span class="accented">satisfied</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>with water</span>; the parched and thirsty soil which no amount of water can satisfy, which drinks in all that is poured upon it and is not benefited, what Virgil ('Georg.,' 1:114) calls "bibula arena." <span class="cmt_word">The fourth is the fire that saith not,</span> <span class="cmt_word">It is enough;</span> the "devouring element," as the newspapers term it. The more you heap on fire, the more material you supply, the fiercer it rages. Septuagint, "Hades, and the love of woman, and earth not satisfied with water, and water, and fire, will not say, It sufficeth." Cheyne and others quote from the Sanscrit 'Hitopadesa,' "Fire is never satisfied with fuel; nor the ocean with rivers; nor death with all creatures; nor bright-eyed women with men." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/30-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Sheol,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;wl)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7585.htm">Strong's 7585: </a> </span><span class="str2">Underworld (place to which people descend at death)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the barren</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1465;&#1450;&#1510;&#1462;&#1451;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;&#7779;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
