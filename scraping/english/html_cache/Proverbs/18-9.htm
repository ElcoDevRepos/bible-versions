In biblical times, work was often tied to survival, whether through agriculture, trade, or craftsmanship. The slothful, or lazy, person neglects these responsibilities, which can lead to poverty and hardship. Proverbs frequently contrasts the diligent with the lazy, emphasizing that hard work leads to prosperity (<a href="/proverbs/10-4.htm">Proverbs 10:4</a>). The cultural context of ancient Israel valued industriousness, as seen in the example of the virtuous woman in <a href="/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>, who is praised for her hard work and resourcefulness.<p><b>is brother to him who destroys</b><br>This part of the verse draws a parallel between laziness and destruction. In the Hebrew culture, being a "brother" implies a close relationship or similarity. The slothful person, by neglecting their duties, indirectly causes harm and chaos, akin to someone who actively destroys. This connection underscores the idea that inaction can be as damaging as harmful actions. Theologically, this can be linked to the parable of the talents in <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>, where the servant who does nothing with his talent is condemned. The concept of destruction here can also be seen as a spiritual warning, as laziness can lead to moral and spiritual decay, distancing one from God's purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_slothful_person.htm">The Slothful Person</a></b><br>This individual is characterized by laziness or a lack of diligence in their work. In the context of Proverbs, this person is often contrasted with the diligent and wise.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_destroyer.htm">The Destroyer</a></b><br>This person actively causes harm or ruin.

A man that does his work in some sort, but not heartily and diligently, as one who knows that labour is not only a duty and necessity, but a means of sanctification, a training for a higher life. <span class="cmt_word">Is brother to him that is a great waster</span>; a destroyer. "Brother" is used as "companion" in <a href="/proverbs/28-24.htm">Proverbs 28:24</a> (comp. <a href="/job/30-29.htm">Job 30:29</a>), for one of like attributes and tendencies; as we say, "next door to;" and the destroyer is, as Nowack says, not merely one who wastes his property by reckless expenditure, but one who delights in such destruction, finds a morbid pleasure in haves and ruin. So the maxim asserts that remissness in duty is as mischievous as actual destructiveness. "An idle brain," say the Italians, "is the devil's workshop." The word rendered "great" is <span class="accented">baal</span> (<a href="/proverbs/1-19.htm">Proverbs 1:19</a>), "owner," <span class="accented">patrono</span> (Montanus), <span class="accented">domino</span> (Vatablus); and, taking this sense, according to Wordsworth and others, the sentence implies that the servant who is slothful is brother to a master who is a prodigal. But the interpretation given above is best founded. The LXX., reading <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5ea;&#x5e8;&#x5e4;&#x5d0;</span> instead of, <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5ea;&#x5e8;&#x5e4;&#x5d4;</span>, renders, "He who healeth not (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) himself in his works is brother to him who destroyeth himself."
