In ancient Israel, the family structure was patriarchal, with sons typically inheriting leadership and property. However, this proverb suggests that wisdom and character can elevate a servant above a son who lacks integrity. This is reminiscent of Joseph, who, though a servant in Egypt, rose to power due to his wisdom and discernment (<a href="/genesis/41-39.htm">Genesis 41:39-41</a>). The concept of a servant ruling over a son also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that those who are faithful in little will be entrusted with much (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p><b>and share his inheritance as one of the brothers.</b><br>In the cultural context of the Old Testament, inheritance was a significant aspect of family life, usually reserved for sons. The idea that a servant could share in the inheritance indicates a radical shift based on merit rather than birth. This reflects the biblical theme that God honors those who are faithful and wise, regardless of their social standing. It also parallels the New Testament teaching that believers, regardless of their background, are co-heirs with Christ (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>). This phrase underscores the principle that God's kingdom values wisdom and righteousness over traditional human hierarchies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wise_servant.htm">Wise Servant</a></b><br>Represents an individual who, despite a lower social status, demonstrates wisdom and integrity, leading to a position of authority and honor.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disgraceful_son.htm">Disgraceful Son</a></b><br>Symbolizes a person who, despite having a privileged position by birth, acts foolishly and brings shame upon themselves and their family.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/inheritance.htm">Inheritance</a></b><br>Refers to the distribution of family wealth or property, traditionally passed down to sons, but in this case, shared with a wise servant due to the son's disgrace.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/brothers.htm">Brothers</a></b><br>Represents the family unit, typically the rightful heirs to the inheritance, highlighting the unusual circumstance of a servant sharing in their portion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_over_birthright.htm">Wisdom Over Birthright</a></b><br>The verse teaches that wisdom and integrity can elevate a person beyond their social or familial status.

Slaves, especially those "born in the house," often rose to a position of great trust. (Comp. <a href="/genesis/24-2.htm" title="And Abraham said to his oldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh:">Genesis 24:2</a>; <a href="/context/genesis/39-4.htm" title="And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.">Genesis 39:4-6</a>.) Eliezer would have been Abraham's heir had not Isaac been born (<a href="/genesis/15-3.htm" title="And Abram said, Behold, to me you have given no seed: and, see, one born in my house is my heir.">Genesis 15:3</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame.</span> Here is intimated the supremacy of wisdom over folly and vice. The contrast is better emphasized by translating, <span class="accented">A servant that dealeth wisely shall have rule over a son that doeth shamefully</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a son of his master. (For similar contrast between "wise" and "shameful," comp. <a href="/proverbs/10-5.htm">Proverbs 10:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-35.htm">Proverbs 14:35</a>.) Slaves were often raised to high honour, and might inherit their master's possessions. Thus Abraham's servant, Eliezer of Damascus, was at one time considered the patriarch's heir (<a href="/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2, 3</a>); Ziba, Saul's servant, obtained the inheritance of his lord Mephibosheth ("the Shameful," <a href="/2_samuel/16-4.htm">2 Samuel 16:4</a>); Joseph was advanced to the highest post in Egypt. Ecclus. 10:25, "Unto the servant that is wise shall they that are free do service; and he that is wise will not grudge when he is reformed." Septuagint, "A wise household servant shall rule over foolish masters." "I have seen," says Ecelesiastes (Ecclesiastes 10:7), "servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth." <span class="cmt_word">Shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren;</span> shall share on equal terms with the sons of the house. This innovation on the usual disposition of property could happen only in the case of an abnormally intelligent and trusted slave. In <a href="/1_chronicles/2-34.htm">1 Chronicles 2:34</a>, etc., mention is made of a case where a master, having no son, gave his daughter in marriage to a slave, and adopted him into the family. Delitzsch understands the clause to mean that the slave shall have the office of dividing his master's inheritance among the heirs, shall be the executor of his deceased master's will; but this explanation hardly seems to do justice to the merits of the "wise servant," and takes no account of the idea involved in "shameful son." But the Septuagint appears to countenance this view, rendering, "and among the brethren he shall divide the portions." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/17-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A wise</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#347;&#183;k&#238;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7919.htm">Strong's 7919: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be, circumspect, intelligent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">servant</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1462;&#1469;&#1489;&#1462;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;e&#183;&#7687;e&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5650.htm">Strong's 5650: </a> </span><span class="str2">Slave, servant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will rule over</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1453;&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yim&#183;&#353;&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4910.htm">Strong's 4910: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rule, have dominion, reign</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a disgraceful</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1489;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_954.htm">Strong's 954: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pale, to be ashamed, to be disappointed, delayed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
