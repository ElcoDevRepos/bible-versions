In biblical context, this aligns with the concept of God's eternal nature, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>, which speaks of God's existence from everlasting to everlasting. The term "established" implies a firm foundation, indicating that wisdom is a fundamental aspect of God's character and creation. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described in <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-2</a> as being with God in the beginning and through whom all things were made.<p><b>From the beginning</b><br>The phrase "from the beginning" connects to the creation narrative in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a>, where God creates the heavens and the earth. It underscores the idea that wisdom was present at the very start of creation, playing a role in the formation of the universe. This is further supported by <a href="/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a>, which states that the Lord founded the earth by wisdom. Theologically, this suggests that wisdom is integral to the order and design of creation, reflecting God's intentionality and purpose.<p><b>Before the earth began</b><br>This phrase highlights the pre-existence of wisdom before the physical world was formed. It suggests a time before the material universe, pointing to a divine plan and order that precedes creation. This can be linked to <a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4-7</a>, where God questions Job about the foundations of the earth, implying that wisdom was present even then. In a Christological sense, it parallels <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>, where Christ is described as existing before all things and holding all creation together, reinforcing the idea of wisdom as a divine attribute embodied in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom.htm">Wisdom</a></b><br>In <a href="/bsb/proverbs/8.htm">Proverbs 8</a>, Wisdom is personified and speaks as a divine attribute of God, present from the beginning of creation. This personification highlights the eternal nature and foundational role of wisdom in God's creation and order.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/creation.htm">Creation</a></b><br>The verse references the time "before the earth began," pointing to the period of creation. It emphasizes the pre-existence of wisdom before the physical universe was formed.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>Implicit in the text is the presence of God, who establishes wisdom. This reflects the belief in God as the eternal source and originator of all things, including wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_nature_of_wisdom.htm">Eternal Nature of Wisdom</a></b><br>Wisdom is not a human invention but an eternal attribute of God. It existed before the world and is foundational to creation. As believers, we should seek this divine wisdom in our lives, recognizing its timeless value.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty in Creation</a></b><br>The establishment of wisdom "from everlasting" points to God's sovereign plan and order. Trusting in God's wisdom means acknowledging His control and purpose in the universe and our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/pursuit_of_wisdom.htm">Pursuit of Wisdom</a></b><br>Since wisdom is foundational and eternal, pursuing it should be a priority for Christians. This pursuit involves studying Scripture, prayer, and seeking the guidance of the Holy Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/christ_as_the_embodiment_of_wisdom.htm">Christ as the Embodiment of Wisdom</a></b><br>In the New Testament, Christ is often associated with divine wisdom.

Before clocks, calendars, or even the first sunrise, Wisdom already was. <a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a> says, &#8220;From everlasting to everlasting You are God,&#8221; and <a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1&#8211;2</a> echoes, &#8220;In the beginning was the Word&#8230; He was with God in the beginning.&#8221; Both point to the same eternal reality: Wisdom is not a latecomer to the story but part of God&#8217;s very nature. <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a> speaks of One &#8220;whose origins are from of old, from ancient times,&#8221; confirming that what is eternal in God is personal and present.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I was established</b><p>&#8226; The phrase underscores intentionality. Wisdom is not accidental; it is &#8220;established,&#8221; firmly set. <a href="/proverbs/3-19.htm">Proverbs 3:19</a> reminds us, &#8220;The LORD founded the earth by wisdom,&#8221; showing that divine order was put in place on purpose. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm">1 Corinthians 1:30</a> identifies Christ as &#8220;our wisdom from God,&#8221; so the establishing work finds its fullest expression in Him. <a href="/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2&#8211;3</a> says the Son &#8220;made the universe&#8221; and &#8220;sustains all things,&#8221; giving weight to this establishing role.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From the beginning</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;From the beginning&#8221; ties eternity to history&#8217;s first moment. <a href="/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a> starts, &#8220;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth,&#8221; and Wisdom was already active. <a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a> calls Jesus &#8220;the Beginning of God&#8217;s creation,&#8221; not as the first created thing but as the initiator of creation itself. The phrase reassures us that nothing predates or surprises God&#8217;s wisdom&#8212;every timeline starts with Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Before the earth began</b><p>&#8226; Going a step further, this clause places Wisdom ahead of solid ground, oceans, and mountains. <a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4&#8211;7</a> depicts the morning stars singing while God laid earth&#8217;s cornerstone, implying wisdom&#8217;s presence in that scene. <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4</a> says we were &#8220;chosen in Him before the foundation of the world,&#8221; and <a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a> speaks of a promise &#8220;before time began.&#8221; If God could plan redemption before dirt existed, His wisdom can handle today&#8217;s details.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Wisdom in <a href="/proverbs/8-23.htm">Proverbs 8:23</a> is eternal, deliberately placed, present at the very start, and prior to earth itself. These layers reveal a personal, living Wisdom&#8212;ultimately fulfilled in Christ&#8212;who stands outside time yet steps into creation to guide and redeem. Knowing this anchors our faith: the same Wisdom that framed the cosmos is available for every decision, trial, and joy we face now.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">I</span> <span class= "bld">was set up.</span>--An unusual word; also applied to our Lord in <a href="/psalms/2-6.htm" title="Yet have I set my king on my holy hill of Zion.">Psalm 2:6</a> when "set" as King on Zion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I was set up from everlasting.</span> The verb used here is remarkable. It is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span>(<span class="accented">nasak</span>), in niph.; and it is found in <a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>, "I have set my King upon my holy hill." Both here and there it has been translated "anointed," which would make a noteworthy reference to Christ. But there seems no proof that the word has this meaning. It signifies properly "to pour forth" (as of molten metal), then "to put down," "to appoint or establish." The versions recognize this. Thus the Septuagint, "he established (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>) me;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">ordinata sum</span>; Aquila, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>; Symmachus, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>; Venetian, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (comp. Ecclus. 1:9). So what is here said is that Wisdom was from everlasting exalted as ruler and disposer of all things. To express eternal relation, three synonymous terms are used.
