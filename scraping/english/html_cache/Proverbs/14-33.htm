In biblical context, the "heart" often represents the center of one's being, including mind, will, and emotions. The discerning are those who possess the ability to judge well, a quality highly valued in the wisdom literature of the Bible. <a href="/proverbs/2-10.htm">Proverbs 2:10-11</a> highlights how wisdom enters the heart and brings knowledge and discretion. The resting of wisdom implies a sense of peace and stability, suggesting that true wisdom is not fleeting but becomes a part of one's character. This aligns with the biblical portrayal of wisdom as a divine gift, as seen in Solomon's request for wisdom in <a href="/1_kings/3-9.htm">1 Kings 3:9-12</a>.<p><b>even among fools she is known.</b><br>This part of the verse suggests that wisdom, though not embraced by fools, is still recognized by them. The term "fools" in Proverbs often refers to those who reject God's ways and lack moral insight. Despite their rejection, the presence of wisdom is evident and undeniable, even to those who do not possess it. This can be seen in the broader biblical narrative where the wisdom of God is evident in creation (<a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1-4</a>) and in the life of Jesus Christ, who is described as the wisdom of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>). The acknowledgment of wisdom by fools underscores the universal truth and authority of divine wisdom, which transcends human understanding and is ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who embodies perfect wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was known for his wisdom, which he received from God.

Wisdom sits enshrined in the intelligent man's mind, and thence disseminates instruction and light around to all who need it. The Septuagint, with which agree the Syriac, Aquila, and Theodotion, inserts a negative in the second clause, thus: "In the good heart of a man shall rest wisdom, but in the heart of fools it is not discerned" (Wisd. 1:4). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/14-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Wisdom</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#7733;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2451.htm">Strong's 2451: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wisdom</span><br /><br /><span class="word">rests</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#257;&#183;n&#363;&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5117.htm">Strong's 5117: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rest, settle down</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the heart</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;l&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3820.htm">Strong's 3820: </a> </span><span class="str2">The heart, the feelings, the will, the intellect, centre</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the discerning;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1453;&#1489;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_995.htm">Strong's 995: </a> </span><span class="str2">To separate mentally, understand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">even in the hearts</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1511;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;qe&#183;re&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7130.htm">Strong's 7130: </a> </span><span class="str2">The nearest part, the center</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of fools</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1437;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;s&#238;&#183;l&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3684.htm">Strong's 3684: </a> </span><span class="str2">Stupid fellow, dullard, fool</span><br /><br /><span class="word">she is known.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1493;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1461;&#1469;&#1506;&#1463;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(tiw&#183;w&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#234;&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/14-33.htm">Proverbs 14:33 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/14-33.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 14:33 Wisdom rests in the heart of one (Prov.
