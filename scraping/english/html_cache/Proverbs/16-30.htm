In the cultural context of ancient Israel, non-verbal gestures carried significant meaning, and a wink could indicate a secretive or underhanded plan. This phrase suggests a person who uses subtlety and cunning to achieve perverse goals, aligning with the broader biblical theme of the heart's intentions being revealed through actions. The concept of devising perversity is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/36-4.htm">Psalm 36:4</a>, which speaks of plotting evil on one's bed. This behavior contrasts with the wisdom and integrity that Proverbs consistently advocates.<p><b>he who purses his lips is bent on evil.</b><br>Pursing the lips can be a sign of determination or resolve, often in a negative context here, indicating a person who is resolute in their pursuit of evil. This imagery suggests a deliberate and conscious choice to engage in wrongdoing. The historical context of Proverbs, a book attributed to Solomon, reflects a time when wisdom literature was used to instruct and guide moral behavior. The emphasis on speech and its connection to the heart's condition is a recurring theme in scripture, as seen in <a href="/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6</a>, which describes the tongue as a fire capable of corrupting the whole body. This phrase underscores the importance of aligning one's intentions and actions with righteousness, a principle central to biblical teaching.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_deceiver.htm">The Deceiver</a></b><br>This verse describes a person who uses subtle gestures, like winking and lip-pursing, to communicate deceitful intentions.
