In biblical times, a nest was a place of protection and nurturing, essential for the survival of young birds. The imagery suggests vulnerability and the potential for danger when one leaves their designated place. In the Bible, birds often symbolize care and provision, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>, where Jesus speaks of God's provision for the birds of the air. The straying bird can also symbolize restlessness or a lack of contentment, which is cautioned against in various scriptures, such as <a href="/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>, which advises believers to be content with what they have.<p><b>is a man who wanders from his home</b><br>In ancient Israel, the home was not just a physical structure but a center of family life, community, and spiritual practice. Wandering from one's home could imply leaving behind responsibilities, relationships, and the spiritual heritage of one's family. The concept of "home" in the Bible often extends to one's community and faith, as seen in the story of the Prodigal Son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>), where leaving home leads to a loss of identity and purpose. The act of wandering can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual drifting, as warned against in <a href="/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a>, which describes a double-minded man as unstable in all his ways. This phrase underscores the importance of remaining steadfast in one's commitments and the dangers of seeking fulfillment outside of God's ordained place for an individual.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

But the idea here is of a bird which leaves its own nest either wantonly or from some external reason, and thereby exposes itself to d so comfort and danger (comp. <a href="/isaiah/16-2.htm">Isaiah 16:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">So is a man that wandereth from his place</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. his own home (comp. Ecclus. 29:21, etc., and 36:28 in Vet. Lat., "Quis credit ei qui non habet nidum, et deflectens ubicumque obscuraverit, quasi succinctus latro exsil ins de civitate in civitatem?"). The proverb indirectly inculcates love of one's home and one's native land. To be "a fugitive and a vagabond" (<a href="/genesis/4-12.htm">Genesis 4:12</a>) was a terrible punishment, as the Jews have learned by the experience of many centuries. Language and religion placed a barrier against residence in any country but their own (see <a href="/psalms/84.htm">Psalm 84</a>.); and though at the time when this book was probably written they knew little of foreign travel, yet they regarded sojourn in a strange land as an evil, and centred all their ideas of happiness and comfort in a home life surrounded by friends and countrymen. The word "wander" may have the notion of going into exile. Septuagint, "As when a bird flies down from its own nest, so is a man brought into bondage when he is banished (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>) from his own place." Some have reasoned from this expression that the idea of exile had become familiar to the writer, and hence that this portion of the Proverbs is of very late origin (Cheyne) - surely a very uncertain foundation for such a conclusion. The love of Orientals for their native soil is a passion which no sordid and miserable surroundings can extinguish, and a man would consider even a change of home an unmixed evil, though such change was not the result of exile. Our view of the fortunes of one who is always shifting his abode is expressed in the adage, "A rolling stone gathers no moss." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/27-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Like a bird</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1453;&#1510;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7779;ip&#183;p&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6833.htm">Strong's 6833: </a> </span><span class="str2">A little bird</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that strays</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1461;&#1445;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7695;&#234;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5074.htm">Strong's 5074: </a> </span><span class="str2">To wave to and fro, to rove, flee, to drive away</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from its nest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(qin&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7064.htm">Strong's 7064: </a> </span><span class="str2">A nest, the nestlings, a chamber, dwelling</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[is] a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1437;&#1431;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who wanders</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1462;&#1443;&#1491;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7695;e&#183;&#7695;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5074.htm">Strong's 5074: </a> </span><span class="str2">To wave to and fro, to rove, flee, to drive away</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(min-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4480.htm">Strong's 4480: </a> </span><span class="str2">A part of, from, out of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his home.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1502;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;m&#601;&#183;q&#333;&#183;w&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4725.htm">Strong's 4725: </a> </span><span class="str2">A standing, a spot, a condition</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/27-8.htm">Proverbs 27:8 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/27-8.htm">Proverbs 27:8 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/27-8.htm">Proverbs 27:8 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/27-8.htm">Proverbs 27:8 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/27-8.htm">Proverbs 27:8 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/27-8.htm">Proverbs 27:8  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/27-8.htm">Proverbs 27:8 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/27-8.htm">Proverbs 27:8 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/27-8.htm">Proverbs 27:8 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/27-8.htm">Proverbs 27:8 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/27-8.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 27:8 As a bird that wanders from her (Prov.
