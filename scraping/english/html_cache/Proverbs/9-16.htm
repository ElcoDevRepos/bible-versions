The invitation is reminiscent of the call of Lady Wisdom earlier in <a href="/proverbs/9.htm">Proverbs 9</a>, highlighting the contrast between wisdom and folly. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the "simple" were those who had not yet committed to a path of wisdom or folly, making them susceptible to influence. This call is an appeal to those who are undecided, urging them to choose a path. The phrase echoes the broader biblical theme of choosing between two paths, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>, where the Israelites are urged to choose life over death.<p><b>She says to him who lacks judgment.</b><br>The speaker here is personified folly, contrasting with Lady Wisdom. The "lack of judgment" refers to a deficiency in discernment and understanding, a common theme in Proverbs where wisdom is equated with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). This lack of judgment makes individuals vulnerable to deception and poor choices. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a high value on wisdom as a means of living a righteous and prosperous life, aligning with God's covenantal laws. The call to those who lack judgment is a warning about the dangers of ignoring wisdom, which is a recurring theme throughout the wisdom literature. This phrase also connects to the New Testament, where Jesus is described as the embodiment of wisdom (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>), offering true discernment and understanding to those who follow Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_simple.htm">The Simple</a></b><br>In the context of Proverbs, the "simple" refers to those who are naive or inexperienced, lacking wisdom and discernment.
