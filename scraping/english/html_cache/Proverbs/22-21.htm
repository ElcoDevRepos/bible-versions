In the biblical context, truth is a central theme, as seen in <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a> where Jesus declares Himself as "the way, the truth, and the life." The Hebrew culture highly valued wisdom and truth, often associating them with divine revelation. The words "true and reliable" suggest a standard that is consistent with God's character, as God is often described as faithful and unchanging (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>). The pursuit of truth is a recurring theme in Proverbs, where wisdom is personified and depicted as calling out to those who seek understanding (<a href="/proverbs/8.htm">Proverbs 8:1-4</a>).<p><b>that you may soundly answer</b><br>The ability to provide a sound answer is linked to wisdom and understanding. In <a href="/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>, believers are encouraged to always be prepared to give an answer for their hope. This reflects a broader biblical principle of being equipped with knowledge and wisdom to respond appropriately in various situations. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a high value on the spoken word, and being able to articulate one's beliefs and understanding was crucial. This phrase underscores the importance of being grounded in truth to effectively communicate and defend one's faith.<p><b>those who sent you?</b><br>This phrase implies a sense of responsibility and accountability to others. In the historical context, messengers were often sent on behalf of a king or leader, and their words carried the authority of the one who sent them. Similarly, Christians are seen as ambassadors for Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a>), tasked with representing Him and His message to the world. The idea of being sent also connects to the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where Jesus sends His disciples to make disciples of all nations. This phrase highlights the importance of being faithful and accurate in conveying the message entrusted to us.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom. His writings often focus on imparting wisdom and understanding.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom much of the wisdom literature, including Proverbs, was originally addressed. The cultural and religious context of Israel is crucial for understanding the text.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wise.htm">The Wise</a></b><br>A general term for those who seek and apply wisdom in their lives, often highlighted in Proverbs as models for behavior.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_truth.htm">The Importance of Truth</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to seek and speak truth. <a href="/proverbs/22-21.htm">Proverbs 22:21</a> emphasizes the value of true and reliable words, which are foundational for a life of integrity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparedness_to_answer.htm">Preparedness to Answer</a></b><br>The verse highlights the need to be ready to provide sound answers.
