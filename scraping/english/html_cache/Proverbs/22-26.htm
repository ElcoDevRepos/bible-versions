This practice is cautioned against in the wisdom literature, as it can lead to financial ruin and loss of personal freedom. The Bible frequently warns against becoming entangled in financial obligations that one cannot fulfill (<a href="/proverbs/6.htm">Proverbs 6:1-5</a>). The cultural context of the time emphasized community and familial responsibility, and failing to meet a pledge could bring shame not only to the individual but also to their family. This advice aligns with the broader biblical principle of living within one's means and avoiding unnecessary debt (<a href="/romans/13-8.htm">Romans 13:8</a>).<p><b>who puts up security for debts</b><br>Putting up security for debts refers to the act of guaranteeing someone else's loan, which could result in severe consequences if the borrower defaults. In the historical context, this could lead to the loss of property or even enslavement. The Bible consistently advises against such financial entanglements (<a href="/proverbs/11-15.htm">Proverbs 11:15</a>), as they can lead to personal and familial hardship. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to be wise stewards of their resources (<a href="/luke/14-28.htm">Luke 14:28-30</a>). The underlying message is one of prudence and responsibility, urging individuals to avoid financial commitments that could jeopardize their well-being and that of their dependents.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
