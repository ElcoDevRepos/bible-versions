This phrase emphasizes the inherent dignity and worth of every person, as all are made in the image of God (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>). The poor, often marginalized in society, are under God's special care and protection, as seen in numerous scriptures (e.g., <a href="/psalms/12-5.htm">Psalm 12:5</a>, <a href="/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>). The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a strong emphasis on community and mutual support, and mocking the poor would disrupt this social harmony. The biblical law provided for the poor through gleaning laws (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>) and the Year of Jubilee (Leviticus 25), reflecting God's heart for justice and provision. This phrase also connects to the teachings of Jesus, who identified with the poor and marginalized (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>).<p><b>whoever gloats over calamity will not go unpunished.</b><br>Gloating over another's misfortune reveals a heart lacking compassion and empathy, qualities highly valued in biblical teaching. The historical context of the Proverbs often addresses the moral and ethical behavior expected within the community of God's people. This phrase warns against schadenfreude, the pleasure derived from another's suffering, which is contrary to the love and mercy God desires (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). The principle of divine justice is evident here, as God promises that such attitudes will not escape His notice or judgment. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that God is just and will hold individuals accountable for their actions (<a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6-8</a>). The warning serves as a reminder of the eventual divine retribution for those who take pleasure in the downfall of others, echoing the sentiment found in <a href="/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12-13</a>, where Edom is condemned for rejoicing over Israel's calamity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor.htm">The Poor</a></b><br>Individuals who are economically disadvantaged or lacking in resources.

When James confronts believers for showing partiality, he says, &#8220;You have dishonored the poor&#8221; (<a href="/james/2-6.htm">James 2:6</a>), echoing this proverb&#8217;s warning.<p>&#8226; Jesus identifies Himself so closely with the needy that He says, &#8220;Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did for Me&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>). Mocking the poor therefore rejects Christ Himself.<p>&#8226; Scripture insists that poverty is no grounds for contempt; God&#8217;s law protected the vulnerable with gleaning rights (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>) and debt release (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a>).

Mockery questions His wisdom in assigning earthly resources.<p>&#8226; Job refuses such arrogance, asking, &#8220;Did not He who made me in the womb make them?&#8221; (<a href="/job/31-15.htm">Job 31:15</a>). Recognizing a common Maker demolishes superiority.<p>&#8226; By insulting the Creator, the mocker steps into rebellion against the sovereign God who &#8220;gives everyone life and breath and everything else&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-25.htm">Acts 17:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whoever gloats over calamity</b><p>&#8226; Schadenfreude&#8212;taking pleasure when someone else suffers&#8212;violates love of neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Obadiah condemns Edom for rejoicing when Jerusalem fell: &#8220;You should not gloat over your brother&#8217;s day of calamity&#8221; (<a href="/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12</a>).<p>&#8226; When enemies fell, David prayed, &#8220;I mourned as one would for a friend&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/35-13.htm">Psalm 35:13-14</a>), modeling compassion instead of gloating.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will not go unpunished</b><p>&#8226; Every slight against the defenseless invites divine justice: &#8220;Do not exploit the poor&#8230; for the LORD will take up their case&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/22-22.htm">Proverbs 22:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s response may be temporal discipline or final judgment, but it is certain. Paul warns, &#8220;God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, he will reap&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The cross itself shows both justice and mercy: Christ bore punishment for those who repent, yet unrepentant mockers face accountability (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Mocking poverty or celebrating disaster despises the God who lovingly crafts every person and governs every circumstance.

The particular calamity primarily intended seems to be that which reduces a person to poverty. Delight in others' misfortunes, even those of enemies, is a most detestable form of selfishness and malice. Job, testifying to his own integrity, was thankful to think that he was free from this vice (<a href="/job/31-29.htm">Job 31:29</a>).
