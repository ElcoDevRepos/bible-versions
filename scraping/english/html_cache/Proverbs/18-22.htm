The act of finding a wife implies a pursuit and a choice, reflecting the cultural practices of arranged marriages in ancient Israel, where families often played a significant role in the selection process. The phrase suggests intentionality and discernment in seeking a life partner, aligning with the wisdom literature's emphasis on making prudent choices.<p><b>finds a good thing</b><br>The term "good thing" underscores the value and blessing of a marital relationship. In Hebrew, "good" (&#1496;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;, tov) often denotes something beneficial, pleasing, or morally excellent. This aligns with the creation narrative where God declares His creation "good" (Genesis 1). The goodness of a wife is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>, which describes the virtuous woman whose worth is far above rubies. The phrase suggests that a wife contributes positively to a man's life, bringing companionship, support, and partnership.<p><b>and obtains favor from the LORD</b><br>The concept of obtaining favor from the LORD indicates divine approval and blessing. In the Old Testament, favor (&#1495;&#1461;&#1503;, chen) is often associated with God's grace and kindness, as seen in the stories of Noah (<a href="/genesis/6-8.htm">Genesis 6:8</a>) and Joseph (<a href="/genesis/39-21.htm">Genesis 39:21</a>). This phrase implies that marriage is not only a social contract but also a spiritual blessing, reflecting God's design and purpose. It suggests that a harmonious marriage aligns with God's will, bringing His favor upon the couple. This favor can be seen as a type of Christ's relationship with the Church, where the union is marked by love, sacrifice, and divine blessing (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-32</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seeker.htm">The Seeker</a></b><br>The verse refers to a man who actively seeks and finds a wife.

Ecclus. 26:1, etc., "Blessed is the man that hath a good wife, for the number of his days shall be double. A virtuous (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) woman rejoiceth her husband, and he shall fulfil the years of his life in peace. A good wife is a good portion which shall be given in the portion of them that fear the Lord." "A good wife," says the Talmud. "is a good gift; she shall be given to a man that feareth God." And again, "God did not make woman from man's head, that she should not rule over him; nor from his feet, that she should not be his slave; but from his side, that she should be near his heart" (Dukes, p. 69). A Greek gnome runs - <p><span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b6;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> The Septuagint and Vulgate here introduce a paragraph which is not in the Hebrew, and only partly in the Syriac. It seems to be a further explanation of the statement in the text, founded on the practice prevalent at the time when the Septuagint Version was composed, which appears to have made divorce a recognized necessity in the case of adultery: "He who casteth away a good a wife casteth away good things; but he who retaineth an adulteress is a fool and impious." The advice of Siracides concerning a wicked wife is austere: "If she go not as thou wouldest have her, cut her off from thy flesh" (Ecclus. 25:26). Nothing is here said about the marriage of divorced persons; but the absolute indissolubility of the marriage bond was never held among the Jews, a certain laxity being allowed because of the hardness of their heart (<a href="/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8</a>, etc.). The original intently of the marriage contract was re-established by Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/18-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He who finds</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4672.htm">Strong's 4672: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come forth to, appear, exist, to attain, find, acquire, to occur, meet, be present</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a wife</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1453;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;i&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><br /><span class="word">finds</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1443;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4672.htm">Strong's 4672: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come forth to, appear, exist, to attain, find, acquire, to occur, meet, be present</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a good thing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2896.htm">Strong's 2896: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pleasant, agreeable, good</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and obtains</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1508;&#1462;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;p&#772;eq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6329.htm">Strong's 6329: </a> </span><span class="str2">To issue, furnish, to secure, to succeed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">favor</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1437;&#1510;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7522.htm">Strong's 7522: </a> </span><span class="str2">Goodwill, favor, acceptance, will</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from the LORD.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/18-22.htm">Proverbs 18:22 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/18-22.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 18:22 Whoever finds a wife finds a good (Prov.
