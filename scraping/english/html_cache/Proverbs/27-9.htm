Oil, particularly olive oil, was used for anointing priests and kings, symbolizing the Holy Spirit's presence and blessing (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). Incense, used in temple rituals (<a href="/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34-38</a>), represented prayers ascending to God (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>). The joy they bring is both literal, due to their pleasant aroma and symbolic, representing spiritual blessings and divine favor. This phrase highlights the sensory and spiritual delight these elements provided, reflecting the joy found in God's presence and blessings.<p><b>and the counsel of a friend is sweetness to the soul</b><br>The counsel of a friend is likened to sweetness, emphasizing the deep, soul-nourishing impact of wise and loving advice. In biblical times, friendship was a covenant relationship, often involving loyalty and mutual support (<a href="/1_samuel/18.htm">1 Samuel 18:1-3</a>). The sweetness here suggests the comfort and encouragement that come from trusted relationships, akin to honey, which is frequently used in Scripture to symbolize delight and wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/16-24.htm">Proverbs 16:24</a>). This phrase underscores the value of godly counsel, which can guide, uplift, and bring joy to one's inner being, much like the refreshing presence of Christ, the ultimate friend and counselor (<a href="/john/15-15.htm">John 15:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

Similarly, perfumes prepared from spices, roses, and aromatic plants were employed; rooms were fumigated, persons were sprinkled with rose water, and incense was applied to the face and beard, as we read (<a href="/daniel/2-46.htm">Daniel 2:46</a>) that Nebuchadnezzar ordered that to Daniel, in recognition of his wisdom, should be offered an oblation and sweet odours (see 'Dick of Bible,' and Kitto, 'Cyclop.,' <span class="accented">voc</span>.

The heat of the climate, the insalubrious character of the houses, the profuse perspiration of the assembled guests, rendered this attention peculiarly acceptable (comp. <a href="/songs/3-6.htm">Song of Solomon 3:6</a>).
