In the context of ancient Israel, women typically did not approach men in public unless there was a specific purpose, often related to commerce or social interaction. The act of a woman coming out to meet a man suggests intentionality and purpose, highlighting the proactive nature of temptation. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of sin seeking out individuals, as seen in <a href="/genesis/4-7.htm">Genesis 4:7</a>, where sin is described as crouching at the door, desiring to have Cain.<p><b>with the attire of a harlot</b><br>The attire mentioned here is significant, as clothing in biblical times often indicated one's social status or occupation. The reference to "the attire of a harlot" suggests clothing that is provocative or designed to attract attention, which would have been easily recognizable in the cultural context of ancient Israel. This attire serves as a metaphor for deception and the superficial allure of sin, drawing parallels to the seductive nature of idolatry and false teachings warned against throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4-5</a>, where Babylon is depicted in luxurious and seductive garments.<p><b>and cunning of heart</b><br>The phrase "cunning of heart" indicates a deeper, more insidious form of deception. In biblical literature, the heart is often seen as the seat of intention and will. The cunning nature of the heart here suggests a deliberate and calculated approach to seduction, echoing the serpent's craftiness in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>. This highlights the theme of inner corruption and the deceitfulness of sin, which is a recurring motif in the wisdom literature of the Bible. The New Testament also warns against being led astray by deceitful desires, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-22.htm">Ephesians 4:22</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>Represents temptation and seduction, often personified in Proverbs as a warning against immorality and unfaithfulness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_young_man.htm">The Young Man</a></b><br>Implied in the context as the one being seduced, symbolizing those who are naive or lacking wisdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_street.htm">The Street</a></b><br>The setting where the encounter takes place, symbolizing the public and often dangerous places where temptation can be encountered.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_attire_of_a_harlot.htm">The Attire of a Harlot</a></b><br>Symbolizes outward appearances that are designed to entice and lead astray.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cunning_of_heart.htm">Cunning of Heart</a></b><br>Indicates deceitfulness and manipulation, highlighting the inner motives that accompany the outward appearance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/guard_your_heart.htm">Guard Your Heart</a></b><br>Be vigilant about what influences your heart and mind.

In <a href="/revelation/17-4.htm">Revelation 17:4</a> the harlot is "arrayed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls;" and in the present case the female is dressed in some conspicuous garments, very different from the sober clothing of the pure and modest.
