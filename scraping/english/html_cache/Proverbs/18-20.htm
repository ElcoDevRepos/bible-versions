In biblical context, words are often seen as seeds that can produce fruit, either good or bad. <a href="/proverbs/12-14.htm">Proverbs 12:14 and 13</a>:2 also highlight the idea that what one speaks can lead to tangible outcomes. The "fruit" here symbolizes the results or consequences of one's speech. In ancient Israel, fruit was a common metaphor for the results of one's actions, reflecting the agrarian society's reliance on agriculture.<p><b>a man&#8217;s belly is filled;</b><br>The "belly" in this context represents one's innermost being or soul, often associated with satisfaction and contentment. In Hebrew culture, the belly or stomach was sometimes seen as the seat of emotions and desires. This phrase suggests that a person's words can lead to personal fulfillment or emptiness, depending on their nature. The imagery of being "filled" implies abundance and satisfaction, akin to the blessings described in <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>.<p><b>with the harvest from his lips</b><br>The term "harvest" indicates the gathering of results from what has been sown, reinforcing the agricultural metaphor. In biblical times, harvest was a critical period that determined survival and prosperity. This phrase suggests that just as a farmer reaps what he sows, so does a person experience the outcomes of their spoken words. The concept of reaping and sowing is a recurring biblical theme, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>.<p><b>he is satisfied.</b><br>Satisfaction here denotes a sense of completeness and fulfillment. In the biblical worldview, true satisfaction comes from aligning one's actions and words with God's wisdom. This satisfaction is not merely physical but also spiritual, reflecting a life lived in accordance with divine principles. The idea of satisfaction through righteous living is echoed in <a href="/psalms/37-4.htm">Psalm 37:4</a>, where delighting in the Lord leads to the fulfillment of one's desires.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_israel.htm">Ancient Israel</a></b><br>- The cultural and historical context in which Proverbs was written, emphasizing wisdom and moral teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wise_man.htm">The Wise Man</a></b><br>- A recurring character in Proverbs, representing those who live according to God's wisdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fool.htm">The Fool</a></b><br>- Another recurring character in Proverbs, representing those who reject wisdom and live foolishly.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_community.htm">The Community</a></b><br>- The audience of Proverbs, including individuals and families seeking to live righteously.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words.htm">The Power of Words</a></b><br>Words have the power to build up or tear down.
