In ancient Israel, hay was a critical resource, especially during the dry season when fresh grass was scarce. The removal of hay signifies preparation and foresight, ensuring that there is sustenance for animals during times when natural resources are not readily available. This practice reflects the biblical principle of stewardship and planning, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-8</a>, where the ant is commended for storing provisions in the summer.<p><b>and new growth appears</b><br>The emergence of new growth symbolizes renewal and the cyclical nature of life. In the biblical context, this can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual renewal and the hope of new beginnings. The idea of new growth is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>, where God promises to do a new thing, making a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert. This phrase can also be seen as a reminder of God's provision and faithfulness, as He ensures that the earth continues to produce and sustain life.<p><b>and the grass from the hills is gathered</b><br>Gathering grass from the hills indicates the practice of utilizing all available resources. In the hilly regions of Israel, grass would grow abundantly and was often used for feeding livestock. This practice underscores the importance of diligence and resourcefulness, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/12-27.htm">Proverbs 12:27</a>, which contrasts the diligent with the lazy. The gathering of grass also reflects the biblical theme of harvest, which is often used as a metaphor for spiritual truths, such as in <a href="/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37-38</a>, where Jesus speaks of the plentiful harvest and the need for laborers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hay.htm">Hay</a></b><br>Represents the old growth or the previous harvest.
