A wise son, therefore, is one who lives according to God's principles, bringing joy to his father. This reflects the cultural importance of family honor in ancient Israel, where a son's actions could significantly impact the family's reputation. The joy mentioned here is not merely emotional but also social and spiritual, as a wise son upholds the family's standing in the community and aligns with God's covenantal promises. This phrase echoes the broader biblical theme of wisdom leading to life and blessing (<a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13-18</a>).<p><b>but a foolish man despises his mother</b><br>Foolishness in Proverbs is often equated with moral and spiritual folly, not just a lack of intelligence. A foolish man, therefore, acts in ways that are contrary to God's commands, bringing shame and dishonor to his family. In the cultural context of the time, despising one's mother would be seen as a grave offense, as mothers were highly respected figures within the family unit. This phrase highlights the relational and societal consequences of foolishness, contrasting the joy of a wise son with the grief and dishonor brought by a foolish man. The use of "despises" indicates a deep-seated disrespect and rejection of parental guidance, which is contrary to the biblical command to honor one's parents (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). This reflects the broader biblical narrative where rebellion against parental authority often symbolizes rebellion against God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wise_son.htm">Wise Son</a></b><br>Represents an individual who lives according to God's wisdom, making choices that honor and bring joy to their parents.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/father.htm">Father</a></b><br>Symbolizes authority, guidance, and the joy that comes from seeing one's children walk in wisdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/foolish_man.htm">Foolish Man</a></b><br>Represents someone who rejects wisdom and understanding, leading to actions that bring shame and dishonor.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mother.htm">Mother</a></b><br>Represents nurturing, care, and the emotional pain experienced when a child acts foolishly.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_wisdom.htm">The Value of Wisdom</a></b><br>Wisdom is not just intellectual but practical, impacting family relationships and bringing joy to those we love.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/parental_joy_and_sorrow.htm">Parental Joy and Sorrow</a></b><br>Our actions have a profound effect on our parents, and living wisely can be a source of great joy to them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_foolishness.htm">The Consequences of Foolishness</a></b><br>Foolishness leads to a breakdown in family relationships and dishonors those who have nurtured us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/honoring_parents.htm">Honoring Parents</a></b><br>Living a life that honors God is a way to honor our parents, fulfilling the biblical command to respect and cherish them.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_god's_wisdom.htm">Reflecting God's Wisdom</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to reflect God's wisdom in our daily lives, impacting those around us positively.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Proverbs_15_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Proverbs 15:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Ways_to_honor_parents_per_Proverbs_15_20.htm">How can we honor our parents as Proverbs 15:20 instructs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_15_20_on_wisdom_in_family_ties.htm">What does Proverbs 15:20 reveal about wisdom's impact on family relationships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Proverbs_15_20_to_Exodus_20_12.htm">How does Proverbs 15:20 connect with the Fifth Commandment in Exodus 20:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_foolishness_grieve_a_mother.htm">In what ways can foolishness bring "grief" to a mother, as stated in Proverbs 15:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Proverbs_15_20_with_parents_daily.htm">How can we apply Proverbs 15:20 in daily interactions with our parents?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_15_20_on_family_wisdom_foolishness.htm">How does Proverbs 15:20 define wisdom and foolishness in family relationships?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Cultural_influences_on_Proverbs_15_20.htm">What cultural context influenced the writing of Proverbs 15:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_15_20_and_honoring_parents.htm">How does Proverbs 15:20 relate to honoring one's parents?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_proverbs_15.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Proverbs 15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_folly.htm">What does the Bible say about foolishness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_busybodies.htm">What does the Bible say about busybodies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_respecting_parents.htm">What does the Bible say about respecting parents?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_child_marriage.htm">What does Proverbs 1:7 mean by 'fools despise wisdom'?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Proverbs 15:20 Mean</div><b>a wise son</b><p>&#8226;
