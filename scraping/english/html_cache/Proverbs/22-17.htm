In the biblical context, wisdom is often personified and is seen as a divine attribute. The call to "incline your ear" suggests a deliberate effort to pay attention, similar to the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, which calls for Israel to hear and obey. The "words of the wise" can be understood as teachings that align with God's truth, often associated with the wisdom literature of the Bible, such as Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Job. Historically, wisdom was highly valued in ancient Near Eastern cultures, and the wise were often sought for counsel. This phrase encourages the reader to seek out and heed the counsel of those who possess godly wisdom.<p><b>apply your mind to my knowledge&#8212;</b><br>This part of the verse calls for an active engagement of the intellect and heart with the teachings being presented. The term "apply" suggests a diligent and intentional effort to understand and internalize knowledge. In the biblical sense, knowledge is not merely intellectual but is deeply connected to living in accordance with God's will. This aligns with the biblical theme that true understanding comes from God (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>). The phrase "my knowledge" indicates a personal impartation of wisdom, possibly from a teacher or a father figure, reflecting the traditional method of passing down wisdom through generations. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate source of divine knowledge and wisdom, as referenced in <a href="/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>, where it states that in Christ "are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
