In ancient agrarian societies, plowing was a critical task that had to be done at the right time to ensure a successful harvest. The "slacker" represents a person who neglects their responsibilities, failing to prepare when the opportunity is present. This concept is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-11</a>, where the ant is praised for its industriousness and foresight. The biblical principle of sowing and reaping is evident here, emphasizing that neglecting one's duties leads to inevitable consequences. The idea of seasons is also significant, as it reflects the natural order established by God, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1-8</a>, where there is a time for every activity under heaven.<p><b>at harvest time he looks,</b><br>The act of looking at harvest time implies expectation and hope for a return on investment. However, for the slacker, this expectation is unfounded due to their earlier negligence. This serves as a warning against procrastination and laziness, which are condemned throughout Scripture. In the New Testament, Jesus uses agricultural metaphors to teach about spiritual readiness and the Kingdom of God, such as in the Parable of the Sower (<a href="/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13:1-23</a>). The principle of being prepared and vigilant is also seen in the Parable of the Ten Virgins (<a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>), where those who were not ready missed the bridegroom's arrival.<p><b>but nothing is there.</b><br>The outcome of the slacker's inaction is barrenness and lack. This phrase underscores the biblical truth that actions have consequences, a theme prevalent throughout Proverbs. The absence of a harvest serves as a metaphor for spiritual and material poverty resulting from laziness. In the broader biblical narrative, this can be connected to the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>), where the servant who did nothing with his talent faced judgment. The concept of reaping what one sows is a universal biblical principle, as stated in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>, where Paul warns that those who sow to please their flesh will reap destruction. This phrase serves as a sobering reminder of the importance of diligence and the futility of expecting results without effort.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sluggard.htm">The Sluggard</a></b><br>A recurring character in Proverbs, representing laziness and a lack of diligence.

The verse assumes a literal farming rhythm in ancient Israel, yet its principle reaches into every vocation.<p>&#8226; God has woven seasons into creation (<a href="/genesis/8-22.htm">Genesis 8:22</a>), and obedience means matching our efforts to those seasons. Ignoring the plowing season is not merely poor planning; it is disobedience to the Creator&#8217;s design.<p>&#8226; Proverbs regularly spotlights the diligent ant (<a href="/proverbs/6-6.htm">Proverbs 6:6-8</a>) and the wise son who gathers in summer (<a href="/proverbs/10-5.htm">Proverbs 10:5</a>). By contrast, the slacker overlooks the time window God assigns for sowing, hoping somehow to reap without planting (<a href="/ecclesiastes/11-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:4</a>).<p>&#8226; In kingdom terms, plowing applies to spiritual disciplines as well&#8212;time in Scripture, prayer, service, and generosity (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-6.htm">2 Timothy 2:6</a>). Those unwilling to cultivate their hearts will find no spiritual harvest later.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>At harvest time he looks, but nothing is there</b><p>&#8220; at harvest time he looks, but nothing is there &#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/20-4.htm">Proverbs 20:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Harvest pictures the moment of accountability, when hidden efforts (or lack of them) become visible. <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a> echoes the same law: &#8220;whatever a man sows, he will reap.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The slacker&#8217;s empty field is not chance; it is the righteous outcome God promised. <a href="/proverbs/13-4.htm">Proverbs 13:4</a> says, &#8220;The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing, but the soul of the diligent is fully satisfied.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Materially, laziness impoverishes (<a href="/proverbs/10-4.htm">Proverbs 10:4</a>); spiritually, it leaves believers barren of reward (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13-15</a>). Jesus&#8217; parable of the talents ends with the unprofitable servant losing even what he thought he had (<a href="/matthew/25-26.htm">Matthew 25:26-30</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;he looks&#8221; underscores false optimism. He expects blessing detached from obedience, mirroring those who call Jesus &#8220;Lord&#8221; yet do not do what He says (<a href="/luke/6-46.htm">Luke 6:46</a>). God&#8217;s economy does not honor wishful thinking, only faithful labor (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/20-4.htm">Proverbs 20:4</a> draws a straight line between work in the proper season and blessing in the appointed harvest. The diligent align themselves with God&#8217;s rhythms, laboring when it is time to plow; the slacker ignores those rhythms and later finds his hopes unmet. The verse urges practical diligence and faithful obedience today, confident that God Himself guarantees the harvest to those who sow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sluggard will not plough by reason of the cold;</span> <span class="accented">propter frigus</span>, Vulgate. But <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;</span> (<span class="accented">choreph</span>) denotes the time of gathering - the autumn; so we would translate, "At the time of harvest the sluggard ploughs not" - just when the ground is most easily and profitably worked. "The weakness of the coulter and other parts of the plough requires that advantage be taken, in all but the most friable soils, of the softening of the surface by the winter or spring rains; so that the peasant, if industrious, has to plough in the winter, though sluggards still shrink from its cold, and have to beg in the harvest" (Geikie, 'Holy Land and Bible,' 2:491). <span class="cmt_word">Therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.</span> So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Mendicabit ergo aestate, et non dabitur illi.</span> But this does not accurately represent the meaning of the clause. If ever the prosperous are disposed to relieve the needy, it would be at the time when they have safely garnered their produce; an appeal to their charity at such a moment would not be made in vain. Rather the sentence signifies that the lazy man, having neglected to have his land ploughed at the proper time, "when he asks (for his fruits) at harvest time, there is nothing." He puts off tilling his fields day after day, or never looks to see if his labourers do their duty, and so his land is not cultivated, and he has no crop to reap when autumn comes. "By the street of By-and-by one arrives at the house of Never" (Spanish proverb). Taking a different interpretation of the word <span class="accented">choreph</span>, the LXX. renders, "Being reproached, the sluggard is not ashamed, no more than he who borrows corn in harvest." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/20-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The sluggard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1510;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6102.htm">Strong's 6102: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sluggish, lazy</span><br /><br /><span class="word">does not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">plow</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1425;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#333;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2790.htm">Strong's 2790: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cut in, engrave, plow, devise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in season;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1453;&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;&#1462;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;rep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2779.htm">Strong's 2779: </a> </span><span class="str2">The crop gathered, the autumn, season, ripeness of age</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at harvest time</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1464;&#1510;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(baq&#183;q&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7105.htm">Strong's 7105: </a> </span><span class="str2">Severed, harvest, the crop, the time, the reaper, a limb</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he looks,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7592.htm">Strong's 7592: </a> </span><span class="str2">To inquire, to request, to demand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but nothing is there.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1469;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;yin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_369.htm">Strong's 369: </a> </span><span class="str2">A non-entity, a negative particle</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/20-4.htm">Proverbs 20:4 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/20-4.htm">Proverbs 20:4 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/20-4.htm">Proverbs 20:4 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/20-4.htm">Proverbs 20:4 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/20-4.htm">Proverbs 20:4 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/20-4.htm">Proverbs 20:4  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/20-4.htm">Proverbs 20:4 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/20-4.htm">Proverbs 20:4 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/20-4.htm">Proverbs 20:4 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/20-4.htm">Proverbs 20:4 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/20-4.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 20:4 The sluggard will not plow by reason (Prov.
