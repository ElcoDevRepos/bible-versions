In biblical times, character was often assessed by one's deeds rather than age or status. The Hebrew culture placed significant value on the reputation and actions of individuals, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God tells Samuel that He looks at the heart rather than outward appearances. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches that a tree is known by its fruit (<a href="/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16-20</a>). The emphasis on actions aligns with the biblical understanding that faith without works is dead (<a href="/james/2-26.htm">James 2:26</a>).<p><b>whether his conduct is pure and upright.</b><br>The terms "pure" and "upright" reflect the moral and ethical standards expected of individuals in the biblical context. Purity often refers to moral cleanliness and integrity, a concept deeply rooted in the Levitical laws, which required the Israelites to be holy as God is holy (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). Uprightness denotes righteousness and adherence to God's commandments, as seen in the lives of figures like Job, who was described as blameless and upright (<a href="/job/1.htm">Job 1:1</a>). This phrase underscores the biblical teaching that true righteousness is demonstrated through one's conduct, aligning with the call to live a life worthy of the gospel (<a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>). The focus on conduct also points to the transformative power of a relationship with God, as seen in the life of Jesus Christ, who perfectly embodied purity and uprightness, setting an example for believers to follow (<a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/y/young_man.htm">Young Man</a></b><br>The term "young man" in this context refers to a youth or child, emphasizing that even at a young age, one's actions reveal character. The Hebrew word used here is "na'ar," which can mean a boy, lad, or youth, indicating someone who is still in the formative stages of life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/actions.htm">Actions</a></b><br>This refers to the deeds or behaviors of the young man. The Hebrew word "ma'aseh" is used, which encompasses work, deeds, or actions, highlighting the importance of what one does.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/conduct.htm">Conduct</a></b><br>This term relates to the manner in which the young man behaves. The Hebrew word "halikah" is used, which means way, path, or conduct, indicating the overall lifestyle or behavior pattern.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/purity_and_uprightness.htm">Purity and Uprightness</a></b><br>These are the qualities by which the young man's actions are judged. "Pure" in Hebrew is "zak," meaning clean or innocent, and "upright" is "yashar," meaning straight or right, emphasizing moral integrity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/character_revealed_through_actions.htm">Character Revealed Through Actions</a></b><br>Our actions are a reflection of our inner character.

(For "even" (<span class="accented">gam</span>), see on Proverbs 17:26.) A child is open, simple, and straightforward in his actions; he has not the reserves and concealments which men practise, so you see by his conduct what his real character and disposition are. Ewald takes <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5d5;</span> in the sense of "play," "games;" but it seems never to have this meaning, and there is no need to change the usual signification. The habits of a life are learned in early age. The boy is father of the man. Delitzsch quotes the German proverbs, "What means to become a hook bends itself early," and "What means to become a thorn sharpens itself early;" and the Aramaean, "That which will become a gourd shows itself in the bud:" <span class="cmt_word">Whether his work be pure</span> ("clean," as ver. 9 and <a href="/proverbs/16-2.htm">Proverbs 16:2</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and whether it be right.</span> His conduct will show thus much, end will help one to prognosticate the future. Septuagint (according to the Vatican), "In his pursuits (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) a young man will be fettered in company with a holy man, and his way will be straight," which seems to mean that a good man will restrain the reckless doings of a giddy youth, and will lead him into better courses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/20-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Even</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(gam)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1571.htm">Strong's 1571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assemblage, also, even, yea, though, both, and</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a young man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1425;&#1506;&#1463;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#8216;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5288.htm">Strong's 5288: </a> </span><span class="str2">A boy, lad, youth, retainer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is known</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#7791;&#183;nak&#183;ker-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5234.htm">Strong's 5234: </a> </span><span class="str2">To regard, recognize</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by his actions&#8212;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1453;&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;ma&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#257;&#183;l&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4611.htm">Strong's 4611: </a> </span><span class="str2">A deed, practice</span><br /><br /><span class="word">whether</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_518.htm">Strong's 518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!, whether?, if, although, Oh that!, when, not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his conduct</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1459;&#1500;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#257;&#183;&#8216;o&#183;l&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6467.htm">Strong's 6467: </a> </span><span class="str2">Doing, deed, work</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is pure</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1463;&#1430;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(za&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2134.htm">Strong's 2134: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pure, clean</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and upright.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3477.htm">Strong's 3477: </a> </span><span class="str2">Straight, right</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/20-11.htm">Proverbs 20:11 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/20-11.htm">Proverbs 20:11 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/20-11.htm">Proverbs 20:11 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/20-11.htm">Proverbs 20:11 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/20-11.htm">Proverbs 20:11 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/20-11.htm">Proverbs 20:11  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/20-11.htm">Proverbs 20:11 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/20-11.htm">Proverbs 20:11 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/20-11.htm">Proverbs 20:11 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/20-11.htm">Proverbs 20:11 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/20-11.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 20:11 Even a child makes himself known (Prov.
