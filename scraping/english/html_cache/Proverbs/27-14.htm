In ancient Israel, blessings were significant and carried spiritual weight. However, the manner of blessing here is noteworthy&#8212;done with a "loud voice." This could imply insincerity or a lack of consideration for the neighbor's circumstances. The Bible often emphasizes the importance of the heart's intent over outward actions (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). The loudness may suggest a desire for attention or self-promotion, contrasting with the humility and sincerity expected in true acts of blessing.<p><b>early in the morning</b><br>The timing of the blessing is crucial. In ancient cultures, mornings were typically quiet, a time for personal reflection or preparation for the day. Disturbing this peace with a loud blessing could be seen as inconsiderate. Proverbs often contrasts wisdom with folly, and this timing suggests a lack of wisdom or discernment. The early morning setting also connects to other scriptures that emphasize the importance of timing and appropriateness in actions (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>).<p><b>it will be counted to him as a curse</b><br>The outcome of the action is paradoxical. Instead of being received as a blessing, it is perceived as a curse. This reflects the biblical principle that the manner and intent behind actions can alter their impact (<a href="/matthew/6.htm">Matthew 6:1-4</a>). The cultural context of honor and shame in ancient societies means that actions perceived as inconsiderate or self-serving could bring dishonor rather than the intended goodwill. This phrase serves as a warning about the consequences of thoughtless actions, aligning with the broader biblical theme of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_neighbor.htm">The Neighbor</a></b><br>Represents any person with whom one has a relationship, emphasizing the importance of social interactions and community living.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blesser.htm">The Blesser</a></b><br>The individual who offers a blessing, highlighting the intention behind actions and words.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_morning.htm">The Morning</a></b><br>A time of day symbolizing new beginnings, but also a time when people may not be ready for loud interactions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_curse.htm">The Curse</a></b><br>The unintended negative consequence of what was meant to be a positive action, illustrating the importance of timing and sensitivity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_timing.htm">The Importance of Timing</a></b><br>Just as there is a time for everything, our actions and words must be appropriately timed to be effective and well-received.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/sensitivity_to_others.htm">Sensitivity to Others</a></b><br>We must be considerate of others' circumstances and states of mind, ensuring our actions are beneficial rather than burdensome.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/sincerity_in_actions.htm">Sincerity in Actions</a></b><br>Our intentions should be genuine, not for show or self-promotion, as insincerity can lead to misunderstanding and resentment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words.htm">The Power of Words</a></b><br>Words have the power to build up or tear down;

Genuine, heartfelt affirmation refreshes relationships and mirrors God&#8217;s own kindness (<a href="/james/3-9.htm">James 3:9-10</a>). The verse therefore assumes something good on the surface: words of goodwill toward a neighbor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With a loud voice</b><p>The manner quickly becomes suspect: &#8220;with a loud voice.&#8221; Volume here pictures showiness and self-promotion rather than sincere goodwill. Jesus warned against public displays done &#8220;to be seen by men&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1-2</a>). Paul wrote that love without the right spirit sounds like &#8220;a clanging cymbal&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-1.htm">1 Corinthians 13:1</a>).

A man who is so eager to express his thanks that he begins early in the morning, and in so loud a voice as to draw upon his patron the attention of all the bystanders, is looked upon as a nuisance; any one would as soon be cursed as blessed by him. So God loves heartfelt gratitude offered in secret. (Comp. <a href="/context/matthew/6-5.htm" title="And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:5-6</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning.</span> What is meant is ostentatious salutation, which puts itself forward in order to stand well with a patron, and to be beforehand with other servile competitors for favour. Juvenal satirized such parasitical effusion ('Sat.' 5:19) - <p><span class="foreign">"Habet Trebius, propter quod rumpere somnum<br />Debeat et ligulas dimittere, sollicitus, ne<br />Tots salutaris jam turba peregerit orbem,<br />Sideribus dubiis, aut illo tempore, quo se<br />Frigida circumagunt pigri surraca Bootae."</span> The "loud voice" intimates the importunate nature of such public trumpeting of gratitude, as the "rising early" denotes its inopportune and tactless insistency, which cannot wait for a convenient opportunity for its due expression. It shall be counted a curse to him. The receiver of this sordid adulation, and indeed all the bystanders, would just as soon be cursed by the parasite as blessed in this offensive manner, This clamorous outpouring of gratitude is not accepted as a return by the benefactor; he sees the mean motives by which it is dictated self-interest, hope of future benefits - and he holds it as cheap as he would the curses of such a person. The nuisance of such flattery is mentioned by Euripides, 'Orest.,' 1161 - <p><span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;</span><br /><span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>. Duo sunt genera prosecutorum, says St. Augustine ('In Psalm.,' 69), "sciliet vituperantium et adulantium; sed plus prosequitur lingua adulatoris, quam manus prosecutoris." "Woe unto you," said Christ (<a href="/luke/6-26.htm">Luke 6:26</a>), "when all men shall speak well of you." "Do I seek to please men?" asked St. Paul (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>); "for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ."
