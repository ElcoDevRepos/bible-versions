These offerings were meant to express gratitude, fulfill a vow, or symbolize fellowship with God. The peace offering was unique because it was shared between the altar, the priests, and the offerer, symbolizing communion. In the context of <a href="/proverbs/7.htm">Proverbs 7</a>, the mention of peace offerings may indicate a superficial or hypocritical use of religious rituals to mask immoral intentions. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God desires genuine obedience over ritualistic sacrifice (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>).<p><b>today I have paid my vows.</b><br>Paying vows was a serious commitment in ancient Israel, often involving a promise made to God in exchange for His favor or blessing. <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a> warns about the importance of fulfilling vows made to God. In <a href="/proverbs/7.htm">Proverbs 7</a>, the mention of paying vows could imply a false sense of security or righteousness, suggesting that the woman uses religious observance to justify or conceal her immoral behavior. This reflects the danger of using religious acts as a cover for sin, a theme echoed in the New Testament when Jesus criticizes the Pharisees for their hypocrisy (<a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_adulterous_woman.htm">The Adulterous Woman</a></b><br>In <a href="/bsb/proverbs/7.htm">Proverbs 7</a>, the speaker describes an encounter with a seductive woman who represents temptation and folly.

By claiming she has just offered one, the woman in <a href="/bsb/proverbs/7.htm">Proverbs 7</a> is implying spiritual respectability.<p>&#8226; She casts herself as freshly &#8220;right with God,&#8221; masking her true intent. This echoes how false teachers &#8220;come to you in sheep&#8217;s clothing&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The aroma of the peace offering symbolized communion with the LORD, yet here that sacred act becomes a lure. Just as <a href="/2_timothy/3-5.htm">2 Timothy 3:5</a> warns of &#8220;a form of godliness but denying its power,&#8221; her ritual is emptied of genuine devotion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>today I have paid my vows</b><p>&#8226; Vows were voluntary promises to God, but once spoken they had to be fulfilled promptly (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-21.htm">Deuteronomy 23:21</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>). She claims punctual obedience, suggesting heightened piety.<p>&#8226; The emphasis on &#8220;today&#8221; adds urgency: &#8220;I&#8217;m spiritually clean right now, so come celebrate with me.&#8221; This parallels <a href="/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a>&#8212;&#8220;Sacrifice a thank offering to God, and fulfill your vows to the Most High&#8221;&#8212;words she twists for selfish gain.<p>&#8226; Her tactic shows how sin often piggybacks on recent religious activity. <a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a> cautions, &#8220;So the one who thinks he is standing firm should be careful not to fall,&#8221; because external rites never guarantee heart purity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/7-14.htm">Proverbs 7:14</a> exposes the seductress&#8217;s strategy: cloak temptation in the language of worship. She flaunts recent peace offerings and vow payments to appear devout, yet her goal is moral ruin. The verse warns that genuine faith is measured not by religious performance but by obedience that flows from a sincere heart (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-27</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">I have peace offerings with me.--</span>Rather, <span class= "ital">upon me, i.e., </span>I had vowed them, and to-day I have accomplished my vow. The peace-, or thank-offering as it is also rendered, was purely voluntary, in token of thanksgiving for some mercy. The breast and right shoulder of the victim were given to the priest, and the rest belonged to the offerer, who was thus admitted, as it were, to feast with God (Leviticus 3, 7), profanation of this privilege being punished with death. Peace-offerings were accordingly offered on occasions of national rejoicing, as at the inauguration of the covenant (<a href="/exodus/24-5.htm" title="And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the LORD.">Exodus 24:5</a>), at the accession of Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/11-15.htm" title="And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.">1Samuel 11:15</a>), and at the bringing up of the ark to Zion (<a href="/2_samuel/6-17.htm" title="And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the middle of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.">2Samuel 6:17</a>), &c. This turning of what should have been a religious festival for the family into an occasion for license, is paralleled by the desecration of the Agapae at Corinth (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.">1Corinthians 11:20</a> <span class= "ital">sqq.</span>) and the history of Church-feasts among ourselves. (For the spiritual interpretation of this passage as symbolising false doctrine, see Bishop Wordsworth; and also Notes on <a href="/context/proverbs/2-16.htm" title="To deliver you from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flatters with her words;">Proverbs 2:16-19</a> above.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - I have <span class="cmt_word">peace offerings with me.</span> <span class="accented">Shelamim</span>, "peace or thank offerings," were divided between Jehovah, the priests, and the offerer. Part of the appointed victim was consumed by fire; the breast and right shoulder were allotted to the priests; and the rest of the animal belonged to the person who made the offering, who was to eat it with his household on the same day as a solemn ceremonial feast (<a href="/leviticus/3.htm">Leviticus 3</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7.htm">Leviticus 7</a>). The adulteress says that certain offerings were due from her, and she had duly made them. <span class="cmt_word">This day have I payed my vows.</span> And now (the day being reckoned from one night to the next) the feast was ready, and she invites her paramour to share it. The religious nature of the feast is utterly ignored or forgotten. The shameless woman uses the opportunity simply as a convenience for her sin. If, as is probable, the "strange woman" is a foreigner, she is one who only outwardly conforms to the Mosaic Law, but in her heart cleaves to the impure worship of her heathen hems And doubtless, in lax times, these religious festivals, even in the case of worshippers who were not influenced by idolatrous proclivities, degenerated into self-indulgence and excess. The early Christian agapae were thus misused (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-20.htm">1 Corinthians 11:20</a>, etc.); and in modern times religious anniversaries have too often become occasions of licence and debauchery, their solemn origin and pious uses being entirely thrust aside. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/7-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;I have made my peace</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8002.htm">Strong's 8002: </a> </span><span class="str2">A sacrifice for alliance or friendship, peace offering</span><br /><br /><span class="word">offerings;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1495;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(zi&#7687;&#183;&#7717;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2077.htm">Strong's 2077: </a> </span><span class="str2">A slaughter, the flesh of an animal, a sacrifice</span><br /><br /><span class="word">today</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1437;&#1497;&#1468;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have paid</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1502;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;il&#183;lam&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7999.htm">Strong's 7999: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be safe, to be, completed, to be friendly, to reciprocate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my vows.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1469;&#1497;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;r&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5088.htm">Strong's 5088: </a> </span><span class="str2">A promise, a thing promised</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/7-14.htm">Proverbs 7:14 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/7-14.htm">Proverbs 7:14 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/7-14.htm">Proverbs 7:14 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/7-14.htm">Proverbs 7:14 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/7-14.htm">Proverbs 7:14 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/7-14.htm">Proverbs 7:14  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/7-14.htm">Proverbs 7:14 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/7-14.htm">Proverbs 7:14 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/7-14.htm">Proverbs 7:14 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/7-14.htm">Proverbs 7:14 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/7-14.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 7:14 Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me (Prov.
