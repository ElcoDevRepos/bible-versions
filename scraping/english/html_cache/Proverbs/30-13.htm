In biblical context, "generation" often refers to a group of people living at the same time, but it can also imply a type of people with shared characteristics. This echoes the recurring theme in Proverbs of contrasting the wise and the foolish. The term "generation" can also be seen in other scriptures, such as in <a href="/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39</a>, where Jesus refers to a "wicked and adulterous generation," highlighting a pattern of behavior that is contrary to God's ways.<p><b>how haughty are their eyes</b><br>Haughtiness, or pride, is a significant theme throughout the Bible, often associated with a rejection of God and His commandments. The eyes are frequently used metaphorically to represent one's perspective or attitude. In <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-17</a>, haughty eyes are listed among the things the Lord detests. This phrase suggests an arrogance that elevates oneself above others, contrary to the humility that is a hallmark of godly wisdom. The cultural context of the ancient Near East often viewed pride as a precursor to downfall, as seen in the story of King Nebuchadnezzar in <a href="/daniel/4.htm">Daniel 4</a>.<p><b>and pretentious are their glances&#8212;</b><br>Pretentiousness implies a false display of importance or worth. This behavior is condemned in scripture as it often leads to deceit and hypocrisy. The glances, like the eyes, symbolize one's outlook and interactions with others. In the New Testament, Jesus warns against such hypocrisy in <a href="/matthew/23-5.htm">Matthew 23:5-7</a>, where the Pharisees are criticized for their outward displays of piety that mask inner corruption. This phrase serves as a warning against superficiality and the dangers of valuing appearance over substance, a theme that resonates throughout biblical teachings on integrity and authenticity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/agur.htm">Agur</a></b><br>The author of <a href="/bsb/proverbs/30.htm">Proverbs 30</a>, Agur son of Jakeh, is a figure about whom little is known.
