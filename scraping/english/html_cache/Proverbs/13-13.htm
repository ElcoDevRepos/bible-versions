The Hebrew word for "despises" implies a strong rejection or disdain. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, instruction was often given by elders, parents, or teachers, and rejecting it was seen as foolishness. The "penalty" refers to the natural consequences of ignoring wise counsel, which can lead to personal and communal harm. This concept is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, where the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. Historically, the Israelites were often warned by prophets to heed God's instructions, and their failure to do so led to exile and suffering.<p><b>but the one who respects a command will be rewarded</b><br>Respecting a command involves not just hearing but also obeying. The Hebrew term for "respects" suggests reverence and careful attention. In biblical times, obedience to God's commands was seen as a path to blessing and prosperity, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. The promise of reward for obedience is a consistent biblical theme, seen in the lives of figures like Abraham, who was blessed for his faithfulness. This principle is also reflected in the New Testament, where Jesus emphasizes the importance of keeping His commandments as a demonstration of love for Him (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). The ultimate reward for obedience is eternal life, as promised in the gospel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

He who despises and neglects this word "brings on himself destruction." Many good authorities take the latter verb in another sense, "is pledged by it;" as Revised Version in margin, "maketh himself a debtor thereto," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> is still bound to fulfil his obligations to it; he cannot escape duty by ignoring or despising it, but is pledged to do it, and will suffer for its neglect. Hence Christ's injunction to agree with our adversary quickly while we are in the way with him (<a href="/matthew/5-25.htm">Matthew 5:25</a>). Vulgate, "He who disparages (<span class="accented">detrahit</span>) anything binds himself for the future." Septuagint, "He who despises a thing (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, 'a command') shall be despised by it." <span class="accented">Virtus se contemnentem contemnit. <span class="cmt_word"></span>He that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded</span> (<a href="/proverbs/11-31.htm">Proverbs 11:31</a>). The Vulgate rendering, "shall live in peace," and that of the Septuagint, "shall be healthful," are not so suitable. The "fearing the commandment" implies obedience to it; and reward is considered as fully pledged to obedience as punishment is to neglect. The Septuagint here adds a distich which Ewald regards as genuine, "Unto a crafty son there shall be nothing good; but to a wise servant all actions shall prosper, and his way shall be guided aright." This is also found in the Vulgate of <a href="/proverbs/14-15.htm">Proverbs 14:15</a>.
