In the biblical context, "counsel" refers to the advice and direction provided by God through His Word and His prophets. The refusal to accept counsel is a recurring theme in the Bible, often leading to negative consequences. For instance, in <a href="/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>, the people are described as not listening or paying attention, but following the stubborn inclinations of their evil hearts. This rejection of counsel is a reflection of human pride and self-reliance, which contrasts with the biblical call to trust in the Lord with all one's heart (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><b>they despised all my reproof.</b><br>"Reproof" refers to correction or rebuke intended to bring about repentance and change. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, reproof was an essential part of maintaining covenant faithfulness. The prophets often delivered reproof to the people, calling them back to obedience to God's laws. Despising reproof indicates a hardened heart and a refusal to acknowledge one's wrongdoing. This attitude is warned against throughout Scripture, as in <a href="/proverbs/12.htm">Proverbs 12:1</a>, which states that whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but whoever hates correction is stupid. The ultimate rejection of reproof is seen in the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, who was despised and rejected by men (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>), yet His sacrifice provides the means for reconciliation and redemption for those who turn back to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
