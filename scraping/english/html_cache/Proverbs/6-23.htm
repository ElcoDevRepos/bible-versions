In ancient times, lamps were essential for navigating the darkness, much like the commandments of God provide moral and spiritual direction. <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a> echoes this sentiment: "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path." The commandment here refers to God's law, which offers wisdom and discernment, helping believers to avoid the pitfalls of sin and error.<p><b>this teaching is a light</b><br>Light in the Bible often represents truth, purity, and the presence of God. The teaching, or Torah, is seen as illuminating the path of righteousness. In <a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>, Jesus declares, "I am the light of the world," indicating that His teachings bring understanding and revelation. The light dispels darkness, symbolizing how divine instruction exposes sin and leads to holiness. This aligns with the cultural understanding of light as essential for life and growth.<p><b>and the reproofs of discipline are the way to life</b><br>Reproofs of discipline refer to correction and instruction that lead to spiritual maturity. In the biblical context, discipline is not merely punitive but is intended for growth and improvement, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a>, which discusses the Lord's discipline as a sign of His love. The "way to life" suggests that accepting correction leads to a fulfilling and righteous life, aligning with the wisdom literature's emphasis on the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). This path to life is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who offers eternal life through His teachings and sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

The servant of God may often feel much perplexity as to his duty, darkness may seem to have settled down upon his path. But there is always some "commandment," or positive order, about which he can have no doubt, calling for his immediate obedience; there is always some "law," or rather "instruction" in God's Word offering itself as his guide; there are always some "reproofs of discipline," that is, he knows he has certain things to shun, others to follow, for the purpose of self-discipline. It is by following out these parts of his duty that he does know, which are, as it were, a "light shining in a dark place "(<a href="/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2Peter 1:19</a>), that man prepares himself for more light and clearer vision; then God "opens his eyes" that he may "behold wondrous things out of His law" (<a href="/psalms/119-18.htm" title="Open you my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law.">Psalm 119:18</a>); because he has some knowledge of God's will and desire to do it, more is given unto him (<a href="/matthew/13-12.htm" title="For whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whoever has not, from him shall be taken away even that he has.">Matthew 13:12</a>), and his path becomes continually clearer, shining "more and more unto the perfect day" (<a href="/proverbs/4-18.htm" title="But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shines more and more to the perfect day.">Proverbs 4:18</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light.</span> The teacher takes up the words "commandment" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">mitzrah</span>) and "law" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">torah</span>) from ver. 20, which he describes respectively as "a lamp" and "light" The "commandment" is any special or particular commandment which harmonizes with God's will, and commands what is to be done and forbids what is to be left undone. The "law" is the whole law of God in its entirety; not here the Law of Moses technically, but the whole system of generalized instruction; They stand, therefore, in the same relation to each other as "a lamp" and "light," the one being particular, and the other general. "Light" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">or</span>) is light in general, as the light of the day and the sun, while "a lamp" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">ner</span>, from <span class="accented">nur</span>, "to shine) is a particular light like that of a candle, which is enkindled at some other source. The "commandment" and the "law" alike enlighten the conscience and enable one to walk in his way of life. On this passage Le Clerc remarks, "Ut in tenebris lucerna, aut fax ostendit nobis, qua eundam sit: in ignorantiae humanae caligine, quae nos per hanc totam vitam cingit, revelatio divina nos docet, quid sit faciendum, quid vitandum." So the psalmist says in <a href="/psalms/19-8.htm">Psalm 19:8</a>, "The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes;" and again in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, "Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they direct and show the true way of faith and life (Gejerus). The "commandment" and the "law" may stand for the whole revelation of God without reference to any particular precept (as Scott), but they have here a specific bearing on a particular form of human conduct, as appears from the following verses. <span class="cmt_word">And reproofs of instruction are the way of life.</span> <span class="accented">Reproofs of instruction</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">tok'khoth musar</span>, disciplinary reproofs, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> reproofs whose object is the discipline of the soul and the moral elevation of the character. The LXX. reads, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>; thus connecting it with education in its highest sense. Such reproofs are a way of life (Hebrew, <span class="accented">derek khayyim</span>)<span class="accented">, i.e.</span> they lead to life; they conduce to the prolongation of life. This view of the subject, so prominent in the mind of the teacher in other passages (cf. <a href="/proverbs/3-2.htm">Proverbs 3:2</a> and 19), must not be lost sight of, though the words are susceptible of another interpretation, as indicating that the severest reproofs, inasmuch as they correct errors and require obedience, conduce to the greatest happiness (Patrick). Or again, it may mean that disciplinary reproofs are necessary to life. The soul to arrive at perfection must undergo them as part of the conditions of its existence, and, consequently, they are to be submitted to with the consciousness that, however irksome they may be, they are imposed for its eventual benefit (cf. <a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5</a>). But this interpretation is unlikely from what follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/6-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this commandment</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1453;&#1510;&#1456;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7779;&#183;w&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4687.htm">Strong's 4687: </a> </span><span class="str2">Commandment</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is a lamp,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5216.htm">Strong's 5216: </a> </span><span class="str2">A lamp, light</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this teaching</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1514;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#333;&#183;w&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8451.htm">Strong's 8451: </a> </span><span class="str2">Direction, instruction, law</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[is] a light,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_216.htm">Strong's 216: </a> </span><span class="str2">Illumination, luminary</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and the reproofs</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1499;&#1456;&#1495;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#333;&#183;w&#7733;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8433.htm">Strong's 8433: </a> </span><span class="str2">Chastisement, correction, refutation, proof</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of discipline</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1464;&#1469;&#1512;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#363;&#183;s&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4148.htm">Strong's 4148: </a> </span><span class="str2">Chastisement, reproof, warning, instruction, restraint</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are the way</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1462;&#1445;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;e&#183;re&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - common singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1870.htm">Strong's 1870: </a> </span><span class="str2">A road, a course of life, mode of action</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to life,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1437;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;ay&#183;y&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2416.htm">Strong's 2416: </a> </span><span class="str2">Alive, raw, fresh, strong, life</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/6-23.htm">Proverbs 6:23 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/6-23.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 6:23 For the commandment is a lamp (Prov.
