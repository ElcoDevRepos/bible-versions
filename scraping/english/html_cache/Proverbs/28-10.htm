In biblical context, leading others astray is a serious offense, as seen in <a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a>, where Jesus warns against causing "one of these little ones who believe in me to sin." The imagery of a path suggests a journey or way of life, emphasizing the deliberate nature of the deception. Historically, Israel faced many temptations from surrounding nations to follow pagan practices, which often led to their downfall. This phrase serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining integrity and resisting the influence of those who would lead one away from God's commandments.<p><b>will fall into his own pit</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the principle of divine justice, where those who plot evil ultimately face the consequences of their actions. The imagery of a pit is common in Scripture, symbolizing danger and entrapment (<a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15-16</a>). It reflects the idea that evil schemes often backfire on the schemer. This concept is echoed in the story of Haman in the Book of Esther, who built gallows for Mordecai but was ultimately hanged on them himself. Theologically, it underscores the belief that God is sovereign and just, ensuring that evil does not go unpunished.<p><b>but the blameless will inherit what is good</b><br>This phrase contrasts the fate of the wicked with the reward of the righteous. The term "blameless" refers to those who live with integrity and righteousness, aligning with God's will. Inheritances in biblical times were significant, often representing stability and blessing. This promise of inheriting "what is good" can be seen as both a present and future reward, aligning with the Beatitudes in <a href="/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>, "Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth." It points to the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises to His people, both in this life and in the life to come, reflecting the hope of eternal life through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upright.htm">The Upright</a></b><br>Refers to those who live righteously and follow God's commandments.

The gnome is true in either case; he who mishads one who trusted him, and who, being simple and good, ought to have been respected and to have received better treatment, shall fall into the destruction which he prepared for the other (<a href="/proverbs/26-27.htm">Proverbs 26:27</a>). Taking the proverb in a moral sense, we find this truth: If the good man does ever yield to the temptations of the sinner, the latter does not reap the enjoyment which he expected from the other's lapse, rather he is made twofold more the child of hell, he himself sinks the deeper and more hopelessly for playing the devil's pert, while the just rises from hi. temporary fall morn humble, watchful, and guarded for the future. <span class="cmt_word">But the upright shall have good things in possession;</span> or, <span class="accented">shall inherit good</span> (<a href="/proverbs/3-35.htm">Proverbs 3:35</a>). He shall be abundantly rewarded by God's grace and protection, by the comfort of a conscience at rest, and by prosperity in his worldly concerns - an adumbration of the eternal recompense awaiting him in the life to come. St. Jerome has changed the incidence of the gnome by inserting <span class="accented">ejus</span>, thus: <span class="accented">Et simplices possidebunt bona ejus</span>, which makes the meaning to be that the righteous shall be the instruments of retribution on the deceiver, whose riches shall pass over into their possession. But the Hebrew gives no countenance to this interpretation.
