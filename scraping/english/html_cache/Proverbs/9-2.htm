This phrase suggests a sense of readiness and abundance. The act of preparing meat indicates a deliberate and thoughtful process, symbolizing wisdom's careful planning and provision. In biblical times, meat was not a daily staple but a luxury, highlighting the value and richness of what wisdom offers. This preparation can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate provision for humanity, offering Himself as the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>and mixed her wine</b><br>Mixing wine in the ancient Near East often involved adding spices or water to enhance flavor and reduce potency. This practice reflects hospitality and generosity, as well as the careful crafting of something desirable and beneficial. Wine in Scripture is frequently associated with joy and celebration (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). The mixing of wine here can be seen as a metaphor for the depth and richness of wisdom's teachings, offering a full and satisfying experience. It also points to the New Covenant in Christ's blood, symbolized by wine in the Lord's Supper (<a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>).<p><b>she has also set her table</b><br>Setting a table is an act of preparation and invitation, indicating that everything is ready for guests to partake. In the cultural context, a set table signifies welcome, fellowship, and community. This imagery aligns with the biblical theme of God's invitation to His people to partake in His blessings and wisdom. The table set by wisdom can be compared to the banquet imagery found in <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>, where the Lord prepares a feast for all peoples. It also foreshadows the marriage supper of the Lamb in <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>, where believers are invited to dine with Christ in eternal fellowship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom.htm">Wisdom (Personified as a Woman)</a></b><br>In <a href="/bsb/proverbs/9.htm">Proverbs 9</a>, wisdom is personified as a woman who prepares a feast, inviting people to partake in her banquet. This personification is a literary device used throughout Proverbs to convey the value and accessibility of wisdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_banquet.htm">The Banquet (Event)</a></b><br>The banquet represents the rich and fulfilling life that wisdom offers. It is a metaphor for the spiritual nourishment and satisfaction that comes from living according to God's wisdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_table.htm">The Table (Place)</a></b><br>The table symbolizes a place of fellowship and communion.

Whoever comes to Me will never hunger&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). He is the living embodiment of the nourishing meal Wisdom sets out.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and mixed her wine</b><p>&#8226; In ancient practice, wine was thoughtfully blended&#8212;often with spices or water&#8212;to heighten flavor and healthfulness. Wisdom&#8217;s &#8220;mixed&#8221; wine displays care, richness, and joy rather than excess.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a> celebrates &#8220;wine that gladdens the heart of man.&#8221; In <a href="/john/2-10.htm">John 2:10</a>, the master of the feast marvels that the best wine was saved for last, prefiguring the surpassing quality of what Christ supplies.<p>&#8226; The cup in <a href="/matthew/26-27.htm">Matthew 26:27-29</a> ties the joy of wine to covenant fellowship: &#8220;Drink from it, all of you&#8230; until that day when I drink it with you in My Father&#8217;s kingdom.&#8221; Even as <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a> cautions against drunkenness, it points to a deeper filling: &#8220;be filled with the Spirit.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she has also set her table</b><p>&#8226; A set table signals readiness, welcome, and order. Nothing is haphazard; every place is appointed. <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a> assures, &#8220;You prepare a table before me&#8230; my cup overflows,&#8221; portraying God&#8217;s protective hospitality.<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; parable in <a href="/luke/14-16.htm">Luke 14:16-23</a> pictures a &#8220;great banquet&#8221; already arranged, where the host urges, &#8220;Come, for everything is now ready.&#8221; Wisdom likewise invites without delay.<p>&#8226; This table foreshadows the ultimate feast: &#8220;Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the Lamb&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>).

Accepting the invitation brings present satisfaction and anticipates the eternal banquet prepared by the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">She hath killed her beasts.--</span>Comp. <a href="/matthew/22-4.htm" title="Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatted calves are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage.">Matthew 22:4</a>.<p><span class= "bld">She hath mingled her wine</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, probably, flavoured it with spices, to improve the flavour.

But the wine used at the Passover (<a href="/matthew/26-29.htm" title="But I say to you, I will not drink from now on of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.">Matthew 26:29</a>, &c.) was mingled with water to decrease its strength.<p><span class= "bld">She hath also furnished her table.</span>--"Christ hath furnished His own Table, exhibiting His precious and spotless Body and Blood, which are daily celebrated at that mystic and divine board, being sacrificed in commemoration of that ever-to-be-remembered original table of that mystic and divine supper."--S. Hippolytus (ed. Lagarde, p. 199), quoted by Wordsworth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">She hath killed her beasts.</span> So in the parable of the marriage of the king's son (<a href="/matthew/22.htm">Matthew 22</a>, which is parallel to the present), the king sends his servants to notify the guests that the oxen and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Wisdom has stores of nourishment for understanding and affection; and Christ has offered himself as a Victim in our behalf, and now makes bounteous offers of grace, and especially has ordained the sacrament of the Lord's Supper for the strengthening and refreshing of the soul. <span class="cmt_word">She hath mingled her wine;</span> Septuagint, "She hath mixed (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>) her wine in a bowl." The wine which, untempered, was too luscious or too fiery to drink, was made palatable by a certain admixture of water, it was always so mixed at the Passover; and the ancient Christian Liturgies direct the mixture in the celebration of the Holy Eucharist, doubtless from traditional use. Some, however, think that allusion is here made to the custom of adding drugs to wine in order to increase its potency. Among the Greeks, <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> meant "wine without water," and in <a href="/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a> we have <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "undiluted wine mixed." And probably in the text the notion is that the fluid for the guests' delectation is properly prepared, that there may be no trouble when they arrive (see on Proverbs 23:30). <span class="cmt_word">She hath also furnished her table,</span> by arranging the dishes, etc., thereon (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, "Thou preparest a table before me," where the same verb, <span class="accented">arak</span>, is used; comp. <a href="/isaiah/21-5.htm">Isaiah 21:5</a>). Moralizing on this passage, St. Gregory says, "The Lord 'killed the sacrifices' by offering himself on our behalf. He 'mingled the wine,' blending together the cup of his precepts from the historical narration and the spiritual signification. And he 'set forth his table,' <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Holy Writ, which with the bread of the Word refreshes us when we are wearied and come to him away from the burdens of the world, and by its effect of refreshing strengthens us against our adversaries" ('Moral,' 17:43, Oxford transl.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/9-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">She has prepared</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1464;&#1489;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2873.htm">Strong's 2873: </a> </span><span class="str2">To slaughter, butcher, slay</span><br /><br /><span class="word">her meat;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1460;&#1453;&#1489;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;i&#7687;&#183;&#7717;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2874.htm">Strong's 2874: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something slaughtered, a beast, butchery</span><br /><br /><span class="word">she has mixed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1505;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;s&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4537.htm">Strong's 4537: </a> </span><span class="str2">To mix, produce by mixing</span><br /><br /><span class="word">her wine;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#234;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3196.htm">Strong's 3196: </a> </span><span class="str2">Wine, intoxication</span><br /><br /><span class="word">she has also</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1437;&#1431;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ap&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_637.htm">Strong's 637: </a> </span><span class="str2">Meaning accession, yea, adversatively though</span><br /><br /><span class="word">set</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1469;&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6186.htm">Strong's 6186: </a> </span><span class="str2">To set in a, row, arrange, put in order</span><br /><br /><span class="word">her table.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1500;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;ul&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7979.htm">Strong's 7979: </a> </span><span class="str2">A table, a meal</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/9-2.htm">Proverbs 9:2 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/9-2.htm">Proverbs 9:2 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/9-2.htm">Proverbs 9:2 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/9-2.htm">Proverbs 9:2 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/9-2.htm">Proverbs 9:2 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/9-2.htm">Proverbs 9:2  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/9-2.htm">Proverbs 9:2 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/9-2.htm">Proverbs 9:2 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/9-2.htm">Proverbs 9:2 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/9-2.htm">Proverbs 9:2 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/9-2.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 9:2 She has prepared her meat (Prov.
