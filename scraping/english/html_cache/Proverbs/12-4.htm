The term "noble character" aligns with the description of the virtuous woman in <a href="/proverbs/31-10.htm">Proverbs 31:10-31</a>, who is industrious, wise, and fears the Lord. The imagery of a "crown" signifies honor and glory, suggesting that a virtuous wife enhances her husband's reputation and standing in the community. This metaphor reflects the cultural importance of family honor in biblical times, where a wife's character could significantly impact her husband's social and economic status. The crown also symbolizes authority and leadership, indicating that a noble wife supports and elevates her husband's role as the head of the household.<p><b>but she who causes shame is like decay in his bones</b><br>The contrast here highlights the destructive impact of a wife who brings shame, which in biblical terms often refers to actions that are morally or socially disgraceful. Such behavior could include infidelity, gossip, or neglect of family duties, which would undermine the husband's reputation and household stability. The phrase "decay in his bones" evokes a sense of internal, pervasive harm, much like a disease that weakens from within. This imagery underscores the profound and lasting damage that shameful conduct can inflict on a marriage and family. In the cultural context of the Bible, where family honor was paramount, a wife's shameful actions could lead to social ostracism and personal distress. This proverb serves as a warning about the potential consequences of failing to uphold moral and social responsibilities within the family unit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wife_of_noble_character.htm">Wife of Noble Character</a></b><br>This refers to a woman who embodies virtues such as integrity, strength, and moral excellence.

The term is applied to Ruth (<a href="/ruth/3-11.htm">Ruth 3:11</a>). The Vulgate renders, <span class="accented">diligens</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>.

The same idea is contained in <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;</span> and <span class="accented">virtus.</span> Such a woman is not simply loving and modest and loyal, but is <span class="cmt_word">a crown to her husband;</span> is an honour to him, adorns and beautifies his life, making, as it were, a joyous festival. So St. Paul (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>) calls his converts "a crown of glorying." The allusion is to the crown worn by the bridegroom at his marriage, or to the garlands worn at feasts (comp. <a href="/songs/3-11.htm">Song of Solomon 3:11</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>; Wisd. 2:8). The Son of Sirach has much praise for the virtuous woman: "Blessed is the man that hath a good (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>) wife, for the number of his days shall be double. A virtuous (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) woman rejoiceth her husband, and he shall fulfil the years of his life in peace" (Ecclus. 26:1, 2). <span class="cmt_word">She that maketh ashamed;</span> "that doeth shamefully" (<a href="/proverbs/10-5.htm">Proverbs 10:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/19-26.htm">Proverbs 19:26</a>); one who is a terrible contrast to the woman of strong character - weak, indolent, immodest, wasteful. <span class="cmt_word">Is as rottenness in his bones</span> (<a href="/proverbs/14-30.htm">Proverbs 14:30</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/3-16.htm">Habakkuk 3:16</a>). Such a wife poisons her husband's life, deprives him of strength and vigour; though she is made "bone of his bones, and flesh of his flesh" (<a href="/genesis/2-23.htm">Genesis 2:23</a>), far from being a helpmate for him, she saps his very existence. Septuagint, "As a worm in a tree, so an evil woman destroyeth a man." Here again Siracides has much to say, "A wicked woman abateth the courage, maketh an heavy countenance and a wounded heart: a woman that will not comfort her husband in distress maketh weak hands and feeble knees" (Ecclus. 25:23). Thus runs a Spanish maxim (Kelly, 'Proverbs of All Nations') - <p><span class="accented">"Him that has a good wife no evil in life<br />that may not be borne can befall;<br />Him that has a bad wife no good thing in life<br />that chance to, that good you may call."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/12-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A wife</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1469;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;&#353;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of noble character</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1463;&#1453;&#1497;&#1460;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#183;yil)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2428.htm">Strong's 2428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A force, an army, wealth, virtue, valor, strength</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is her husband&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#8216;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1167.htm">Strong's 1167: </a> </span><span class="str2">A master, a husband, owner</span><br /><br /><span class="word">crown,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1496;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7789;e&#183;re&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5850.htm">Strong's 5850: </a> </span><span class="str2">A crown, wreath</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but she who causes shame</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#238;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_954.htm">Strong's 954: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pale, to be ashamed, to be disappointed, delayed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is like decay</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1511;&#1464;&#1430;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;q&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-k &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7538.htm">Strong's 7538: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rottenness, decay</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in his bones.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1510;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8216;a&#7779;&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - feminine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6106.htm">Strong's 6106: </a> </span><span class="str2">A bone, the body, the substance, selfsame</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/12-4.htm">Proverbs 12:4 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/12-4.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 12:4 A worthy woman is the crown (Prov.
