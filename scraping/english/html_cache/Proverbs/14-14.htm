In biblical context, a "backslider" is often someone who has known the truth but has chosen to deviate from it. The heart, in Hebrew thought, is the center of one's being, encompassing mind, will, and emotions. <a href="/jeremiah/3-22.htm">Jeremiah 3:22</a> calls for backsliders to return, highlighting God's willingness to forgive. The concept of backsliding is also seen in the Israelites' repeated turning away from God throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>receives the fill of his own ways</b><br>This suggests that a person who turns away from God will experience the consequences of their actions. The "fill" implies a complete measure, indicating that the backslider will fully experience the results of their choices. <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a> supports this idea, stating that a person reaps what they sow. The historical context of Israel shows that when they turned from God, they often faced oppression and hardship as a result.<p><b>but a good man</b><br>A "good man" in biblical terms is someone who seeks to live righteously and in accordance with God's commandments. This is not merely about outward actions but reflects an inward commitment to God. The Psalms and Proverbs frequently contrast the righteous with the wicked, emphasizing the blessings that come to those who follow God's ways. Jesus, in the New Testament, is the ultimate example of a "good man," fulfilling the law and living a life of perfect obedience.<p><b>is rewarded for his ways</b><br>This phrase indicates that a person who lives righteously will receive blessings and rewards. In the Old Testament, this often meant tangible blessings such as prosperity and peace. However, the New Testament expands this understanding to include spiritual blessings and eternal life. <a href="/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a> speaks of rewards in heaven for those who are persecuted for righteousness. The concept of divine reward is a recurring theme, encouraging believers to remain faithful despite challenges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/backslider_in_heart.htm">Backslider in Heart</a></b><br>This refers to an individual who has turned away from God internally, even if outwardly they may appear righteous.
