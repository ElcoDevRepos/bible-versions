In biblical times, unjust gain could include practices like extortion, theft, or deceitful business dealings. The Bible consistently warns against greed, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, which states that the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. The pursuit of wealth at the expense of integrity is condemned, reflecting the broader biblical principle that righteousness and justice are more valuable than material wealth.<p><b>brings trouble on his household</b><br>The consequences of greed extend beyond the individual to affect their entire household. In ancient Israel, the family unit was central to social and economic life, and the actions of one member could impact the whole family. This phrase suggests that unethical behavior can lead to familial strife, financial ruin, or divine judgment. The story of Achan in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a> illustrates this principle, where his covetousness led to disaster for his family and the nation. The biblical narrative often emphasizes that sin has communal repercussions, not just personal ones.<p><b>but he who hates bribes</b><br>Rejecting bribes is a mark of integrity and righteousness. In the ancient Near East, bribery was a common practice that undermined justice and fairness. The Bible frequently condemns bribery, as seen in <a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>, where it is prohibited because it perverts justice and blinds the eyes of the wise. This phrase highlights the importance of maintaining moral integrity and upholding justice, which are key themes throughout Scripture.<p><b>will live</b><br>This promise of life can be understood both in a literal and spiritual sense. Literally, it suggests that those who act with integrity and reject corruption will avoid the pitfalls and dangers associated with unethical behavior. Spiritually, it aligns with the biblical teaching that righteousness leads to life, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-19.htm">Proverbs 11:19</a>. This life is not only physical but also encompasses spiritual well-being and eternal life, as promised through faithfulness to God's commandments. The connection to life echoes the broader biblical narrative that obedience to God and His principles leads to true life and blessing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_greedy_individual.htm">The Greedy Individual</a></b><br>This person is characterized by a desire for unjust gain, often at the expense of others.

Achan&#8217;s hidden plunder cost his family their lives (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8226; When greed drives decisions, resources get squandered, trust erodes, and relational strife multiplies (cf. <a href="/proverbs/11-29.htm">Proverbs 11:29</a>, &#8220;He who troubles his own house will inherit the wind&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The verse underscores personal responsibility: leading a family means shielding them from the fallout of unrighteous choices, not exposing them to it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but he who hates bribes</b><p>&#8226; The contrast pivots from greedy pursuit to active rejection: &#8220;he who hates bribes.&#8221; Hatred here implies decisive, consistent refusal (cf. <a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a>, describing leaders who &#8220;hate dishonest gain&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Bribery perverts justice (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>) and silences truth (<a href="/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>). To hate it is to love integrity, safeguarding both personal reputation and the community&#8217;s well-being.<p>&#8226; Joseph fled Potiphar&#8217;s wife&#8217;s advances, illustrating how shunning an illicit offer can preserve one&#8217;s calling and testimony (<a href="/genesis/39-7.htm">Genesis 39:7&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will live</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Will live&#8221; means more than survival; it promises flourishing under God&#8217;s favor.

The special reference is doubtless to venal judges, who wrested judgment for lucre. Such malefactors were often reproved by the prophets (see <a href="/isaiah/1-23.htm">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1</a>, etc.; <a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>; <a href="/micah/7-3.htm">Micah 7:3</a>). But all ill-gotten gain brings sure retribution. The Greeks have many maxims to this effect. Thus - <p><span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> And again - <p><span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <p><span class="accented">"Riches ill won bring ruin in their train."</span> An avaricious man troubles his house in another sense. He harasses his family by stingy economies and his domestics by overwork and underfeeding, deprives his household of all comfort, and loses the blessing of God upon a righteous use of earthly wealth. The word "troubleth" (<span class="accented">akar</span>, "to trouble") reminds one of the story of Achan, who, in his greed, appropriated some of the spoil of the banned city Jericho, and brought destruction upon himself and his family, when, in punishment of the crime, he and all his were stoned in the Valley of Achor (<a href="/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25</a>). So the covetousness of Gehazi caused the infliction of the penalty of leprosy upon himself and his children (<a href="/2_kings/5-27.htm">2 Kings 5:27</a>). Professor Plumptre ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) notes that the Chaldee Targum paraphrases this clause, referring especially to lucre gained by unrighteous judgments, thus: "He who gathers the mammon of unrighteousness destroys his house;" and he suggests that Christ's use of that phrase (<a href="/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>) may have had some connection with this proverb through the version then popularly used in the Palestinian synagogues. <span class="cmt_word">He that hateth gifts shall live</span> (comp. <a href="/ecclesiastes/7-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:7</a>). Primarily this refers to the judge or magistrate who is incorruptible, and gives just judgment, and dispenses his patronage without fear or favour; he shall "prolong his days" (<a href="/proverbs/28-16.htm">Proverbs 28:16</a>), And in all cases a man free from covetousness, who takes no bribes to blind his eyes withal, who makes no unjust gains, shall pass a long and happy life undisturbed by care. We see here a hope of immortality, to which integrity leads. The LXX., with the view of making the two clauses more marked in antithesis, restricts the application thus: "The receiver of gifts destroyeth himself; but he who hateth the receiving of gifts liveth." The Vulgate and Septuagint, after this verse, introduce a distich which recurs in <a href="/proverbs/16-6.htm">Proverbs 16:6</a>. The Septuagint transposes many of the verses at the end of this chapter and the beginning of the next. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/15-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He who is greedy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1461;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7779;&#234;&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1214.htm">Strong's 1214: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cut off, break off, gain by violence</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for unjust gain</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1510;&#1463;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#7779;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1215.htm">Strong's 1215: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gain made by violence, unjust gain, profit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">brings trouble</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1465;&#1499;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5916.htm">Strong's 5916: </a> </span><span class="str2">To roil water, to disturb, affict</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on his household,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1453;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but he who hates</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1461;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#347;&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8130.htm">Strong's 8130: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">bribes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1465;&#1443;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(mat&#183;t&#257;&#183;n&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4979.htm">Strong's 4979: </a> </span><span class="str2">A present, a sacrificial offering, a bribe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will live.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1495;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#7717;&#183;yeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2421.htm">Strong's 2421: </a> </span><span class="str2">To live, to revive</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/15-27.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 15:27 He who is greedy for gain troubles (Prov.
