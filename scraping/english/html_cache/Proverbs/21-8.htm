In biblical context, "crooked" often refers to a path that is not straight, symbolizing a life that is not aligned with God's commandments. The Hebrew word for "crooked" can also imply deceit and moral corruption. This aligns with passages like <a href="/isaiah/59-8.htm">Isaiah 59:8</a>, which speaks of the way of peace being unknown to the wicked. Historically, the imagery of a crooked path would resonate with an agrarian society familiar with the importance of straight paths for travel and agriculture. Theologically, it underscores the idea that sin distorts one's life direction, leading away from God's intended path.<p><b>but the conduct of the innocent is upright</b><br>In contrast, the "innocent" are those who live in accordance with God's laws, and their conduct is described as "upright." This term suggests integrity and righteousness, qualities that are highly valued throughout Scripture. The upright path is often associated with wisdom and divine favor, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-5.htm">Proverbs 11:5</a>, which states that the righteousness of the blameless makes their paths straight. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed a high value on community and social harmony, which was maintained through upright conduct. This phrase also points to the ultimate fulfillment of righteousness in Jesus Christ, who is the embodiment of innocence and uprightness, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>, which affirms that He committed no sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/guilty_man.htm">Guilty Man</a></b><br>Represents individuals who live in sin and deceit, whose paths are morally and ethically twisted.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/innocent.htm">Innocent</a></b><br>Refers to those who live righteously, with integrity and honesty, following God's commandments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, known for his wisdom and understanding.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ancient_israel.htm">Ancient Israel</a></b><br>The cultural and historical context in which Proverbs was written, emphasizing wisdom and moral living.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_path/way.htm">The Path/Way</a></b><br>A metaphor for one's life journey and moral choices, common in wisdom literature.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_crooked_and_upright.htm">Understanding Crooked and Upright</a></b><br>The Hebrew word for "crooked" ('iqqesh) implies perversion and deceit, while "upright" (yashar) suggests straightness and integrity.

Both this and the Authorized Version miss the antithesis between the guilty and the pure man, which is intended. In <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;</span>, translated "and strange" (which seems to mean "alien from what is right"), the <span class="accented">vav</span> is not the copulative, but part of the word, which is an adjective signifying "laden with guilt;" so that the clause ought to be rendered, "Crooked is the way of a guilty man" (see note on Proverbs 2:15, where, however, the word is different, though the idea is analogous). An evil man's way of life is not open and straightforward, simple and uniform, but stealthy, crooked, perverse, whither his evil inclinations lead him. Septuagint, "To the crooked (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>) God sendeth crooked ways;" which recalls <a href="/psalms/18-26.htm">Psalm 18:26</a>, "With the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the perverse thou wilt show thyself froward."

The pure in heart will be right in action; he follows his conscience and God's law, and goes direct on his course without turning or hesitation. The LXX. refers the clause to God: "for pure and right are his ways." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/21-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The way</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(de&#183;re&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1870.htm">Strong's 1870: </a> </span><span class="str2">A road, a course of life, mode of action</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of a guilty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1494;&#1464;&#1425;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;z&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2054.htm">Strong's 2054: </a> </span><span class="str2">Criminal, guilty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is crooked,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1508;&#1463;&#1499;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1463;&#1452;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;p&#772;a&#7733;&#183;pa&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2019.htm">Strong's 2019: </a> </span><span class="str2">Very perverse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but the conduct</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1459;&#1500;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#257;&#183;&#8216;o&#183;l&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6467.htm">Strong's 6467: </a> </span><span class="str2">Doing, deed, work</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the innocent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1437;&#1494;&#1463;&#1431;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;za&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2134.htm">Strong's 2134: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pure, clean</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is upright.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3477.htm">Strong's 3477: </a> </span><span class="str2">Straight, right</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/21-8.htm">Proverbs 21:8 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/21-8.htm">Proverbs 21:8 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/21-8.htm">Proverbs 21:8 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/21-8.htm">Proverbs 21:8 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/21-8.htm">Proverbs 21:8 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/21-8.htm">Proverbs 21:8  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/21-8.htm">Proverbs 21:8 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/21-8.htm">Proverbs 21:8 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/21-8.htm">Proverbs 21:8 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/21-8.htm">Proverbs 21:8 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/21-8.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 21:8 The way of the guilty is devious (Prov.
