In the wisdom literature, such as Proverbs, discipline is closely tied to the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). The lack of discipline can lead to spiritual and physical demise, as seen in the lives of biblical figures like Samson, whose lack of self-control led to his downfall (Judges 16). The Hebrew word for "discipline" can also imply correction or instruction, suggesting that ignoring divine guidance results in dire consequences. This phrase warns of the ultimate consequence of neglecting wisdom and instruction, which is death, both spiritually and sometimes physically.<p><b>led astray by his own great folly</b><br>Folly in the biblical sense is not merely foolishness but a moral failing, a rejection of wisdom and understanding. The phrase "led astray" indicates a deviation from the path of righteousness, often due to one's own decisions and desires. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that sin originates from within, as <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a> explains that each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire. The "great folly" here can be seen as a life lived in opposition to God's commandments, leading to ruin. This is a recurring theme in Proverbs, where wisdom is personified and calls out to those who are simple to turn from their ways (<a href="/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20-33</a>). The phrase serves as a cautionary reminder of the consequences of ignoring divine wisdom and choosing one's own path over God's.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_foolish_man.htm">The Foolish Man</a></b><br>The primary subject of this verse, representing anyone who lacks discipline and is led astray by their own folly.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was known for his wisdom and is addressing his son or a young man in this chapter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_path_of_folly.htm">The Path of Folly</a></b><br>A metaphorical path representing a life lived without wisdom or discipline, leading to destruction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_discipline.htm">The Importance of Discipline</a></b><br>Discipline is crucial for a righteous life.

The obvious meaning is, because he gave no heed to instruction. So Aben Ezra and Gersom. The Authorized Version is at least ambiguous, and seems to imply that the adulterer has been without instruction, without any to reprove or counsel him. But such is not the case. He has been admonished of the evil consequences of his sin, but to these warnings he has turned a deaf ear, and the teacher says therefore he shall die. The Vulgate supports this explanation, <span class="accented">quia non habuit disciplinam</span> "because he did not entertain or use instruction." In the LXX. the idea is enlarged, "He shall die together with these who have no instruction (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)." The <span class="accented">b</span>' (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>) in <span class="accented">b'eyn</span> is causal, and equivalent to <span class="accented">propter</span>, as in <a href="/genesis/18-28.htm">Genesis 18:28</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-3.htm">Jeremiah 17:3</a>. A similar statement is found in <a href="/job/4-21.htm">Job 4:21</a>, "They die even without wisdom," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> because they have disregarded the lessons of wisdom; and <a href="/job/36-12.htm">Job 36:12</a>, "They shall die without knowledge." <span class="cmt_word">And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray;</span> better, as Delitzsch, "He shall stagger to ruin." The verb <span class="accented">shagah</span> is used as in vers. 19 and 20, but with a deeper and more dread significance. A climax is reached in the manner in which the end of the adulterer is portrayed. His end is without a gleam of hope or satisfaction. With an understanding darkened and rendered callous by unrestrained indulgence in lust, and by folly which has reached its utmost limits and cannot, as it were, be surpassed, in that it has persistently and wilfully set aside and scorned wisdom and true happiness, the adulterer, like the drunkard, who is oblivious of the danger before him, shall stagger to ruin. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/5-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will die</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1453;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;m&#363;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4191.htm">Strong's 4191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To die, to kill</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for lack</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_369.htm">Strong's 369: </a> </span><span class="str2">A non-entity, a negative particle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of discipline,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1464;&#1425;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#363;&#183;s&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4148.htm">Strong's 4148: </a> </span><span class="str2">Chastisement, reproof, warning, instruction, restraint</span><br /><br /><span class="word">led astray</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#353;&#183;geh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7686.htm">Strong's 7686: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stray, to mistake, to transgress, to reel, be enraptured</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by his own great</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1465;&#1430;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;r&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7230.htm">Strong's 7230: </a> </span><span class="str2">Multitude, abundance, greatness</span><br /><br /><span class="word">folly.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1493;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;iw&#183;wal&#183;t&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_200.htm">Strong's 200: </a> </span><span class="str2">Silliness</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/5-23.htm">Proverbs 5:23 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/5-23.htm">Proverbs 5:23 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/5-23.htm">Proverbs 5:23 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/5-23.htm">Proverbs 5:23 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/5-23.htm">Proverbs 5:23 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/5-23.htm">Proverbs 5:23  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/5-23.htm">Proverbs 5:23 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/5-23.htm">Proverbs 5:23 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/5-23.htm">Proverbs 5:23 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/5-23.htm">Proverbs 5:23 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/5-23.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 5:23 He will die for lack of instruction (Prov.
