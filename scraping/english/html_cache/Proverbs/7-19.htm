In the cultural context of ancient Israel, the husband's absence would have been significant, as the husband was typically the protector and provider of the household. The absence creates an opportunity for the wife to engage in illicit behavior, reflecting the broader biblical theme of the dangers of idleness and lack of accountability. This situation can be compared to the story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife in <a href="/genesis/39.htm">Genesis 39</a>, where Joseph resists temptation despite the absence of Potiphar. Theologically, this phrase can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual unfaithfulness, where the absence of God in one's life leads to moral and spiritual decline.<p><b>he has gone on a long journey.</b><br>The mention of a long journey suggests a significant period during which the husband will be away, providing the wife with ample opportunity to engage in her plans without fear of immediate discovery. In the historical context, long journeys were common due to trade, military service, or other obligations, and they often involved extended periods of travel due to the limitations of ancient transportation. This phrase underscores the theme of delayed accountability, a common motif in wisdom literature, where the consequences of one's actions may not be immediate but are inevitable. It also serves as a warning against presuming upon the grace period before judgment, as seen in parables like the Ten Virgins in <a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>, where preparedness and vigilance are emphasized.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_adulterous_woman.htm">The Adulterous Woman</a></b><br>In <a href="/bsb/proverbs/7.htm">Proverbs 7</a>, she is depicted as a seductress who lures a young man into sin.

Scripture exposes the lie&#8212;God always sees, consequences remain certain, and momentary pleasure conceals lasting ruin. Wisdom therefore calls us to flee secrecy, cherish marital faithfulness, and trust that God&#8217;s watchful presence is the surest guard against hidden sin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">The goodman.--</span>Literally, <span class= "ital">the man; </span>she does not even call him "my husband."<p><span class= "bld">At the day appointed.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">at the full moon, </span>a fortnight later, as now it would seem to have been new moon, when the nights are dark.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - The temptress proceeds to encourage the youth by showing that there is no fear of interruption or detection. <span class="cmt_word">The goodman is not at home.</span> "Goodman" is an old word meaning "master of the house," or husband (<a href="/matthew/20-11.htm">Matthew 20:11</a>, etc.); but the Hebrew is simply "the man," which is probably a contemptuous way of speaking of the husband whom she was outraging. <span class="cmt_word">He is gone a long journey;</span> he has gone to a place at a great distance hence.
