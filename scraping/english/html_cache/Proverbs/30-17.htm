The "eye" symbolizes perception and attitude, suggesting that disrespect begins with how one views authority. In ancient Israel, family structure was patriarchal, and the father was seen as a representative of God's authority. Mocking a father was not just a personal offense but a challenge to the divine order.<p><b>and scorns obedience to a mother</b><br>The mother, while often seen as the nurturer, also held a position of authority within the family. Scorning obedience to her was equally serious, reflecting a heart of rebellion. Proverbs frequently highlights the wisdom of listening to parental instruction (<a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>). In the cultural context, both parents were to be revered, and their guidance was considered a source of wisdom and blessing.<p><b>may the ravens of the valley pluck it out</b><br>Ravens are often associated with desolation and judgment in the Bible (<a href="/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a>). The "valley" may symbolize a place of vulnerability or exposure. This imagery serves as a warning of the severe consequences of disrespecting parents. The act of plucking out the eye signifies the removal of the source of contempt, a metaphor for divine retribution.<p><b>and young vultures devour it</b><br>Vultures are scavengers, often linked with death and decay. Their presence in this proverb underscores the finality and severity of the judgment. In biblical symbolism, vultures consuming the flesh is a picture of disgrace and divine judgment (<a href="/revelation/19-17.htm">Revelation 19:17-18</a>). This serves as a stark reminder of the spiritual and moral consequences of rebellion against parental authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_eye.htm">The Eye</a></b><br>Symbolizes the attitude and perspective of a person, particularly in how they view authority and parental guidance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/father_and_mother.htm">Father and Mother</a></b><br>Represents parental authority and the God-given role of parents in guiding and instructing their children.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/ravens_of_the_valley.htm">Ravens of the Valley</a></b><br>Birds often associated with desolation and judgment in biblical literature, symbolizing divine retribution.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/y/young_vultures.htm">Young Vultures</a></b><br>Scavengers that consume the dead, representing the ultimate consequence of disrespect and rebellion.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_valley.htm">The Valley</a></b><br>A place of vulnerability and exposure, often used metaphorically for life's challenges and trials.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_authority.htm">Respect for Authority</a></b><br>The verse underscores the importance of respecting parental authority as a reflection of our respect for God's order.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disobedience.htm">Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The imagery of ravens and vultures serves as a stark warning about the spiritual and sometimes physical consequences of rebellion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_eye.htm">Symbolism of the Eye</a></b><br>The "eye" represents our inner attitudes.

Disrespect breaks fellowship with both earthly parents and the heavenly Father (<a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Proverbs repeatedly warns against such contempt: &#8220;Whoever curses his father or mother, his lamp will be extinguished in deepest darkness&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/20-20.htm">Proverbs 20:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Scorns obedience to a mother</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Scorns obedience&#8221; moves from eye to action, showing rebellion that refuses instruction (<a href="/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8-9</a>; 23:22).<p>&#8226; God ties parental authority to His own; rejecting a mother&#8217;s guidance is rejecting God&#8217;s wisdom (<a href="/ephesians/6-1.htm">Ephesians 6:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Old-covenant Israel treated chronic rebellion severely (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-18.htm">Deuteronomy 21:18-21</a>), underscoring how seriously heaven views parental honor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>May the ravens of the valley pluck it out</b><p>&#8226; Ravens feed on carcasses left unburied (<a href="/1_kings/17-4.htm">1 Kings 17:4-6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-46.htm">1 Samuel 17:46</a>).

The scornful eye exposes a rebellious heart; God promises that the very eye will face gruesome retribution by carrion birds. Scripture consistently links honoring parents with blessing and longevity, while contempt brings darkness, disgrace, and destruction. Honor given at home is worship offered to God; dishonor is rebellion against Him and reaps consequences as sure as the flight of ravens and vultures.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">The ravens of the valley shall pick it out</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the rebellious son shall die of a "grievous death" (<a href="/jeremiah/16-4.htm" title="They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung on the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcasses shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.">Jeremiah 16:4</a>). The propensity of ravens to attack the eyes is well known.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - This is an independent proverb, only connected with the preceding by being founded on an allusion to an animal. <span class="cmt_word">The eye that mocketh at his father.</span> The eye is named as the mind's instrument for expressing scorn and insubordination; it is the index to the inner feeling; and look may be as sinful as action. <span class="cmt_word">And despiseth to obey his mother</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. holds obedience to his mother to be a thing of no importance whatever. The word translated "to obey" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d9;&#x5e7;&#x5d4;&#x5ea;</span>) is rendered by St. Jerome <span class="accented">partum</span>; by others, "weakness," or "wrinkles," or "old age," as Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. But etymology has led most modern commentators to give the sense of "obedience" (see <a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The ravens of the valley shall pick it out.</span> Such an undutiful son shall die a violent death; his corpse shall lie unburied, and the birds of prey shall feed upon him. It is well known that ravens, vultures, and other birds that live on carrion first attack the eyes of their prey; and in our own islands we are told crows and birds of this sort will fix on the eyes of young or sickly animals. Corn. a Lapide quotes Catullus, 'Carm.,' 108:5 - <p><span class="foreign">"Effossos oculos voret atro gutture corvus,<br />Intestina canes, cetera membra lupi."</span> <p><span class="accented">"His eyes, plucked out, let croaking ravens gorge,<br />His bowels dogs, his limbs the greedy wolves."</span> The valley, or brook, reminds one of Elijah's miraculous support (<a href="/1_kings/17-4.htm">1 Kings 17:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Young eagles.</span> The <span class="accented">nesher</span> must here mean one of the vulture tribe, as eagles do not feed on carrion (but see <a href="/job/39-30.htm">Job 39:30</a>). St. Gregory ('Moral.,' 18:49) applies the proverb thus: "'The eye that sneereth at his father, and despiseth the travail of his mother, lo! the ravens from the torrents shall pick it out.' For bad men, while they find limit with the judgments of God, do 'sneer at their Father;' and heretics of all sorts, whilst in mocking they contemn the preaching of holy Church and her fruitfulness, what else is this but that they 'despise the travail of their mother'? whom we not unjustly call the mother of them as well, because from the same they come forth, who speak against the same." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/30-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As for the eye</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1444;&#1497;&#1460;&#1503;
