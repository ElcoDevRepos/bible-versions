This method involved throwing stones, sticks, or other objects to determine an outcome. The practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/leviticus/16-8.htm">Leviticus 16:8</a>, where lots were used to choose between the scapegoat and the goat for sacrifice. The phrase "into the lap" suggests a personal and intimate setting, indicating that the decision-making process was often done in a private or sacred context. The use of lots was a way to seek God's guidance, reflecting a belief in His sovereignty over seemingly random events.<p><b>but its every decision is from the LORD</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the belief in God's ultimate control over all events, even those that appear to be left to chance. It reflects the theological understanding that nothing happens outside of God's will or knowledge. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>, which states, "Many are the plans in a person&#8217;s heart, but it is the LORD&#8217;s purpose that prevails." The idea that God directs the outcome of casting lots underscores His omnipotence and omniscience. It also points to the trust believers are to have in God's providence, knowing that He orchestrates all things for His purposes. This trust in divine sovereignty is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, reinforcing the belief that God is actively involved in the world and in the lives of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

It is not quite clear what articles the Jews used in their divinations by lot. Probably they employed stones, differing in shape or colour, or having some distinguishing mark. These were placed in a vessel or in the fold of a garment, and drawn or shaken thence. Such a practice has been common in all ages and countries; and though only cursorily mentioned in the Mosaic legislation (<a href="/numbers/26-55.htm">Numbers 26:55</a>), it was used by the Jews from the time of Joshua, and in the earliest days of the Christian Church (see <a href="/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>; <a href="/judges/20-9.htm">Judges 20:9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-20.htm">1 Samuel 10:20, 21</a>; <a href="/acts/1.htm">Acts 1</a>:28, etc.). As by this means man's agency was minimized, and all partiality and chicanery were excluded, the decision was regarded as directed by Providence. There is one case only of ordeal in the Law, and that under suspicion of adultery (<a href="/numbers/5-12.htm">Numbers 5:12</a>, etc.). In the Epistle to the Hebrews, in place of the lot we read (<a href="/hebrews/6-16.htm">Hebrews 6:16</a>), "An oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife." <span class="cmt_word">The whole disposing thereof is of the Lord.</span> In these cases the Jew learned to see, in what we call chance, the overruling of Divine power. But this was not blind superstition. He did not feel justified in resorting to this practice on every trivial occasion, as persons used the <span class="accented">Sortes Virgilianae</span> or even the verses of the Bible for the same purpose. The lot was employed religiously in cases where other means of decision were not suitable or available; it was not to supersede common prudence or careful investigation; but, for example, in trials where the evidence was conflicting and the judges could not determine the case, the merits were ascer-rained by lot (comp. ch. 18:18). After the effusion of the Holy Spirit, the apostles never resorted to divination, and the Christian Church has wisely repudiated the practice of all such modes of discovering the Divine will. Septuagint, "For the unrighteous all things fall into their bosom, but from the Lord are all just things," which may mean either that, though the wicked seem to prosper, God still works out his righteous ends; or the evil suffer retribution, and thus God's justice is displayed. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/16-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The lot</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#333;&#183;w&#183;r&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1486.htm">Strong's 1486: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lot -- a lot (for casting)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is cast</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;&#1463;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#363;&#183;&#7789;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hofal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2904.htm">Strong's 2904: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pitch over, reel, to cast down, out</span><br /><br /><span class="word">into the lap,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1453;&#1495;&#1461;&#1497;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(ba&#183;&#7717;&#234;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2436.htm">Strong's 2436: </a> </span><span class="str2">The bosom</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but its every</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">decision</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1496;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;p&#257;&#183;&#7789;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4941.htm">Strong's 4941: </a> </span><span class="str2">A verdict, a sentence, formal decree, divine law, penalty, justice, privilege, style</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is from the LORD.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1437;&#1502;&#1461;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-m &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 16:33 The lot is cast into the lap (Prov.
