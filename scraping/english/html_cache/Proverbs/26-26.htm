The idea of concealing hatred through deceit is reminiscent of the serpent's deception in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where cunning and subtlety mask true intentions. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, deceit was seen as a grave sin, as honesty and integrity were highly valued. The Hebrew word for "deception" here implies a deliberate act of misleading others, which is condemned throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/psalms/5-9.htm">Psalm 5:9</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/9-8.htm">Jeremiah 9:8</a>). This phrase warns against trusting appearances and encourages discernment, echoing Jesus' teachings in <a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a> about false prophets who come in sheep's clothing.<p><b>his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly</b><br>The exposure of wickedness in the assembly refers to the eventual revelation of one's true character before the community. In ancient Israel, the assembly often served as a place of judgment and accountability, where matters were brought to light (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15-19</a>). This concept is paralleled in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of hidden things being revealed (<a href="/luke/12-2.htm">Luke 12:2-3</a>). The assembly can also be seen as a type of the final judgment, where all will be laid bare before God (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>). This phrase serves as a reminder of divine justice and the ultimate accountability each person faces, reinforcing the biblical principle that God sees beyond outward appearances to the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_deceptive_person.htm">The Deceptive Person</a></b><br>This individual harbors hatred and uses deception to conceal their true intentions. The verse warns about the eventual exposure of such a person's wickedness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly.htm">The Assembly</a></b><br>This refers to a gathering of people, possibly a community or congregation, where the truth about the deceptive person is revealed.

Detest what is evil; cling to what is good.&#8221; A sincere heart leaves no room for hidden hostility.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by deception</b><p>&#8226; Deception is the chosen tool of the hater. Just two verses earlier, <a href="/proverbs/26-24.htm">Proverbs 26:24</a> observes, &#8220;A hateful man disguises himself with his speech, but he lays up deceit in his heart.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/12-2.htm">Psalm 12:2</a> describes the same tactic: &#8220;They lie to one another; they speak with flattering lips and a double heart.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Deception may seem clever, but it is always unrighteous. <a href="/colossians/3-9.htm">Colossians 3:9</a> commands, &#8220;Do not lie to one another, since you have taken off the old self with its practices.&#8221; Truthfulness flows from a transformed heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his wickedness will be exposed</b><p>&#8226; No disguise endures forever. <a href="/luke/12-2.htm">Luke 12:2</a> assures us, &#8220;There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God Himself guarantees exposure. <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a> affirms, &#8220;For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether good or evil.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Paul adds the New-Testament echo in <a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>: &#8220;He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men&#8217;s hearts.&#8221; The hater imagines safety behind lies, but divine justice is certain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the assembly</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The assembly&#8221; points to a public setting where the community gathers. In Old-Testament Israel this often meant the city gate or a congregational meeting (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-16.htm">Deuteronomy 19:16-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Public exposure serves two purposes:<p>&#8211; It protects the innocent by revealing danger.<p>&#8211; It warns others against duplicity. <a href="/1_timothy/5-20.htm">1 Timothy 5:20</a> instructs, &#8220;Those who sin should be rebuked in front of everyone, so that the rest will stand in fear.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/18-17.htm">Matthew 18:17</a> shows a similar pattern in church discipline: unresolved sin eventually reaches the whole congregation. God values transparency because hidden evil harms the body.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/26-26.htm">Proverbs 26:26</a> assures us that hatred, no matter how carefully camouflaged, cannot stay hidden. Deception is temporary; God-ordained exposure is inevitable and often public.
