Snow was rare in the lower elevations but could be found in the higher mountains, such as Mount Hermon. The imagery here suggests unexpected relief and refreshment. This phrase can be connected to the concept of divine provision and unexpected blessings, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10-11</a>, where God's word is likened to rain and snow that nourish the earth.<p><b>is a trustworthy messenger to those who send him;</b><br>A trustworthy messenger was crucial in ancient times, as communication relied heavily on individuals to carry messages accurately over long distances. The reliability of a messenger was a reflection of the sender's integrity and the importance of the message. This can be compared to the role of prophets in the Bible, who were seen as God's messengers, delivering His word faithfully. Jesus Christ is the ultimate trustworthy messenger, as seen in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>, where He is described as the Word made flesh, faithfully conveying God's message to humanity.<p><b>he refreshes the soul of his masters.</b><br>The refreshment brought by a trustworthy messenger is likened to the relief provided by cold snow during harvest. This refreshment is not just physical but also emotional and spiritual, as it brings peace and assurance to those who rely on the messenger. This can be related to the peace and comfort that comes from the Holy Spirit, described as the Comforter in <a href="/john/14-26.htm">John 14:26</a>.

Picture laborers cutting grain under a blazing Middle-Eastern sun. Suddenly someone brings in snow packed from a distant mountain&#8212;cooling water or chilled wine. The shock of that icy touch revives body and mind. Scripture often ties cool water to life-giving relief: &#8220;As cold water to a weary soul, so is good news from a distant land&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/25-25.htm">Proverbs 25:25</a>), and &#8220;He leads me beside still waters; He restores my soul&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/23-2.htm">Psalm 23:2&#8211;3</a>). Solomon starts with an experience everyone craves&#8212;tangible refreshment&#8212;so we immediately feel what the verse is driving at.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the time of harvest</b><p>Harvest means heat, hard labor, and urgency (<a href="/genesis/8-22.htm">Genesis 8:22</a>; <a href="/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37&#8211;38</a>). It is the very moment you least expect snow, making its appearance even more delightful. By choosing harvest season, Solomon highlights contrast: unexpected relief at the most demanding hour. The Lord often sends help right when His people are stretched thin, as when Ruth gleaned in Boaz&#8217;s field (<a href="/ruth/2-3.htm">Ruth 2:3&#8211;9</a>) or when Elijah received bread from ravens during famine (<a href="/1_kings/17-4.htm">1 Kings 17:4&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is a trustworthy messenger</b><p>A &#8220;trustworthy messenger&#8221; stands out like that cold snow&#8212;rare, valuable, welcome (<a href="/proverbs/13-17.htm">Proverbs 13:17</a>). Think of Joseph delivering grain to his family (<a href="/genesis/45-7.htm">Genesis 45:7&#8211;8</a>) or Tychicus carrying Paul&#8217;s letters (<a href="/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21&#8211;22</a>). Reliability here is moral as well as practical. Such a person carries truth undiluted (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-22.htm">2 Corinthians 8:22&#8211;23</a>). In an age of rumors and half-truths, God still prizes faithfulness in every errand we run for Him (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to those who send him</b><p>The proverb looks at the sender&#8217;s perspective. Masters stake reputation and resources on the courier&#8217;s integrity. When the messenger proves dependable, anxiety dissolves. Contrast that with &#8220;Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to those who send him&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/10-26.htm">Proverbs 10:26</a>). Trustworthy service not only benefits the recipient of the message but vindicates the one who commissions it&#8212;mirroring how Jesus perfectly represented the Father (<a href="/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he refreshes the soul of his masters</b><p>Good news safely delivered &#8220;refreshes&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-30.htm">Proverbs 15:30</a>). The Hebrew idea is rest, revival, even exhilaration. When Onesimus returned to Philemon as a changed man, Paul expected Philemon&#8217;s &#8220;heart&#8221; to be &#8220;refreshed&#8221; (<a href="/philemon/1-20.htm">Philemon 1:20</a>). Faithful believers bring that same lift to the Lord Himself: &#8220;The LORD takes pleasure in those who fear Him&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/147-11.htm">Psalm 147:11</a>). Our obedience becomes a delight to the One who sends us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Just as a sudden blast of mountain snow cools weary harvesters, a reliable messenger brings life-giving relief to those who sent him. The verse challenges us to be that kind of person&#8212;dependable, truthful, and timely&#8212;so that our service refreshes both the people we serve and the God who commissioned us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">As the cold of snow in the time of harvest.</span>--Not a snowstorm, as this would be a calamity (<a href="/proverbs/26-1.htm" title="As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honor is not seemly for a fool.">Proverbs 26:1</a>), but snow employed to cool drinks in the summer heats. The use of this was probably familiar to Solomon in his summer palace at Lebanon (<a href="/1_kings/9-19.htm" title="And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.">1Kings 9:19</a>). The peasants of Lebanon are said now to store up snow in the clefts of the mountain, and convey it in summer to Damascus and the coast towns. For the opposite picture of the unfaithful messenger comp. <a href="/proverbs/10-26.htm" title="As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him.">Proverbs 10:26</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - A comparative tristich concerning words. <span class="cmt_word">As the cold of snow in the time of harvest.</span> This, of course, does not mean a snowstorm or hailstorm in the time of harvest, which would be anything but a blessing (<a href="/proverbs/26-1.htm">Proverbs 26:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/12-17.htm">1 Samuel 12:17, 18</a>), but either the distant view of the snow on Hermon or Lebanon, which gave an idea of refreshment in the heat of autumn, or more probably snow used to cool drink in warm weather. This luxury was not unknown in the time of Solomon, who had a summer palace on Lebanon (<a href="/1_kings/9-19.htm">1 Kings 9:19</a>), though it could have been enjoyed by very few, and would not speak to the personal experience of the burgher class, to whom the proverbs seem to have been addressed. Xenophon writes of the use of snow to cool wine ('Memorab.,' 2:1. 30). Hitzig quotes a passage from the old history of the Crusades, called 'Gesta Dei per Francos,' which runs thus: "Nix frigidissima a monte Libano defertur, ut vino commixta, tanquam glaciem ipsum frigidum reddat." So in the present day snow is sold in Damascus bazaars. The LXX., not realizing what harm such an untimely storm might effect, translates, "As a fall (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of snow in harvest is of use against heat, so a faithful messenger benefits those who sent him." So is a faithful messenger to them that send him. (For "faithful messenger," see on Proverbs 13:17; and for "them that send," see on Proverbs 22:21.) The comparison is explained. <span class="cmt_word">For he refresheth the soul of his masters.</span> He brings as great refreshment to his masters' mind as would a drink of snow-cooled water in the burning harvest field. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/25-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Like the cold</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7779;in&#183;na&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
