In biblical context, honesty and integrity are highly valued, as seen in the Ten Commandments, which prohibit bearing false witness (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). The Bible consistently warns against dishonest gain, emphasizing that God detests lying lips (<a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>). Historically, deceitful practices in trade and commerce were common, yet the biblical narrative calls for fairness and truthfulness. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches about the dangers of wealth obtained through unrighteous means (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10-13</a>).<p><b>is a vanishing mist</b><br>The imagery of a "vanishing mist" suggests the fleeting and insubstantial nature of wealth gained through deceit. This metaphor is consistent with biblical teachings that emphasize the temporary nature of earthly riches (<a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>). The mist represents something that appears substantial but quickly dissipates, illustrating the futility of relying on dishonest wealth. This concept is reinforced in Ecclesiastes, where the pursuit of wealth is described as "vanity" and "chasing after the wind" (<a href="/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a>).<p><b>a deadly pursuit</b><br>The phrase "a deadly pursuit" underscores the spiritual and moral dangers associated with dishonest gain. In biblical terms, the pursuit of wealth at the expense of integrity leads to spiritual death and separation from God. This is reflected in the teachings of Jesus, who warns that one cannot serve both God and money (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>). The pursuit of wealth through deceit is not only morally wrong but also leads to destructive consequences, as seen in the story of Ananias and Sapphira, who lied about their possessions and faced dire consequences (<a href="/acts/5.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>). This serves as a cautionary tale about the ultimate cost of dishonest pursuits.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

(Comp. <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/5-14.htm" title="For the hope of the ungodly is like dust that is blown away with the wind; like a thin froth that is driven away with the storm; like as the smoke which is dispersed here and there with a tempest, and passeth away as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but a day.">Wisdom Of Solomon 5:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-2.htm" title="As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melts before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.">Psalm 68:2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The getting of treasures by a lying tongue</span> - the acquisition of wealth by fraud and falsehood - <span class="cmt_word">is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death</span>. The latter clause is variously rendered and interpreted. The Hebrew is literally, <span class="accented">a fleeting breath, those seeking death.</span> The Revised Version makes the last words a separate proposition, "They that seek them seek death." But this seems unnecessary, and somewhat opposed to the gnomic style, which often combines two predicates in one construction; and there is no reason why we should not render the words, as in the Authorized Version, "of seekers of death." Such a mode of obtaining wealth is as evanescent and unstable as the very breath, and ends in death, which is practically the result of their quest. Thus Wisd. 5:14, "The hope of the ungodly is like dust that is blown away with the wind; like a thin froth that is driven away with the storm; like as the smoke which is dispersed here and there with the tempest, and passeth away. as the remembrance of a guest that tarrieth but a day." Some think that the comparison regards the mirage of the desert, which deceives travellers with the phantasms of cool waters and refreshing shade. Such an allusion is found in <a href="/isaiah/35-7.htm">Isaiah 35:7</a>. The Talmud enjoins, "Speak no word that accords not with the truth, that thy honour may not vanish as the waters of a brook." The Septuagint and Vulgate have followed a different reading (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5e7;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d9;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>), and render thus: Vulgate, <span class="accented">Vanus et excors est, et impingetur ad laqueos mortis</span>, "He is vain and foolish, and will be taken in the snares of death;" Septuagint, "pursues vain things unto the snares of death (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>)" (<a href="/proverbs/13-14.htm">Proverbs 13:14</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-27.htm">Proverbs 14:27</a>). So St. Paul says (<a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>), "They that desire to be rich fall into a into a temptation and a snare (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>), and many foolish and hurtful lusts, such as drown men in destruction and perdition." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/21-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Making</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#333;&#183;&#8216;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6467.htm">Strong's 6467: </a> </span><span class="str2">Doing, deed, work</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a fortune</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1453;&#1493;&#1465;&#1510;&#1464;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#183;r&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_214.htm">Strong's 214: </a> </span><span class="str2">Treasure, store, a treasury, storehouse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by a lying</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1425;&#1511;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;qer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8267.htm">Strong's 8267: </a> </span><span class="str2">Deception, disappointment, falsehood</span><br /><br /><span class="word">tongue</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(bil&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Noun - common singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">The tongue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is a vanishing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1437;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(nid&#183;d&#257;p&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5086.htm">Strong's 5086: </a> </span><span class="str2">To shove asunder, disperse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">mist,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1462;&#1445;&#1489;&#1462;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#183;&#7687;el)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1892.htm">Strong's 1892: </a> </span><span class="str2">Emptiness, vanity, transitory, unsatisfactory</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a deadly</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1469;&#1493;&#1462;&#1514;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;we&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4194.htm">Strong's 4194: </a> </span><span class="str2">Death, the dead, their place, state, pestilence, ruin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">pursuit.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1511;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#7687;aq&#183;&#353;&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Participle - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1245.htm">Strong's 1245: </a> </span><span class="str2">To search out, to strive after</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/21-6.htm">Proverbs 21:6 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/21-6.htm">Proverbs 21:6 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/21-6.htm">Proverbs 21:6 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/21-6.htm">Proverbs 21:6 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/21-6.htm">Proverbs 21:6 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/21-6.htm">Proverbs 21:6  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/21-6.htm">Proverbs 21:6 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/21-6.htm">Proverbs 21:6 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/21-6.htm">Proverbs 21:6 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/21-6.htm">Proverbs 21:6 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/21-6.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 21:6 Getting treasures by a lying tongue (Prov.
