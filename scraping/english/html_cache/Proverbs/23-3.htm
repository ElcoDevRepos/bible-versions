In biblical times, sharing a meal was a sign of fellowship and agreement. The delicacies of a ruler or wealthy person could symbolize the allure of worldly pleasures and the temptation to compromise one's values for material gain. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of caution against covetousness and the love of money, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, which warns that the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. The delicacies can also be seen as a metaphor for the seductive nature of sin, which often appears attractive but leads to spiritual harm.<p><b>for that food is deceptive</b><br>The deception of the food highlights the idea that what seems appealing and beneficial on the surface may have hidden dangers. In the historical context, accepting food from a ruler could imply loyalty or obligation, potentially leading to moral compromise. This reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>, which states that there is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death. The deceptive nature of the food can also be seen as a type of the deceitfulness of sin, which promises satisfaction but ultimately leads to destruction. This is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus warns against the leaven of the Pharisees, which represents hypocrisy and false teaching (<a href="/matthew/16-6.htm">Matthew 16:6</a>). The caution here is to remain vigilant and discerning, recognizing that not all that glitters is gold, and to seek wisdom from God to navigate the complexities of life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>- Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
