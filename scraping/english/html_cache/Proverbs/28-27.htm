Throughout Scripture, giving to the poor is seen as a righteous act that aligns with God's heart for justice and mercy. In the Old Testament, the Law provided for the poor through gleaning laws (<a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9-10</a>) and the Year of Jubilee (Leviticus 25). The promise that the giver "will not be in need" reflects the principle of sowing and reaping found in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6-8</a>, where Paul teaches that God loves a cheerful giver and will provide for those who give generously. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>, where He promises that those who give will receive in abundance. The act of giving is not only a physical provision but also a spiritual investment, reflecting the character of Christ, who gave Himself for humanity.<p><b>but he who hides his eyes will receive many curses</b><br>This part of the verse warns against ignoring the needs of the poor. "Hides his eyes" suggests a deliberate choice to avoid seeing or acknowledging the plight of the needy. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, community and kinship were vital, and neglecting the poor was seen as a breach of social and religious duty. The "many curses" can be understood as the natural and divine consequences of such neglect. In <a href="/deuteronomy/27-19.htm">Deuteronomy 27:19</a>, a curse is pronounced on those who pervert justice for the vulnerable, including the poor. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where <a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15-17</a> warns against faith without works, emphasizing that true faith is demonstrated through action, particularly in caring for those in need. The call to care for the poor is a reflection of God's justice and mercy, and neglecting this duty invites divine disfavor.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

actionable call: &#8220;Whoever gives to the poor&#8230;.&#8221; The verse is not offering a suggestion but describing a spiritual reality at work. Scripture consistently holds generosity toward the needy as a hallmark of authentic faith:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the LORD, and He will repay him for his deed&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus affirms in <a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a> that a giving heart sets the stage for God&#8217;s overflowing provision.<p>&#8226; Paul underscores in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6&#8211;8</a> that those who sow generously will reap generously, because &#8220;God loves a cheerful giver.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The Lord identifies personally with the hungry and the thirsty in <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35&#8211;40</a>, revealing that acts of mercy toward the poor are, in His sight, acts done to Him.<p>Giving, then, is both obedience and worship: we reflect the character of a God who &#8220;takes up the case of the poor and needy&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/22-16.htm">Jeremiah 22:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will not be in need</b><p>The promise follows immediately: those who give &#8220;will not be in need.&#8221; This is not prosperity theology but God assuring His faithful that He sees, remembers, and supplies.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/11-24.htm">Proverbs 11:24&#8211;25</a> echoes that &#8220;one gives freely, yet gains even more&#8230; The generous man will prosper.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a> invites believers to &#8220;bring the whole tithe&#8221; and watch heaven&#8217;s windows open.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s life testimony rings out: &#8220;I have been young and now am old, yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/37-25.htm">Psalm 37:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul declares in <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>, &#8220;My God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.&#8221;<p>When we open our hands, God ensures we have enough to keep them open.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but he who hides his eyes</b><p>The contrast sharpens: ignoring need is not neutral. &#8220;Hides his eyes&#8221; pictures deliberate avoidance&#8212;choosing not to see.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7</a> warns Israel not to &#8220;harden your heart or shut your hand&#8221; when a brother is poor.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15&#8211;16</a> rebukes the believer who offers warm words but no practical help.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17</a> drives the point home: &#8220;If anyone has the world&#8217;s goods and sees his brother in need but closes his heart&#8230; how can God&#8217;s love abide in him?&#8221;<p>Indifference contradicts the gospel we profess.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will receive many curses</b><p>Turning away from the poor invites consequences.

Giving to the poor is more than philanthropy; it is fellowship with God&#8217;s own heart. Those who meet need will themselves be met by God, while those who look away forfeit His favor. The verse invites us to live with eyes wide open, hands extended, and confidence that the Lord will supply every generous step we take.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack.--</span>See above on <a href="/proverbs/11-24.htm" title="There is that scatters, and yet increases; and there is that withholds more than is meet, but it tends to poverty.">Proverbs 11:24</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Shall have many a curse.--</span>With this comp. <a href="//apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/4-5.htm" title="Turn not away thine eye from the needy, and give him none occasion to curse thee:">Ecclesiasticus 4:5-6</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack</span> (see <a href="/proverbs/11-24.htm">Proverbs 11:24</a>, etc.; Proverbs 19:17). God in some way compensates what is spent in almsdeeds by shedding his blessing on the benevolent. "Der Geiz," runs the German maxim, "sammlet sich arm, die Milde giebt sich reich," "Charity gives itself rich; covetousness hoards itself poor" (Trench). "Alms," said the rabbis, "are the salt of riches." <span class="cmt_word">But he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse</span> (<a href="/proverbs/11-26.htm">Proverbs 11:26</a>). The uncharitable man either turns away his eyes that he may not see the misery around him, or pretends not to notice it, lest his compassion should be claimed. The expression, "hiding the eyes," occurs in <a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>, "When ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you." The unmerciful man meets with the curses of those whom he has neglected to relieve when he had the power, and such curses are ratified and fulfilled because they are deserved, and Divine retribution attends them (see the opposite view, Ver. 20). "Turn not away thine eye from the needy," says the Son of Sirach, "and give him none occasion to curse thee; for if be curse thee in the bitterness of his soul, his prayer shall be heard of him that made him" (Ecclus 4:4, etc.; comp.
