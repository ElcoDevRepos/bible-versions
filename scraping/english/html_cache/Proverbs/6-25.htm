The heart, in biblical terms, is the center of one's emotions and will. The admonition here is to guard one's heart against covetousness and lust, which are often the precursors to sinful actions. This aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>, where He equates lustful thoughts with adultery. The beauty referenced is a reminder of the seductive power of physical appearance, which can lead one astray if not checked by wisdom and self-control. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, beauty was often associated with temptation, as seen in the story of David and Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11).<p><b>or let her captivate you with her eyes</b><br>The eyes are often seen as windows to the soul and can be instruments of seduction. In the ancient Near Eastern context, women might use their eyes to allure and entice, a theme echoed in the story of Samson and Delilah (Judges 16). The warning here is against being ensnared by superficial charm or flirtation, which can lead to moral and spiritual downfall. This phrase underscores the importance of discernment and the need to focus on inner beauty and character rather than outward appearances. The call is to remain vigilant and not be swayed by fleeting attractions, reflecting the wisdom literature's emphasis on living a life of integrity and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

The "commandment" and the "law" illuminate the path of true life generally, but in a special degree they, if attended to, will guard the young against sins of impurity, fornication, and adultery. <span class="accented">The evil woman</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">esheth ra</span>); strictly, <span class="accented">a woman of evil</span>, or vileness, or of a wicked disposition, addicted to evil in an extraordinary degree; <span class="accented">ra</span> being here a substantive standing in a genitive relation to <span class="accented">esheth, as</span> in <a href="/proverbs/2-12.htm">Proverbs 2:12</a>, "The way of evil (<span class="accented">derek ra</span>)." Cf. also <span class="accented">tah'pukoth ra, perverstates mali</span> (<a href="/proverbs/2-14.htm">Proverbs 2:14</a>), and <span class="accented">makh'sh'voth ra, cogitationes mali</span> (<a href="/proverbs/15-26.htm">Proverbs 15:26</a>), and <span class="accented">an'shey</span> <span class="accented">ra</span>, <span class="accented">viri mali</span> (<a href="/proverbs/28-5.htm">Proverbs 28:5</a>). The Vulgate, however, gives an adjectival force to <span class="accented">ra</span> rendering, it <span class="accented">muliere mala.</span> The LXX. <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "from the married woman," arises from reading <span class="accented">rea</span>, "a companion," for <span class="accented">ra</span>, "evil." <span class="cmt_word">From the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from her enticements; Hebrew, <span class="accented">mekhel'kath lashon noh'riyyah</span>; literally, "from the smoothness of a strange tongue," as in the margin. Zockler, however, proposes an emendation of the Masoretic text, and substitutes the construct case, <span class="accented">l'shon</span>, for the absolute, <span class="accented">lashon</span>, rendering as in the Authorized Version, on the ground that the emphasis lies, not on the "tongue," which would be the case if we render "of a strange tongue," but on "the strange woman," who is the subject of the discourse, as in <a href="/proverbs/2-16.htm">Proverbs 2:16</a> and Proverbs 5:20. But <span class="accented">nok'riyyah</span> is feminine of the adjective <span class="accented">nok'ri</span>, ann in agreement with <span class="accented">lashon</span>, which, though common, is more frequently feminine (Gesenius), and hence the two words may stand in agreement. The marginal reading is to be preferred (Wordsworth). Again, <span class="accented">me</span>-<span class="accented">khel'kath</span>, the construct ease of <span class="accented">khel'kah</span>, literally, "smoothness," and metaphorically flattery, with the prefix <span class="accented">me</span>, forms one member of the phrase, while the compound expression, <span class="accented">lashon nok'riyyah</span>, forms the second. Ewald and Bertheau render, "from the smooth-tongued, the strange woman," thus connecting <span class="accented">mekhel'kath lashon</span>, and regarding <span class="accented">nok'riyyah</span> as a separate and distinct idea. They agree with Symmachus and Theodotion, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "from the smooth-tongued or flattering stranger." So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">blanda lingua extraneae, i.e.</span> from the smooth tongue of the strange woman. The LXX. again favours the marginal reading, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3bb;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "from the slander of a strange tongue." So the Chaldee Paraphrase. The Syriac reads, "from the accusation of a woman of a strange tongue," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> who uses a foreign language. If, however, the Authorized Version be retained, the Hebrew <span class="accented">nok'riyyah</span> will, as in other passages, mean "an adulteress" (Gesenius); <a href="/proverbs/5-20.htm">Proverbs 5:20</a>; <a href="/proverbs/7-5.htm">Proverbs 7:5</a>; <a href="/proverbs/23-27.htm">Proverbs 23:27</a>. Under any circumstances, we have here attributed to the tongue what, in fact, belongs to the woman. It is against the enticements and blandishments of a woman of depraved moral character that the "commandment" and "law" form a safeguard to youth. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lust not after her beauty in thine heart</span>. The admonition of this verse embraces the two sides of the subject - the external allurement and the internal predisposition to vice. <span class="accented">Lust not after</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">al-takh'mod</span>); strictly, <span class="accented">desire not</span>, since the verb <span class="accented">khamad</span> is properly" to desire, or covet." The same verb is used in <a href="/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a>, "Thou shalt not <span class="accented">covet</span> thy neighbour's wife," and <a href="/exodus/34-24.htm">Exodus 34:24</a>, "Neither shall any man <span class="accented">desire</span> thy land" (cf. <a href="/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a> and <a href="/proverbs/12-12.htm">Proverbs 12:12</a>). In <a href="/psalms/68-19.htm">Psalm 68:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-29.htm">Isaiah 1:29</a>; <a href="/isaiah/53-2.htm">Isaiah 53:2</a>, it has the sense of <span class="accented">taking delight</span> in anything. It may be questioned whether it ever has the strong meaning given in the Vulgate (<span class="accented">non concupiscat</span>) and adopted in the Authorized Version, "to lust after" (Holden). Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus render <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>. The use of <span class="accented">khamad</span> here reveals the warning of the Decalogue. <span class="accented">In thine heart</span>; Hebrew, <span class="accented">bil'va-veka</span>. corresponding to the <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> of <a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>. The admonition is a warning to repress the very first inclinations to unchaste desires. They may be unobserved and undetected by ethers, but they are known to ourselves, and the first duty of repressing them calls for an act of determination and will on our part. Our Lord teaches (<a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>, cited above), "That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart." The LXX. reading is <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, "Let not the desire of beauty conquer thee." <span class="cmt_word">Neither let her take thee with her eyelids;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> do not let her captivate thee with her amorous glances. <span class="accented">Take.</span> The Hebrew verb, <span class="accented">lakakh</span>, is "to captivate" with blandishments, "to allure, beguile" (cf. <a href="/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30</a>); LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="accented">With her eyelids</span> (Hebrew, <span class="accented">b'aph'appeyah</span>); or perhaps more literally, <span class="accented">with her eyelashes</span> (Zockler). The eyelids; Hebrew, <span class="accented">aph'appayim</span>, dual of <span class="accented">aph'aph</span>, so called from their rapid, volatile motion, are here compared with <span class="accented">nets</span>, as by Philostratus ('Epistles:' <span class="greek">&#x393;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;</span>), who speaks of "the nets of the eyes (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;</span>)." The eyelids are the instruments by which the amorous woman beguiles or catches her victims. She allures him by her glances. So St. Jerome says, "The eye of an harlot is the snare of her lover." The wanton glance is expressed in the Vulgate by <span class="accented">nutibus illius</span>; cf. "The whoredom of a woman may be known in her haughty looks and eyelids" (Ecclus. 26:9). Milton ('Paradise Lost,' 11:620) speaks of the daughters of men "rolling the eye," amongst other things, in order to captivate the sons of God. Piscator and Mercerus understand the eyelids as standing metonymically for the beauty of the eye; and Bayne, for the general adornment of the head in order to attract attention. Allusion may possibly be made to the custom of Eastern women painting the eyelids to give brilliancy and expression; cf. <a href="/2_kings/9-30.htm">2 Kings 9:30</a> (Wordsworth).
