A fortified city symbolized security and strength. Wealth, in this context, is seen as providing a similar sense of security for the rich man. However, this security is often illusory, as wealth can be fleeting. The Bible frequently warns against placing trust in riches (<a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>). The imagery of a fortified city also contrasts with the true refuge found in God, as seen in Psalms 18:2, where God is described as a fortress and deliverer.<p><b>it is like a high wall in his imagination.</b><br>The high wall represents an exaggerated sense of security that wealth provides. This phrase suggests that the rich man's confidence in his wealth is more about perception than reality. The Bible often highlights the deceptive nature of riches (<a href="/proverbs/23-4.htm">Proverbs 23:4-5</a>). The "imagination" indicates that this security is not as solid as it appears, echoing Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a> about storing treasures in heaven rather than on earth. This also points to the spiritual blindness that can accompany wealth, as seen in the parable of the rich fool in <a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>, where the man's trust in his abundant possessions leads to his downfall.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rich_man.htm">Rich Man</a></b><br>Represents individuals who possess significant material wealth and resources.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/fortified_city.htm">Fortified City</a></b><br>Symbolizes a place of security and protection, often used in ancient times to describe a city with strong defenses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_wall.htm">High Wall</a></b><br>Represents a barrier or defense mechanism, suggesting a sense of safety and invulnerability.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/imagination.htm">Imagination</a></b><br>Refers to the mental perception or belief of the rich man regarding his wealth as a source of security.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/false_security_of_wealth.htm">False Security of Wealth</a></b><br>Wealth can create a false sense of security, leading individuals to trust in their resources rather than in God.

Yet the same book warns, &#8220;Riches are worthless in the day of wrath&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Money can indeed meet certain earthly needs&#8212;food, shelter, medicine, legal help&#8212;so the image has some grounding in reality. Still, its protection is limited.<p>&#8226; Notice the contrast in the previous verse: &#8220;The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>). The inspired author sets true safety (the Lord) against perceived safety (wealth).<p>&#8226; Other voices echo the point:<p>&#8211; &#8220;He who trusts in his riches will fall&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;Some trust in chariots and others in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;Command those who are rich&#8230; not to put their hope in the uncertainty of wealth&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-17.htm">1 Timothy 6:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Riches can be a blessing when held loosely and stewarded faithfully (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9&#8211;10</a>), yet they make a terrible savior.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it is like a high wall in his imagination</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;high wall&#8221; suggests invincibility, yet Scripture exposes the illusion: &#8220;When you gaze at wealth, it disappears, for it sprouts wings flying off to the sky like an eagle&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/23-5.htm">Proverbs 23:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The key phrase is &#8220;in his imagination.&#8221; The security exists mainly in his mind; reality tells another story.<p>&#8226; Jesus illustrates the same self-deception in the parable of the rich fool who planned larger barns and said, &#8220;Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-19.htm">Luke 12:19</a>), but God called him to account that very night.<p>&#8226; Walls can crumble suddenly: economic collapse, illness money can&#8217;t cure, judgment day. &#8220;Riches do not profit in the day of wrath&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Instead of imaginary walls, the Lord offers genuine refuge: &#8220;God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in times of trouble&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/18-11.htm">Proverbs 18:11</a> exposes the false security wealth can create. Money may function like a fortified city and a towering wall, yet only in the mind of the one who trusts it. Lasting safety rests not in possessions but in the Lord, whose name is the strong tower immediately preceding this verse.
