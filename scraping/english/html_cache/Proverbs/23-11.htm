This role is exemplified in the Book of Ruth, where Boaz acts as a kinsman-redeemer for Ruth and Naomi. The strength of the Redeemer here emphasizes God's power and authority to defend and deliver His people. This is a reflection of God's covenant relationship with Israel, where He is portrayed as a protector and deliverer. The strength of the Redeemer also foreshadows the ultimate Redeemer, Jesus Christ, who is strong to save and deliver humanity from sin.<p><b>He will take up their case against you.</b><br>This phrase indicates divine justice and advocacy. In the ancient Near Eastern legal system, taking up a case was akin to acting as an advocate or defender in a legal dispute. God is portrayed as the ultimate judge who will defend the rights of the oppressed and marginalized, particularly the fatherless and widows, as seen throughout the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>, <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>). This assurance of divine justice serves as a warning against exploiting the vulnerable, reminding believers of God's righteous character. The advocacy role of God here can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described in the New Testament as our advocate with the Father (1 <a href="/john/2.htm">John 2:1</a>), interceding on behalf of believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/redeemer.htm">Redeemer</a></b><br>In the context of this verse, the "Redeemer" refers to God Himself, who acts as a protector and defender of the oppressed. The term "Redeemer" (Hebrew: go'el) is often used in the Old Testament to describe someone who rescues or redeems, particularly in the context of family or kinship obligations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oppressed.htm">The Oppressed</a></b><br>While not explicitly mentioned in this verse, the context implies that there are individuals who are being wronged or oppressed, and God is their advocate.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oppressors.htm">The Oppressors</a></b><br>Those who are acting unjustly or taking advantage of others, against whom God will take up the case.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_our_defender.htm">God as Our Defender</a></b><br>God is portrayed as a strong and capable defender of those who are wronged. Believers can find comfort in knowing that God is actively involved in their lives, advocating for justice on their behalf.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_strength_of_the_redeemer.htm">The Strength of the Redeemer</a></b><br>The verse emphasizes the strength of the Redeemer. This strength is not just physical but also moral and spiritual, ensuring that justice will ultimately prevail.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_divine_justice.htm">Trust in Divine Justice</a></b><br>While human justice systems can fail, God's justice is perfect and unfailing.
