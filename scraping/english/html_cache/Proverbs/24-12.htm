In biblical context, it reflects the call for personal responsibility and accountability. The law of Moses emphasized the importance of knowing and following God's commandments (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-11.htm">Deuteronomy 30:11-14</a>). Ignorance is not a valid defense when it comes to moral and spiritual obligations, as God has made His will known through His Word and creation (<a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>).<p><b>does not He who weighs hearts consider it?</b><br>God's ability to weigh hearts signifies His omniscience and His role as the ultimate judge of human intentions and thoughts. This echoes <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God tells Samuel that He looks at the heart rather than outward appearances. The heart, in biblical terms, represents the center of one's being, including thoughts, emotions, and will. God's discernment of the heart underscores His intimate knowledge of each person, beyond mere actions.<p><b>Does not the One who guards your life know?</b><br>This phrase highlights God's sovereignty and protective nature. The imagery of God as a guardian is prevalent throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/121-7.htm">Psalm 121:7-8</a>, where God is described as the keeper of His people. It reassures believers of God's constant vigilance and care, affirming that nothing escapes His notice. This also implies that God is aware of all circumstances and intentions, reinforcing the call to live righteously.<p><b>Will He not repay a man according to his deeds?</b><br>The principle of divine retribution is a consistent theme in the Bible, where God rewards or punishes individuals based on their actions. This is seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a> and <a href="/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6</a>, which affirm that God will render to each person according to their deeds. It serves as both a warning and an encouragement, urging believers to pursue righteousness and trust in God's just nature. This principle also foreshadows the final judgment, where Christ will judge all humanity (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/he_who_weighs_hearts.htm">He who weighs hearts</a></b><br>This refers to God, who is omniscient and judges the true intentions and thoughts of individuals.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/he_who_guards_your_life.htm">He who guards your life</a></b><br>Again, this is a reference to God, emphasizing His role as protector and overseer of human life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/a_man.htm">A man</a></b><br>This represents any individual who might try to excuse their inaction or ignorance regarding moral responsibilities.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience.htm">God's Omniscience</a></b><br>We cannot hide our true intentions or ignorance from God.

St. Jerome makes the excuse to be inability, <span class="accented">vires</span> <span class="accented">non suppetunt</span>. The LXX. makes it a personal matter, ignoring the plural form of the previous paragraph. "I know him not, he is no friend of mine; why should I trouble myself about him?"
