The streets represent public places where people gather, symbolizing that wisdom is accessible to all. In ancient Israel, city streets were bustling with activity, making them ideal for public announcements. This imagery suggests that wisdom is not hidden or exclusive but available to everyone who seeks it. The call of wisdom in public spaces echoes the prophetic tradition, where prophets often delivered messages in public to ensure they reached a wide audience. This aligns with the biblical theme that God desires all people to know and follow His ways.<p><b>She lifts her voice in the square</b><br>The square, or marketplace, was the center of social and economic life in ancient cities. It was a place of commerce, legal proceedings, and social interaction. By lifting her voice in the square, wisdom is portrayed as actively seeking to engage with people in their daily lives. This setting emphasizes the practical nature of wisdom, as it applies to everyday decisions and interactions. The public proclamation of wisdom in the square can be seen as a type of Christ, who also taught in public places and called people to follow Him. This connection highlights the continuity of God's revelation through wisdom and the teachings of Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom.htm">Wisdom</a></b><br>Personified as a woman, Wisdom is depicted as actively seeking to impart knowledge and understanding to those who will listen.

Rejecting it is therefore a choice, not a necessity; embracing it brings the blessings promised throughout Proverbs.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(b)<span class= "ital"> Second Discourse:</span>--<span class= "ital">Wisdom Addresses her Despisers </span>(<a href="/context/proverbs/1-20.htm" title="Wisdom cries without; she utters her voice in the streets:">Proverbs 1:20-33</a>).<p>(20) <span class= "bld">Wisdom.--</span>The form of the Hebrew term (<span class= "ital">chokhmoth</span>) has been taken for an abstract singular noun, but probably it is the plural of <span class= "ital">chokhmah </span>(<a href="/proverbs/1-2.htm" title="To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;">Proverbs 1:2</a>), signifying the multiform excellences of wisdom. It is possible that Solomon may have originally meant in this passage only to describe, in highly poetic language, the influence and work in their generation of those in whom "the fear of the Lord" dwells. So, too, many of the Psalms (Psalms 45, for example), in the first instance it would seem, are intended to describe the excellence of some earthly saint or king, yet they are completely fulfilled only in the Son of man, the ideal of all that is noblest and best in man. And thus the description of Wisdom in her manifold activity, as represented in Proverbs 1, 8, 9, so closely corresponds to the work of our Lord, as depicted in the New Testament, that from the earliest times of Christianity these passages have been held to be a prophecy of Him; and there is good reason for such a view. For a comparison of <a href="/luke/11-49.htm" title="Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:">Luke 11:49</a> ("Therefore also said the wisdom of God, Behold, I send," &c.) with <a href="/matthew/23-34.htm" title="Why, behold, I send to you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them you shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall you whip in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city:">Matthew 23:34</a> (where He says, "Behold, I send") would seem to show that He applied the title to Himself. St. Paul in like manner speaks of Him as the "Wisdom of God" (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm" title="But to them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.">1Corinthians 1:24</a>); says He has been "made unto us wisdom" (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-30.htm" title="But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:">1Corinthians 1:30</a>); and that in Him "are hid all the treasures of wisdom" (<a href="/colossians/2-3.htm" title=" In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.">Colossians 2:3</a>). For passages from the Fathers embodying this view, see references in Bishop Wordsworth on this chapter. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-33.</span> - 2. <span class="accented">Second admonitory discourse. Address of Wisdom personified, exhibing the folly of those who wilfully reject, and the security of those who hearken to, her counsels.</span> The sacred writer, in this section, as also in ch. 8, uses the rhetorical figure of prosopopceia, or impersonation. Wisdom is represented as speaking and as addressing the simple, scorners, and fools. The address itself is one of the noblest specimens of sacred eloquence, expressing in rapid succession the strongest phases of feeling - pathetic solicitude with abundant promise, indignant scorn at the rejection of her appeal, the judicial severity of offended majesty upon offenders, and lastly the judicial complacency which delights in mercy towards the obedient. The imagery in part is taken from the forces of nature in their irresistible and overwhelming violence and destructive potency. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wisdom crieth without.</span> <span class="accented">Wisdom</span>. The Hebrew word (<span class="accented">khochmoth</span>) here used to designate Wisdom seems to be an abstract derivation from the ordinary <span class="accented">khochmah.</span> The form is peculiar to the Proverbs and Psalms, in the former occurring four times (<a href="/proverbs/1-22.htm">Proverbs 1:22</a>; <a href="/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-1.htm">Proverbs 14:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/24-7.htm">Proverbs 24:7</a>), and in the latter twice only (viz. <a href="/psalms/49-4.htm">Psalm 49:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-15.htm">Psalm 78:15</a>). As in <a href="/proverbs/9-1.htm">Proverbs 9:1</a> and Proverbs 24:7, it is a <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae</span> of the feminine gender, a variety of the <span class="accented">pluralis extensivus</span>, as Bottcher prefers to denominate it. The feminine form may he determined by the general law which associates purity and serenity with womanhood (Plumptre). The idea of plurality, however, is not that of extension, but of comprehension, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it is not so much all kinds of wisdom which is presented to us, as all the varieties under which wisdom <span class="accented">par excellence</span> may be regarded and is comprehended. The plural form of the word denotes the highest character or excellence in which wisdom can be conceived; or, as the marginal reading expresses it, wisdoms, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> excellent wisdom. Other instances of the <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae</span> are met with in Holy Writ, <span class="accented">e.g. Elohim</span>, God, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "God of Gods," either from the polytheistic view, or from the monotheistic view as expressive of God's might in manifestation, <span class="accented">passim</span>; <span class="accented">k'doshim</span>, "the Holy (God)," <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/30-3.htm">Proverbs 30:3</a>; <span class="accented">adonim</span>, for <span class="accented">adon</span> "lord" (Gesenius, 'Gram.,' &sect; 108. 2 <span class="accented">b</span>). In the conception of Wisdom here presented to us in the text we have the germ of an idea which, on the principles of expansion, developed subsequently in the consciousness of the Christian Church into a definite identification of Wisdom with the Second Person of the blessed Trinity. There is a striking parallel to this passage in <a href="/luke/11-49.htm">Luke 11:49</a>, where Christ speaks of himself as <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "the Wisdom of God," that shall send prophets and apostles into the world, and thereby identifies himself with Wisdom (cf. this with vers. 20, 21; ch. 7.). Again, a striking similarity is observable between the teaching of Divine Wisdom and that of the Incarnate Word, as much in their promises as in their threats and warnings. But it is difficult to determine with accuracy to what extent the Messianic import of the personification was present to the <span class="accented">consciousness</span> of the sacred writers, and whether Wisdom as here presented to us is simply a poetic and abstract personification or a distinct by-postatizing of the Word. Dorner ('Pers. of Christ,' Introd., p. 16), with reference to ch. 8:22, etc., says that though Wisdom is introduced speaking as a personality distinct from God, still the passage does not lead clearly to an hypostatizing of the Khochmah. Dollinger ('Heidenthum und Judenthum,' bk. 10. pt. 3. sec. 2 <span class="accented">a</span>, and <a href="/proverbs/8-22.htm">Proverbs 8:22</a>, etc.) maintains that Wisdom is "the personified idea of the mind of God in creation," rather than the presence of "a distinct hypostasis." Lucke (see references in Liddon, 'Bampton Lects.') holds that in Proverbs Wisdom is merely a personification It is clear that whatever is predicated of Wisdom in ch. 8. must be also predicated of her in the passage before us, in reference either to the hypostatic or opposite view. On the other hand, a large number of expositors, dating from the earliest periods of the Christian Church down to the present time, see in Wisdom a distinct hypostasis, or person - the Lord Jesus Christ. A fuller investigation of this subject will be seen in our remarks on ch. 8. For the present we observe that Wisdom is essentially Divine. Her authority, her utterances, whether of promise, threat, scorn, or vengeance, are the authority, the utterances, of God. <span class="accented">Crieth</span>; rather, <span class="accented">crieth loudly</span>, or <span class="accented">aloud.</span> The Hebrew verb <span class="accented">ranan</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5df;</span>) is "to vibrate the voice," and conveys the idea of the clear loud ringing tones with which proclamations were made; cf. the Vulgate <span class="accented">praedicare</span>, and the Arabic <span class="accented">clamitate</span>, "to cry with a loud voice." Fleischer remarks that the Arabic <span class="accented">rannan</span>, which is allied to the Hebrew verb, is used of a speaker who has a clear piercing voice. In such a way does Wisdom cry without when making her address. She elevates her voice that all may hear. The verb in the original is <span class="accented">tazonnah</span>, the feminine singular of <span class="accented">ranan</span>, and predicate to "Wisdom," according to the rule that verbs in the singular are construed with plural nouns having a singular signification, especially the <span class="accented">pluralis excellentiae</span> (see Gesenius, 'Gram.,' &sect; 146. 2). <span class="accented">Without.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span> (<span class="accented">bakhuts</span>) is here used adverbially, as in <a href="/genesis/9-22.htm">Genesis 9:22</a>, and signifies "in the open places," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> abroad, without, as opposed to the space within the walls.
