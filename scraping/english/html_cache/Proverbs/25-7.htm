In the cultural context of ancient Israel, social hierarchy was significant, and being publicly honored by a superior was a mark of distinction. This echoes the teaching of Jesus in <a href="/luke/14-8.htm">Luke 14:8-11</a>, where He advises taking the lowest place at a banquet to be honored by the host. The principle of humility is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting the importance of letting others elevate you rather than self-promotion.<p><b>than that you should be demoted in the presence of the prince.</b><br>This part of the verse warns against the shame and embarrassment of being publicly demoted. In the historical context, a prince or ruler had the authority to elevate or demote individuals, and such actions were often carried out in public settings. The wisdom literature often contrasts the outcomes of pride versus humility, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall." The cultural expectation was to know one's place and wait for recognition rather than seeking it presumptuously.<p><b>Even what you have seen with your own eyes,</b><br>This phrase suggests the importance of personal experience and observation in understanding and applying wisdom. It implies that one should be cautious even with what seems evident, as appearances can be deceiving. This aligns with the biblical theme of discernment, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which advises trusting in the Lord rather than one's understanding.

Think banquets or royal courts where guests wait for the host&#8217;s direction. Scripture consistently commends humility that lets others exalt us rather than grabbing a spotlight for ourselves:<p>&#8226; Jesus echoes this wisdom in <a href="/luke/14-8.htm">Luke 14:8-10</a>: &#8220;When you are invited to a wedding banquet, do not take the place of honor&#8230; Then the host&#8230; will say to you, &#8216;Friend, move up higher.&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a> reminds, &#8220;Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will exalt you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_peter/5-6.htm">1 Peter 5:6</a> repeats the same rhythm&#8212;humble first, honor later.<p>Choosing the lower place says, &#8220;I trust God to decide when and how to lift me up.&#8221; It keeps our hearts free from striving, envy, or resentment if promotion seems slow.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Than to be demoted in the presence of the prince</b><p>Nothing stings quite like public embarrassment&#8212;especially before someone powerful. Proverbs warns that self-advancement can backfire:<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>: &#8220;Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/esther/6-6.htm">Esther 6:6-10</a> gives a living example in Haman, who assumed the king meant to honor him and ended up honoring his rival.<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/23-12.htm">Matthew 23:12</a>: &#8220;Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted.&#8221;<p>The principle is simple: God values character over position. He can safeguard us from humiliating reversals when we refuse to push ourselves forward.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even what you have seen with your own eyes</b><p>The closing line reminds us that our eyesight&#8212;and insight&#8212;can still be limited. We may think we know enough to seize the seat of honor, but only the Lord and the &#8220;prince&#8221; see the full picture. He calls us to hold our conclusions loosely:<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>: &#8220;Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_corinthians/8-2.htm">1 Corinthians 8:2</a>: &#8220;The one who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/42-3.htm">Job 42:3</a>: &#8220;Surely I spoke of things I did not understand, things too wonderful for me to know.&#8221;<p>Remembering our finite perspective keeps us teachable and willing to wait for a higher invitation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/25-7.htm">Proverbs 25:7</a> teaches the freedom and safety of humility. Let the Lord, not self-promotion, determine timing and honor. Waiting for the &#8220;Come up here!&#8221; avoids the shame of a forced retreat and acknowledges that our own eyes never see the whole story.

The reference is not necessarily to position at a royal banquet, though the maxim lends itself readily to such application. This warbling against arrogance and presumption was used by our blessed Lord in enforcing a lesson of humility and self-discipline (<a href="/luke/14-7.htm">Luke 14:7</a>, etc ). Septuagint, "For it is better for thee that it should be said, Come up unto me (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;</span>)" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="/luke/14-7.htm">Luke 14:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.</span> The last words have been variously interpreted: "to whom thou hast come with a request for preferment;" "into whose august presence thou hast been admitted, so as to see his face" (<a href="/2_samuel/14-24.htm">2 Samuel 14:24</a>); "who knows all about thee, and will thus make thee feel thy humiliation all the more." But <span class="accented">nadib</span>, rendered "prince," is not the king, but any noble or great man; and what the maxim means is this - that it is wise to save yourself from the mortification of being turned out of a place which you have knowingly usurped. Your own eyes see that he is in the company; you are aware of what is his proper position; you have occupied a post which belongs to another; justly you are removed, and all present witness your humiliation. The moralist knew that the bad spirit of pride was fostered and encouraged by every act of self-assertion; hence the importance of his warning. The Septuagint makes a separate sentence of these last words, "Speak thou of what thine eyes saw," or, perhaps, like St. Jerome, the Syriac, and Symmachus, attach them to the next verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/25-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it is better</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1496;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2896.htm">Strong's 2896: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pleasant, agreeable, good</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that he says</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;m&#257;r-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1431;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
