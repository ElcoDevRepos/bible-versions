In ancient Israel, as in many societies, wealth often translated into social and political influence. The rich, by virtue of their resources, could exert control over the less fortunate, shaping societal structures to their advantage. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:8</a>, which acknowledges the oppression of the poor and the perversion of justice. The Bible frequently warns against the misuse of wealth and power, urging the rich to act justly and to care for the needy, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a> and <a href="/james/2-6.htm">James 2:6</a>.<p><b>and the borrower is slave to the lender</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the vulnerability and dependency that come with debt. In the ancient Near East, borrowing often led to a loss of freedom, as debtors could become indentured servants if they failed to repay their loans. This reality is reflected in the laws of the Old Testament, such as those found in <a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39-43</a>, which provide guidelines for the treatment of debt slaves. The imagery of slavery here is potent, illustrating the loss of autonomy and the burden of obligation that debt imposes. This principle is timeless, warning against the dangers of financial overextension and encouraging prudent stewardship of resources. The New Testament also speaks to the spiritual dimension of debt, with Jesus Christ offering freedom from the ultimate debt of sin, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/6-18.htm">Romans 6:18</a>, where believers are described as being set free from sin and becoming slaves to righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rich.htm">The Rich</a></b><br>Individuals who possess wealth and resources, often having influence and power over others.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poor.htm">The Poor</a></b><br>Those who lack financial resources and are often subject to the authority or control of the wealthy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_borrower.htm">The Borrower</a></b><br>A person who takes on debt, thereby entering into a relationship of obligation to the lender.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lender.htm">The Lender</a></b><br>The individual or entity that provides resources or money to the borrower, establishing a position of authority over them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_financial_authority.htm">Understanding Financial Authority</a></b><br>Recognize that wealth often brings power and influence, which can be used for good or ill.

Verse 7 sits amid warnings about the snares of wealth, pride, and unjust gain (vv. 8&#8211;16).

The verse calls us to handle resources humbly, avoid unnecessary borrowing, protect the poor, and use any influence for godly service. Ultimate liberation comes through Christ, who cancels sin&#8217;s debt and equips His people to steward finances in a way that blesses others and honors Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The rich ruleth over the poor.</span> "The rich man (singular) will rule over the poor" (plural); for there are many poor for one rich (see on ver. 3). This is the way of the world (<a href="/proverbs/18-23.htm">Proverbs 18:23</a>). Aben Ezra explains the gnome as showing the advantage of wealth and the inconvenience of poverty; the former bringing power and pre-eminence, the latter trouble and servitude; and hence the moralist implies that every one should strive and labour to obtain a competency, and thus avoid the evils of impecuniosity. The borrower is servant to the lender. (For the relation between borrower and louder, or debtor and creditor, see on Proverbs 20:16; and comp. <a href="/matthew/18-25.htm">Matthew 18:25, 34</a>.) Delitzsch cites the German saying, "Borghart (borrower) is Lehnhart's (leader's) servant." We have the proverb, "He that goes a-borrowing goes a-sorrowing." The Septuagint departs from the other versions and our Hebrew text, translating, "The rich will role over the poor, and household servants will lend to their own masters" - a reading on which some of the Fathers have commented. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/22-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The rich</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1453;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6223.htm">Strong's 6223: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rich</span><br /><br /><span class="word">rule</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yim&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;wl)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4910.htm">Strong's 4910: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rule, have dominion, reign</span><br /><br /><span class="word">over the poor,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7326.htm">Strong's 7326: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be in want or poor</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and the borrower</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1437;&#1493;&#1462;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3867.htm">Strong's 3867: </a> </span><span class="str2">To twine, to unite, to remain, to borrow, to lend</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is slave</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1462;&#1445;&#1489;&#1462;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;e&#183;&#7687;e&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5650.htm">Strong's 5650: </a> </span><span class="str2">Slave, servant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the lender.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1493;&#1462;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3867.htm">Strong's 3867: </a> </span><span class="str2">To twine, to unite, to remain, to borrow, to lend</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/22-7.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 22:7 The rich rule over the poor (Prov.
