In biblical terms, a "fool" is not merely someone lacking intelligence, but rather someone who rejects God's ways and wisdom (<a href="/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>). Wisdom, often personified in Proverbs, is portrayed as something that requires humility and the fear of the Lord to attain (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The "height" of wisdom suggests its exalted nature, something that requires effort and divine assistance to reach. This aligns with the biblical theme that true wisdom comes from God and is beyond human grasp without His revelation (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p><b>he does not open his mouth in the meeting place.</b><br>In ancient Israel, the "meeting place" or "gate" was where community leaders gathered to make decisions and dispense justice (<a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1-11</a>). It was a place of public discourse and legal proceedings. The fool's inability to speak in such a setting underscores his lack of understanding and credibility. This reflects the cultural context where wisdom and eloquence were highly valued in public life. The fool's silence is not just a lack of words but a lack of meaningful contribution, contrasting with the wise who are able to speak with authority and insight (<a href="/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>). This also serves as a warning about the consequences of rejecting wisdom, as it leads to exclusion from important communal and spiritual discussions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fool.htm">The Fool</a></b><br>In the context of Proverbs, the fool is someone who rejects wisdom and understanding, often characterized by a lack of moral insight and discernment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom.htm">Wisdom</a></b><br>A central theme in Proverbs, wisdom is portrayed as a valuable and divine attribute that guides righteous living and decision-making.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_meeting_place.htm">The Meeting Place</a></b><br>This refers to a public setting where community discussions or judgments occur, often a place where wisdom and discernment are required.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_wisdom.htm">The Value of Wisdom</a></b><br>Wisdom is portrayed as a treasure that is beyond the reach of those who reject it.

"Wisdom" (<span class="accented">chochmoth</span>) is in the plural number, intimating the various attributes connoted by it, or the different aspects in which it may be regarded (see note on Proverbs 1:20). "Too high" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, <span class="accented">ramoth</span>) is also plural; and Delitzsch and Nowack take it to mean, not so much "high things" as "precious things," such as pearls or precious stones, in accordance with <a href="/job/28-18.htm">Job 28:18</a>, "No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; yea,. the price of wisdom is above rubies." In this sense Delitzsch translates, "Wisdom seems to the fool to be an ornamental commodity," a costly and unnecessary appendage, which is not worth the sacrifices entailed by its pursuit. Whichever way we take it, the point is the rarity and inaccessibility of wisdom, and the repugnance of fools to make any exertion in order to obtain it. St. Augustine thus sums up the steps by which wisdom is reached: fear of God, piety, knowledge, fortitude, mercifulness, sincerity ('De Doctr. Christ.,' 2:7). <span class="cmt_word">He openeth not him month in the gate.</span> When men gather in the usual place of assembly (<a href="/proverbs/8-3.htm">Proverbs 8:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/22-2.htm">Proverbs 22:2</a>), to take counsel on public matters, he has nothing to say; he listens fatuously, and is silent.
