In biblical context, the "corner" often symbolizes a place of decision or temptation. The imagery of a corner can also imply a hidden or secretive area, where one might encounter unexpected dangers. In ancient cities, corners were places where people gathered, and they could be associated with both social interaction and illicit activities. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of avoiding the path of the wicked (<a href="/proverbs/4-14.htm">Proverbs 4:14-15</a>). The act of crossing the street suggests a transition from safety to potential danger, echoing the biblical call to remain on the path of righteousness and avoid the snares of sin.<p><b>strolling down the road to her house</b><br>The word "strolling" implies a casual, perhaps careless, approach, highlighting a lack of vigilance or awareness of the impending danger. This leisurely pace contrasts with the urgency often advised in Scripture to flee from sin (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-18.htm">1 Corinthians 6:18</a>). The "road to her house" signifies a path leading to temptation and sin, specifically in the context of Proverbs, which frequently warns against the seduction of the adulterous woman (<a href="/proverbs/5-8.htm">Proverbs 5:8</a>). Historically, roads in ancient times were not just physical pathways but also represented moral and spiritual journeys. The house, in this context, symbolizes a place of moral compromise and spiritual danger. This imagery serves as a warning to avoid not just the act of sin, but the very path that leads to it, emphasizing the importance of making wise choices and staying true to God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_young_man.htm">The Young Man</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, representing someone lacking wisdom and discernment, who is easily led astray by temptation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman's_corner.htm">The Woman's Corner</a></b><br>Symbolic of temptation and danger, this location represents the proximity to sin and the ease with which one can be ensnared.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_street/road.htm">The Street/Road</a></b><br>Represents the path of life and the choices one makes.
