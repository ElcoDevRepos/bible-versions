Throughout the Bible, the concept of divine providence is prevalent, suggesting that God orchestrates the events of the world and the lives of people. In the context of ancient Israel, this understanding would have been comforting, as it assured the Israelites that their lives were under divine guidance. This aligns with passages like <a href="/jeremiah/10-23.htm">Jeremiah 10:23</a>, which acknowledges that a person's path is not solely determined by their own decisions. Theologically, this reflects the belief that God has a plan for each person, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>, where believers are described as created for good works prepared by God.<p><b>so how can anyone understand his own way?</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights human limitations in comprehending the full scope of God's plan. It suggests humility and reliance on divine wisdom rather than human understanding. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, wisdom literature often explored themes of human limitation and the need for divine insight. This is echoed in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, which advises trusting in the Lord rather than one's own understanding. The phrase also resonates with the story of Joseph in Genesis, where his life's path, though fraught with challenges, ultimately fulfilled God's purpose. This underscores the idea that while humans may not always understand their journey, it is part of a larger divine narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

So the Septuagint has <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;</span> in one clause and <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span> in the other. The proverb says that the steps of a great and powerful man depend, as their final cause, upon the Lord; he conditions and controls results. Man has free will, and is responsible for his actions, but God foreknows them, and holds the thread that connects them together; he gives preventing grace; he gives efficient grace: and man blindly works out the designs of Omnipotence according as he obeys or resists. A similar maxim is found in <a href="/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>, "A man's goings are established of the Lord," but the meaning there is that it is God's aid which enables a man to do certain actions. Here we have very much the same intimation that is found in <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a> and Proverbs 19:21; and see note on Proverbs 16:9. Hence arises the old prayer used formerly at prime, and inserted now (with some omissions) at the end of the Anglican Communion Service: "O almighty Lord, and everlasting God, vouchsafe, we beseech thee, to direct, sanctify, and govern, both our hearts and bodies, our thoughts, words, and actions, in the ways of thy laws, and in the works of thy commandments; that through thy most mighty protection we may be preserved both here and forever." If man cannot see all sides, as God does, cannot comprehend the beginning, middle, and end in one view, how then can a man (a weak mortal) understand his own ways. How can he find out of himself whither he should go, or what will be the issue of his doings (comp. <a href="/proverbs/16-25.htm">Proverbs 16:25</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/10-23.htm">Jeremiah 10:23</a>)? St. Gregory, "It is well said by Solomon [<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 9:1</a>], 'There are righteous and wise men, and their works are in the hand of God; and yet no man knoweth whether he is deserving of love or of hatred; but all things are kept uncertain for the time to come.' Hence it is said again by the same Solomon, 'What man will be able to understand his own way?' And any one doing good or evil is doubtless known by the testimony of his own conscience. But it is said that their own way is not known to men, for this reason, because, even if a man understands that he is acting rightly, yet he knows not, under the strict inquiry, whither he is going" ('Moral.,' 29:34). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/proverbs/20-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">A man&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1464;&#1425;&#1489;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7713;&#257;&#183;&#7687;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1397.htm">Strong's 1397: </a> </span><span class="str2">A valiant man, warrior, a person simply</span><br /><br /><span class="word">steps</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1510;&#1456;&#1506;&#1458;&#1491;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7779;&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4703.htm">Strong's 4703: </a> </span><span class="str2">A step, companionship</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[are] from the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;&#8234;&#8236;&#8234;&#8236;&#8234;&#8236;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">so how</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mah-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">can anyone</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1437;&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">understand</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_995.htm">Strong's 995: </a> </span><span class="str2">To separate mentally, understand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his own way?</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(dar&#183;k&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1870.htm">Strong's 1870: </a> </span><span class="str2">A road, a course of life, mode of action</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/proverbs/20-24.htm">Proverbs 20:24 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/proverbs/20-24.htm">Proverbs 20:24 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/proverbs/20-24.htm">Proverbs 20:24 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/proverbs/20-24.htm">Proverbs 20:24 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/proverbs/20-24.htm">Proverbs 20:24 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/proverbs/20-24.htm">Proverbs 20:24  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/proverbs/20-24.htm">Proverbs 20:24 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/proverbs/20-24.htm">Proverbs 20:24 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/proverbs/20-24.htm">Proverbs 20:24 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/proverbs/20-24.htm">Proverbs 20:24 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/proverbs/20-24.htm">OT Poetry: Proverbs 20:24 A man's steps are from Yahweh (Prov.
