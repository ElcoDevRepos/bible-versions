In the biblical context, the pursuit of wisdom is often associated with a life that is aligned with God's will, leading to a sense of fulfillment and joy. The Hebrew concept of wisdom (chokmah) is not merely intellectual but involves living in accordance with divine principles. This aligns with <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>, where the blessed man delights in the law of the Lord. The idea of pleasing God is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>, which states that without faith, it is impossible to please Him.<p><b>when you keep them within you</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of internalizing wisdom, not just having a superficial understanding. The heart, in Hebrew thought, is the center of one's being, encompassing mind, will, and emotions. Keeping wisdom within suggests a deep, transformative process that affects one's entire life. This is reminiscent of <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6</a>, where the Israelites are commanded to keep God's commandments on their hearts. The internalization of wisdom is also a safeguard against sin, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>, "I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you."<p><b>and they are constantly on your lips</b><br>This phrase highlights the importance of speaking wisdom regularly, indicating that what fills the heart will naturally overflow into speech. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, oral tradition was a primary means of transmitting knowledge and values. The constant articulation of wisdom ensures that it is not only remembered but also shared with others, fostering a community grounded in godly principles. This is echoed in <a href="/joshua/1-8.htm">Joshua 1:8</a>, where Joshua is instructed to keep the Book of the Law always on his lips. The New Testament also reflects this principle in <a href="/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>, encouraging believers to let the word of Christ dwell richly among them, teaching and admonishing one another.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
