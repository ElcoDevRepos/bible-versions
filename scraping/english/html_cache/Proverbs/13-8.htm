In ancient times, ransom payments were common for securing the release of captives or hostages, as seen in the story of Abraham rescuing Lot (Genesis 14). Wealth could be used to influence outcomes, whether in legal disputes or in negotiations with enemies. The Bible often warns about the deceptive security of riches (<a href="/proverbs/11-4.htm">Proverbs 11:4</a>), yet acknowledges their practical benefits in certain situations. This reflects the tension between relying on material wealth and trusting in God for ultimate security.<p><b>but a poor man hears no threat</b><br>The second part of the verse highlights the advantage of having little to no wealth in terms of avoiding certain dangers. A poor man, having no riches to attract thieves or kidnappers, is less likely to be targeted. This can be seen as a form of protection in itself. The Bible frequently emphasizes God's care for the poor and their reliance on Him (<a href="/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>). This phrase also underscores the theme of contentment and the spiritual richness found in simplicity, as echoed in the teachings of Jesus, who often spoke of the blessedness of the poor in spirit (<a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.
