In biblical context, the concept of deceitful speech is frequently addressed, as seen in Psalms 55:21, where words are described as smoother than butter but harboring war. The cultural backdrop of ancient Israel placed a high value on integrity and truthfulness, as deceit was seen as a direct violation of the commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). The Hebrew word for "disguises" implies a deliberate act of concealing true intentions, reminiscent of the serpent's deception in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>. This phrase warns against the superficial charm that can mask malicious intent, a theme echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus warns of false prophets who come in sheep's clothing (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>).<p><b>but he lays up deceit in his heart</b><br>The heart, in biblical terms, is the center of one's being, encompassing mind, will, and emotions. This phrase suggests a premeditated and deeply ingrained deceit, not just a momentary lapse. The imagery of "laying up" implies storing or treasuring, indicating that deceit is not accidental but a cherished strategy. <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a> describes the heart as deceitful above all things, underscoring the need for divine intervention to purify it. In a broader theological context, this deceit contrasts with the purity and truth embodied by Jesus Christ, who is described as the way, the truth, and the life (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The phrase serves as a caution against internalizing deceit, which ultimately leads to spiritual and relational destruction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally regarded as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom. Proverbs is a collection of his wise sayings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hateful_man.htm">The Hateful Man</a></b><br>This is a general reference to any person who harbors malice or ill will towards others.
