The mountains, often seen as symbols of stability and permanence in the ancient world, were created by God and are part of the natural order. The mention of mountains being "settled" suggests a time before the earth was fully formed and established. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's wisdom being foundational to creation, as seen in <a href="/job/38-4.htm">Job 38:4-6</a>, where God questions Job about the earth's foundations. The imagery of mountains also connects to the grandeur and majesty of God's creation, highlighting the divine origin and authority of wisdom.<p><b>before the hills</b><br>The repetition of "before" underscores the timelessness of wisdom, existing even before the hills, which are often used in scripture to denote ancient and enduring features of the landscape. Hills, like mountains, are part of the earth's topography that predates human history. This phrase reinforces the idea that wisdom is not a human invention but a divine attribute that predates creation itself. In biblical poetry, hills can symbolize strength and stability, as seen in <a href="/psalms/121.htm">Psalm 121:1</a>, where the psalmist looks to the hills for help, symbolizing looking to God. This further illustrates that wisdom is an integral part of God's eternal plan.<p><b>I was brought forth</b><br>The phrase "I was brought forth" suggests a birthing or originating process, indicating that wisdom is not created but emanates from God. This aligns with the concept of wisdom as a divine attribute, inherent to God's nature. The Hebrew term used here can imply being born or brought into existence, which in this context, signifies the manifestation of wisdom as part of God's creative work. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is described in the New Testament as the wisdom of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-24.htm">1 Corinthians 1:24</a>). The pre-existence of wisdom parallels the pre-existence of Christ, who is also described as being with God in the beginning (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-2</a>). This connection highlights the integral role of divine wisdom in both creation and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom.htm">Wisdom</a></b><br>In <a href="/bsb/proverbs/8.htm">Proverbs 8</a>, Wisdom is personified and speaks as if it were a person.
