The mortar and pestle were essential tools in ancient Israel for preparing food, symbolizing thoroughness and effort. The fool, in biblical terms, is someone who rejects wisdom and instruction (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). This imagery suggests that no amount of external force can change the inherent nature of a fool, emphasizing the deep-seated nature of folly. The Bible often contrasts the wise and the foolish, highlighting that wisdom begins with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p><b>yet his folly will not depart from him</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the persistence of folly in a fool's heart. Despite attempts to correct or discipline, the fool remains unchanged. This reflects the biblical theme that true transformation comes from within, through a change of heart and mind, rather than through external coercion. The New Testament echoes this idea, emphasizing the need for spiritual rebirth and renewal (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>, <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>). The persistence of folly in a fool can also be seen as a warning against hardening one's heart to wisdom and instruction, as seen in the repeated calls for repentance and transformation throughout Scripture (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/fool.htm">Fool</a></b><br>In the context of Proverbs, a fool is someone who rejects wisdom and instruction, often characterized by stubbornness and a lack of moral insight.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mortar_and_pestle.htm">Mortar and Pestle</a></b><br>These are tools used for grinding substances into powder.

Scripture&#8217;s picture of a &#8220;fool&#8221; isn&#8217;t a harmless prankster; it is someone who despises God&#8217;s wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>) and insists on his own way (<a href="/proverbs/12-15.htm">Proverbs 12:15</a>). The verse paints an extreme scenario&#8212;subjecting the fool to crushing force&#8212;to show that even the harshest external pressure cannot penetrate a heart set against wisdom. We see the same truth in <a href="/proverbs/17-10.htm">Proverbs 17:10</a>, where &#8220;a rebuke affects a discerning man more than a hundred lashes a fool.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with mortar and a pestle</b><p>The image intensifies: &#8220;with mortar and a pestle.&#8221; A mortar holds the grain; the pestle hammers it repeatedly. This extra detail underscores thoroughness. Every method of discipline&#8212;verbal correction, painful consequences, even severe hardship&#8212;can be applied, yet stubbornness may remain. Compare <a href="/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>, &#8220;A man who remains stiff-necked after much reproof will suddenly be broken beyond remedy.&#8221; King Manasseh illustrates this: only when his enemies &#8220;put a hook in his nose&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11-13</a>) did he finally humble himself. Some fools, however, never reach that turning point (<a href="/isaiah/26-10.htm">Isaiah 26:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>yet his folly will not depart from him</b><p>Here is the sobering conclusion. Folly is not merely bad behavior; it is a settled condition of the heart. External force can crush the kernel, but only God can give a new heart (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>). Until that miracle happens, the fool clings to folly as a dog returns to its vomit (<a href="/proverbs/26-11.htm">Proverbs 26:11</a>). This calls us to:<p>&#8226; Expect persistence of folly where repentance is absent (<a href="/proverbs/14-16.htm">Proverbs 14:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Depend on God&#8217;s transforming work, not just stronger consequences (<a href="/2_timothy/2-24.htm">2 Timothy 2:24-26</a>).<p>&#8226; Guard our own hearts lest we mimic the fool&#8217;s obstinacy (<a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>practical implications</b><p>&#8226; Parents: Discipline consistently, but realize that heart change comes through prayer and the gospel (<a href="/ephesians/6-4.htm">Ephesians 6:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Leaders: Correct and warn, yet know when further argument becomes &#8220;throwing pearls before swine&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Friends: Offer counsel, but avoid being dragged into endless strife (<a href="/proverbs/20-3.htm">Proverbs 20:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Personal application: Invite God&#8217;s searchlight daily (<a href="/psalms/139-23.htm">Psalm 139:23-24</a>) so any seed of foolishness is uprooted early.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/proverbs/27-22.htm">Proverbs 27:22</a> teaches that no amount of external pressure guarantees a fool&#8217;s change; folly is rooted in a heart resistant to God&#8217;s wisdom. While firm correction has its place, only the Lord can replace a stony heart with one that loves truth. Our role is to dispense discipline, counsel, and prayer, trusting Him for the transformation that grinding alone can never achieve.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/proverbs/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Though thou shouldest bray </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>pound) a fool (a self-willed, headstrong person) in a mortar among wheat with a pestle.--This would separate completely the husks from the wheat; but obstinacy has become a part of such a man's nature, and cannot be got rid of even by such violent measures.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/proverbs/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle.</span> "To bray" is to pound or beat small.

The LXX., reading, differently, has, "Though thou scourge a fool, disgracing him (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) in the midst of the congregation." Of course, the process of separating the husks from the corn by the use of pestle and mortar is much more delicate and careful than threshing in the usual clumsy way; hence is expressed the idea that the most elaborate pains are wasted on the incorrigible fool (see on Proverbs 1:20). His foolishness will not depart from him. An obstinate, self-willed, unprincipled man cannot be reformed by any means; his folly has become a second nature, and is not to be eliminated by any teaching, discipline, or severity. There is, too, a judicial blindness, when, after repeated warnings wilfully rejected and scorned, the sinner is left to himself, given over to a reprobate mind "Whoso teacheth a fool," Siracides pronounces, "is as one that glueth a potsherd together, and as he that waketh one from a sound sleep" (Ecclus. 22:7). Again, "The inner parts of a fool are like a broken vessel, and he will hold no knowledge as long as he liveth" (Ecclus. 21:14). In Turkey, we are told, great criminals were beaten to pieces in huge mortars of iron, in which they usually pounded rice. "You cannot straighten a dog's tail, try as you may," says a Telugu maxim (Lane). There is a saying of Schiller's which is quite proverbial, "Heaven and earth fight in vain against a dunce."
