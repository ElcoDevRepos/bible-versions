Throughout the Old Testament, prophets received visions from God to guide and instruct His people (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/1.htm">Ezekiel 1:1</a>). The absence of such vision implies a lack of divine guidance, leading to spiritual and moral decay. Historically, Israel experienced periods of spiritual decline when prophetic voices were absent or ignored, such as during the time of the Judges (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><b>the people cast off restraint</b><br>This phrase suggests a society without moral or spiritual boundaries, leading to chaos and lawlessness. The Hebrew word used here can imply a sense of being ungoverned or unrestrained, similar to the behavior of the Israelites when Moses was on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/32-25.htm">Exodus 32:25</a>). Without divine guidance, people tend to follow their own desires, often resulting in societal breakdown and sin.<p><b>but blessed is he who keeps the Law</b><br>The "Law" refers to the Torah, God's instructions given to Israel through Moses. Keeping the Law implies obedience to God's commandments, which brings blessing and order. This principle is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1-3</a>, where the one who delights in the Law is likened to a fruitful tree. The Law serves as a guide for righteous living, and adherence to it is seen as a source of blessing and stability. In the New Testament, Jesus fulfills the Law (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>), and through Him, believers are empowered to live according to God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Proverbs, Solomon was the son of King David and known for his wisdom.

"Vision" (<span class="accented">chazon</span>), prophecy in its widest sense, denotes the revelation of God's will made through agents, which directed the course of events, and was intended to be coordinate with the supreme secular authority. The prophets were the instructors of the people in Divine things, standing witnesses of the truth and power of religion, teaching a higher than mere human morality. The fatal effect of the absence of such revelation of God's will is stated to be confusion, disorder, and rebellion; the people, uncontrolled, fall into grievous excesses, which nothing but high principles can restrain. We note the licence of Eli's time, when there was no open vision (<a href="/1_samuel/3.htm">1 Samuel 3</a>.); in Asa's days, when Israel had long been without a teaching priest (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-3.htm">2 Chronicles 15:3</a>); and when the impious Ahaz "made Judah naked" (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-19.htm">2 Chronicles 28:19</a>); or when the people were destroyed by reason of lack of knowledge of Divine things (<a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>). Thus the importance of prophecy in regulating the life and religion of the people is fully acknowledged by the writer, in whose time, doubtless, the prophetical office was in full exercise: but this seems to be the only passage in the book where such teaching is directly mentioned; the instructors and preceptors elsewhere introduced as disseminating the principles of the <span class="accented">chochmah</span> being parents, or tutors, or professors, not inspired prophets. <span class="cmt_word">But he that keepeth the Law, happy is he!</span> "The Law" (<span class="accented">torah</span>) is not merely the written Mosaic Law, but the announcement of God's will by the mouth of his representatives; and the thought is, not the blessedness of those who in a time of anarchy and irreligion keep to the authorized enactments of the Sinaitic legislation, but a contrast between the lawlessness and ruin of a people uninfluenced by religious guidance, and the happy state of those who obey alike the voice of God, whether conveyed in written statutes or by the teaching of living prophets.
