The nation is depicted as being in a state of continual rebellion against God. This reflects the cyclical pattern of sin seen throughout the Old Testament, particularly in the book of Judges, where Israel repeatedly falls into sin, cries out to God, and is delivered, only to fall again. The phrase underscores the persistent nature of sin and the hardening of hearts that occurs when people turn away from God.<p><b>and make for themselves cast images,</b><br>The making of cast images refers to the practice of idolatry, which was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>). This practice was prevalent among the surrounding nations, and Israel's adoption of it signifies a departure from their covenant relationship with Yahweh. The casting of images was a common method of idol creation in the ancient Near East, involving the melting and molding of metals.<p><b>idols skillfully made from their silver,</b><br>The use of silver indicates the wealth and resources that were being misused for idolatrous purposes. The skill involved in crafting these idols suggests a deliberate and intentional act of worship, rather than a casual or ignorant sin. This echoes the account of Aaron and the golden calf in <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>, where the people of Israel used their gold to create an idol, demonstrating a similar misuse of their blessings.<p><b>all of them the work of craftsmen.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the human origin of the idols, contrasting with the divine creation of the world by God. It highlights the futility and absurdity of worshiping something made by human hands, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where the prophet mocks the idea of worshiping a crafted object. The reliance on human craftsmanship underscores the departure from reliance on God.<p><b>People say of them, &#8220;They offer human sacrifice</b><br>This accusation points to the extreme depravity that idolatry can lead to, as human sacrifice was a practice associated with pagan worship, particularly among the Canaanites (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>). It indicates the depth of Israel's apostasy and the influence of surrounding cultures. The practice is condemned throughout Scripture and is a stark violation of God's commandments.<p><b>and kiss the calves!&#8221;</b><br>Kissing the calves refers to acts of devotion and worship directed towards the golden calves, reminiscent of the calf worship instituted by Jeroboam in <a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>. This act of kissing is a sign of allegiance and reverence, showing how deeply ingrained idolatry had become in Israelite society. The calves symbolize a false representation of God, leading the people away from true worship. This idolatry is a direct affront to the worship of Yahweh and serves as a type of the ultimate rejection of Christ, who is the true image of God (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often rebuked by God through Hosea for their idolatry and unfaithfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>Objects of worship made by human hands, representing a significant sin of Israel against God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/calves.htm">Calves</a></b><br>Likely referring to the golden calves set up by Jeroboam I in Bethel and Dan, which became a central part of Israel's idolatrous practices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/craftsmen.htm">Craftsmen</a></b><br>Skilled workers who created the idols, highlighting the deliberate and skillful nature of Israel's sin.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just a historical issue but a present danger.

The pattern matches the spiral Paul later describes: when people reject what they know of God, &#8220;their foolish hearts were darkened&#8221; (<a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21-24</a>).<p>- Sin accumulates, sears the conscience, and becomes habitual (<a href="/psalms/106-43.htm">Psalm 106:43</a>).<p>- With every new indulgence, the distance between the people and their covenant Lord widens, setting the stage for the judgment Hosea will soon announce.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and make for themselves cast images, idols skillfully made from their silver</b><p>The next step in the downward slide is self-made worship.

But the former is quite consistent with Hebrew usage, while the latter compels us to adopt the unwarrantable supposition that human sacrifices formed part of the calf-worship.

Or, <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> not content with the calves, they introduced gods of their own as their penates. The <span class="accented">material</span> out of which these molten images were manufactured was silver. Kimchi, however, gives a curious explanation in proof that the material was gold: "The calves," he says, "were not silver, but he means to say that, of the silver which they each one gave to procure gold to make the calves, they made for themselves idols according to their understanding; and these were the calves." The <span class="accented">manner</span> in which they made these idols was <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">in their understanding</span>, that is, in their understanding, such as it was, so stupidly employed in such sensuous work, or their proficiency in the art of graving. Kimchi explains it somewhat differently: "The explanation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5ea;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5dd;</span> is, 'As if they had carefully reflected on the matter what form they should give it, and then had agreed to make a calf, as they did in the wilderness.'" The reading of the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5ea;&#x5d9;</span> is disputed, but without sufficient ground. No doubt the Septuagint, which is followed by the Chaldee, Arabic, and Jerome, probably read <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> <span class="accented">rad</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>, to build, like <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b0;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span>, figure, or <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>;
