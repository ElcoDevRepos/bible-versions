The imagery of flourishing suggests a period of economic and social success. Historically, Israel experienced times of prosperity under kings like Jeroboam II. However, this prosperity often led to complacency and idolatry, as seen in Hosea's broader message. The idea of flourishing among brothers can also be seen in the context of Israel's relationship with surrounding nations and tribes, where it held a significant position.<p><b>An east wind will come&#8212;a wind from the LORD rising up from the desert</b><br>The east wind is a metaphor for impending judgment and destruction. In the ancient Near East, the east wind, or sirocco, was known for its scorching and destructive nature, often bringing drought and devastation. This wind is described as coming from the LORD, indicating divine judgment. The desert, or wilderness, often symbolizes a place of testing or divine encounter in the Bible, as seen in the Israelites' journey in Exodus. The east wind is also reminiscent of the plagues in Egypt, where God used natural elements to execute judgment (<a href="/exodus/10-13.htm">Exodus 10:13</a>).<p><b>His fountain will fail, and his spring will run dry</b><br>This imagery of a failing fountain and drying spring signifies the loss of prosperity and life-sustaining resources. Water is a critical resource in the arid climate of the Middle East, and its absence would lead to severe consequences. Spiritually, this can be seen as a withdrawal of God's blessing and favor, leading to a state of spiritual barrenness. The metaphor of water is often used in Scripture to represent life and sustenance, as seen in Jesus' offer of "living water" in <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>.<p><b>The wind will plunder his treasury of every precious article</b><br>The plundering of the treasury indicates a complete stripping away of wealth and security. This can be understood as a prophecy of the Assyrian invasion, which led to the downfall of the northern kingdom in 722 BC. The loss of precious articles symbolizes the end of Israel's material wealth and the humiliation of its people. This phrase echoes the theme of divine retribution for Israel's unfaithfulness, as seen throughout the prophetic books. The idea of plundering also connects to the broader biblical theme of judgment against those who turn away from God, as seen in the warnings given to other nations and peoples in the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Represents the Northern Kingdom of Israel, often used as a symbol of the entire nation due to its size and influence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/east_wind.htm">East Wind</a></b><br>Symbolizes destruction and judgment, often associated with harsh, dry winds from the desert that cause devastation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is both the source of blessing and judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>Represents a place of testing and desolation, often used in the Bible to signify a place where God&#8217;s judgment or purification occurs.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/treasury.htm">Treasury</a></b><br>Symbolizes the wealth and resources of Israel, which will be plundered as a result of their disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_illusion_of_prosperity.htm">The Illusion of Prosperity</a></b><br>Material success does not equate to spiritual health.

God, who once caused Israel to flourish, can just as surely withdraw life-giving water and allow wealth to vanish. The enduring call is to trust the true Fountain so that, when every scorching wind blows, life remains rooted in Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15, 16) <span class= "bld">Fruitful.</span>--Observe the play on Ephraim's name.<p><span class= "bld">Wind of the Lord</span> stands in apposition to <span class= "ital">east wind.</span> Render <span class= "ital">a wind of the Lord rising from the wilderness.</span> The armies of Assyria are referred to.<p><span class= "bld">Become desolate.</span>--Or rather, <span class= "ital">suffer punishment.</span> Thus rolls the thunder of Divine judgment in one last tremendous crash of doom, beyond which scarce anything worse can be thought or said.

The name Ephraim, signifying "double-fruitfulness," shall be verified, confirming the promised redemption from death, and, by the pledge of blessing, which the name implies affording a guarantee that the coming storm would not quite overwhelm them. The play on the name Ephraim fixes the meaning of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;</span>, the <span class="accented">aleph</span> taking the place of <span class="accented">he</span>.

But though fruitful among the other tribes, yet the abuse of that fruitfulness invited the instrument of destruction. There is an allusion to the patriarchal blessing, "Joseph is a fruitful bough by a well;" the source of his fruitfulness was that well or fountain; while the drying up of it would be the certain cause of barrenness. <span class="cmt_word">An east wind shall come, the wind of the Lord shall come up from the wilderness.</span> Thus, while Ephraim presents the pleasing picture of a fair and fruitful tree, the element of destruction is already on the way. A wind, the east wind, with its rude vehemence, blighting heat, and desolating effect, was coming. It was a wind, not coming by chance, but commissioned by Jehovah as a minister of vengeance to execute his wrath. It was, moreover, a wind issuing forth from its home in the desert, and fraught with fiery heat from the scorching sands of the Arabian desert. <span class="cmt_word">And his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up.</span> This flourishing tree, planted by the living spring, to which it owed its vigor and verdure, was doomed soon to wither in consequence of the drying up of the waters, that nourished it, by the east wind. <span class="cmt_word">He shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.</span> Here the figure merges in the fact. The Assyrian conqueror was the blustering east wind, that swept like a whirlwind with his armies from the east. He not only ravaged the country, but rifled the treasures of the capital The <span class="accented">keli chemdah</span> included all the valuables and treasures of Samaria referred to in the following verse. Kimchi explains the verse as follows: "For Ephraim was fruitful among brethren as long as he did not make calves. He became increasingly great and fruitful among his brethren, as Jacob said of him.... And now that he has sinned, an east wind of the Lord shall come; and it is the King of Assyria that is meant. And he compares him to the east wind, because it is a wind from the east, for the land of Assyria lies to the east of the land of Israel; and further he says, 'east wind,' because it is a violent wind. And he says, 'wind of Jehovah,' to magnify the wind and emphasize it; and he says also, 'spirit of Jehovah,' because Jehovah the blessed stirred up his spirit (i.e. spirit of the King of Assyria) to come against Israel, 'goeth up from the wilderness;' wind is always in the wilderness. Or the explanation is, because the wilderness is between the land of Israel and the land of Assyria; and before this wind, which is the King of Assyria, is dried up the fountain of Ephraim, which was at first like a tree flourishing by the waters." And now before this wind shall its spring become dry and its fountain dried up.
