The "cords of kindness" symbolize God's loving and patient approach, contrasting with the harshness often experienced under human leadership. In biblical context, this imagery recalls God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt, where He led them with compassion and provided for their needs (<a href="/exodus/15-13.htm">Exodus 15:13</a>). The cords signify not bondage but a tender connection, emphasizing God's desire for a relationship based on love rather than coercion.<p><b>with ropes of love</b><br>The "ropes of love" further illustrate the depth of God's affection and commitment to His people. Unlike physical ropes that bind, these ropes are metaphorical, representing the bonds of love that draw Israel closer to God. This imagery can be connected to the covenant relationship God established with Israel, where love and faithfulness were central themes (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>). The ropes of love also prefigure the New Testament revelation of God's love through Jesus Christ, who draws humanity to Himself through sacrificial love (<a href="/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32</a>).<p><b>I lifted the yoke from their necks</b><br>This phrase signifies liberation and relief from oppression. Historically, the yoke is a symbol of servitude and burden, often used to describe Israel's slavery in Egypt (<a href="/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a>). God's action of lifting the yoke indicates His role as a redeemer who frees His people from bondage. This act of deliverance is a type of Christ's work, who offers rest and freedom from the yoke of sin (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>). The lifting of the yoke also points to God's ongoing care and provision, ensuring that His people are not overwhelmed by life's burdens.<p><b>and bent down to feed them</b><br>Here, God's humility and provision are highlighted. The image of God bending down to feed His people conveys intimacy and personal care, much like a parent nurturing a child. This reflects God's sustenance provided during the wilderness journey, where He supplied manna and quail (Exodus 16). The act of feeding is not only physical but also spiritual, as God nourishes His people with His word and presence. This anticipates the ultimate provision through Jesus, the Bread of Life, who offers spiritual nourishment and eternal life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His tender care and love for Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation being addressed, often depicted as a wayward child or unfaithful spouse in the book of Hosea.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His message, known for his symbolic marriage to Gomer, representing God's relationship with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>Implicitly referenced as the place of bondage from which God delivered Israel, symbolizing past oppression.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus.htm">The Exodus</a></b><br>The historical event of Israel's deliverance from Egypt, symbolizing God's redemptive power and love.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_tender_guidance.htm">God's Tender Guidance</a></b><br>God leads us with kindness and love, not with harshness or force.

The <span class="accented">cords of a man</span> are such as parents use in leading weak or young children. <span class="accented">Bands of lore</span> qualify more closely the preceding expression, "cords of a man," and are the opposite of those which men employ in taming or breaking wild and unmanageable animals. The explanation of Rashi is similar: "I have always led them with tender cords such as these with which a man leads his child, as if he said with loving guidance." Aben Ezra and Kimchi, in their explanations, carry out more fully the same idea. The former says, "The bands of love are not like the bands which are fastened on the neck of a plowing heifer;" the latter, "Because he compared Ephraim to a heifer, and people lead a heifer with cords, he says, 'I have led Israel by the cords of a man, and not the cords of a heifer which one drags along with resistance, but as a man draws his fellow-man without compelling him to go with resistance: even so I have led them after a gentle method;' and therefore he afterward calls them (cords of a man) bands of love." The LXX., taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;</span> from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, in the sense of" injure," "destroy," have the mistaken rendering <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1fb6;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>, "When men were destroyed I drew them." The other Greek versions have the correct rendering. <span class="cmt_word">And I was to them as they that take off the yoke.</span> The word <span class="accented">herim</span> does not mean "to lift up on" and so "impose a yoke," as some think, nor "to take away the yoke," but "to lift it up." The figure is that of a humane and compassionate husbandman raising upwards or pushing backwards the yoke over the cheeks or dewlaps of the ox, that it may not press too heavily upon him or hinder him while eating. The reference is, according to Kimchi, to "taking the yoke off the neck, and letting it hang on the jaw, that it may not pull but rest from labor one or more hours of the day." The fact thus figuratively expressed is, not the deliverance from the bondage of Egypt, but the loving-kindness of Jehovah in lightening the fulfillment of the Law to Israel. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The LXX. omit the word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span>, yoke, and strangely translates the clause, "I will be to them as a man smiting (another) on the cheeks." <span class="cmt_word">And I laid meat unto them.</span> The older and many modern interpreters, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;</span> as the first person future apoc., Hiph., from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d8;&#x5d7;</span>, translate, "And I reached them food to eat," namely, the manna in the wilderness.
