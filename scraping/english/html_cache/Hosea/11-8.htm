This rhetorical question highlights God's deep love and reluctance to abandon His people despite their persistent unfaithfulness. The name Ephraim, meaning "fruitful," reflects the tribe's significant role and God's desire for their prosperity. This echoes God's covenantal faithfulness, reminiscent of His promises to the patriarchs.<p><b>How could I surrender you, O Israel?</b><br>Israel, the chosen nation, is at the heart of God's redemptive plan. The term "surrender" suggests a military defeat or handing over to enemies, which God is reluctant to do. This reflects the tension between divine justice and mercy. Historically, Israel faced numerous threats, yet God's protective hand often intervened, as seen in the Exodus and the conquest of Canaan.<p><b>How could I make you like Admah?</b><br>Admah was one of the cities destroyed alongside Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/14-8.htm">Genesis 14:8, 19</a>:24-25). Mentioning Admah serves as a warning of total destruction due to sin. However, God's rhetorical question implies His desire to spare Israel from such a fate, emphasizing His mercy over judgment.<p><b>How could I treat you like Zeboiim?</b><br>Zeboiim, like Admah, was destroyed due to wickedness. The reference underscores the severity of Israel's sin but also highlights God's reluctance to enact such judgment. This reflects God's consistent character of offering repentance and restoration, as seen in the story of Nineveh (Jonah 3).<p><b>My heart is turned within Me;</b><br>This phrase reveals the emotional depth of God's relationship with Israel. The turning of God's heart indicates a profound internal struggle between His justice and mercy. It reflects the divine pathos, showing that God's decisions are not detached or unemotional but deeply personal and compassionate.<p><b>My compassion is stirred!</b><br>God's compassion, or "rachamim" in Hebrew, is a central attribute, often associated with a mother's love. This stirring of compassion indicates a movement towards mercy and forgiveness. It aligns with God's self-revelation in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where He describes Himself as "compassionate and gracious." This compassion ultimately points to the redemptive work of Christ, who embodies God's mercy and offers salvation to all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Represents the northern kingdom of Israel, often used synonymously with Israel in the prophetic books.

On the darkest cloud gleams the bow of promise. A nation so much beloved as Israel cannot be destroyed by Him who has fostered it so tenderly. As the prophet loved his faithless bride, so Jehovah continued to love His people. The "how?" of this verse expresses the most extreme reluctance. Admah and Zeboim were cities of the plain destroyed with Sodom and Gomorrah, which are often referred to as the type of irremediable catastrophe. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm" title="Except the LORD of hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrah.">Isaiah 1:9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/13-19.htm" title="And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.">Isaiah 13:19</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-15.htm" title="Truly I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.">Matthew 10:15</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Mine heart is turned within me</span>.--Better, <span class= "ital">against</span> me--a violent revulsion of feeling. Divine compassion pleads with Divine justice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim?</span> This verse paves the way for transition to promise. Although the Israelites on account of such conduct had merited complete annihilation, yet Jehovah, for his love and mercy's sake, substitutes grace for justice, and will not destroy them from off the face of the earth. One rendering <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> gives the clause the turn of an exclamation rather than of an interrogation; thus: "How readily and justly could I [or should I, or how thoroughly could I if I punished thy rebellion as I deserved] give thee up to destruction!" We prefer <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the ordinary rendering, by which it is treated as a question: "How shall I give thee up to the power of the enemy, and not only that, but destroy thee?" Calvin's exposition seems indeed to favor the former: "Here," he says, "God consults what he is to do with the people; and first, indeed, he shows that it was his purpose to execute vengeance such as the Israelites deserved, even wholly to destroy them; but yet he assumes the character of one deliberating, that none might think that he hastily fell into anger, or that, being soon excited by excessive fury, he devoted to ruin those who had lightly sinned, or were guilty of no great crimes By these expressions of the text God shows what the Israelites deserved, and that he was now inclined to inflict the punishment of which they were worthy, and yet not without repentance, or at least not without hesitation. He afterwards adds in the next clause, <span class="accented">This I will not do</span>; <span class="accented">my heart is within me changed</span>." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together</span>. The <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, literally, "upon," "with," then, "in," or "within:" "My heart is turned or changed from anger to pity in me." The expression, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, signifies, according to Rashi, "one <span class="accented">warmed</span>," as in <a href="/genesis/43-30.htm">Genesis 43:30</a>, where this same word is rendered in the Authorized Version," yearned:" "His bowels did yearn upon his brother," or "warmed towards." But <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> many modern interpreters understand the word in the sense of" gathering themselves together:" "<span class="accented">The</span> feelings of compassion gathered themselves together;" <span class="accented">nichumim</span>, from Piel <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5dd;</span>, a noun of the form <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span>, less definite than <span class="accented">rachamim</span>, bowels, as the seat of the emotions, "<span class="accented">gathered</span> themselves together," or "were excited all at once." The cities of the plain included Admah and Zeboim, Sodom and Gomorrah, all of which, in consequence of their sins, were overthrown and perished in one common calamity. In <a href="/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a> these cities are all named, though Admah and Zeboim are not mentioned by name in the narrative of the catastrophe contained in Genesis. Though Israel had been as guilty and deserving of wrath as these, God expresses strong reluctance to deliver them over into the hands and power of their enemies, or to give them up to destruction. His heart revolted at the thought, and turned aside from the fierceness of his anger, though so fully deserved, into the direction of mercy; a new turn was given to his feelings in the direction of compassion. All his relentings or repentings together - one and all - yearned or were at once aroused. Repenting on the part of God is an expression suited to human comprehension, implying no change of purpose on the side of God, but only a change of procedure consistent with his purpose of everlasting love. "The Law speaks in the language of the sons of men." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/11-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">How</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1438;&#1497;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_349.htm">Strong's 349: </a> </span><span class="str2">How?, how!, where</span><br /><br /><span class="word">can I give you up,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1504;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1443;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;et&#183;ten&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular &#124;
