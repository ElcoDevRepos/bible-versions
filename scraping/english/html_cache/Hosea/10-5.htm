The "calf of Beth-aven" refers to the golden calf idol set up in Bethel, a city that became a center of idol worship. "Beth-aven" is a derogatory term meaning "house of wickedness," replacing "Bethel," which means "house of God." This reflects the spiritual decline of Israel. The fear mentioned here is due to the impending judgment and loss of their idol, which they wrongly trusted for protection and prosperity.<p><b>Indeed, its people will mourn over it</b><br>The mourning signifies the deep attachment and misplaced devotion the people had towards the idol. This mourning is not for their sin or for turning away from God, but for the loss of the idol itself. It highlights the spiritual blindness and hardness of heart prevalent among the Israelites, who failed to recognize the true source of their blessings and security.<p><b>with its idolatrous priests&#8212;those who rejoiced in its glory&#8212;</b><br>The idolatrous priests, or "chem&#257;rim," were those who served at the high places and led the people in idol worship. They rejoiced in the glory of the calf, which was seen as a symbol of strength and fertility. This phrase underscores the corrupt religious leadership that led Israel astray, contrasting with the Levitical priesthood ordained by God. Their rejoicing was in something transient and false, rather than in the eternal glory of God.<p><b>for it has been taken from them into exile.</b><br>The exile refers to the Assyrian captivity, which occurred in 722 BC when the Northern Kingdom was conquered. The taking of the idol into exile symbolizes the futility of trusting in man-made objects for salvation. This event fulfilled the prophetic warnings given by Hosea and other prophets about the consequences of idolatry and disobedience. It serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the certainty of His judgment against sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, often associated with idolatry and rebellion against God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/calf_of_beth-aven.htm">Calf of Beth-aven</a></b><br>A reference to the golden calf idol worshiped in Beth-aven, a place synonymous with idolatry.

Bethel means "house of God," once a place of sacred memory from its association with the history of the patriarch Jacob; afterward one of the two centers of idolatrous worship, and here called Beth-aven, "house of vanity," because of the idolatry. The word for "calves" is in the feminine, in order to express contempt for those idols which Jeroboam set up. With this have been compared the following expressions in Greek and Latin: <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;</span>, and O <span class="accented">vere Phrygiae, nec enim Phryges!</span> The Hebrews ignored the existence of female divinities, as of their, ten names of the Deity all are masculine. The feminine may also imply their weakness; so far from helping their worshippers, their worshippers were in trepidation for them, or rather it, lest it should be carried away captive. Further, this same word is in the plural, to cast ridicule on it, as if mimicking the plural of majesty, or rather, perhaps, to include that of Dan, or to intimate that the calf of Bethel, the more celebrated place, was that after which the calf of Dan and probably those of other places were fashioned, especially so as it is afterwards referred to in the singular. Besides, a few - a very few - manuscripts, it is true, read the singular, as also the LXX., which has <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and the Syriac; while Bathe, relying on these authorities, maintains the reading to have been <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b0;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> in the singular. Others suppose an enallage of both gender and number; or an indefinite generality is expressed by the plural, while for abstracts the feminine is used. The coming punishment is casting its shadow before, so that the inhabitants, perceiving symptoms of its approach, tremble for their god of gold, now, like themselves, in greatest jeopardy<span class="cmt_word">. For the people thereof shall mourn over it.</span> The people of Israel are now called the people of the calf, as once they had been the people of Jehovah, and as Moab was called the people of Chemosh. They had chosen the calf for their god. Of their own free-will they had done so, though at first enjoined and prompted to adopt this course by the mandate of their king; they had even rejoiced and gloried in it. Now they mourn for their idol, which can neither help itself nor them. <span class="cmt_word">And the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.</span> According to this rendering, the relative must be understood before "rejoiced," which, though quite possible and not ungrammatical, is, however, unnecessary. The Hebrew commentators all understand the word in the sense of "joy" or "jubilation;" thus Rashi says," Why is it that its people mourn over, it and its priests, who always rejoiced over it, now mourn over its glory that is gone away?" The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span>, however, is primarily "to twist or whirl one's self," and is thence applied to any violent emotion, generally of joy, also of anxiety and fear, as here, so that the simpler and more correct rendering is, <span class="accented">the priests thereof shall tremble for it, for its glory, because it is departed from it</span>. The priests here mentioned have a peculiar name, <span class="accented">kemarim</span>, from <span class="accented">kamar, to</span> be black, from the black garments in which they ministered, and are thus distinguished as ministers of a foreign cult; for kohen is the usual word for a Hebrew priest, and his robe of office is said to have been white. The glory of the calf-god was not the temple treasure at Bethel, nor its glory as the state God set up there, but the honor and the Divine halo with which its worship there was surrounded. Thus Kimchi: "When its glory is departed from it; and this means the honor of its worship. When the calf is broken before their eyes its glory shall depart from it." The perfects of "mourn" and "departed" are prophetic, denoting the certainty of the events, though yet future; while <span class="accented">galah</span> and <span class="accented">yagilu</span> form the favorite assonance. But a question still remains - Why is Samaria and not Beth-avert said to mourn? To this the explanation of Kimchi is a satisfactory reply: "The inhabitants of Samaria tremble. And the prophet makes mention of Samaria, though there were no calves there, because it was the metropolis of the kingdom, where the kings of Israel resided, and it was these kings who strengthened the people in the worship of the calves. And he says," When Bethel is laid waste, and the calves cannot deliver it, the inhabitants of Samaria tremble for themselves, which place (Samaria) the King of Assyria laid siege to for three years." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/10-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1443;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7733;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7934.htm">Strong's 7934: </a> </span><span class="str2">A resident, a fellow-citizen</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Samaria</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1469;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8111.htm">Strong's 8111: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samaria -- capital of northern kingdom of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will fear</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1490;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7713;&#363;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1481.htm">Strong's 1481: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn aside from the road, sojourn, to shrink, fear, to gather for, hostility</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for the calf</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1506;&#1462;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8216;e&#7713;&#183;l&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
