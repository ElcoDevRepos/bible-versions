In the context of Hosea, the prophet's marriage to Gomer symbolizes God's relationship with Israel. The children represent the consequences of Israel's spiritual adultery. Biblically, compassion is a key attribute of God (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>), but here, His justice necessitates a temporary withholding of mercy. This reflects the covenantal relationship where blessings and curses are contingent on obedience (Deuteronomy 28). The lack of compassion is not permanent, as God's ultimate plan is restoration (<a href="/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14-23</a>).<p><b>because they are the children of adultery</b><br>This phrase underscores the spiritual infidelity of Israel, likened to adultery. In the ancient Near Eastern context, adultery was a grave offense, often punishable by death (<a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>). Spiritually, Israel's idolatry is seen as breaking the covenant with God, akin to marital unfaithfulness. The children symbolize the fruit of this unfaithfulness, indicating that the nation has produced outcomes contrary to God's desires. This imagery is consistent with other prophetic literature, where idolatry is equated with adultery (<a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-10</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>). Theologically, this points to the need for repentance and the hope of redemption through Christ, who restores the broken relationship between God and His people (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver a message of judgment and redemption.

Not only is idolatry enshrined in the national sanctuary and the royal palace, but the people love to have it so. They endorse the degradation of their mother.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms.</span> The connection of this verse is carried on from the preceding, viz. <span class="accented">and lest I will not have mercy upon her children</span>. An exceedingly apt illustration of this verse is given by Jerome. It is to this effect: When the children of Israel were brought out of Egypt, the parents perished in the wilderness; but the children of those who had thus perished, and whose caresses had thus fallen in the wilderness, were spared and permitted to enter the land of promise. Now, however, the case is different, and the punishment aggravated. The adulterous parent perishes, and the children of that parent perish also. Further, the reason is assigned in the concluding clause. The children proved themselves no better than the mother that bore them; they were the worthless progeny of a worthless parent. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/2-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will have no</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">compassion</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1512;&#1463;&#1495;&#1461;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;ra&#183;&#7717;&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7355.htm">Strong's 7355: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fondle, to love, to compassionate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on her children</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1504;&#1462;&#1430;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;ne&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1469;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;m&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1992.htm">Strong's 1992: </a> </span><span class="str2">They</span><br /><br /><span class="word">are the children</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of adultery.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#601;&#183;n&#363;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2183.htm">Strong's 2183: </a> </span><span class="str2">Adultery, idolatry</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/hosea/2-4.htm">Hosea 2:4 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/hosea/2-4.htm">Hosea 2:4 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/hosea/2-4.htm">Hosea 2:4 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/hosea/2-4.htm">Hosea 2:4 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/hosea/2-4.htm">Hosea 2:4 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/hosea/2-4.htm">Hosea 2:4  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/hosea/2-4.htm">Hosea 2:4 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/hosea/2-4.htm">Hosea 2:4 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/hosea/2-4.htm">Hosea 2:4 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/hosea/2-4.htm">Hosea 2:4 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/hosea/2-4.htm">OT Prophets: Hosea 2:4 Indeed on her children I will have (Ho Hs Hos.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/hosea/2-3.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Hosea 2:3"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Hosea 2:3" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/hosea/2-5.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Hosea 2:5"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Hosea 2:5" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
