In the context of Hosea, the prophet often condemns the people for their superficial worship and lack of genuine commitment to God. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God desires truth in the inward parts (<a href="/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>) and condemns lip service without heart engagement (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>). The emphasis on "mere words" suggests a disconnect between what is spoken and what is truly believed or intended.<p><b>with false oaths they make covenants.</b><br>The Israelites are accused of making covenants with deceitful intentions, which is a violation of the commandment against bearing false witness (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). In the ancient Near Eastern context, covenants were solemn agreements often sealed with oaths invoking divine witnesses. The false oaths indicate a breach of trust not only with fellow humans but also with God, who is the ultimate witness to all covenants. This behavior is reminiscent of the treachery condemned in <a href="/zechariah/8-17.htm">Zechariah 8:17</a>, where God calls for truth and justice.<p><b>So judgment springs up like poisonous weeds</b><br>The imagery of judgment as "poisonous weeds" suggests something that is both inevitable and destructive. In an agrarian society, weeds were a common threat to crops, symbolizing sin's pervasive and corrupting influence. This metaphor indicates that the consequences of Israel's deceitful actions are as natural and unavoidable as weeds overtaking a field. The idea of judgment as a natural outgrowth of sin is echoed in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, where Paul warns that a man reaps what he sows.<p><b>in the furrows of a field.</b><br>The "furrows of a field" represent the places where seeds are sown, intended for growth and fruitfulness. However, instead of a bountiful harvest, the Israelites' actions have led to the growth of judgment and destruction. This agricultural metaphor underscores the principle that the moral and spiritual choices of a nation or individual have tangible outcomes. The imagery is similar to the parable of the sower in <a href="/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13</a>, where the condition of the soil determines the fruitfulness of the seed, highlighting the importance of a receptive and obedient heart.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel during the 8th century BC, Hosea's ministry focused on calling Israel to repentance and warning of impending judgment due to their unfaithfulness to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often characterized by idolatry and political alliances that contradicted their covenant with God.

He had also threatened to punish them for their sin, and to deprive them of the means of sinning by destroying the instruments thereof, and to prevent their obtaining any help from their king, proving to them the folly of depending on him. He now proceeds, in this and following verses (4-8), to point out their moral corruption, the usual consequence or concomitant of irreligion and of false religion, instancing their deceptive dealing in the common affairs of life and their perjury in public compacts or covenants, as also their general unrighteousness. He threatens to destroy their idols to the distress of their worshippers and ministering priests as well as of their chief city. He threatens further to cause their calf-idols to be carried into captivity, pouring shame and contempt on their enterprises; to cut off their king; to leave the places of their idol-worship desolate, filling the people with distress and despair because of all their sins. <span class="cmt_word">They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant.</span> In this fourth verse the prophet deplores the absence of truth, faithfulness, and loyalty to duty. This expression, "they have spoken words," is generally understood to signify <p><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> "empty words," "false words," only words and no more, like the Latin <span class="accented">verba alicui dare</span>. Thus their vain, deceitful, lying words in private transactions and common affairs of everyday life would correspond to their perjury in public treaties and covenants. Their words were deceitful and their oaths falsehood. In their ordinary business transactions they used words, empty words, words without truth, corresponding thereto; in international concerns they had pursued the same course of falsifying and covenant-breaking. After entering into an engagement with the Assyrian king Shalmaneser, they made a covenant with So King of Egypt, as we read in <a href="/2_kings/17-4.htm">2 Kings 17:4</a>, "<span class="accented">And</span> the King of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So King of Egypt, and brought no present to the King of Assyria, as he had done year by year." In this latter case they acted as covenant-breakers, and at the same time contravened the Divine command, which forbade them entering into covenants with foreigners. The first clause, however, is understood by some <p><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> in the sense of "deliberating.' Thus Kimchi understands it, erroneously referring it to Jeroboam and his countrymen; thus: "<span class="accented">Jeroboam</span> and his companions took counsel what they should do in order to strengthen the government in his hand, and they deliberated (or held consultation) that the people should not go up to Jerusalem to the house of the sanctuary; and for this purpose they bound themselves by oath and made a covenant. But their oath was a vain one, because their oath was intended to frustrate the words of the Law and the command of God, and to make images for their worship."
