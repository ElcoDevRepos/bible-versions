This practice was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). The Israelites' reliance on these idols reflects a departure from their covenant relationship with Yahweh. Archaeological findings have uncovered various Canaanite religious artifacts, indicating the influence of surrounding pagan cultures. The use of wooden idols signifies a tangible, yet powerless, substitute for the living God, highlighting the futility of idolatry (<a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>).<p><b>and their divining rods inform them</b><br>Divining rods, or staffs, were tools used in ancient divination practices to seek guidance or predict the future. This practice is condemned in the Bible as it seeks knowledge apart from God (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>). The use of such methods indicates a lack of trust in God's sovereignty and wisdom. The Israelites' reliance on divination reflects their spiritual adultery, as they turn to pagan practices instead of seeking God's will through His prophets and His Word.<p><b>For a spirit of prostitution leads them astray</b><br>The metaphor of prostitution is frequently used in the Bible to describe Israel's unfaithfulness to God (<a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-10</a>). This "spirit of prostitution" suggests a pervasive and deep-seated inclination towards idolatry and spiritual infidelity. It implies a betrayal of the exclusive relationship God established with Israel, akin to marital unfaithfulness. This spiritual adultery is not just a physical act but a heart condition that leads the people away from their true devotion to God.<p><b>and they have played the harlot against their God</b><br>The imagery of harlotry underscores the severity of Israel's sin. By turning to other gods, the Israelites are depicted as being unfaithful to their divine "husband," Yahweh. This language is consistent with the covenantal relationship described in the Old Testament, where God is often portrayed as the husband of Israel (<a href="/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>). The prophetic message here is a call to repentance, urging the people to return to their covenantal obligations and fidelity to God. This theme of spiritual adultery and the call to return is echoed in the New Testament, where the Church is called to remain faithful to Christ, the bridegroom (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and redemption.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted as unfaithful to God, engaging in idolatry and spiritual adultery.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wooden_idols.htm">Wooden Idols</a></b><br>Objects of worship made from wood, representing the false gods that Israel turned to instead of the one true God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/divining_rods.htm">Divining Rods</a></b><br>Tools used in ancient practices to seek guidance or revelation, indicative of Israel's reliance on pagan practices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/spirit_of_prostitution.htm">Spirit of Prostitution</a></b><br>A metaphor for Israel's unfaithfulness to God, likening their idolatry to adultery.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry's_deception.htm">Idolatry's Deception</a></b><br>Idolatry leads to spiritual blindness and estrangement from God.

The verse stands as a timeless warning: whenever we seek direction, fulfillment, or identity anywhere but in the LORD, we repeat Israel&#8217;s folly and grieve the heart of our faithful Husband.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Their stocks.--</span>Blocks of wood fashioned into idols (Heb., <span class= "ital">his wood,</span> the collective singular being maintained).<p><span class= "bld">Their staff.</span>--Cyril regarded this as referring to divinations by means of rods (<span class= "greekheb">????????????</span>), which were placed upright, and after the repetition of incantations, allowed to fall, the forecast of the future being interpreted from the manner in which they fell. But perhaps the "staff" may refer, like the "stocks," to the idol itself. The Canaanite goddess Asherah was worshipped under this form.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-14.</span> - The first of these verses exhibits the private life of the people as depraved by sin and folly; the second their public life as degraded by idolatry and lewdness; while the third points to the corresponding chastisement and its cause. <span class="cmt_word">My people ask counsel at their stocks</span> (literally, <span class="accented">wood</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>and their staff declareth unto them</span>. Rashi explains "stocks," or literally, "wood," to mean "a graven image made out of wood;" while Aben Ezra prefaces his exposition of this by an observation which serves well as a link of connection between the eleventh and twelfth verses. It is as follows: "The sign that they are in reality without heart, is that my people turn to ask counsel of its stocks and wood." Kimchi not inaptly remarks, "They are like the blind man to whom his staff points out the way in which he should go." The stupidity of idolatry and the sin of divination are here combined. By the "wood" is meant an idol carved out of wood; while the staff may likewise have an image carved at the top for idolatrous purposes, or it may denote mode of divination by a staff which by the way it fell determined their course. Theophylaet explains this method of divination as follows: "<span class="accented">They</span> set up two rods, and muttered some verses and enchantments; and then the rods falling through the influence of demons, they considered how they fell, whether forward or backward, to the right or the left, and so gave answers to the foolish people, using the fall of the rods for <span class="accented">signs</span>." Cyril, who attributes the invention of rabdomancy to the Chaldeans, gives the same account of this method of divination. Herodotus mentions a mode of divination prevalent among the Scythians by means of willow rods; and Tacitus informs us that the Germans divined by a rod cut from a fruit-bearing tree. "They (the Germans) cut a twig from a fruit tree, and divide it into small pieces, which, distinguished by certain marks, are thrown promiscuously on a white garment. Then the priest or 'the canton, it' the occasion be public - if private, the master of the family - after an invocation of the gods, with his eyes lifted up to heaven, thrice takes out each piece, and as they come up, interprets their signification according to the marks fixed upon them." The sin and folly of any people consulting an idol of wood about the success or otherwise of an undertaking, or deciding whether by a species of teraphim or staff divination, is sufficiently obvious. But the great aggravation of Israel's sin arose from the circumstance not obscurely hinted by the possessive "my" attached to "people." That a people like Israel, whom God had chosen from among the nations of the earth and distinguished by special tokens of Divine favor, and to whom he had given the ephod with the truly oracular Urim and Thummim, should forsake him and the means he had given them of knowing his will, and turn aside to gods of wood, evinced at once stupidity unaccountable and sin inexcusable. "The prophet," says Calvin, "calls here the Israelites the people of God, not to honor them, but rather to increase their sin; for the more heinous was the perfidy of the people, that, having been chosen, they had afterwards forsaken their heavenly Father.... Now this people, that ought to be mine, consult their own wood, and their staff answers them!" <span class="cmt_word">For the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a-whoring from under their God.</span> In this part of the verse the prophet attempts to account for the extreme folly and heinous sin of Israel, as described in the first clause. It was an evil spirit, some demoniac power, that had inspired them with an insuperable fondness for idolatry, which in prophetic language is spiritual adultery. The consequence was a sad departure from the true God and a sinful wandering away from his worship, notwithstanding his amazing condescension and love by which he placed himself in the relation of a husband towards them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/4-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">My people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
