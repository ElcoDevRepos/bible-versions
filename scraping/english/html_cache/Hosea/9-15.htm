It was the first campsite of the Israelites after crossing the Jordan River into the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19-20</a>). However, it later became a center of idolatry and rebellion against God (<a href="/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>). The mention of Gilgal here symbolizes the transformation of a place of initial obedience into one of persistent sin. This serves as a reminder of how sacred places can become corrupted when the people turn away from God.<p><b>For there I hated them</b><br>The use of the word "hated" reflects God's righteous indignation towards Israel's persistent sin and idolatry. It is not an emotional hatred but a divine judgment against their actions. This phrase underscores the seriousness of Israel's rebellion and the resulting separation from God's favor. It echoes the covenantal language where disobedience leads to divine displeasure (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>).<p><b>I will drive them from My house</b><br>"My house" refers to the land of Israel, which God had given to His people as an inheritance. The driving out signifies exile, a consequence of breaking the covenant. This is a fulfillment of the warnings given in the Law, where disobedience would lead to expulsion from the land (<a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>). It also foreshadows the Assyrian exile of the Northern Kingdom.<p><b>For the wickedness of their deeds</b><br>The phrase highlights the cause of God's judgment: the people's actions. Their deeds included idolatry, injustice, and moral corruption, which violated the covenant relationship with God. This reflects the biblical principle that sin has consequences, and God's holiness demands justice (<a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>).<p><b>I will no longer love them</b><br>This statement indicates a withdrawal of God's covenantal love, which was conditional upon Israel's obedience. It is a sobering reminder of the conditional aspects of the Mosaic Covenant, where blessings were contingent on faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9-11</a>). It also points to the need for a new covenant, fulfilled in Christ, where love is unconditional and based on grace (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>).<p><b>All their leaders are rebellious</b><br>The leaders, including kings and priests, were responsible for guiding the people in righteousness. Their rebellion exacerbated the nation's sin, leading the people astray (<a href="/isaiah/9-16.htm">Isaiah 9:16</a>). This highlights the importance of godly leadership and the impact of leaders on the spiritual health of a nation. It also foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, the perfect leader and shepherd who would lead His people in truth and righteousness (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and redemption.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilgal.htm">Gilgal</a></b><br>A significant location in Israel's history, often associated with pivotal events, but here it symbolizes a place of Israel's rebellion and sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, which is the primary audience of Hosea's prophecies, known for its idolatry and turning away from God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who is expressing His judgment and displeasure with Israel's persistent sinfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/leaders_of_israel.htm">Leaders of Israel</a></b><br>The rulers and authorities who are described as rebellious, contributing to the nation's spiritual decline.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_persistent_sin.htm">The Consequences of Persistent Sin</a></b><br>God&#8217;s patience has limits; persistent rebellion leads to judgment.<br><br>Reflect on areas in life where we may be ignoring God&#8217;s warnings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_leadership.htm">The Significance of Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders have a profound impact on the spiritual direction of a community.<br><br>Pray for and support godly leaders who seek to honor God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just about physical idols but anything that takes God&#8217;s rightful place in our hearts.<br><br>Regularly evaluate what might be competing with God for our devotion.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_love_and_justice.htm">God&#8217;s Love and Justice</a></b><br>God&#8217;s love is profound, but His justice is equally important.<br><br>Understand that true love sometimes involves discipline and correction.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>Despite judgment, God always offers a path to repentance and restoration.<br><br>Seek God&#8217;s forgiveness and strive to return to Him wholeheartedly.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hosea_9_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hosea 9:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Hosea_9_15_God_s_response_to_sin.htm">How does Hosea 9:15 illustrate God's response to persistent sin and rebellion?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_evil_at_Gilgal_in_Israel.htm">What does "all their evil is at Gilgal" signify in Israel's history?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Avoid_behaviors_God_rejects_in_Hosea_9_15.htm">How can we avoid the behaviors that led to God's rejection in Hosea 9:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Hosea_9_15_vs_Psalm_5_5_God_s_view_on_sin.htm">Compare Hosea 9:15 with Psalm 5:5.

"My house" here, and in <a href="/hosea/8-1.htm" title="Set the trumpet to your mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.">Hosea 8:1</a> ("Jehovah's house"), is interpreted by Wnsche and Nowack, with considerable show of reason, to mean the "holy land," Canaan. This interpretation is confirmed by the use of the Assyrian word <span class= "ital">Bitu,</span> corresponding to the Hebrew <span class= "ital">beth</span> "house." The term seems to have blended the conception of a people and the territory they occupied. (See Schrader, <span class= "ital">Keilinschriften und das alte Testament,</span> p. 540, where the examples are cited <span class= "ital">Bit-Am-ma-na "</span>Ammon," <span class= "ital">Bit-A-di-ni,</span> "Beth-Eden.") Similarly, Egypt is called in <a href="/exodus/20-2.htm" title="I am the LORD your God, which have brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.">Exodus 20:2</a>, "the house of slaves." We are reminded by the word "house" of the domestic episode (Hosea 1-3): Ephraim, like an adulterous wife, is turned out of house and home (comp. <a href="/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a>), and is no longer Jehovah's people (<a href="/hosea/1-9.htm" title="Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for you are not my people, and I will not be your God.">Hosea 1:9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-17.</span> - After the interruption by the excited question of the prophet in ver. 14, the terrible storm of denunciation sweeps on to the end of the chapter. <span class="cmt_word">All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them</span>; or, <span class="accented">there I conceived hatred against them</span>, the verb being used in an inchoative sense. Gilgal had been the scene of many mercies; there the rite of circumcision, the seal of the Abrahamic covenant, after its omission dining the sojourn in the wilderness, was renewed; there the Passover, also intermitted from its second observance at Sinai, was kept; there the twelve memorial stones had been set up; there the Captain of the host of the Lord had appeared to Joshua, reassuring him of Divine protection; there the tabernacle had stood before its removal to Shiloh; yet that very place - a place of such blessing and solemn covenanting-had become the scene of idolatry and iniquity. The wickedness of Israel had been concentrated there as in a focus; there Israel's rejection of the theocracy in its spiritual form had taken place; there that first-plague's pot of ruin had been contracted; there the calf-worship had been developed; there the form of civil government had been shaped according to their own erring fancy, and their mode of religious worship had been corrupted. Thus Gilgal had become the center of all their sin; but the scene of mercy became the source of wrath, for there God's fatherly love was turned by Israel's wickedness into hatred. <span class="cmt_word">For the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house, I will love them no more.</span> They were driven out like Hagar out of the house of the patriarch, that Ishmael might not inherit with Isaac; like an unfaithful wife divorced and driven out of the house of the husband whom she has dishonored; or like an undutiful and disobedient son whom his father has disinherited. Further, God disowns the rebellious son, and acknowledges the paternal relationship no longer. The princes of Israel had become rebellions and stubborn: by an impressive Hebrew paronomasia, their <span class="accented">sarim</span>, rulers, had become <span class="accented">sorerim</span>, revolters. <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit.</span> Ephraim is a pleasant plant, but a worm has smitten the root and it has withered; Ephraim is a goodly tree, but the lightning of heaven has scorched and dried it up; there may be leafage for a time, but no fruitage ever. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb.</span> The desires - margin, <span class="accented">dear delights</span>, or, <span class="accented">darlings - perish</span>, and so the figure is now dropped, and the fact is seen in all its severe and stern reality, while the dread denunciation of vers. 11 and 12 is repeated and emphasized. <span class="cmt_word">My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations.</span> The prophet submits his will to the Divine will, and acquiesces in the disposals of his providence, and in his own proper person predicts Israel's coming doom. He fills up the outline of the dark picture by stating the cause of their rejection. He specifies at the same time the character of rejection, namely, dispersion among the nations, like birds driven from their nest, for so the term <span class="accented">nodedim</span> denotes. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/9-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their evil</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1444;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
