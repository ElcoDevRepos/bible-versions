It suggests a period of restoration and hope after judgment and exile. The prophetic nature of this word points to a time when God's redemptive plan will unfold.<p><b>the people of Israel will return</b><br>The return of Israel signifies repentance and a turning back to God. Historically, this can be seen in the context of the Babylonian exile and the eventual return to the land. Spiritually, it represents a broader return to faithfulness and covenant relationship with God. This theme of return is echoed in other prophetic books, such as Jeremiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>and seek the LORD their God</b><br>Seeking the LORD implies a sincere desire to know and follow God, contrasting with Israel's previous idolatry. This phrase emphasizes a restored relationship and a renewed commitment to the covenant. It aligns with the call to seek God found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a> and <a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a>.<p><b>and David their king</b><br>This reference to David points to the messianic hope rooted in the Davidic covenant (2 Samuel 7). It suggests a future leader from David's line, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the Son of David in the New Testament. This expectation of a Davidic king is a recurring theme in prophetic literature, including Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>They will come trembling to the LORD</b><br>The imagery of trembling conveys a sense of awe, reverence, and fear of the LORD. It reflects a deep recognition of God's holiness and power. This response is consistent with biblical accounts of encounters with God, such as at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>) and in the visions of the prophets.<p><b>and to His goodness</b><br>God's goodness encompasses His mercy, grace, and faithfulness. This phrase highlights the benevolent character of God, who desires to bless and restore His people. The goodness of God is a central theme in the Psalms and is often associated with His covenant love and faithfulness.<p><b>in the last days</b><br>The term "last days" is eschatological, pointing to the future fulfillment of God's promises. It encompasses both the immediate future of Israel's restoration and the ultimate culmination of history in the coming of the Messiah. This concept is further developed in the New Testament, particularly in the teachings of Jesus and the writings of Paul and Peter.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, Hosea's life and marriage symbolize God's relationship with Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/children_of_israel.htm">Children of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Israel, God's chosen nation, who are called to return to Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_their_god.htm">The LORD their God</a></b><br>The one true God of Israel, whom the people are urged to seek.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david_their_king.htm">David their king</a></b><br>Symbolically refers to the Messiah, a descendant of David, whom Christians believe is fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_last_days.htm">The Last Days</a></b><br>A prophetic term often used to describe the time of fulfillment of God's promises, including the coming of the Messiah and the establishment of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/return_to_god.htm">Return to God</a></b><br>The call to return to God is timeless.

Thus Rehoboam and his house are spoken of as "David" (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm" title="So when all Israel saw that the king listened not to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to your own house, David. So Israel departed to their tents.">1Kings 12:16</a>). The phrase "latter days" is used indefinitely of the distant future, the horizon of the seer's gaze. It occurs in <a href="/genesis/49-1.htm" title="And Jacob called to his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.">Genesis 49:1</a> (Authorised version, "last days"). We can only see the fulfilment of this anticipation in the Messianic reign. (Comp. <a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm" title="And I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.">Ezekiel 34:23</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/37-24.htm" title="And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments, and observe my statutes, and do them.">Ezekiel 37:24</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the Lord theft God, and David their king.</span> The note of time in the beginning of ver. 5 is explained by Rashi to signify "after the days of the Captivity;" and by Kimchi as follows: "This will take place at the end of the days, near the time of salvation, when the children of Israel shall return in repentance." Though not comprehended in the symbolic representation that precedes, this statement is necessary to complete it. The future of Israel is the burden of this promise; the blessedness of that future is its brightness. It comprises three items - the reversal of their previous career, their loving return to the Lord their God, and their cordial reception of David their king. Contemporaneous with their sorrow for the sins of the past was their serious seeking of the Lord their God and submission to David their king. Their revolt from the Davidic dynasty in the days of Rehoboam was immediately followed by the idolatry of the calves which Jeroboam set up at Dan and Bethel. The reversal of this course is symptomatic of their complete recovery. The patriarch David was long dead and buried, and his sepulcher was in Palestine at the time when the prophet wrote; one, therefore, in the Davidic line, a descendant from, and dynastic representative of, the patriarch must be meant. That this was Messiah there can be no reasonable doubt; parallel passages in the other prophets prove this; for example: "I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd. And I the Lord will be their God, and my servant David a prince among them" (<a href="/ezekiel/34-23.htm">Ezekiel 34:23, 25</a>; comp. also Ezekiel 37:24). Again in Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/30-9.htm">Jeremiah 30:9</a>) we read to the same purpose, "They shall serve the Lord their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them." We can by no means concur with those who refer this promise to Zerubbabel as a later occupant of the Davidic throne; and just as little with those who, like Wunsche, hold that the prophet has no particular period and no particular person in view, but presents the prospect of a happy and blissful future when Israel would return to the pure worship of Jehovah and enjoy his gracious protection, and when the national prosperity would equal or even far <span class="accented">surpass</span> that under the glorious reign of David <span class="accented">himself.</span> The best Jewish authorities are quoted in favor of the same; thus Rabbi Tanchum says, "He (the prophet) understands the son of David, occupying his place, from his lineage, walking in his way, by whom his name shall endure and his kingdom be preserved." The Chaldee Targum translates in the same sense: "<span class="accented">They</span> shall seek the worship of Jehovah their God, and obey Messiah, the Son of David, their king." So Aben Ezra <span class="accented">says</span> that "David their king is this Messiah, Like 'My servant David shall be their prince forever' (<a href="/ezekiel/37-25.htm">Ezekiel 37:25</a>)." The well-known idiom of one idea expressed by two verbs, so that the rendering of the clause would be "They shall again seek the Lord their God, and David their king," if applied here, as undoubtedly it might, would weaken the sense, and so be unsuitable to the context. <span class="cmt_word">And shall fear</span> (literally, <span class="accented">come with trembling to</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the Lord and his goodness in the latter days.</span> The comment of Kimchi on the first part of this clause is as follows: "They shall tremble and be afraid of him when they return to him, and shall with repentance wait for the goodness of redemption on which they have trusted." A somewhat different meaning is assigned to the words by Aben Ezra: "They shall return in haste, when the end (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the time of redemption) comes to their own land with hasty course suddenly." <span class="accented">His goodness</span> is taken by some in a concrete sense, as signifying the blessings which he bestows and the good gifts which he imparts; and by others in the abstract, as the Divine goodness or majesty, to which Israel resorts for the pardon of sin and the gracious acceptance of their petitions and answer of their prayers. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/3-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Afterward,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1431;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_310.htm">Strong's 310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The hind or following part</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1428;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will return</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1433;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#353;u&#183;&#7687;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and seek</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;iq&#183;&#353;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
