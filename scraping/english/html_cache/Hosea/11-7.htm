The Hebrew word for "bent" suggests a strong inclination or stubbornness, indicating that the people's hearts are set on apostasy. Historically, Israel's idolatry and alliances with foreign nations demonstrate this turning away. The context of Hosea, a prophet to the Northern Kingdom, underscores the spiritual adultery of Israel, as they often worshiped Baal and other deities. This rebellion is reminiscent of the Israelites' behavior in the wilderness (Exodus 32) and their cyclical sin during the time of the Judges (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-19</a>).<p><b>Though they call to the Most High,</b><br>This phrase suggests a superficial or insincere appeal to God. Despite their rebellion, the Israelites still engaged in religious rituals and called upon God, perhaps in times of distress. This reflects a common theme in the Old Testament where the people of Israel would turn to God in desperation but not in genuine repentance (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>). The term "Most High" emphasizes God's supreme authority and sovereignty, a title that denotes His power over all creation (<a href="/genesis/14-18.htm">Genesis 14:18-20</a>).<p><b>He will by no means exalt them.</b><br>This indicates that God will not honor or elevate those who are insincere in their devotion. The phrase underscores the principle that God desires true repentance and faithfulness rather than empty rituals (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). The historical context of Hosea shows that Israel's continued rebellion led to their eventual downfall and exile by Assyria in 722 BC. This serves as a warning that God's patience has limits, and judgment follows persistent disobedience. Theologically, this reflects the justice of God, who cannot be mocked (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>), and points to the need for genuine transformation, a theme fulfilled in the New Testament through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel during the 8th century BC.

Israel is not merely stumbling; they are &#8220;bent&#8221; or set on departing from the God who rescued and nurtured them (see <a href="/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1-4</a>).<p>- This describes real history: after being delivered from Egypt, the nation repeatedly chose idols and alliances over covenant faithfulness (<a href="/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1-8</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13-17</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s lament underscores that wayward hearts grieve Him, yet He records it to warn and awaken (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2-4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-19.htm">Jeremiah 2:19</a>).<p>- Application: whenever a believer drifts, it begins with a heart posture, not an isolated act.
