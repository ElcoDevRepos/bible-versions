In the context of Hosea, this refers to the impending judgment on Israel due to their persistent idolatry and unfaithfulness to God. Historically, this aligns with the period leading up to the Assyrian conquest of Israel in 722 BC. Theologically, it reflects the principle that God&#8217;s patience has limits when His people continually reject His covenant.<p><b>the days of retribution have arrived&#8212;</b><br>Retribution here implies a just recompense for Israel's sins. The concept of retribution is consistent with the covenantal curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to specific consequences. This serves as a warning that God&#8217;s justice will be executed, fulfilling the prophetic warnings given through His prophets.<p><b>let Israel know it.</b><br>This is a call for awareness and acknowledgment of the seriousness of their situation. It emphasizes the need for Israel to recognize the reality of their impending judgment. The phrase suggests that despite the warnings, Israel has been oblivious or dismissive of the consequences of their actions.<p><b>The prophet is called a fool,</b><br>Prophets in Israel were often ridiculed or dismissed, especially when their messages were unpopular. This reflects a cultural tendency to reject divine messages that challenge the status quo or call for repentance. The term "fool" here is used derogatorily, indicating a lack of respect for the prophet&#8217;s role as God&#8217;s messenger.<p><b>and the inspired man insane,</b><br>This phrase highlights the contempt and disbelief faced by those who were genuinely inspired by God. The term "insane" suggests that the people viewed the prophet&#8217;s warnings as irrational or nonsensical. This mirrors the treatment of other prophets, such as Jeremiah, who were often persecuted for their messages.<p><b>because of the greatness of your iniquity and hostility.</b><br>The "greatness of your iniquity" underscores the extent of Israel&#8217;s sin, which includes idolatry, social injustice, and covenant unfaithfulness. "Hostility" refers to their opposition to God and His messengers. This hostility is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, where the people&#8217;s resistance to God&#8217;s word leads to their downfall. This phrase serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God&#8217;s commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted in Hosea as unfaithful to God, engaging in idolatry and moral corruption.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet.htm">Prophet</a></b><br>In this context, refers to Hosea and other true prophets of God who were often disregarded or mocked by the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/days_of_punishment_and_retribution.htm">Days of Punishment and Retribution</a></b><br>A period of divine judgment upon Israel due to their persistent sin and rebellion against God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/iniquity_and_hostility.htm">Iniquity and Hostility</a></b><br>The sinful behaviors and attitudes of the Israelites that led to their estrangement from God and the rejection of His prophets.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin has real consequences, both spiritually and physically.

God&#8217;s retribution is deliberate and just, and His prophet faithfully declares it. Instead of repenting, the people dismiss the messenger as a fool and a madman, revealing the depth of their sin-darkened hostility. The verse warns every generation: when sin grows great, we may be tempted to label God&#8217;s truth-speakers as irrational, but the real madness is refusing the gracious call to turn back while there is still time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) The latter part of the verse should be translated <span class= "ital">Crazed is the prophet, mad the inspired one, because of the multitude of thy iniquity, while persecution is increased.</span> The prophet is crazed either in the depraved public opinion that Hosea scornfully describes, or, he is driven mad, distracted, by the persecutions to which he is subjected. The latter is more probable. (Comp. the following verse.) Other commentators, including Maurer and Hitzig (preceded by Jerome and many Jewish as well as Christian expositors) take the words for prophet in this verse as signifying "false prophet," and would connect the clauses thus:--"Israel shall recognise that the prophet (who prophesied good to them) is a fool, the inspired one a madman, because of," &c. But it is doubtful whether the Hebrew for "inspired one" (<span class= "ital">ish har-ach</span>) can bear this unfavourable sense, with the definite article affixed (comp. <a href="/1_kings/22-21.htm" title="And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will persuade him.">1Kings 22:21</a>, Heb.); so Nowack. The passage is very difficult, and no decisive superiority can be claimed for any rendering yet proposed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-9.</span> - These verses describe the season and source of punishment. <span class="cmt_word">The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come.</span> Commentators have appropriately compared the Vergilian "Venit summa dies, et irreluctabile tempus," equivalent to" The final day and inevitable hour is come." <span class="cmt_word">Israel shall know</span> (it): <span class="cmt_word">the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad</span>. Here the prophet and the man of the spirit (margin) are <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the false prophets which pretended to inspiration, and flattered the people with false hopes and vain promises of safety and prosperity; and thus helped to confirm them in their sinful courses. The object of Israel's knowledge, though not introduced by <span class="accented">ki</span>, is the folly of such false prophets, and the madness of such pretenders to prophetic inspiration. That <span class="accented">ish ruach</span> may be used of a false prophet as well as of a true one is proved from <span class="accented">ish holekh ruach</span>, a man walking in the spirit, applied by <a href="/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a> to one of these pretenders: "If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people." Israel is doomed to know by bitter experience the folly and madness of those prophets who deceived and duped the people by lies soon detected, and their own folly and madness in giving ear to the delusive prospects they held forth. This explanation agrees with Kimchi's comment: "Then shall they confess, and say to the prophets of lies, who had led them astray, and had said to them, Peace (in time of greatest peril) - then shall they say unto them, A fool the prophet, a madman the man of spirit." The predicate precedes the subject for emphasis, and the article prefixed to the subject exhausts the class of those false prophets. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Aben Ezra, Ewald, and many others understand the prophet and spiritual man to mean true prophets, which the people called fools and madmen, and treated is such, contemning and persecuting them. Thus Aben Ezra: "The days of recompense are come to you from God, who will recompense you who said to the prophet of God, He is a fool, and to the man in whom the spirit of God was, He is mad."
