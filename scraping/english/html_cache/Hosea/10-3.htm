It suggests a turning point where the consequences of their actions become evident. The context is the impending judgment due to their idolatry and unfaithfulness to God. This realization is prophetic, as Hosea often speaks of future events as if they are already happening, emphasizing the certainty of God's word.<p><b>We have no king</b><br>Historically, this reflects the political instability in Israel during Hosea's time. The Northern Kingdom experienced frequent changes in leadership, with several kings being assassinated or overthrown. This instability is seen as a direct result of the nation's spiritual unfaithfulness. Biblically, the absence of a king also symbolizes a lack of divine guidance, as the king was supposed to be God's representative on earth.<p><b>for we do not revere the LORD</b><br>The root cause of Israel's problems is identified here: a failure to honor and worship God. This lack of reverence is tied to their idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness. Theologically, reverence for the LORD is foundational to Israel's identity and success, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which commands love and devotion to God. The absence of reverence leads to moral and societal decay.<p><b>What can a king do for us?</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the futility of relying on human leadership when the people are spiritually bankrupt. It reflects a sense of hopelessness and disillusionment with earthly powers. Biblically, it echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a>, which warns against putting trust in princes. Theologically, it points to the need for divine intervention and foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, the true King who provides spiritual salvation and eternal hope.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, Hosea's ministry was during a time of great moral and spiritual decline.

When judgment falls and the idols fail, the people will finally admit aloud what had been simmering under the surface.<p>&#8226; Earlier in the chapter the prophet declared, &#8220;Their heart is deceitful; now they must bear their guilt&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/10-2.htm">Hosea 10:2</a>). The &#8220;surely&#8221; ties directly to that verdict&#8212;exposure of hidden sin leads inevitably to confession.<p>&#8226; Similar prophetic scenes appear in <a href="/jeremiah/2-19.htm">Jeremiah 2:19</a>, where God says, &#8220;Your wickedness will punish you; your apostasy will reprove you,&#8221; and the people come to see what their rebellion has cost them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We have no king</b><p>&#8226; Israel had once clamored for a king (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5&#8211;7</a>), believing a throne would bring security. Now they stand kingless&#8212;either because the monarchy has collapsed or because the remaining ruler is powerless.<p>&#8226; Hosea later reminds them, &#8220;Where is your king now, that he may save you in all your cities?&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/13-10.htm">Hosea 13:10</a>). Earthly authority cannot withstand divine judgment.<p>&#8226; Even in exile, this sentiment echoes: &#8220;For the Israelites will live many days without king or prince&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>). The vacuum is both political and spiritual.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For we do not revere the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The confession cuts to the root. A missing king is only a symptom; the real disease is irreverence toward God. <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a> declares, &#8220;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge,&#8221; and <a href="/2_kings/17-34.htm">2 Kings 17:34</a> notes that Israel &#8220;did not fear the LORD&#8221; and therefore slid into idolatry.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Revere&#8221; includes worship, trust, and obedience. Without that posture, every human structure&#8212;government, economy, family&#8212;unravels.<p>&#8226; This admission fulfills <a href="/hosea/4-1.htm">Hosea 4:1</a>, where the LORD charges, &#8220;There is no faithfulness or love, no knowledge of God in the land.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What can a king do for us?</b><p>&#8226; Disillusionment sets in. Once God is sidelined, even the best ruler is helpless. <a href="/psalms/146-3.htm">Psalm 146:3</a> warns, &#8220;Put not your trust in princes&#8230; in whom there is no salvation,&#8221; and <a href="/isaiah/2-22.htm">Isaiah 2:22</a> urges, &#8220;Stop trusting in mere humans.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The question is rhetorical and despairing: &#8220;If we refuse to honor the LORD, why expect help from a man?&#8221; <a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5</a> answers, &#8220;Cursed is the man who trusts in man&#8230; whose heart turns away from the LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verse anticipates the ultimate solution: only by returning to the covenant King&#8212;Yahweh Himself and, in fullness of time, the Messiah-King&#8212;can the nation find rescue (<a href="/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hosea/10-3.htm">Hosea 10:3</a> captures the moment when Israel&#8217;s self-reliance collapses. The people reluctantly admit three intertwined realities: their earthly throne is empty, their hearts lack fear of God, and therefore no human leader can help them. Scripture affirms that when reverence for the LORD disappears, every other support crumbles. The verse invites us to reverse the pattern&#8212;start with wholehearted fear of the LORD, and all leadership, security, and hope find their rightful place under His sovereign rule.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">To us</span>.--Better, <span class= "ital">as for a king, what will he do for us?</span> The prophet having witnessed a succession of Israelite kings overthrown, and anarchy as its consequence, predicts yet another time of confusion and helplessness, a full vindication of the threatenings of the prophet Samuel. (Comp. <a href="/1_samuel/8-19.htm" title="Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, No; but we will have a king over us;">1Samuel 8:19</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the Lord.</span> In the day of their destruction Israel would be brought to see and even feel that the king appointed through their own self-will and fancied plenitude of power was unable to protect or help them, and that because they had rejected Jehovah and cast aside his fear. The point of time denoted by "now" is either when they see destruction before their eyes, or when Israel is already in captivity. Rashi explains it in the former sense: "When destruction shall come upon them, they shall say, 'We have no king,' that is, our king on whom we set our hopes when we said, 'Our king shall go out before us and light our battles,' affords us no help whatever." Kimchi explains similarly, but fixes the "now" in the time of the Captivity: "Now, when they shall be carried out of their land, they shall recognize and say, 'We have no king;' the explanation is, as it' we had no king among us, for there is no strength in him to deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, as we thought when we asked for a king who should march at our head and fight our battles. God - blessed be he! - was our King, and we needed no king, and he it was that delivered us out of the hand of our enemies when we did his will." Aben Ezra and others understand it as the expression of a wild licorice on the part of Israel, recklessly giving vent to an anarchical and atheistic spirit: "As soon as their heart was divided they had no wish to have a king over them, and had no fear of Jehovah; therefore they had no fear, and every one did what was right in his own eyes." This exposition neglects the note of time, as also the causal particle that follows. They bethought themselves that, as they had not feared Jehovah, but neglected his Law, the king which they had demanded could do them no good. "What," they asked, "can the king do for us? He has no power to deliver us, since God is angry with us, for we have sinned against him?" Such is the confession of Israel in captivity. Pusey remarks in reference to this: "In sin, all Israel had asked for a king, when the Lord was their King; in sin, Ephraim had made Jeroboam king; in sin, their subsequent kings were made, without the counsel and advice of God; and now, as the close of all, they reflect how fruitless it all was." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/10-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Surely</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6258.htm">Strong's 6258: </a> </span><span class="str2">At this time</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they will say,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;We have</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1425;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
