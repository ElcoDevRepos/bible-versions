Historically, Assyria was a dominant empire during Hosea's time, and Israel sought alliances with them for protection against other threats. This act of seeking help from Assyria reflects a lack of faith in God's provision and protection, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>, where reliance on foreign powers is condemned. The political context of the time was marked by instability, and Israel's leaders often turned to powerful neighbors for security, which ultimately led to their downfall.<p><b>like a wild donkey on its own</b><br>The wild donkey is a symbol of stubbornness and independence, often used in Scripture to describe a lack of discipline or control (see <a href="/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5-8</a>). This imagery suggests that Israel is acting impulsively and without guidance, pursuing its own desires rather than following God's commandments. The wild donkey's solitary nature also implies that Israel is isolating itself from God's covenant community, choosing its own path rather than the one God has set.<p><b>Ephraim has hired lovers</b><br>Ephraim, representing the northern kingdom of Israel, is depicted as unfaithful, akin to a spouse seeking illicit relationships. The term "hired lovers" suggests that Israel is paying for alliances and protection, which is both costly and degrading. This metaphor of infidelity is consistent with Hosea's broader theme of Israel's spiritual adultery, as seen in <a href="/hosea/1.htm">Hosea 1-3</a>, where Israel's unfaithfulness to God is likened to a wife's unfaithfulness to her husband. The hiring of lovers also points to the futility of these alliances, as they ultimately lead to Israel's exploitation and downfall, fulfilling the prophetic warnings of judgment for their unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Represents the northern kingdom of Israel, often used synonymously with Israel in the prophetic books.

They abandon covenant reliance on God (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1&#8211;14</a>) and invite the curse side of that same covenant (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-47.htm">Deuteronomy 28:47&#8211;52</a>), which Assyria eventually brings to pass in 722 BC.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like a wild donkey on its own</b><p>&#8226; A wild donkey in Scripture pictures stubborn independence and aimless wandering (<a href="/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-24.htm">Jeremiah 2:24</a>). Israel is pictured as an untamed beast, doing whatever it pleases yet exposed to every predator.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;on its own&#8221; underlines isolation. By cutting loose from God&#8217;s herd, Ephraim forfeits the Shepherd&#8217;s care (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>; <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p>&#8226; What looks like freedom is actually vulnerability. Hosea pairs this image with an earlier warning: &#8220;Ephraim is like a dove, silly and without sense, calling to Egypt, going to Assyria&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>). Both animal pictures stress flighty, self-directed behavior that ends in captivity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ephraim has hired lovers</b><p>&#8226; The marriage imagery that runs through Hosea resurfaces here. Instead of trusting her Husband, Israel pays foreign nations for security&#8212;an act of spiritual prostitution (<a href="/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-33.htm">Ezekiel 16:33&#8211;34</a>).<p>&#8226; Politically, the &#8220;hire&#8221; was tribute: gold and silver stripped from temple and palace treasuries (<a href="/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>; <a href="/2_kings/16-8.htm">2 Kings 16:8</a>). Spiritually, it was the exact opposite of faith, because God had promised to provide everything freely if Israel would simply remain faithful (<a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; The irony is sharp: lovers should pursue the bride, yet Israel &#8220;hires&#8221; them, degrading herself and draining her resources. <a href="/proverbs/5-10.htm">Proverbs 5:10</a> warns that unfaithfulness ends with &#8220;strangers feast[ing] on your wealth,&#8221; a prophecy fulfilled when Assyria plunders Samaria.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hosea/8-9.htm">Hosea 8:9</a> exposes Israel&#8217;s misplaced trust: rushing to Assyria for aid, running wild in self-willed independence, and paying foreign powers for protection. Each image uncovers covenant infidelity and highlights the inevitable consequence&#8212;captivity by the very nation they courted. The verse invites every reader to reject self-reliance and compromising alliances, and instead cling to the faithful, all-sufficient Lord who alone rescues and satisfies those who remain true to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Gone up to Assyria</span>.--The word thus translated is elsewhere used for "going up" to the sanctuary of the Lord. (See Note on <a href="/hosea/7-11.htm" title="Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.">Hosea 7:11</a>.) <span class= "ital">Wild ass</span> is the image of untamed waywardness (<a href="/job/39-5.htm" title="Who has sent out the wild ass free? or who has loosed the bands of the wild ass?">Job 39:5</a>, <span class= "ital">sea.</span>) it is described by Wetzstein as inhabiting the steppes, a creature of dirty yellow colour, with long ears and no horns, and a head resembling a gazelle's. Its pace is so swift that no huntsman can overtake it. It is seldom seen alone, but in herds of several hundreds. From <a href="/jeremiah/2-24.htm" title="A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffs up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.">Jeremiah 2:24</a> we infer that the animal wanders alone after the object of its lust. Israel, like a solitary wild ass, seeks strange loves, courts strange alliances. On the last clause, see <a href="/context/ezekiel/16-32.htm" title="But as a wife that commits adultery, which takes strangers instead of her husband!">Ezekiel 16:32-34</a>. Ephraim pays abnormally for her own shame.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.</span> All their misery and misfortune they have brought upon themselves. They have prepared this fate for themselves, and made themselves meet for their fate. The second clause is correctly rendered, <span class="accented">a wild ass goes alone by itself</span>; <span class="accented">and</span> this clause is an independent statement - not connected by n- of comparison either with the clause preceding nor with the succeeding one. Instead of saying that Epraim, that is, Israel, went up to Assyria like a stubborn wild ass alone by itself, or that like a wild ass going alone Ephraim hired (sued for) lovers, the statement stands independent and in a measure detached, the meaning being that even a wild ass, stupid and stubborn as that animal is, keeps by itself to secure its independence. The conduct of Israel, however, appears to disadvantage in contrast with that of a stupid wild ass; it is more stupid and senseless; their folly is seen by the comparison: it maintained its independence by going alone, Ephraim lost independence by soliciting help from heathen allies. What, then, was the object to the attainment of which this foolish conduct was directed? In other words, why did Israel go on this stupid mission to Assyria? What did they seek to gain by it? The third clause contains the answer: they sought help and succor from the <span class="accented">Assyrians</span>. Thus the first clause, giving a reason for their calamity, shows it was self-procured by Ephraim going up to Assyria; the second clause exposes the folly of such conduct in seeking prohibited and pernicious foreign alliances; the third clause specifies the precise object of Ephraim's sinful and foolish mission, namely, the procuring of succor from <span class="accented">Assyria</span>. The above explanation, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> which is in substance Keil's, and which is a contrast between the independence of the wild ass and Ephraim's servile suing for foreign help, is, we think, simpler and more correct than <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the common one, which is a comparison of the willfulness, waywardness, and wantonness of the wild ass roaming solitarily by itself with Ephraim's willful waywardness in going up to Assyria for succor, and wantonness in suing for idolatrous alliances. The expression, "<span class="accented">going</span> <span class="accented">up</span>," alludes to going to the interior of the country, or to the capital of the monarch Assyria now owned as sovereign, or to a place of refuge. The hiring of lovers, or lover, by Ephraim stigmatizes their shameful conduct as that of a shameless harlot, who, instead of receiving, bestows presents on lovers, or as the reward of endearments. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/8-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1433;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;m&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun -
