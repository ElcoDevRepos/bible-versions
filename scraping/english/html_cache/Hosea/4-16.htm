In ancient agrarian societies, a heifer that refused to be led was a significant problem, symbolizing rebellion and disobedience. This metaphor highlights Israel's refusal to follow God's commandments and their tendency to pursue idolatry and sinful practices. The comparison to a heifer is significant because cattle were common in Israel, making this a relatable image for the original audience. This stubbornness is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where Israel often turns away from God despite His continuous guidance and provision (e.g., <a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6</a>).<p><b>Can the LORD now shepherd them like lambs in an open meadow?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the difficulty of leading a rebellious people. Shepherding is a common biblical metaphor for God's care and guidance (<a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), and lambs represent innocence and willingness to follow. The open meadow suggests a place of safety and provision, where the sheep can graze freely under the shepherd's watchful eye. However, Israel's obstinacy makes it impossible for God to lead them to such a place of blessing and peace. This imagery contrasts the ideal relationship between God and His people with the current reality of Israel's rebellion. The question implies that without repentance and a change of heart, Israel cannot experience the fullness of God's care and protection. This theme of shepherding is also a type of Christ, who is the Good Shepherd, leading His flock with love and sacrifice (<a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14-15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, often referred to as Ephraim, representing the people of God who have turned away from Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who desires to shepherd His people but faces their resistance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His message of judgment and hope to Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/stubborn_heifer.htm">Stubborn Heifer</a></b><br>A metaphor for Israel's obstinacy and unwillingness to follow God's guidance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/open_meadow.htm">Open Meadow</a></b><br>Symbolizes a place of peace and provision where God desires to lead His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_stubbornness.htm">Understanding Stubbornness</a></b><br>Recognize that spiritual stubbornness is a refusal to submit to God's will, akin to a heifer resisting guidance.

A heifer is meant to work alongside its master, just as God&#8217;s people are designed to walk in covenant obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement is literal in its indictment: Israel&#8217;s actions&#8212;idolatry, injustice, and ritual prostitution described earlier in <a href="/bsb/hosea/4.htm">Hosea 4</a>&#8212;prove the charge.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Can the LORD now shepherd them</b><p>&#8226; Shepherding implies guidance, protection, and provision (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-11.htm">Isaiah 40:11</a>). God stands ready to do exactly that, yet Israel&#8217;s obstinacy blocks the blessing.<p>&#8226; The question &#8220;Can the LORD now&#8230;?&#8221; underlines the moral tension. God&#8217;s holy character will not indulge unrepentant sin (<a href="/isaiah/59-1.htm">Isaiah 59:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar moments appear throughout Scripture: Jesus weeping over Jerusalem&#8212;&#8220;How often I wanted to gather your children together&#8230; and you were unwilling&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>). The offer of care is real; the refusal is equally real.<p>&#8226; The verse does not suggest divine inability but highlights human responsibility. If the sheep bolt, the benefits of the Shepherd&#8217;s care are forfeited (<a href="/john/10-26.htm">John 10:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Like lambs in an open meadow</b><p>&#8226; The image shifts from the stubborn heifer to gentle lambs grazing securely. It evokes peace, abundance, and intimacy with the Shepherd (<a href="/psalms/95-7.htm">Psalm 95:7</a>; <a href="/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a>).<p>&#8226; An &#8220;open meadow&#8221; suggests unrestricted pasture&#8212;no walls, no threats, full nourishment. God promised this in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/34-14.htm">Ezekiel 34:14</a>: &#8220;I will feed them in a good pasture.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Because Israel acts like the heifer instead of the lamb, they miss the meadow and will face the consequences outlined in the next verses (<a href="/hosea/4-17.htm">Hosea 4:17-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the picture of lambs hints at hope: if they would repent and trust, the meadow remains God&#8217;s intended destiny (<a href="/jeremiah/50-19.htm">Jeremiah 50:19</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hosea/4-16.htm">Hosea 4:16</a> draws a sharp contrast: Israel&#8217;s current attitude (stubborn heifer) versus God&#8217;s desired relationship (lambs under a Shepherd&#8217;s care). The literal charge of obstinacy underscores why judgment looms, while the pastoral question exposes what is forfeited by rebellion. The verse invites each reader to choose between digging in against the Lord or yielding to His leading and enjoying the open meadow of His provision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Slideth back.</span>--More correctly, <span class= "ital">is stubborn as</span> <span class= "ital">a stubborn cow.</span><p><span class= "bld">Will feed them as a lamb in a large place.--</span>An expression of tender commiseration (so Ewald).

If this view of the connection be correct, it will help to the right understanding of a difficult passage. The "backsliding," according to the Authorized Version, is rather "stubbornness," "intractableness," or "unmanageableness." Keil renders it "refractory." This refractoriness was Israel's sin; the people would have their own way, and became refractory, like an unmanageable heifer, which rebels upon being trained. Aben Ezra explains <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> (which, by the way, has <span class="accented">tsere</span> before the tone syllable) as follows: "<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d9;</span> is he who turns aside from the way that is appointed him, so that he does not walk in it. And, behold, he compares Israel to a stubborn cow, with which a man cannot plough." So also Kfinchi: "Like a heifer which goes on a crooked way, and curves itself from under the yoke, that a man cannot plough with it; so Israel are crooked under their God, as they have taken upon them the yoke of the Law and of the command-meats which he commanded them, and curve themselves under the yoke, and break from off them the yoke of the commandments." Israel rebelled against instruction, waxed stubborn and intractable. They would have their own way, and worshipped according to their own will, in indulging all the while with a high hand in vilest lusts. Now the season of punishment is arrived; and as they refused instruction and rebelled against Divine guidance, God, in just judgment and deserved punishment, leaves them to themselves. Carried into captivity, they may worship what they will, and live as they list. In these circumstances they will resemble a lamb taken away into a wilderness, and left there to range the wild and live at large, but without provision and without protection. Untended by the shepherd's watchful care, unguarded from ravening wolves or other beasts of prey, that lamb is in a lost and perishing condition. So shall it be with Israel. Aben Ezra gives as an alternative sense: "Now (Jehovah will feed them like a lamb) alone in a wide place, and it wanders to and fro." Kimchi cites as the opinion of others: "Some say, Now will Jehovah let them feed alone in a wide place, like a lamb which bleats and goes to and fro, and neither rests nor feeds." Another meaning has been attached to the verse, to the effect that Israel, subdued by chastise-meat, will renounce their stubbornness, and, rendered tractable and tame, become like a lamb, which, brought to feel its helplessness amid a wilderness, requires and receives the shepherd's care. We much prefer the former. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/4-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1434;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is as obstinate</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1465;&#1469;&#1512;&#1461;&#1512;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#333;&#183;r&#234;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5637.htm">Strong's 5637: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn away, be refractory</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as a stubborn</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#257;&#183;rar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5637.htm">Strong's 5637: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn away, be refractory</span><br /><br /><span class="word">heifer.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1508;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;p&#772;&#257;&#183;r&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
