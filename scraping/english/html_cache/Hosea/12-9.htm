The reference to "the land of Egypt" recalls the Exodus, a foundational event where God delivered the Israelites from slavery, establishing His power and faithfulness. This historical context underscores God's unchanging nature and His role as a deliverer. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the covenant established at Sinai, where God gave the Law and solidified His relationship with Israel. This connection to the Exodus is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, highlighting God's consistent presence and authority over His people.<p><b>I will again make you dwell in tents,</b><br>This phrase alludes to the Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot), a time when Israelites lived in temporary shelters to commemorate their ancestors' journey through the wilderness. The mention of dwelling in tents symbolizes a return to a state of dependence on God, reminiscent of the wilderness period when Israel relied on God's provision. It serves as a warning of impending judgment, suggesting a return to a nomadic lifestyle due to exile or hardship. This imagery also points to the transient nature of life and the need for spiritual renewal and reliance on God.<p><b>as in the days of the appointed feast.</b><br>The "appointed feast" refers to the Feast of Tabernacles, a significant Jewish festival celebrating God's provision and protection during the Israelites' 40 years in the wilderness. This feast is a time of joy and thanksgiving, but in this context, it serves as a reminder of past hardships and God's faithfulness. The historical and cultural context of this feast highlights the cyclical nature of Israel's relationship with God, marked by periods of faithfulness and rebellion. The prophetic aspect of this phrase suggests a future time of restoration and renewal, where God's people will once again experience His provision and presence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places

To the true theocratic spirit the condition here spoken of is one of real blessedness, but to the worldly, grasping Canaan or Ephraim it would come as a threat of expulsion, desolation, and despair.

It is better, therefore, to translate thus: And I <span class="accented">am the Lord thy God, from the land of Egypt: I will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast. Some understand this verse as a threatening; not a few as a promise; while others combine both. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Theodoret, who may be taken as representing the first class of interpreters, comments thus: "That thou mayest understand this and learn wisdom by thy calamity, I will bring thee back again to that point that thou must again dwell in tents and wander as an exile in a foreign land." <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Kimchi may represent those who understand it as a promise, or rather a promise with an implied threatening, and thus combine both. His exposition is as follows: "Even so am I ready to bring you forth out of the captivity where ye shall Be, as I did when I brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, and sustained you in the wilderness and made you dwell in tents; so am I ready yet again, when I shall have brought you forth out of the lands of the Gentiles, to cause you to dwell in tents in the wilderness by the way, and to show you wonders until ye shall return to your land in peace." <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Wunsche rejects both the preceding, and refers the statement to the other, present time, taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span>, not in the sense of "yet again," but in the equally allowable meaning of "further," or "still further;" thus his rendering of the verse is, "And yet I am thy God from Egypt, still I let thee dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast." Thus we have a remembrance of God's goodness to Israel all along from the Exodus to the time then present, including the celebration of their feasts, especially that of Taber-uncles, the most joyful of them all. This is favored by the interpretation of Aben Ezra, which is the following: "The sense is, 'Shouldst thou not remember that I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt in great riches for which thou didst not labor, and nourished thee in the wilderness when thou wast in tents?' In like manner he shall be able to do unto thee as in the days of the solemn feast of thy coming out of Egypt."
