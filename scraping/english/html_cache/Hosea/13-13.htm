In the Bible, labor pains often symbolize sudden and inevitable suffering or judgment (<a href="/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>, <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>). The imagery of labor pains suggests an unavoidable process that must be endured, reflecting the consequences of Israel's idolatry and rebellion against God.<p><b>but he is an unwise son</b><br>The "unwise son" refers to Israel's foolishness in not recognizing the need for repentance and return to God. Wisdom in the biblical context is often associated with the fear of the Lord and obedience to His commandments (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). Israel's lack of wisdom is evident in their continued pursuit of idols and alliances with foreign nations, ignoring the covenant relationship with God. This phrase highlights the spiritual immaturity and stubbornness of the nation.<p><b>When the time arrives</b><br>This indicates a critical moment or opportunity for change and redemption. In the context of childbirth, it is the moment when the child should be born. Spiritually, it represents the time when Israel should have turned back to God. The prophetic literature often speaks of appointed times for judgment and salvation (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, <a href="/daniel/12.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>).<p><b>he fails to present himself at the opening of the womb</b><br>This phrase illustrates Israel's failure to seize the opportunity for renewal and deliverance. The "opening of the womb" symbolizes a new beginning or birth, which Israel neglects. In biblical terms, birth can represent spiritual rebirth or the emergence of a new era (<a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-7</a>). Israel's failure to "present himself" signifies their reluctance to embrace God's offer of restoration and life. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of new birth and redemption for humanity (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, whose ministry was to call Israel back to faithfulness to God amidst their idolatry and moral decline.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to metaphorically as an unwise son in this passage, representing the nation&#8217;s failure to repent and return to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/childbirth.htm">Childbirth</a></b><br>Used metaphorically to describe the impending judgment and the opportunity for Israel to repent, which they fail to seize.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine voice speaking through Hosea, expressing both judgment and the desire for Israel&#8217;s repentance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The impending consequence of Israel's persistent idolatry and rebellion against God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_repentance.htm">The Urgency of Repentance</a></b><br>Just as childbirth is an urgent and unavoidable event, so is the call to repentance.

Lack of seasonable repentance increases the danger at this critical stage of Israel's destiny. The latter part of the verse is missed in the rendering of the English version. Read, <span class= "ital">For at the right time he standeth not in the place where children break forth.</span> But the use of the Hebrew word for "at the right time" ('<span class= "ital">?th</span>) is doubtful.

(Comp. <a href="/ezekiel/27-34.htm" title="In the time when you shall be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters your merchandise and all your company in the middle of you shall fall.">Ezekiel 27:34</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him.</span> The threatened punishment that is to overtake them is compared to the throes of a parturient woman, on account of their severity, as <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a>. Their sinfulness, which stands in the way of their success, shall be succeeded by severe sufferings and many sorrows. But eventually these worldly sorrows shall, under Divine grace, issue in the godly sorrows of repentance: then, and not till then, shall a new and happier period of existence be ushered in. The sorrow of travail shall give place to the joy of birth Delay of confession and repentance defers that joy, prolongs the sufferings, and puts the life of both parent and child in peril, so far as their personality is identical. <span class="cmt_word">He is an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children.</span> Here the unwisdom of Israel is accounted for: it is folly, sheer folly that postpones repentance, and delays efforts and aspirations after new spiritual life, The literal rendering of the last clause is - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">For it is time, he should not tarry at the place of the breaking forth of children</span>; or rather, <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">When it is time, he does not place himself</span> at (literally, <span class="accented">stand</span>) or come <span class="accented">forward to the opening of the womb</span>; and some translate <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;&#x5b4;</span> <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> "at the time," but that would rather require <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>; it might, indeed, be duration of time, and Aben Ezra so renders it: "Therefore at the time he will not stand in the breaking forth of children." Also Wunsche: "He is an unwise son, for at the time he stands not in the breaking forth of children." It might be expressed, as in the Authorized Version, with a slight modification; thus: For otherwise <span class="accented">he would not stand long time in the place of the breaking forth of children</span>. The figure is now shifted from the mother to the child; such abrupt and sudden transitions are not infrequent in Scripture, especially in the Pauline Epistles (setup. e.g. <a href="/2_corinthians/3-13.htm">2 Corinthians 3:13-16</a>). The danger is represented as extreme, as may be inferred from the similar expression, "The children are come to the birth, and there is no strength to bring forth." A perilous period in Israel's history is indicated, and to escape the danger he must make no tarrying, but advance at once into the new life of faith and repentance. Kimchi has the following comment: "Because he has compared his pains to the pain of a woman in travail, he says, 'The children are not wise,' as if he said, 'The coming generations, who have seen their fathers in affliction because of their iniquities, are not wise, and do not consider that distress has overtaken their fathers because of their iniquity; and turn not from the evil deeds of their fathers, but have done wickedness like them.'" He adds: "There are children lively by nature in their coming forth out of the womb; so also would these, if they were wise, not stay a single hour in distress, but immediately On returning to the Lord be delivered out of their distress."
