The "exultation" refers to the joy and celebration associated with religious festivals and worship practices. In the context of Hosea, God is addressing the Northern Kingdom of Israel, which had turned to idolatry and false worship. The cessation of exultation signifies the removal of joy and blessing due to their unfaithfulness. This judgment is consistent with the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to the loss of God's favor and the joy of His presence.<p><b>her feasts,</b><br>The feasts mentioned here are likely the major religious festivals that were central to Israel's worship, such as Passover, Pentecost, and the Feast of Tabernacles. These feasts were times of communal gathering, worship, and remembrance of God's past deliverance and provision. However, in Hosea's time, these feasts had become corrupted by syncretism and idolatry. The end of these feasts symbolizes the withdrawal of God's presence and blessing, as the people had turned these sacred times into occasions for idol worship.<p><b>New Moons,</b><br>The New Moon festivals were monthly observances marking the beginning of each month in the Hebrew calendar. They were times for offering sacrifices and seeking God's favor. The cessation of New Moon celebrations indicates a disruption in the regular cycle of worship and a break in the relationship between God and His people. This aligns with <a href="/isaiah/1-13.htm">Isaiah 1:13-14</a>, where God expresses disdain for the people's empty rituals, emphasizing that without true repentance, these observances are meaningless.<p><b>and Sabbaths&#8212;</b><br>The Sabbath was a weekly day of rest and worship, instituted by God as a sign of the covenant with Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-13.htm">Exodus 31:13</a>). It was a time for the community to cease from labor and focus on spiritual renewal. The end of Sabbaths signifies a profound spiritual crisis, as the Sabbath was integral to Israel's identity and relationship with God. This judgment reflects the seriousness of their covenant breach, as seen in <a href="/ezekiel/20-12.htm">Ezekiel 20:12-13</a>, where the profaning of the Sabbath is linked to rebellion against God.<p><b>all her appointed feasts.</b><br>The appointed feasts encompass all the sacred times set by God for Israel to gather, worship, and remember His deeds. These include not only the major festivals but also other sacred assemblies. The termination of these feasts underscores the totality of God's judgment and the breakdown of the covenant relationship. It serves as a warning of the consequences of idolatry and unfaithfulness, pointing to the need for genuine repentance and a return to true worship. This theme is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus fulfills the law and the prophets, offering a new covenant through His sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver a message of judgment and redemption to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted as an unfaithful wife in the book of Hosea, symbolizing the nation's spiritual adultery and idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/feasts,_new_moons,_sabbaths.htm">Feasts, New Moons, Sabbaths</a></b><br>These are religious observances commanded by God in the Torah, which had become empty rituals due to Israel's unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_empty_rituals.htm">The Danger of Empty Rituals</a></b><br>Religious observances without a heart for God are meaningless.

(Comp. <a href="/nehemiah/2-2.htm" title="Why the king said to me, Why is your countenance sad, seeing you are not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,">Nehemiah 2:2</a>.)<p>The "feast days" are to be distinguished from the "solemn feasts." The latter term is more generic in Hebrew, while the former denoted the three great festivals of the year (especially the Feast of Tabernacles). These feasts, which Jeroboam I. had instituted, are not spoken of in themselves as sinful.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.</span> The enumeration is complete, "Her feast days" were the three annual festivals of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles. "Her new moons" were the monthly celebrations at the commencement of each month. "Her sabbaths" were the weekly solemnities of one day in seven, dedicated to the Lord. Then there is a general summing up of the whole by the addition of "all her solemn feasts," - all her festal days and seasons, including, besides those named, the beginning of the years, the solemn assembly or holy convocation on the seventh day of the Passover and on the eighth day of Tabernacles. Preceding the enumeration is the general <span class="accented">characteristic</span> of all Israel's festivities. They were times of joy, as we read in <a href="/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>, "In the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets;" and in Dent. 12:12 it is expressly declared, "Ye shall rejoice before the Lord... ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates." All this was to cease; the coming captivity would render all such celebrations impossible. Kimchi remarks on this (ver. 11): "For in the distress there is no new moon and no sabbath; and the beginnings of months and sabbaths on which offerings were presented were days of joy. And so with respect to the feast days and solemn assemblies, which were days of rest and quiet joy, they shall not have in them any joy in consequence of the greatness of their distresses." He subsequently adds, "There is a <span class="accented">chag</span> which is not a <span class="accented">raced</span>, but joy wherewith men rejoice and eat and drink; and it is called <span class="accented">chag</span>," referring to Solomon's feast of dedication; "and there is also a <span class="accented">moed</span> which is not a <span class="accented">chag</span>, as for signs and for seasons (<span class="accented">moedim</span>), and at the appointed time I will return unto thee" (<span class="accented">raced</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e2;&#x5e8;</span>, to appoint as time and place). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/2-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will put an end</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hi&#353;&#183;bat&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
