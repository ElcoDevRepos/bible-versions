The imagery of harlotry is used to illustrate Israel's idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness. In the ancient Near Eastern context, idolatry was often associated with fertility cults and ritual prostitution, making the metaphor particularly poignant. The "mother" symbolizes the nation of Israel as a collective entity, with the people being her children. This metaphor is consistent with other prophetic writings, such as <a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-10</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>, where Israel's idolatry is likened to marital infidelity.<p><b>and has conceived them in disgrace</b><br>The children conceived in disgrace represent the consequences of Israel's unfaithfulness. The term "disgrace" highlights the shame and dishonor brought upon the nation due to its idolatrous practices. This disgrace is not only a social stigma but also a spiritual condition, reflecting the broken relationship with God. The imagery of conception and birth underscores the idea that the actions of the nation have tangible, lasting consequences. This concept is echoed in <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>, where the nation is described as a "sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity."<p><b>For she thought, &#8216;I will go after my lovers</b><br>The "lovers" symbolize the foreign nations and deities that Israel pursued instead of remaining faithful to Yahweh. This pursuit reflects a misguided belief that these alliances and idols could provide security and prosperity. In the historical context, Israel often sought political alliances with surrounding nations like Assyria and Egypt, which were seen as "lovers" in a metaphorical sense. This pursuit is condemned in other prophetic texts, such as <a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a>, where reliance on foreign powers is portrayed as a rejection of God's protection.<p><b>who give me bread and water, wool and linen, oil and drink.&#8217;</b><br>These items represent the basic necessities and luxuries of life, which Israel believed were provided by their "lovers" rather than by God. This reflects a misunderstanding of the true source of their blessings, as God is the ultimate provider of all needs (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-18.htm">Deuteronomy 8:18</a>). The mention of "bread and water" signifies sustenance, while "wool and linen" represent clothing and "oil and drink" denote luxury and abundance. This misattribution of provision is a central theme in Hosea, as God later declares that He will take back these provisions to demonstrate His sovereignty and the futility of idolatry (<a href="/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8-9</a>). The passage serves as a reminder of the first commandment, to have no other gods before Yahweh (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>), and foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of provision and faithfulness in Jesus Christ, who is the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver a message of judgment and redemption.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gomer.htm">Gomer</a></b><br>Hosea's wife, whose unfaithfulness symbolizes Israel's spiritual adultery.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted as an unfaithful wife in the prophetic literature.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lovers.htm">Lovers</a></b><br>Represents the false gods and foreign nations Israel pursued instead of remaining faithful to Yahweh.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/provision.htm">Provision (bread, water, wool, linen, oil, drink)</a></b><br>Symbolizes the material and spiritual blessings that Israel wrongly attributed to their idols and alliances.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_adultery.htm">Spiritual Adultery</a></b><br>Just as Gomer's unfaithfulness symbolizes Israel's idolatry, we must guard against placing anything above our relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/misplaced_trust.htm">Misplaced Trust</a></b><br>Israel's reliance on foreign nations and idols for provision is a reminder to trust God as our ultimate provider.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_unfaithfulness.htm">Consequences of Unfaithfulness</a></b><br>The disgrace mentioned in the verse highlights the shame and consequences of turning away from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_restoration.htm">Repentance and Restoration</a></b><br>Despite Israel's unfaithfulness, God's call through Hosea is ultimately one of repentance and hope for restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/materialism_and_idolatry.htm">Materialism and Idolatry</a></b><br>The pursuit of material goods and security can become idolatrous if it replaces our dependence on God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hosea_2_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hosea 2:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Hosea_2_5_Israel_s_unfaithfulness.htm">How does Hosea 2:5 illustrate Israel's unfaithfulness and pursuit of false gods?

Every phrase traces the descent from corporate identity (&#8220;their mother&#8221;) into deliberate infidelity (&#8220;played the harlot&#8221;), generational impact (&#8220;conceived them in disgrace&#8221;), self-deception (&#8220;she thought&#8221;), and idolatrous pursuit of provision (&#8220;bread&#8230; wool&#8230; oil&#8221;). The verse warns that attributing God&#8217;s gifts to false sources brings shame and judgment, while also setting the stage for the Lord&#8217;s relentless, redeeming love that follows in the chapter.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">For their mother hath played</span> . . .--We might render, with Ewald, <span class= "ital">yea, their mother hath played</span> . . . This would more easily account for the change of person ("your ". . . "their "), which is, however, very frequent in Hebrew prophecy.

She attributes to these idol-gods all those temporal benefits which theocratic history shows to have been Jehovah's gift, and the consequence of loyalty to Him. The modern analogue of this sin of Israel is the use of "Fortune," "Nature," "Destiny," "Impersonal Law," and even "Humanity," as the giver of all good things, as though it were superstitious or heretical to speak of God as the giver.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nor their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath dons shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers.</span> The charge of idolatry under the figure of harlotry, spiritual harlotry, is reiterated. "Mother" is repeated in and emphasized by the parallel words, "she that conceived them." A somewhat similar form of expression is that in <a href="/psalms/58-3.htm">Psalm 58:3</a>, "The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies." To <span class="accented">bosh</span>, to be ashamed, belong the Hiphil forms, <span class="accented">hebhish</span> and <span class="accented">hobhish</span> (the latter formed from <span class="accented">zabhish</span>), properly "to put to shame," but also "to practice shame or do shameful things." The nature of her shameful conduct is more definitely and distinctly expressed in the clauses which follow; and consisted of several particulars. There is the persistent pursuit of her lovers; then the unblushing boldness with which she avows her determination to continue that course; and next come her expectations from them. <span class="cmt_word">That give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink</span> (margin, <span class="accented">drinks</span>). The original word here rendered "lovers" is the Piel participle, which may have either its usual intensive sense or its occasional causative sense in which it is taken by Rosenm&uuml;ller, who has "a-mare me facientes," equivalent to "wooers." It matters little which way we understand it. The more important point is to determine who or what are here meant by lovers. Most commentators understand them to be those nations whose friendship Israel set such store by - the Assyrians and the Egyptians. Thus Grotius and Jerome, - the latter explains them of the Assyrians and Egyptians and other nations, with whose idols Israel committed fornication, and from which in distress they vainly hoped for help; so also Kimchi, in the following comment: "By 'friends ' he implies the Assyrians and Egyptians joined in alliance to the Israelites, who delivered them from their enemies, so that they lived safely, in return for the gifts (tribute) which they (the Israelites) were in the habit of giving them. And as they lived in tranquility in virtue of the compact entered into with them, the prophet represents it as if they supplied them with all the necessaries of life. For with their help they tilled their land without fear and in safety traded from country to country." Kimchi quotes at the same time his father's (Joseph Kimchi) interpretation: "But my lord my father of blessed memory explained 'after her lovers' of the sun and moon and stars, which they worshipped; while their intention was that they gave them their food and their sufficiency, as they said, 'But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.'" This exposition of Joseph Kimchi is much nearer the truth than that of his son David; it is, however, too restricted. The "lovers" were the idols on which the people of the northern kingdom so dented, and on which they placed so much dependence. The blessings which they vainly expected from these idols are enumerated: they were - food and raiment and luxuries; the bread and water were the articles of food as it is written elsewhere. "Bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure;" the wool and flax were the materials for clothing; while the oil and drinks were, the former for ornament, the latter for refresh-merit, and so included all luxuries; thus in <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, "<span class="accented">Thou</span> anointest my head with oil;" and in <a href="/psalms/102-9.htm">Psalm 102:9</a>, "And mingled my drink [literally, 'drinks,' the same word, <span class="accented">shigguyar</span>] with weeping;" also in <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a> we read of "wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengthened man's heart." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/2-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their mother</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;im&#183;m&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
