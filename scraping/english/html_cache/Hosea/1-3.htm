This marriage symbolizes God's relationship with Israel, where Hosea represents God and Gomer represents Israel. The name "Gomer" may suggest "completion" or "consummation," indicating the fullness of Israel's unfaithfulness. This act of marrying a woman of questionable reputation serves as a living parable of God's enduring love and commitment to His people despite their infidelity.<p><b>daughter of Diblaim</b><br>The mention of Gomer's father, Diblaim, is unique and not much is known about him. The name "Diblaim" could be related to the Hebrew word for "fig cakes," which might imply sweetness or indulgence, possibly hinting at the indulgent lifestyle that led to Gomer's reputation. This detail emphasizes the personal and familial nature of the narrative, grounding the prophetic message in real human relationships.<p><b>and she conceived and bore him a son</b><br>The birth of a son to Hosea and Gomer is significant as it marks the beginning of a series of symbolic acts through their children. Each child's name is a prophetic message to Israel. The conception and birth underscore the reality of the marriage and the tangible consequences of Israel's spiritual adultery. This son, named Jezreel, symbolizes the impending judgment on the house of Jehu and the nation of Israel, drawing a parallel to the historical events at the Valley of Jezreel, a site of bloodshed and divine retribution.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His message to the Northern Kingdom of Israel.

Kimchi conjectures that "Gomer was the name of a harlot well known at that time;" he also explains the name, according to his view of its symbolic import, as follows: "Gomer has the meaning of completion;" as if the prophet said, He will fully execute on them the punishment of their transgressions that he may forgive their iniquity." The names of the children born to the prophet are significant and symbolical; and their symbolic significance is explained. The names mentioned in this verse are also significant, though their significance is not expressly stated, as in the former case; the cause of the omission being the fact that these names were not, like the others, now received for the first time, but simply retained. Gomer denotes "completion" or" consummation," from a verbal root signifying "to perfect" or "come to an end; and Diblaim is the dual of <span class="accented">deblelah</span>, the plural being <span class="accented">debhelim</span>, from the verb <span class="accented">dabhal, to</span> press together into a mass, especially a round mass. The meaning of the word, then, is "<span class="accented">two</span> cakes," that is, of dried figs pressed together in lumps. It may be observed, in passing, that the Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> seems to come from the Aramaic form <span class="accented">debhalta</span>, by the omission of the initial <span class="accented">daleth</span>. But what is the mystic meaning which the prophet veils under the two names Consummation and Compressed fig-cakes (cakes of <span class="accented">compressed</span> figs)? The one may hint not obscurely consummation in sin and in the suffering which is the ultimate consequence of sin; while the other may imply the sweetness of sensual indulgences, especially such as idolatrous celebrants were prone to. If, then, the symbolical interpretation of these names be allowable, we may accept that given by Jerome. He says, "<span class="accented">Out</span> of Israel is taken typically by Hosea a wife <span class="accented">consummated in</span> fornication, and a perfect <span class="accented">daughter of pleasure</span> which seems sweet and pleasant to those who enjoy it." There is, moreover, an obvious appropriateness in the names thus symbolically understood. The prophet, whose name signifies "salvation," marries a woman who was a daughter of plea. sure and a votary of sin; this alliance represents the relation into which Jehovah, with his saving power, had mercifully taken Israel; but that people, unmindful and unthankful for such mercy, and intent on the indulgence of a sinful course, went from bad to worse in apostasy and idolatry till God at length left them in their impenitence and abandoned them to their fate. The conception and birth of Gomer's son to the prophet, though several authorities omit "him," give no countenance to the idea of the child being supposititious; and so far there seems to be some confirmation of the opinion of Keil referred to under ver. 2. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/1-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So [Hosea] went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1433;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
