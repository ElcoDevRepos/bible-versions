The "calf" symbolizes the false gods that the Israelites turned to instead of worshiping Yahweh. Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom, represents the entire nation. The rejection signifies God's disapproval and judgment against their idolatry. This echoes the sin of the golden calf at Mount Sinai (Exodus 32), highlighting a recurring pattern of rebellion against God.<p><b>My anger burns against them.</b><br>This phrase indicates God's righteous indignation towards Israel's persistent idolatry and disobedience. The imagery of burning anger is used throughout the Old Testament to describe God's response to sin (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-22.htm">Deuteronomy 32:22</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/4-4.htm">Jeremiah 4:4</a>). It underscores the seriousness of their transgressions and the impending judgment. God's anger is not capricious but a response to covenant unfaithfulness, as Israel was bound by the covenant at Sinai to worship Yahweh alone (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>).<p><b>How long will they be incapable of innocence?</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights Israel's stubbornness and inability to return to a state of purity and faithfulness. The term "innocence" suggests a return to covenantal faithfulness and moral integrity. The question implies a deep frustration with Israel's persistent sinfulness and unwillingness to repent. It reflects the prophetic call for repentance and the hope for restoration, as seen in other prophets like Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/3-12.htm">Jeremiah 3:12-14</a>). The phrase also points to the need for a transformation that ultimately finds fulfillment in the New Covenant through Jesus Christ, who offers true cleansing and restoration (<a href="/hebrews/9-14.htm">Hebrews 9:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, often used to represent the entire kingdom.

The Lord does not negotiate on the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming Samaria (the capital), God addresses the whole northern kingdom.

The passage exposes the emptiness of man-made gods, affirms God&#8217;s righteous anger toward covenant unfaithfulness, and underscores humanity&#8217;s deep need for a purity only He can supply.
