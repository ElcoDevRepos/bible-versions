In biblical literature, "wind" often signifies something transient and insubstantial. The imagery suggests that Ephraim is engaging in activities that are ultimately unproductive and meaningless. This can be connected to <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:14</a>, where the pursuit of the wind is equated with vanity.<p><b>and pursues the east wind all day long;</b><br>The "east wind" in the Bible is often associated with destruction and desolation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/41-6.htm">Genesis 41:6</a> and <a href="/exodus/10-13.htm">Exodus 10:13</a>. By pursuing the east wind, Ephraim is depicted as chasing after destructive and harmful endeavors. This reflects their misguided alliances and reliance on foreign powers rather than trusting in God.<p><b>he multiplies lies and violence;</b><br>Ephraim's actions are characterized by deceit and aggression. This reflects the moral and spiritual decay within the nation, as they have turned away from God's commandments. The multiplication of lies and violence indicates a society deeply entrenched in sin, reminiscent of the conditions described in <a href="/micah/6-12.htm">Micah 6:12</a>.<p><b>he makes a covenant with Assyria</b><br>This refers to the political alliances that Israel sought with Assyria, a dominant power at the time. Such covenants were often made for protection or political gain but were contrary to God's desire for Israel to rely solely on Him. This is a direct violation of the covenantal relationship Israel was supposed to maintain with God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>.<p><b>and sends olive oil to Egypt.</b><br>Sending olive oil to Egypt signifies attempts to secure alliances and favor with another powerful nation. Olive oil, a valuable commodity in the ancient Near East, symbolizes the resources and wealth that Israel was willing to expend to secure these alliances.

Israel sought alliances with Assyria for protection, which demonstrated a lack of trust in God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>Another powerful nation, often seen as a place of refuge or alliance for Israel.

The verse warns that every alternative to wholehearted trust in the LORD is empty, destructive, and morally corrosive, while reminding believers today that true sustenance, protection, and peace are found solely in covenant faithfulness to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XII.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">East wind.</span>--Comp. <a href="/isaiah/27-8.htm" title="In measure, when it shoots forth, you will debate with it: he stays his rough wind in the day of the east wind.">Isaiah 27:8</a> and <a href="/job/27-21.htm" title="The east wind carries him away, and he departs: and as a storm hurles him out of his place.">Job 27:21</a>. On the latter passage Wetzstein remarks:--"This wind is more frequent in winter and early spring, when, if it continues long, the tender vegetation is parched up, and a year of famine follows. Both man and beast feel sickly while it prevails." Hence, that which is unpleasant and revolting in life is compared by Orientals to the east wind. The idea expressed by the east wind here is the same as in <a href="/job/15-2.htm" title="Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?">Job 15:2</a>, combining the notions of destructiveness and emptiness. The covenant with Assyria refers to the events of the reign of Hoshea. Covenants with Assyria, and presents to Egypt were to Hosea curses in disguise. (See Note on <a href="/hosea/7-11.htm" title="Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.">Hosea 7:11</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind.</span> "Wind" is employed figuratively to denote what is empty and vain, of no real worth or practical benefit. <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> To feed on wind is to take pleasure in or draw sustenance from what can really afford neither; while following after the east wind is <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> to pursue vain hopes and ideals which are unattainable. According to this view, the prominent idea of the east wind is its fleetness, which passed into a proverb; thus Horace says, "Agents nimbos Oeior Euro." To outrun the swift and stormy east wind would represent an undertaking at once impracticable and hopeless. But <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is rather the blasting influence of the east wind that is referred to, so that it is a figurative representation, not so much of what is vain and hopeless, as of what is pernicious and destructive. Thus their course was not only idle, but injurious; not only delusive, but destructive; not only fruitless, but fatal. Their career, which is thus represented, included their idolatry and foreign alliances Kimchi explains this clause as follows: "In his service of the calves he is like him who opens his mouth to the wind and feeds on it, though he cannot support life thereby." And followeth after the east wind; ' he repeats the sense in different words, and mentions the east wind because it is the strongest and most injurious of winds to the sons of men.
