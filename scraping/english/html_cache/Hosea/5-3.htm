Ephraim was the largest and most influential tribe, often used to denote the entire northern kingdom. God's omniscience is emphasized here, as He is fully aware of their actions and intentions. This echoes <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>, where God's knowledge of human thoughts and actions is described in detail.<p><b>and Israel is not hidden from Me.</b><br>The phrase underscores God's ability to see beyond outward appearances and into the true state of Israel's heart. Despite any attempts to conceal their sins, nothing is hidden from God. This is consistent with <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>, which states that everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of God.<p><b>For now, O Ephraim, you have turned to prostitution;</b><br>Ephraim's turning to prostitution is a metaphor for idolatry and unfaithfulness to God. The imagery of prostitution is frequently used in the prophetic books to describe Israel's spiritual adultery, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-9</a>. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, akin to a marriage, where idolatry is equated with infidelity.<p><b>Israel is defiled.</b><br>The defilement of Israel signifies moral and spiritual corruption. This defilement results from their idolatrous practices and abandonment of God's laws. <a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-30</a> warns against defilement through idolatry and immorality, highlighting the consequences of such actions. The defilement also foreshadows the eventual judgment and exile that Israel would face due to their persistent unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>A prominent tribe in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, often used to represent the entire Northern Kingdom.
