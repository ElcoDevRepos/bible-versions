The imagery of teaching a child to walk suggests a tender, patient, and guiding relationship. Historically, this reflects God's guidance and provision for Israel from their early days as a nation, particularly during the Exodus and their journey through the wilderness. Theologically, it underscores God's sovereignty and intimate involvement in the lives of His people, akin to a parent-child relationship.<p><b>taking them by the arms</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the personal and direct involvement of God in Israel's growth and development. The act of taking by the arms suggests support and protection, indicating that God was actively sustaining Israel. Culturally, this reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of deities as protectors of their people, but with a unique personal touch in the biblical narrative. This can be connected to other scriptures where God is depicted as a shepherd or a father, such as <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> and <a href="/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>, illustrating His care and guidance.<p><b>but they never realized that it was I who healed them</b><br>Here, the focus shifts to Israel's lack of recognition and gratitude for God's care and healing. The healing can be understood both physically, in terms of deliverance from enemies and diseases, and spiritually, in terms of forgiveness and restoration. This reflects a recurring theme in the prophetic books where Israel fails to acknowledge God's hand in their well-being, leading to idolatry and rebellion. Theologically, this points to the human tendency to forget God's blessings and take His grace for granted. It also foreshadows the ultimate healing brought by Jesus Christ, who is often unrecognized and unappreciated, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10-11</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Represents the northern kingdom of Israel, often used as a symbol for the entire nation due to its prominence among the tribes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His nurturing and caring relationship with Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His message, calling Israel to repentance and illustrating God's enduring love.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_parental_care.htm">God's Parental Care</a></b><br>Just as a parent teaches a child to walk, God guides and supports His people.

The unwillingness to recognise the Divine Hand in "creation," "literature," "history" takes the opposed forms of Pantheism and Pyrrhonism. To each of these the prophet's words apply.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I taught Ephraim also to fro, taking them by their alms; but they knew not that I healed them.</span> This picture of God's guiding and guarding care of Ephraim is very touching and tender. It is that of an affectionate parent or tender nurse teaching a child to walk by leading-strings; taking it up in the arms when stumbling or making a false step; and in case it fell curing the wound. Thus, nurse-like, God taught Ephraim, his wayward perverse child, to use his feet (so the original word imports), all the while lending considerate help and seasonable aid. He took them by the hand to guide them, that they might not stray; he took them in his arms to hold them up, that they might not stumble and to help them over any obstacle that might lie in the way; and when, left to themselves during a short season, and in order to test their strength, they did stumble and fall, he healed their hurt. And yet they did not apprehend nor appreciate God's gracious design and dealings with them in thus guiding and guarding them, and in healing their diseases both temporal and spiritual. There is, perhaps, an allusion to <a href="/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>, "<span class="accented">I</span> will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the Lord that healeth thee." This promise, it will be remembered, was vouchsafed immediately after the bitter waters of Marah had been sweetened by the tree which, according to Divine direction, had been cast therein. Thus Kimchi: "<span class="accented">And</span> they have not acknowledged that I healed them of every sickness and every affliction, as he said, 'I will put none of these diseases upon thee.'" The reference is rather to all those evidences of his love which God manifested to them during their forty years' wandering in the wilderness; or perhaps to his guidance of them by 'his Law throughout their entire history. Rashi remarks that "they knew it very well, but dissembled [literally, 'trod it down with the heel,' equivalent to 'despised'] and acted, as if they did not know." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d3;&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span> is properly taken both by Kimchi and Gesenius <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5d2;&#x5dc;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span>; the former says; "The <span class="accented">tar</span> stands in place of <span class="accented">he:</span> this is the opinion of the grammarians;" the latter regards it as a solitary example of Tiphel; others again consider it a corrupt reading instead of the ordinary form of Hiph. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Some take it for a noun, as J. Kimchi, who says it is "a noun after the form of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5e4;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span>, and although the word is Milel (while in <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e4;&#x5d0;&#x5e8;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span> it is Milra), yet it is the same form;" thus the translation is, "As for me, my guidance was to Ephraim;" so Jerome, "I have been as a nurse to Ephraim;" likewise also Cyril. The former explanation is simpler and also otherwise preferable. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The Septuagint has the incorrect rendering <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, "I bound the feet of Ephraim," which Jerome explains, "I bound the feet of Ephraim that they might not fly further from me," though his own rendering is that given above. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d4;&#x5dd;</span> has also occasioned some difficulty and consequent diversity of explanation.  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/11-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">It was I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1504;&#1465;&#1499;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7733;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
