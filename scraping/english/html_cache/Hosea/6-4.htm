This rhetorical question reflects God's frustration and sorrow over Israel's persistent unfaithfulness. Historically, Ephraim was a leading tribe, and its actions often set the tone for the rest of the northern kingdom. The question underscores God's desire for repentance and change, highlighting the tension between divine justice and mercy.<p><b>What shall I do with you, O Judah?</b><br>Judah, the southern kingdom, is addressed similarly, indicating that both kingdoms are guilty of infidelity. This reflects the divided monarchy period after Solomon's reign, where both Israel and Judah frequently turned away from God. The mention of Judah alongside Ephraim emphasizes that the problem of unfaithfulness is widespread, not limited to one region or group. It also foreshadows the eventual judgment that would come upon both kingdoms.<p><b>For your loyalty is like a morning mist,</b><br>The imagery of a morning mist suggests something transient and insubstantial. In the cultural and geographical context of ancient Israel, morning mist would quickly dissipate with the rising sun, symbolizing the fleeting nature of the people's faithfulness. This metaphor highlights the inconsistency and superficiality of their devotion to God, contrasting with the steadfast loyalty that God desires.<p><b>like the early dew that vanishes.</b><br>Similar to the morning mist, the early dew evaporates quickly, further illustrating the temporary and unreliable nature of Israel and Judah's loyalty. This imagery is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe fleeting things (e.g., <a href="/hosea/13-3.htm">Hosea 13:3</a>). The comparison to dew emphasizes the need for a deeper, more enduring commitment to God, pointing to the spiritual renewal that is only possible through a genuine relationship with Him. This can be seen as a call to repentance and a foreshadowing of the new covenant through Jesus Christ, who offers a permanent solution to the problem of sin and unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Represents the northern kingdom of Israel.

God, having tried various expedients and many ways to restore Israel to faithfulness, finds all those methods unavailing; and now he asks what further means of reclamation he can resort to; what further punishment he is to inflict. Thus in <a href="/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5</a>, "Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more!" or what additional privileges can be vouchsafed? Thus in <a href="/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>, "What could have been done more to my vineyard, than I have not done in it?" The reason is then assigned for such questioning; it was the brief duration of Israel's piety. It was evanescent as the early cloud which floats across a summer's sky and which the sun soon scatters for ever, or which pro-raises a refreshing shower, but which is exhaled by the sun's heat; it was transient as the dew which lies in pearly drops of beauty upon the grass, but which the foot of the passing traveler brushes away in a moment. The prophet had, in the opening verses, referred to real repentance; but now, turning to Israel, he reminds them of <span class="accented">their</span> repentance by way of con-trust, showing them that it was neither of the consistency nor permanent character required. Proofs of their deficiency lay on the pages of their national history. Hezekiah had done "that which was right in the sight of the Lord;" but his son and successor, Manasseh, "wrought much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him to auger." Josiah, again, was eminent for piety, so that "like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might;" but his successors degenerated, for it is added, "neither after him arose there any like him." The connection and meaning are well given by Kimchi: "How shall I heal you, and how shall I bind you up, as your repentance is by no means perfect? For if the kings of Israel did that which was right in the sight of the Lord, so have they soon turned to do evil, like Jehu. And likewise the kings of Judah, who in the days of Josiah did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, turned again to do evil in the days of his son and son's son." Thus he reproves them for the superficial and fleeting character of their goodness. The participles <span class="accented">mashkim</span> and <span class="accented">holek</span> are either co-ordinated asynde-tously, thus: "coming in the morning, going away;" or the latter is subordinated to the former: "<span class="accented">in</span> the morning passing away." Kimchi takes the former word as a noun after the form of <span class="accented">makbir</span>, equivalent to "abundance" (<a href="/job/36-31.htm">Job 36:31</a>); the right rendering is, "as the dew early going away." A somewhat different rendering is proposed by Wunsche, viz. "Your goodness goeth away like a morning cloud, and like the dew in the morning;" "goodness" being the subject, "goeth away" the predicate, "like morning cloud and dew" nearer definitions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/6-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">What</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">shall I do</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1469;&#1506;&#1457;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#8216;&#277;&#183;&#347;eh-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
