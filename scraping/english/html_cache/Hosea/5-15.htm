In biblical context, God's "place" often refers to His heavenly dwelling or the temple, symbolizing His presence. The withdrawal signifies a period of divine judgment and absence of favor, reminiscent of times when Israel experienced God's silence due to disobedience (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/4-21.htm">1 Samuel 4:21-22</a>).<p><b>until they admit their guilt</b><br>Admitting guilt is a call for repentance, a central theme in the prophetic books. The Hebrew concept of repentance involves a heartfelt acknowledgment of sin and a turning back to God. This phrase underscores the conditional nature of God's return, emphasizing that reconciliation requires genuine contrition and confession, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>.<p><b>and seek My face;</b><br>Seeking God's face implies a desire for a personal and intimate relationship with Him. In ancient Near Eastern culture, seeking the face of a king or deity was a metaphor for seeking favor and presence. This phrase highlights the importance of earnest prayer and devotion, aligning with scriptures such as <a href="/psalms/27-8.htm">Psalm 27:8</a>, which speaks of seeking God's presence as a priority.<p><b>in their affliction</b><br>Affliction often serves as a catalyst for repentance in the biblical narrative. Historically, Israel faced numerous afflictions, such as invasions and exiles, which were seen as consequences of their covenant unfaithfulness. This phrase suggests that suffering can lead to spiritual awakening and a return to God, as illustrated in <a href="/judges/10-10.htm">Judges 10:10-16</a>, where Israel's distress leads them to cry out to the Lord.<p><b>they will earnestly seek Me.</b><br>The earnest seeking of God implies a sincere and wholehearted pursuit, often born out of desperation and need. This reflects a transformation from superficial religiosity to genuine devotion. The prophetic literature frequently calls for such earnestness, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a>, where God promises to be found by those who seek Him with all their heart. This seeking is a precursor to restoration and renewal, pointing to the hope of redemption through repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His intention to withdraw His presence until Israel acknowledges their guilt and seeks Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation being addressed, which has turned away from God and is experiencing His judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers this message, calling Israel to repentance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The context of this passage, where God is pronouncing judgment on Israel for their unfaithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/repentance.htm">Repentance</a></b><br>The desired response from Israel, involving acknowledgment of guilt and a sincere seeking of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_patience_and_withdrawal.htm">God's Patience and Withdrawal</a></b><br>God&#8217;s decision to "return again to My place" signifies His patience and the seriousness of sin.

Earlier in Hosea (5:6), the people &#8220;have betrayed the LORD,&#8221; so He now promises to &#8220;return&#8221; to His heavenly throne, much like in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17</a> where He says, &#8220;I will hide My face from them.&#8221; <a href="/psalms/81-12.htm">Psalm 81:12</a> shows the same pattern: when people persist in sin, He &#8220;gives them over to their stubborn hearts.&#8221; This is not abandonment forever, but a purposeful retreat that lets the consequences of rebellion be felt, echoing <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>&#8212;the invitation remains open should they humble themselves.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Until they admit their guilt</b><p>The divine silence is temporary, lasting only &#8220;until&#8221; confession happens. <a href="/proverbs/28-13.htm">Proverbs 28:13</a> states, &#8220;He who conceals his sins will not prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them will find mercy.&#8221; David experienced this in <a href="/psalms/32-5.htm">Psalm 32:5</a>: &#8220;I said, &#8216;I will confess my transgressions to the LORD,&#8217; and You forgave.&#8221; Because Scripture consistently presents sin as a moral reality, not a mere mistake, admission of guilt is the first necessary step back to fellowship (<a href="/leviticus/26-40.htm">Leviticus 26:40&#8211;42</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And seek My face</b><p>Confession alone is incomplete; the heart must turn toward God Himself. <a href="/psalms/27-8.htm">Psalm 27:8</a> urges, &#8220;My heart said, &#8216;Seek His face.&#8217; Your face, LORD, I will seek.&#8221; <a href="/jeremiah/29-13.htm">Jeremiah 29:13</a> promises, &#8220;You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.&#8221; Hosea will soon echo this invitation: &#8220;Come, let us return to the LORD&#8230; He will revive us&#8221; (6:1&#8211;3). Genuine repentance moves beyond regret; it reaches for renewed intimacy&#8212;an earnest pursuit of the Lord&#8217;s favor, presence, and guidance (<a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In their affliction they will earnestly seek Me</b><p>Pain becomes the catalyst. <a href="/judges/10-9.htm">Judges 10:9&#8211;16</a> shows Israel crying out when &#8220;great distress&#8221; came. <a href="/psalms/119-67.htm">Psalm 119:67</a> admits, &#8220;Before I was afflicted I went astray, but now I keep Your word.&#8221; God disciplines &#8220;for our good, that we may share in His holiness&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10&#8211;11</a>). Affliction strips away illusions of self-sufficiency, steering hearts back to the only real refuge. Like the prodigal son who &#8220;came to his senses&#8221; in famine (<a href="/luke/15-14.htm">Luke 15:14&#8211;20</a>), Israel will discover that hardship, rightly received, is a severe mercy drawing them home (<a href="/revelation/3-19.htm">Revelation 3:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hosea/5-15.htm">Hosea 5:15</a> reveals a loving God who, taking sin seriously, steps back so His people can feel the weight of their choices. He waits&#8212;not forever, but &#8220;until&#8221; they confess, repent, and actively seek Him. Affliction, rather than proof of rejection, becomes the means He uses to awaken earnest pursuit of His face. The verse assures that when guilt is admitted and God is sought, He stands ready to restore.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) Tenderness blends with judgment, and insulted love bleeds and hopes.
