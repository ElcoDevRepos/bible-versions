The "king" here likely refers to one of the monarchs of Israel during Hosea's ministry, possibly Jeroboam II or one of his successors. The phrase suggests that the king finds pleasure or satisfaction in the wickedness of his people, indicating a corrupt leadership that encourages or at least tolerates evil practices. This reflects a broader theme in Hosea where leaders are held accountable for leading the people astray (<a href="/hosea/4-9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>). The delight in evil can be seen as a reversal of the king's role, which should be to uphold justice and righteousness (<a href="/proverbs/16-12.htm">Proverbs 16:12</a>).<p><b>and the princes with their lies</b><br>The "princes" refer to the ruling officials or nobles who assist the king in governance. Their delight in lies suggests a culture of deceit and manipulation within the leadership. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where falsehood and deception are condemned (<a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>). The lies could involve false prophecies, misleading policies, or betrayal of covenants, which were common issues in Israel's history (<a href="/jeremiah/23-14.htm">Jeremiah 23:14</a>). The acceptance and propagation of lies by the leaders contribute to the nation's downfall, as truth and integrity are foundational to a just society.
