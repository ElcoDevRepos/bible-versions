In the context of Hosea, Israel's actions, particularly idolatry and social injustice, have created a separation from God. The deeds refer to the persistent sinful behaviors that have become habitual, making repentance difficult. This echoes the biblical principle found in <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>, where iniquities create a separation between people and God. The historical context of Hosea involves a time of moral and spiritual decline in Israel, where the worship of Baal and other Canaanite deities was prevalent, leading to a departure from the covenant relationship with Yahweh.<p><b>for a spirit of prostitution is within them</b><br>The "spirit of prostitution" metaphorically describes Israel's unfaithfulness to God, akin to marital infidelity. This imagery is consistent throughout Hosea, where Israel is often depicted as an unfaithful spouse. The term "spirit" suggests a pervasive and controlling influence, indicating that idolatry and spiritual adultery have deeply infiltrated the nation's heart and mind. This reflects the cultural and religious syncretism of the time, where the Israelites adopted pagan practices, compromising their exclusive devotion to God. The concept of spiritual adultery is also seen in <a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>, where friendship with the world is equated with enmity against God.<p><b>and they do not know the LORD</b><br>This phrase underscores the lack of true knowledge and relationship with God. In the Hebrew context, "to know" implies an intimate, covenantal relationship, not merely intellectual awareness. Israel's failure to know the LORD indicates a breakdown in their covenant relationship, characterized by disobedience and ignorance of God's laws and character. This is a recurring theme in the prophetic literature, where knowing God is equated with living in accordance with His will (<a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23-24</a>). Theologically, this points to the necessity of a heart transformation, as seen in the New Covenant promise of <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>, where God writes His law on the hearts of His people, enabling them to truly know Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to as Ephraim in Hosea, which had turned away from God and engaged in idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God, who desires a covenant relationship with His people but is grieved by their unfaithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/spirit_of_prostitution.htm">Spirit of Prostitution</a></b><br>A metaphorical expression indicating Israel's unfaithfulness and idolatry, likened to spiritual adultery.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/deeds.htm">Deeds</a></b><br>The actions of the Israelites that reflect their rebellion and prevent them from returning to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Sin creates a barrier between us and God, preventing us from returning to Him.

The habits they cultivated now serve as shackles.<p>- Sin is not merely an event; it becomes a pattern (<a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>). As Israel&#8217;s idolatrous sacrifices multiplied, the pull of those rituals kept them from genuine repentance (<a href="/hosea/8-11.htm">Hosea 8:11-13</a>).<p>- Scripture often links persistent disobedience with an inability&#8212;even an unwillingness&#8212;to turn back (<a href="/jeremiah/13-23.htm">Jeremiah 13:23</a>; <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>).<p>- Practical takeaway: what we repeatedly do shapes our capacity to respond to God. Secret sins, tolerated attitudes, or &#8220;small&#8221; compromises eventually harden the heart (<a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for a spirit of prostitution is within them</b><p>- The phrase &#8220;spirit of prostitution&#8221; points to a deep-rooted, inward disposition toward unfaithfulness. It isn&#8217;t only outward behavior; it&#8217;s an internal bent that longs for substitutes for God (<a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>).<p>- This spirit drives people to seek satisfaction in idols&#8212;whether carved images in Hosea&#8217;s day or modern pursuits of power, pleasure, or prestige (<a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>).<p>- In <a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>, Israel consults wooden idols; the same inner force is at work here, urging them to forsake their covenant Lover.<p>- Until that spirit is confronted and replaced by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-17.htm">Galatians 5:17-24</a>), external reforms alone cannot last.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they do not know the LORD</b><p>- &#8220;Know&#8221; in Scripture speaks of intimate relationship, not mere information (<a href="/jeremiah/9-23.htm">Jeremiah 9:23-24</a>; <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>). Israel&#8217;s rituals continued, yet true knowledge of God was absent (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>).<p>- Lack of knowledge leads to destruction (<a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>). When people ignore who God is&#8212;His holiness, mercy, and covenant faithfulness&#8212;they inevitably fashion a god of their own making (<a href="/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4-5</a>).<p>- Personal reflection: regular exposure to Scripture (<a href="/psalms/119-11.htm">Psalm 119:11</a>), obedience (<a href="/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3-5</a>), and walking in the light (<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>) cultivate authentic knowledge of the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hosea/5-4.htm">Hosea 5:4</a> exposes a tragic cycle: habitual sin locks people in, a corrupt inner spirit drives continuous unfaithfulness, and genuine knowledge of God fades. The verse warns that outward religion cannot override entrenched rebellion. Yet underlying Hosea&#8217;s message is hope: God remains ready to break the cycle by giving a new heart to all who turn to Him (<a href="/hosea/14-4.htm">Hosea 14:4</a>; <a href="/titus/3-3.htm">Titus 3:3-6</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) The margin, "Their deeds will not suffer (them)," requires the introduction of the word "them," not in the Hebrew. It is favoured by the Jewish commentators, Schmoller, and others, but it is better to render, with the Authorised version, <span class= "ital">They frame not their doings,</span> &c. The knowledge of the only true God is life.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - In this verse their evil doings are traced to an evil spirit of whoredoms that is, of idolatries, which impels them blindly and resistlessly to evil, while at the same time it expels the knowledge of God. The first clause is differently rendered. The textual rendering of the Authorized Version, viz. they will not frame (literally, <span class="accented">give</span>, <span class="accented">direct</span>) their doings to turn unto their God, denotes their total and absolute refusal to repent or to bring forth fruits meet for repentance. The actions are an index of the state of the heart, but neither the thoughts of Israel at this time, nor their deeds which indicated these thoughts, were in the direction of repentance. In heart and life they were impenitent. This rendering is supported by most of the Hebrew commentators. Rashi says, "They forsake not their evil way;" Aben Ezra," They perform not works so as to turn." Kimchi also gives an alternative sense: "Or the sense of the words is thus: They cling so closely to their evil works, that even should they for once conceive in their heart the idea of turning, they immediately repent them of it." The marginal rendering also yields a good sense; it is, <span class="accented">Their doings</span> <span class="accented">will not suffer</span> (allow) [<span class="accented">them</span>] <span class="accented">to turn unto their God</span>. The pronominal suffix for "them" is wanting, yet it may be dispensed with, as the appending of it to "doings" and "God" makes the sense sufficiently explicit. It is favored by Ewald, Keil, the Targum, and Kimchi, who explains: "Their evil works do not allow them to return to their God, as if he said, To such extent have they multiplied transgression that there is no way left them to return, until they receive their punishment." Such and so great was the power of their evil habits that they could not break them off or break away from them by repentance; or so intimately connected is a change of heart with a change of life that, in the absence of the latter, the former is impossible. According to either rendering, the reason assigned is contained in the next clause: <span class="cmt_word">For the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have not known the Lord.</span> So overmastered were they, as though by some fiendish spirit that held them in check and exercised despotic power over them, that they rushed headlong down the steep incline, like the Gadarene herd of swine, which, when the unclean spirits entered into them, ran violently down a steep place into the sea. Neither was there any counteracting force to turn them back or reverse their course. Such a force might have been found in the knowledge of God, of his covenant mercy, of his power, love, grace, and goodrich. But this was wanting, and the absence of this knowledge at once increased their impenitence and aggravated their guilt. It was Israel's privilege and Israel's duty to know the Lord; for he had revealed himself to them as to no other nation; he had given them his Law, he had made them depositaries of his truth and the conservators of his living oracles; their ignorance, therefore, was altogether inexcusable, while it evinced greatest ingratitude to Jehovah, who had taken them into covenant with himself, and declared himself to be their God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/5-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Their deeds</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#183;&#8216;al&#183;l&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
