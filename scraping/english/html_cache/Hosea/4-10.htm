In the context of Hosea, it reflects the spiritual and physical consequences of Israel's unfaithfulness to God. The Israelites were engaging in idolatry and turning away from the covenant with God, which led to a lack of true fulfillment. This echoes the curse of disobedience found in <a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>, where God warns that despite having bread, they will not be satisfied. It also parallels the spiritual hunger described in <a href="/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11</a>, where there is a famine of hearing the words of the Lord. The idea is that without God, even the most basic needs cannot truly satisfy.<p><b>they will be promiscuous but not multiply.</b><br>This phrase addresses the moral and social decay resulting from Israel's idolatry and infidelity. The promiscuity mentioned here is both literal and metaphorical, referring to the worship of foreign gods and the associated immoral practices. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, fertility was often linked to religious rites, and the Israelites' participation in these practices was a direct violation of their covenant with God. The lack of multiplication is a direct consequence of their actions, as God had promised fruitfulness and multiplication to those who remained faithful (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>). This barrenness serves as a judgment and a sign of God's displeasure.<p><b>For they have abandoned the LORD</b><br>This phrase underscores the root cause of Israel's plight: their abandonment of the LORD. The covenant relationship between God and Israel was central to their identity and prosperity. By turning away from God, they forfeited His protection and blessings. This abandonment is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where the prophets call Israel to repentance and return to the LORD (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>, <a href="/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>). The spiritual adultery of Israel is likened to a wife leaving her husband, a powerful image used throughout Hosea to illustrate the broken relationship between God and His people.<p><b>to give themselves</b><br>This final phrase indicates a deliberate choice to pursue other gods and desires. It reflects a willful decision to engage in idolatry and immorality, prioritizing their own desires over their commitment to God. This self-giving to false gods is a betrayal of the exclusive relationship they were to have with the LORD. The language of giving themselves is reminiscent of <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24-25</a>, where people exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshiped created things rather than the Creator. It highlights the depth of Israel's spiritual infidelity and the resulting consequences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted as unfaithful to God, engaging in idolatry and immorality.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who desires faithfulness and obedience from His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prostitution.htm">Prostitution</a></b><br>Used metaphorically to describe Israel's spiritual unfaithfulness and idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment.htm">Judgment</a></b><br>The consequence of Israel's abandonment of God, leading to dissatisfaction and lack of increase.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_idolatry.htm">The Futility of Idolatry</a></b><br>Just as Israel sought satisfaction in false gods and practices, modern believers must guard against placing anything above God in their lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/true_satisfaction_in_god.htm">True Satisfaction in God</a></b><br>Only a relationship with God can truly satisfy the deepest needs of the human heart.

Hosea&#8217;s words echo that warning:<p>&#8226; Physical lack mirrors spiritual famine. As <a href="/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11</a> reminds, &#8220;I will send a famine&#8230; not of bread, but of hearing the words of the LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Satisfaction is a gift the Lord alone provides; without Him even abundance tastes thin. <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-10.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:10</a> notes, &#8220;He who loves money is never satisfied with money.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Withheld fullness is discipline meant to draw hearts back, just as in <a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a> where &#8220;you will eat but not be satisfied.&#8221;<p>The verse challenges us: if our souls feel lean despite full plates, have we drifted from the Giver?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they will be promiscuous but not multiply</b><p>Israel&#8217;s worship had blended with Canaanite fertility rites, yet the very thing they chased&#8212;growth&#8212;would dry up. The Lord told them long before, &#8220;The fruit of your womb will be cursed&#8221; when they rejected Him (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-18.htm">Deuteronomy 28:18</a>). Hosea shows the irony:<p>&#8226; Sexual excess cannot manufacture blessing; <a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a> says, &#8220;Children are a heritage from the LORD.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Immorality drains life rather than producing it. <a href="/proverbs/5-11.htm">Proverbs 5:11</a> warns that at the end &#8220;your flesh and body are consumed.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God sometimes withholds conception to expose idolatry. <a href="/malachi/2-15.htm">Malachi 2:15</a> asks, &#8220;Did He not make them one&#8230; seeking godly offspring?&#8221; When covenant faithfulness disappears, godly offspring dwindle too.<p>Sin promises increase but delivers barrenness&#8212;both in the womb and in the heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For they have abandoned the LORD to give themselves</b><p>Here lies the root: forsaking the Lord for lesser loves.

Turning from God triggers the chain reaction of unmet hunger and fruitless intimacy.<p>&#8226; Abandoning the Lord severs the source of every good gift (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Giving oneself to idols is spiritual adultery (<a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>), provoking covenant curses.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a> captures the tragedy: &#8220;They have forsaken Me, the fountain of living water, to dig cisterns&#8230; that cannot hold water.&#8221;<p>Until loyalties return to the Lord alone, satisfaction and fruitfulness remain out of reach.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hosea/4-10.htm">Hosea 4:10</a> lays out a simple, sobering pattern: forsake the Lord, and even the most basic joys&#8212;full stomachs, growing families&#8212;slip through your fingers. The verse reminds us that real satisfaction and lasting fruit come only from steadfast devotion to the Lord. Return to Him, and the famine ends; persist in other loves, and emptiness remains no matter how much we eat or indulge.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase.</span> This part of the verso states the punishment to be inflicted and the reward to be received; it is thus an expansion of the closing clause of the preceding verse, with an obvious allusion to the sin specified in the eighth verse. To eat and not be satisfied may occur in time of famine, or be the effect of disease or the consequence of insatiable craving. "Since," says Kimchi, "they eat in an unlawful manner, their food shall not be to them a blessing." This was one of the punishments threatened for violation of the Law, as we read in <a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>, "When I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied." Further, the multiplication of wives or concubines would not increase their posterity; Solomon long previously had been a notable exemplification of this. "So in their cohabitation with their women, since it is in a whorish manner, they shall not increase, for they shall not have children by them; or, if they have, they shall die from the birth." The Hiph. <span class="accented">hiznu</span> has rather the intensive sense of Qal than that of causing or encouraging whoredom. <span class="cmt_word">Because they have left off to take heed to the Lord.</span> The verbal <span class="accented">lishmor</span> either <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> has Jehovah for its object, as in the Authorized Version; or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">durko</span> or <span class="accented">darkair</span> may be supplied, as is done by Kimchi and Aben Ezra. The former has, "To observe his <span class="accented">ways</span>, for they have no delight in him and in his ways; to observe his ways they have left off;" the latter <span class="accented">has</span>, "They have forsaken Jehovah, to observe his way or his Laws." But <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Kimchi informs us that "Saadiah Gaon of blessed memory has connected the word with the verse that comes after it; they have forsaken the Lord to observe whoredom and wine and new wine." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/4-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They will eat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1469;&#1499;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;l&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
