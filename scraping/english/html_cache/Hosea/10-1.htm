This imagery reflects God's care and provision for Israel, intended to produce righteousness and justice. However, the phrase "yielding fruit for himself" indicates self-centeredness and a failure to honor God with their prosperity. The vine, instead of producing fruit for God's glory, serves its own interests, highlighting Israel's spiritual decline and idolatry.<p><b>The more his fruit increased, the more he increased the altars.</b><br>As Israel's prosperity grew, so did their idolatrous practices. The "altars" refer to places of worship for false gods, which proliferated as the nation became wealthier. This reflects a common biblical theme where material blessings lead to spiritual complacency and idolatry (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11-14</a>). The increase in altars signifies a departure from exclusive worship of Yahweh, violating the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p><b>The better his land produced, the better he made the sacred pillars.</b><br>"Sacred pillars" were often associated with Canaanite religious practices and idolatry (<a href="/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>). As the land produced abundantly, Israel invested in these pagan symbols, further entrenching themselves in idolatry. This reflects a cultural assimilation with surrounding nations, contrary to God's command to remain distinct (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>). The prosperity intended to lead to gratitude and worship of God instead resulted in increased devotion to false gods, illustrating the nation's spiritual adultery.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, often depicted as God's chosen people who have turned away from Him.

The verse warns that prosperity without remembrance of the Lord breeds spiritual corruption.

Wnsche has powerfully illustrated this wild strong growth of Israel as compared with Judah. Joash prevailed over Amaziah, and plundered Jerusalem (<a href="/context/2_kings/14-12.htm" title="And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled every man to their tents.">2Kings 14:12-14</a>). Jeroboam II. extended his power as far as Hamath (<a href="/context/2_kings/14-23.htm" title="In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years.">2Kings 14:23-25</a>).

The comparison of Israel to a vine is frequent; but the epithet <span class="accented">boqeq</span> is variously rendered; <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as "empty." Thus Aben Ezra explains it as "empty in which there is no strength to bring forth fruit, nor fruit;" and thus also Kimchi explains it: "An empty vine in which there is not any life-sap;" and in the same sense <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5d9;</span>, "empty and sick," <a href="/nahum/2-11.htm">Nahum 2:11</a>. This, too, is the meaning of the Authorized Version, but is irreconcilable with the statement in the following clause, "he bringeth forth fruit." The Chaldee had preceded in giving the word the sense of "plundered," "empty," "waste." But <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> some take <span class="accented">boqeq</span> transitively, and attach to it the signification of "emptying out its fruit." In this way Rashi explains it: "The Israelites resemble a vine which casts all its good fruit;" and similarly the marginal rendering of the Authorized Version has, "a vine emptying the fruit which it giveth." There is <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> a signification derivable from the primary meaning of <span class="accented">boqeq</span> more suitable than either of the preceding. From the primary sense of "pouring," "pouring itself out," or" poured out," and so overflowing, comes that of "luxuriant." Accordingly Gesenius translates, "a wide-spreading vine." This agrees with the <span class="accented">Septuagint</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, "a vine with goodly branches," to which the Vulgate <span class="accented">frondosa</span>, "leafy," nearly corresponds. In like manner De Wette renders it <span class="accented">wuchernder</span>, "growing prosperously." It was thus a vine of vigorous growth, and extending its branches far and wide; a parallel expression is found in the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e1;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> of <a href="/ezekiel/17-6.htm">Ezekiel 17:6</a>, "a spreading vine." He (rather, <span class="accented">it</span>) bringeth forth fruit unto him self (<span class="accented">itself</span>). The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>literally signifies "reset to" or "on," and is rightly rendered by Gesenius "to set" or "yield fruit." It is variously interpreted by the Hebrew commentators, but more or less erroneously by them all. Rashi takes it in the sense of "to profit;" Aben Ezra, "to bear" or "make equal;" and Kimchi informs us that the older interpreters understood in the sense of "lying," as if <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>, the whole phrase meaning, "the fruit will lie to him," that is, deceive or fail him (like <a href="/hosea/9-2.htm">Hosea 9:2</a>). Kimchi himself takes the verb in the right sense, but, misled by his erroneous explanation of <span class="accented">boqeq</span>, empty or plundered, takes the clause interrogatively: "How shall he set on himself [equivalent to 'yield' any fruit], since he is as a plundered vine; for the enemies have plundered him and set him as an empty vessel? how should he still thrive and become numerous in children and treasures?"
