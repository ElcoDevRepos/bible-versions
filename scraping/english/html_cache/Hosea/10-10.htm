The concept of divine chastening is consistent throughout Scripture, where God disciplines those He loves (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>). The timing is at God's discretion, emphasizing His control over history and events. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where disobedience leads to correction (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>).<p><b>nations will be gathered against them</b><br>This part of the verse suggests a collective judgment involving multiple nations. Historically, Israel faced invasions and captivities by foreign powers such as Assyria and Babylon. This gathering of nations can be seen as a fulfillment of warnings given by prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah, who spoke of foreign nations as instruments of God's judgment (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>). It also foreshadows eschatological themes where nations gather against God's people, as seen in prophetic books like Daniel and Revelation.<p><b>to put them in bondage</b><br>The bondage refers to the physical captivity and oppression experienced by Israel due to their disobedience. This is historically realized in the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles. Bondage is a recurring theme in the Bible, symbolizing the consequences of sin and rebellion against God. It also serves as a type pointing to spiritual bondage from which Christ redeems believers (<a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34-36</a>).<p><b>for their double transgression.</b><br>The "double transgression" likely refers to Israel's idolatry and social injustice, two major sins frequently condemned by the prophets. Hosea, in particular, highlights Israel's unfaithfulness to God through idolatry and their failure to uphold justice and righteousness (<a href="/hosea/4.htm">Hosea 4:1-2</a>). This dual sinfulness underscores the depth of their rebellion and the justification for divine chastening. The concept of "double" may also imply the severity and repeated nature of their offenses, echoing the warnings found in the law and the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, Hosea's ministry focused on calling Israel to repentance and warning of impending judgment due to their unfaithfulness to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to as Ephraim in Hosea, which had fallen into idolatry and moral decay, prompting God's judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the foreign powers that God would use as instruments of judgment against Israel, such as Assyria.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/double_iniquity.htm">Double Iniquity</a></b><br>This term highlights the compounded sins of Israel, including idolatry and social injustice, which warranted divine discipline.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/discipline.htm">Discipline</a></b><br>God's corrective action intended to bring Israel back to righteousness and covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_discipline.htm">God's Sovereignty in Discipline</a></b><br>God exercises His authority to discipline His people at His discretion, emphasizing His control over nations and events.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>Israel's "double iniquity" serves as a warning about the seriousness of sin and its inevitable consequences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_divine_discipline.htm">The Purpose of Divine Discipline</a></b><br>God's discipline is not merely punitive but redemptive, aiming to restore His people to a right relationship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_nations_in_god's_plan.htm">The Role of Nations in God's Plan</a></b><br>God can use even foreign nations to accomplish His purposes, demonstrating His power over all creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_repentance.htm">Call to Repentance</a></b><br>The passage serves as a call to examine our own lives for areas of unfaithfulness and to seek repentance and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Hosea_10_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Hosea 10:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Hosea_10_10_God_s_judgment_on_Israel.htm">How does Hosea 10:10 illustrate God's judgment and justice towards Israel's sin?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_God_s_discipline_reveal.htm">What does "I will chasten them" reveal about God's discipline in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Hosea_10_10_Repent_and_seek_God.htm">How can Hosea 10:10 encourage believers to repent and seek God's forgiveness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Compare_Hosea_10_10_Hebrews_12_6_on_discipline.htm">Compare Hosea 10:10 with Hebrews 12:6.

This expresses God's determination to punish sin and vindicate his justice as the infinitely Holy One. It means, not only that his desire to punish them does exist, but that, this desire being taken for granted, there shall be no let nor hindrance; nothing can stay his hand. Then the mode and means of chastisement are indicated - peoples, foreign invaders, shall be gathered against them.

They thus refer the word to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5df;</span>, eye, but <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> is "fountains," not "eyes." <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Hebrew commentators, Aben Ezra and Kimchi, explain the word in the sense of "two furrows" as in Authorized Version; and refer them to Judah and Ephraim. Thus Kimchi says, "The prophet compares Judah and Ephraim to two plowing oxen. I thought they would plough well, but they have ploughed ill, since they have bound themselves together one with the other and have allied themselves the one with the other to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah." Similarly Rosenm&uuml;ller: "To be bound to two furrows is said of oxen plowing when they are bound together in a common yoke, so that in two adjacent furrows they walk together and with equal pace." <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The Septuagint rendering, based on the Qeri and followed by the Syriac and Arabic, gives a better and clearer sense than the preceding. It is, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, and is followed by Jerome in <span class="accented">Super duas iniquitates suas</span>, as also by the most judicious expositors of ancient and modern times. Yet there is great variety as to what those iniquities are. Some, like Jerome, refer to the double idolatry - that of Micah and that of Jeroboam; others, like Dathe, to the two golden calves set up at Dan and Bethel; Cyril and Theodoret to the apostasy of Israel from Jehovah, and devotion to idols; De Wette and Keil to the double unfaithfulness of Israel to Jehovah and the royal house of David. The exact rendering would, according to any of these views, be, "When I bind them to their two transgressions," or, "When I allow the foreigners to bind them on account of their two transgressions;" that is to connect or yoke them to their two transgressions by the punishment, so that they, like beasts of burden, must drag them after them, whatever be the view we take of the nature of those transgressions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/10-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will chasten them</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1505;&#1468;&#1459;&#1512;&#1461;&#1425;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;es&#183;so&#183;r&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
