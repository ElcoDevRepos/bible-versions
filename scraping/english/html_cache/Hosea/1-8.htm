This period signifies a transition from infancy to early childhood, marking a new phase in the child's life. The name "Lo-ruhamah" means "not loved" or "not pitied," reflecting God's message to Israel about the withdrawal of His mercy due to their persistent unfaithfulness. This weaning symbolizes a shift in God's relationship with Israel, as He prepares to deliver further judgment through the birth of another child.<p><b>Gomer conceived and gave birth to a son</b><br>Gomer, the wife of the prophet Hosea, represents Israel's unfaithfulness to God. Her conception and the birth of another child continue the prophetic symbolism of Hosea's family. The son born to Gomer is named "Lo-ammi," meaning "not my people," which further emphasizes the broken covenant relationship between God and Israel. This act of conception and birth is a direct message from God, illustrating the consequences of Israel's idolatry and spiritual adultery. The birth of this son is a prophetic act, foreshadowing the eventual restoration and redemption of Israel, as seen in later chapters of Hosea and other prophetic books like Jeremiah and Ezekiel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gomer.htm">Gomer</a></b><br>The wife of the prophet Hosea, whose marriage symbolizes Israel's unfaithfulness to God.

The verse shows God&#8217;s measured patience, Hosea&#8217;s faithful obedience, and the intensifying seriousness of sin. Even as the new son points to broken covenant, the wider passage promises that God&#8217;s last word will be restoration, proving His judgments are always purposeful and His faithfulness never fails.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son.</span> As Eastern mothers nurse their children some two or three years, the process of weaning at the end of that period would imply a corresponding interval. This may be merely an incident to complete the prophetic declaration, and pleasingly vary the narrative. It is rather, we think, a pause in the progress of the approaching calamity - a pause indicative of the Divine lothness to execute the final sentence. Or the weaning may be referred, with some, to the entire withdrawal of all spiritual nourishment and support, when promise and prophecy, instruction and consolation, symbol and sacrifice, would be abolished. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/1-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After she had weaned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;ti&#7713;&#183;m&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1580.htm">Strong's 1580: </a> </span><span class="str2">To deal fully or adequately with, deal out to, wean, ripen</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Lo-ruhamah,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1467;&#1495;&#1464;&#1425;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ru&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3819.htm">Strong's 3819: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo-ruhamah -- 'without compassion', symbolic name of Hosea's daughter</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Gomer] conceived</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1492;&#1463;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;ta&#183;har)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2029.htm">Strong's 2029: </a> </span><span class="str2">To conceive, become pregnant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and gave birth to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1500;&#1462;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#234;&#183;le&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3205.htm">Strong's 3205: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bear young, to beget, medically, to act as midwife, to show lineage</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a son.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1469;&#1503;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/hosea/1-8.htm">Hosea 1:8 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/hosea/1-8.htm">Hosea 1:8 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/hosea/1-8.htm">Hosea 1:8 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/hosea/1-8.htm">Hosea 1:8 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/hosea/1-8.htm">Hosea 1:8 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/hosea/1-8.htm">Hosea 1:8  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/hosea/1-8.htm">Hosea 1:8 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/hosea/1-8.htm">Hosea 1:8 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/hosea/1-8.htm">Hosea 1:8 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/hosea/1-8.htm">Hosea 1:8 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/hosea/1-8.htm">OT Prophets: Hosea 1:8 Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah she (Ho Hs Hos.) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/hosea/1-7.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Hosea 1:7"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Hosea 1:7" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/hosea/1-9.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Hosea 1:9"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Hosea 1:9" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
