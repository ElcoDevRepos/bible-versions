Throughout the Old Testament, prophets served as intermediaries between God and Israel, delivering divine messages, warnings, and guidance. This method of communication underscores the personal and relational nature of God, who desires to guide His people directly. Prophets like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel were pivotal in conveying God's will, often calling Israel back to faithfulness. This phrase also connects to <a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>, which states that God spoke to the ancestors through the prophets in various ways.<p><b>and multiplied their visions;</b><br>Visions were a common way God revealed His plans and purposes to the prophets. These supernatural experiences provided insight into God's will and future events. The multiplication of visions indicates the abundance and clarity of God's communication, ensuring that His messages were understood and disseminated. Visions often contained symbolic imagery, requiring interpretation, as seen in the books of Daniel and Zechariah. This method of revelation highlights God's desire to make His will known and His patience in repeatedly reaching out to His people.<p><b>I gave parables through the prophets.</b><br>Parables are simple stories used to illustrate moral or spiritual lessons. In the context of the prophets, parables served as a tool to convey complex truths in an accessible manner. This method of teaching is seen in the ministry of Jesus Christ, who frequently used parables to reveal the mysteries of the Kingdom of God (e.g., <a href="/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13</a>). The use of parables by the prophets underscores the continuity of God's teaching methods and His desire for His people to understand and apply His truths. Parables often required reflection and discernment, encouraging listeners to engage deeply with the message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel during the 8th century BC, Hosea's ministry focused on calling Israel back to faithfulness to God amidst widespread idolatry and moral decay.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Messengers chosen by God to convey His words and will to the people.
