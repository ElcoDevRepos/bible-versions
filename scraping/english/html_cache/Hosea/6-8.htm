This contrast highlights the moral decay present in a place associated with healing. Historically, Gilead was part of the territory given to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. The reference to "evildoers" suggests rampant sin and corruption, possibly linked to idolatry and injustice, which were common issues addressed by the prophets. This phrase underscores the theme of Israel's unfaithfulness to God, a central message in Hosea.<p><b>tracked with footprints of blood</b><br>The imagery of "footprints of blood" suggests violence and murder, indicating that the city is marked by acts of brutality. This could be a literal reference to bloodshed or a metaphor for pervasive injustice and sin. The phrase evokes the idea of guilt and accountability, as footprints can be traced back to the perpetrator. In a broader biblical context, bloodshed is often associated with judgment and the need for repentance. This imagery aligns with the prophetic call for Israel to return to God and abandon their sinful ways. The mention of blood also foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, whose blood would be shed for the redemption of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilead.htm">Gilead</a></b><br>A region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and fertile land.

A whole population&#8212;not merely isolated individuals&#8212;was implicated. Compare <a href="/jonah/3-3.htm">Jonah 3:3-8</a>, where Nineveh&#8217;s entire city repents; here, Gilead&#8217;s city refuses.

The verse stands as a warning that no amount of past blessing can shield a community that turns from God&#8217;s righteousness. Yet, just as the Great Physician once offered balm from Gilead, the Lord still calls His people to repent (<a href="/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1-3</a>). Those who heed the call find cleansing through the blood of Christ, not the blood of victims, and the hope of a restored land marked by holiness rather than violence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Polluted</span> . . .--More accurately, <span class= "ital">betrodden</span> (or foot-tracked) <span class= "ital">with blood.</span> We infer from <a href="/judges/10-17.htm" title="Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.">Judges 10:17</a> that there was a town called Gilead east of the Jordan distinct altogether from Mizpah (identified by many with the city of refuge Ramoth-Gilead), and this is confirmed by notices in Eusebius and Cyril. Murder in a "city of refuge" adds to the horror. On the murderous propensities of the Gileadites see <a href="/2_kings/15-25.htm" title="But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.">2Kings 15:25</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - In these two verses the prophet adduces proof of that faithlessness with which he had just charged Israel. <span class="cmt_word">Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.</span> The latter clause is more literally rendered, <span class="accented">foot-printed</span> or <span class="accented">foot-tracked from blood</span>. Two things require consideration here - the place and its pollution. Gilead is sometimes a mountain range, and sometimes the mountainous region east of the Jordan; it has Bashan on the north, the Arabian plateau on the east, and Moab on the south. It stretches from the south end of the Sea of Galilee to the north end of the Dead Sea - some sixty miles in length by twenty in breadth. The part of Gilead between the Hieromax and the Jabbok is now called <span class="accented">Jebel Ajlun</span>; while the section south of the Jabbok forms the province of <span class="accented">Belka</span>. In the New Testament it is spoken of under the name of Pertea, or beyond Jordan. Sometimes the whole trans-Jordanic territory belonging to Israel is called Gilead. In the passage before us it is the name of a city, though some take it to mean the whole land of Gilead. The men of Gilead and the Gileadites in general seem to have been fierce, wild mountaineers; and yet they are represented as still worse in this Scripture. They are nut only barbarous and wicked, but murderous and infamous for homicidal atrocities. As evidence in some sort of the justness of this dark picture, the murder of Pekahiah by Pekah with "fifty men of the Gileadites." as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a>, may be specified. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> is taken <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by some as the feminine of the adjective <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>, crafty, cunning, wily; thus Rashi explains it: "Gilead is full of people who lie in wait for murder;" and Kimchi likewise has, "Gilead is a city of evil-doers, who are crafty to murder men." But <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> it is rather the Qal Pual participle feminine from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>, to seize the heel of any one, hold, tread in the footsteps, follow, go after; which is the right meaning, viz. "tracked," as given above. We retain the Authorized Version of the first clause of ver. 9, slightly modified, viz. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="cmt_word">As troops of robbers wait for a man, so is the company of priests</span>; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;</span> equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>, wait, being an anomalous form of the infinitive Piel for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5d4;</span>; thus Kimchi says, "The <span class="accented">yod</span> stands in the place of <span class="accented">he</span>, and the form is the infinitive." Both Aben Ezra and Kimchi translate the first clause as above; the former beg, "The sense is, As robber-troops wait for a man who is to pass along the way, that they may plunder him, so is (or so does) the company of the priests;" the latter explains, "As troops of robbers wait for a man passing along the way to plunder him, so is the company of priests, he means to say, as the priests of the high places who combine to plunder those who pass along the way.
