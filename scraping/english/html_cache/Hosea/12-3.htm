Jacob's grasping of Esau's heel symbolizes his future struggle for supremacy and blessing, which is a recurring theme in his life. The act of grasping the heel is significant in Hebrew culture, as it foreshadows Jacob's later actions to secure the birthright and blessing meant for the firstborn. This event is foundational in understanding the character of Jacob, whose name itself means "he who grasps the heel" or "supplanter." The imagery of the heel is also seen in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where it is prophesied that the seed of the woman will crush the serpent's head, indicating a struggle between good and evil.<p><b>and in his vigor he wrestled with God</b><br>This phrase refers to the pivotal event in Jacob's life when he wrestled with a divine being at Peniel, as described in <a href="/genesis/32-24.htm">Genesis 32:24-30</a>. This encounter is both literal and symbolic, representing Jacob's struggle with God and man throughout his life. The wrestling match signifies a turning point, where Jacob's persistence and determination are met with divine intervention, resulting in a blessing and a new name, Israel, meaning "he struggles with God." This event is a type of Christ, as it prefigures the ultimate struggle and victory of Jesus, who wrestled with the powers of sin and death. The location, Peniel, meaning "face of God," underscores the significance of encountering God directly. This wrestling also highlights the theme of human weakness and divine strength, as Jacob's physical struggle leads to spiritual transformation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Jacob is one of the patriarchs of Israel.

Jacob &#8220;wrestled with Him until daybreak,&#8221; refusing to let go without a blessing. Hosea calls that encounter literal history, not mere metaphor.<p>&#8226; &#8220;In his vigor&#8221; reminds us Jacob was no passive recipient; he exerted all his strength. Yet when God touched his hip (<a href="/genesis/32-25.htm">Genesis 32:25</a>), Jacob learned true victory is granted, not earned (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The Lord renamed him &#8220;Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men and have prevailed.&#8221; Hosea uses that renaming to press Israel to return to the faith of their father (<a href="/hosea/12-4.htm">Hosea 12:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; This wrestling scene illustrates:<p>&#8211; Tenacious faith clings to God&#8217;s promises even in pain (<a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>).<p>&#8211; God sometimes meets us in crisis to break self-reliance and impart blessing (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7-10</a>).<p>&#8211; The new name signals a new identity&#8212;God transforms strivers into overcomers (<a href="/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hosea/12-3.htm">Hosea 12:3</a> links two real events from Jacob&#8217;s life to remind Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;of God&#8217;s sovereign purpose and the call to wholehearted pursuit of His blessing. From the womb to the wrestling match, Jacob&#8217;s story testifies that God chooses, confronts, and changes people for His glory.

But <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> according to others, and we agree with them, the object of the prophet in these verses is to admonish them to imitate the conduct of their progenitor, and to remind them of the distinction which he had obtained thereby, as an encourage-merit to them to go and do likewise. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Another interpretation, somewhat similar to  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/12-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the womb</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1496;&#1462;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(bab&#183;be&#183;&#7789;en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
