The imagery of Israel as a child highlights the nation's infancy and dependence on God. In biblical context, this period includes the covenant with Abraham and the formative experiences of the Israelites in Egypt. The metaphor of a child is used to emphasize innocence and the nurturing relationship God had with Israel.<p><b>I loved him</b><br>God's love for Israel is a central theme throughout the Old Testament. This love is covenantal, rooted in the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It is an unconditional love that persists despite Israel's frequent disobedience. The love mentioned here is not just emotional but also involves God's actions in history, such as delivering Israel from slavery and guiding them through the wilderness.<p><b>and out of Egypt I called My son</b><br>This phrase directly references the Exodus, when God delivered the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. It is a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing liberation and the beginning of their identity as God's chosen people. The term "My son" signifies a special relationship, echoing the language used in <a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22-23</a>, where God calls Israel His firstborn son. This phrase is also seen as a typological prophecy, later applied to Jesus Christ in <a href="/matthew/2-15.htm">Matthew 2:15</a>, where it is fulfilled in the return of Jesus from Egypt, drawing a parallel between Israel's history and the life of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the nation of Israel, God's chosen people, whom He delivered from slavery in Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved before God delivered them through Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_love.htm">God's Love</a></b><br>The verse highlights God's enduring love for Israel, depicted as a fatherly love for a child.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/calling_out_of_egypt.htm">Calling Out of Egypt</a></b><br>This event refers to the Exodus, where God led the Israelites out of bondage.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_fulfillment.htm">Prophetic Fulfillment</a></b><br>This verse is also seen as a prophecy fulfilled in the New Testament with Jesus' return from Egypt.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_unchanging_love.htm">God's Unchanging Love</a></b><br>God's love for His people is steadfast and enduring, much like a parent's love for their child.

The calling out of Egypt of the Messiah gave a new indication of the cyclical character of Hebrew history. The passage helps us to understand what is meant by the formula, "that it might be fulfilled," &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.</span> Driver uses this verse to exemplify the principle that when the reference is to what is past or certain, rather than to what is future or indefinite, we find the predicate or the apodosis introduced by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;</span>, though not with nearly the same frequency as <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> perfect and <span class="accented">vav</span> causes <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> with subject or object pre-fixed; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> after time-determinations. <p>The life of a nation has its stages of rise, progress, and development, like the life of an individual man. The prophet goes back to that early period when the national life of Israel was in its infancy; it was then that a few patriarchs who had gone down to sojourn in Egypt were becoming a people; the predicate precedes, to emphasize, that early day when Israel became God's peculiar people. The <span class="accented">ray</span> marks the apodosis recording God's love in choosing that people, calling them into the relation of sonship, and delivering them out of Egypt. <span class="accented">Thus</span> Kimchi says, "When Israel was vet a child, <span class="accented">i.e. in</span> Egypt, then I loved him, therefore I am more angry with them than with the rest of the nations; for from their youth onward I have loved them, and delivered them out of the bands of their enemies.
