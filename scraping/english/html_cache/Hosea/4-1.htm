The "children of Israel" refers to the descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel, and represents the northern kingdom during the divided monarchy. This call to hear is reminiscent of the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>, which begins with "Hear, O Israel," underscoring the importance of listening to God's commands. The prophetic tradition often begins with such a call, indicating the divine authority behind the message.<p><b>for the LORD has a case against the people of the land</b><br>The imagery of a legal case suggests a covenant lawsuit, where God, as the suzerain, brings charges against His vassal, Israel, for breach of covenant. This reflects the covenantal relationship established at Sinai, where Israel agreed to follow God's laws. The "people of the land" indicates the inhabitants of the northern kingdom, who are being held accountable for their actions. This legal language is common in prophetic literature, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a> and <a href="/micah/6.htm">Micah 6:1-2</a>, where God calls His people to account.<p><b>There is no truth, no loving devotion, and no knowledge of God in the land!</b><br>The absence of "truth" (emet) suggests a lack of faithfulness and reliability, both in interpersonal relationships and in the people's relationship with God. "Loving devotion" (hesed) refers to covenant loyalty and kindness, a key aspect of the relationship between God and His people, as seen in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>. The "knowledge of God" implies an intimate, experiential understanding of God's character and will, not merely intellectual assent. This lack of knowledge is a recurring theme in Hosea, as seen in <a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>, where God laments that His people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. The absence of these qualities indicates a society that has turned away from its covenant obligations, leading to moral and spiritual decay.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, Hosea's ministry was marked by his call to speak against the spiritual adultery of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/children_of_israel.htm">Children of Israel</a></b><br>The descendants of Jacob, representing the Northern Kingdom, who were in a covenant relationship with God but had turned away from Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is bringing a legal case against His people for their unfaithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/inhabitants_of_the_land.htm">Inhabitants of the Land</a></b><br>The people living in Israel who are being accused of lacking truth, loving devotion, and knowledge of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Northern Kingdom of Israel, which was experiencing moral and spiritual decay.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_truth.htm">The Importance of Truth</a></b><br>Truth is foundational to a relationship with God.

These three absences summarize every moral collapse. The verse warns that when God&#8217;s people forsake Scripture, covenant loyalty, and intimate fellowship with the Lord, judgment follows. It calls believers in every age to hear, to love, and to know the living God, guarding society and soul from the same ruin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Controversy.</span>--A judicial suit, in which Jehovah is plaintiff as well as judge (<a href="/isaiah/1-23.htm" title="Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loves gifts, and follows after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come to them.">Isaiah 1:23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-21.htm" title="Produce your cause, said the LORD; bring forth your strong reasons, said the King of Jacob.">Isaiah 41:21</a>).

What had previously been presented in figure and symbol is now plainly and literally stated. The children of Israel are summoned in the first verse of this chapter to hear the charge preferred against them and the sentence pronounced. Having convened, as it were, a public assembly and cited the persons concerned, the prophet proceeds to show cause why they are bound to give an attentive hearing. In God's controversy with the people of the land the prophet acts as his ambassador, accusing the people of great and grievous sins, and vindicating the justice of God's judgments in their punishment. The <span class="accented">ki</span> with which the last clause of the verse commences may be either causal or recitative, and may thus specify either the ground or subject of controversy. It is commonly understood here in the former sense. Israel is charged with want of truth, mercy, and the knowledge of God. Kimchi comments on this controversy as follows: "<span class="accented">With</span> the inhabitants of the land of Israel I have a controversy, for I gave them the land on the condition that they should exercise righteousness and judgment, and on this condition I pledged myself to them that my eyes would be upon them from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. But since they practice the opposite - cursing, lying, etc. - I also will act with them in a way contrary to what I assured them, and will hide my face from them." He adds, "There were some righteous among them, but they were few, and they hid themselves from the face of the multitude who were wicked." Truth and mercy are at once Divine attributes and human virtues; it is in the latter sense, of course, that they are here employed. Truth includes works as well as words, doing as well as saying; it implies uprightness in speech and behavior - thorough integrity of character and conduct, Mercy goes beyond and supplements this. We sometimes say of such a one that he is an honest but a hard man. Mercy combined with truth, on the contrary, makes a man kind as well as honest, benevolent as well as upright. In a somewhat similar sense the apostle conjoins goodness and righteousness when he says, "Scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die." The knowledge of God is the real root of these two virtues of truth and mercy. If we know God as he is in himself and as he stands in his relations to us, we shall conform our conduct to his character and our actions to his will. If we know God to be a God of truth, who delighteth in truth in the inward parts, we shall cultivate truth in our hearts, express it with our lips, and practice it in our lives. If we know God as a God of mercy, who has shown such boundless mercy to us in pardoning our multiplied and aggravated offences, we shall imitate that mercy in our relations to our fellow-man; nor shall we enact the part of the merciless man in the parable, who owed his lord ten thousand talents, and who, having nothing to pay, was freely forgiven the debt; but finding his fellow-servant, who owed him only an hundred pence, laid hands on him and took him by the throat, saying, "Pay me that thou owest," and, deaf to that fellow-servant's supplications, east him into prison till he should pay the debt. The intimate connection of the knowledge of God with the virtues in question is confirmed by the Prophet Jeremiah, "<span class="accented">Did</span> not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was well with him? he judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him: was not this to know me, saith the Lord?" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/4-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Hear</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;im&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the word</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1456;&#1489;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#601;&#183;&#7687;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">O children</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
