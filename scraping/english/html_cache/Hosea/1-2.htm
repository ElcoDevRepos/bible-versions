Hosea is one of the Minor Prophets, and his ministry is set in the Northern Kingdom of Israel during the 8th century BC, a time of political instability and spiritual decline. The phrase underscores the authority and divine origin of Hosea's message, aligning with other prophets who were called by God, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>He told him</b><br>This direct communication from God to Hosea highlights the personal nature of God's relationship with His prophets. It reflects the biblical pattern where God gives specific instructions to His chosen messengers, as seen with Moses and Jonah. This divine command sets the stage for Hosea's symbolic actions.<p><b>Go, take a prostitute as your wife</b><br>This command is both shocking and symbolic. In the cultural context, marriage to a prostitute would be seen as socially unacceptable, yet it serves as a powerful metaphor for Israel's unfaithfulness to God. The marriage symbolizes God's covenant relationship with Israel, which has been marred by idolatry and spiritual adultery. This act prefigures the redemptive work of Christ, who seeks out sinners and the spiritually unfaithful.<p><b>and have children of adultery</b><br>The children born from this union represent the consequences of Israel's spiritual infidelity. They symbolize the fruit of Israel's idolatrous practices and the resulting judgment. This imagery is consistent with the prophetic tradition of using family relationships to illustrate spiritual truths, as seen in Isaiah's children and their symbolic names.<p><b>because this land is flagrantly prostituting itself</b><br>The land refers to the people of Israel, who are engaging in idolatry and abandoning their covenant with God. The term "flagrantly" emphasizes the blatant and shameless nature of their actions. This mirrors the spiritual condition described in other prophetic books, such as Jeremiah and Ezekiel, where Israel's idolatry is likened to adultery.<p><b>by departing from the LORD</b><br>This phrase captures the essence of Israel's sin: a deliberate turning away from God. It highlights the covenantal breach and the spiritual apostasy of the nation. The departure from the LORD is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen in the cycles of sin and repentance in Judges and the warnings of exile in Deuteronomy. This departure foreshadows the ultimate need for redemption through Christ, who restores the broken relationship between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver His message to the Northern Kingdom of Israel.

Hosea must marry a woman already known for sexual immorality, as reconfirmed in <a href="/hosea/3-1.htm">Hosea 3:1</a>.<p>&#8226; This does not endorse sin; it is a prophetic sign-act like Isaiah walking barefoot (<a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2-3</a>) or Ezekiel lying on his side (<a href="/ezekiel/4-4.htm">Ezekiel 4:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; God may override social norms for a higher redemptive purpose (<a href="/acts/10-13.htm">Acts 10:13-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Hosea&#8217;s painful marriage will mirror God&#8217;s relationship with wayward Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-1.htm">Jeremiah 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"and have children of adultery"</b><p>&#8226; Hosea will raise children conceived in unfaithfulness, each becoming a living message (<a href="/hosea/1-3.htm">Hosea 1:3-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Their names&#8212;Jezreel, Lo-Ruhamah, Lo-Ammi&#8212;announce judgment, similar to Isaiah&#8217;s sons in <a href="/isaiah/8-18.htm">Isaiah 8:18</a>.<p>&#8226; Every family moment reinforces the divine indictment (<a href="/ezekiel/24-15.htm">Ezekiel 24:15-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"because this land is flagrantly prostituting itself by departing from the LORD"</b><p>&#8226; Spiritual adultery equals idolatry, the very offense warned against in <a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15-16</a> and <a href="/leviticus/17-7.htm">Leviticus 17:7</a>.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Flagrantly&#8221; points to habitual betrayal (<a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-15.htm">Ezekiel 16:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Departing from the LORD violates covenant loyalty and invites judgment (<a href="/2_kings/17-15.htm">2 Kings 17:15</a>; <a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; By staging this drama in Hosea&#8217;s home, God exposes the nation&#8217;s sin publicly, leaving no room for denial (<a href="/revelation/2-4.htm">Revelation 2:4-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a> launches a living sermon.

Is it an historic occurrence, the only too real tragedy of the author's personal experience, employed for the purpose of illustration? (Comp. the domestic incident, <a href="/context/isaiah/8-1.htm" title="Moreover the LORD said to me, Take you a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.">Isaiah 8:1-4</a>.) Or is this opening chapter a merely allegorical representation, designed to exhibit in vivid colours the terrible moral condition of Israel? (Comp. the symbolic actions described in <a href="/context/jeremiah/25-15.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send you, to drink it.">Jeremiah 25:15-29</a>; <a href="/context/ezekiel/4-4.htm" title="Lie you also on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it: according to the number of the days that you shall lie on it you shall bear their iniquity.">Ezekiel 4:4-6</a>; and perhaps <a href="/context/isaiah/20-1.htm" title="In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it;">Isaiah 20:1-3</a>.) Able writers have advocated each of these opposed theories; but in our opinion the balance of evidence inclines to the former view, which regards the events as historic. The further question arises, Was Gomer guilty before or after the marriage? The former supposition involves the harshness of conceiving such a marriage as the result of a Divine command; but the latter supposition admits of a satisfactory interpretation. The wickedness which <span class= "ital">after</span> marriage revealed itself to the prophet's agonised heart was transfigured to the inspired seer into an emblem of his nation's wrong to Jehovah. In the light of this great idea, the prophet's past came before him in changed aspect. As he reflected on the marvellous symbolic adaptation of this episode to the terrible spiritual needs of his fellow-countrymen, which he was called by God to supply, the Divine purpose which shaped his sorrowful career became interpreted to his glowing consciousness as a Divine command--"Go, take unto thyself a wife of whoredoms." He had suffered acutely, but the agony was part of God's arrangement, and the very love that was repeatedly outraged proves ultimately to have been suggested by a Divine monition.<p><span class= "bld">Children of whoredoms.--</span>Children of Hosea's marriage.

These words may be rendered at once more literally and more exactly, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> "<span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">beginning</span> (of that which) Jehovah spoke by Hosea." Thus Gesenius translates, understanding ashen, which is often omitted as a pronoun in the nominative or accusative, indicating relation, and as including the antecedent personal or demonstrative pronoun. When the pronoun thus supplied is in the genitive, the preceding noun is in the construct state, as here. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Rosenm&uuml;ller, without necessity, takes the noun in the adverbial sense; thus: "In the beginning Jehovah spake by Hosea." He also suggests the possibility of <span class="accented">dibber</span> being a noun of the same meaning as <span class="accented">dabar</span>, but of different formation; while in two manuscripts of De Rossi and one of Kennicott the regular form of the construct state of <span class="accented">davar</span> is expressed. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Keil takes the noun as an accusative of time, and accounts for its construct state by the substantival idea of the succeeding subordinated clause; thus: "<span class="accented">At</span> the commencement of ' Jehovah spake,' Jehovah said to him." But what is the beginning here mentioned? It cannot mean that Hoses was the first of the prophets by whom God made known his will to Israel, or the first of the minor prophets; for Jonah, as is rightly inferred from <a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>, preceded him; Joel also is usually regarded as before him in point of time; neither can it denote his priority to Isaiah and <span class="accented">Amos</span>, who also prophesied in the days of Uzziah. The plain meaning is that which becomes obvious when we adopt the right rendering of Gesenius, as given above, that is, the beginning of the prophecies which Hoses was commissioned by Jehovah to make known. The peculiarity of the expression, "<span class="accented">in</span> Hosea," as the word literally means, deserves attention. Maurer compares <a href="/numbers/12-2.htm">Numbers 12:2, 6</a>, and 8, to prove that the expression signifies speaking to rather than in or <span class="accented">by</span>; he also cites other passages to the same purpose, But while the verb "to speak," followed by b5 and the verb constructed with <span class="accented">el</span>, may coincide in signification at a certain point, it does not thence follow that they are everywhere and always synonymous. Long ago Jerome drew attention to the distinction which this difference of construction suggests. "It is one thing," says that Father, "for the Lord to speak <span class="accented">in</span> Hosea, another to speak to  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/1-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">first</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;&#7717;il&#183;la&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8462.htm">Strong's 8462: </a> </span><span class="str2">A commencement, rel, original</span><br /><br /><span class="word">spoke</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(dib&#183;ber-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Hosea,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1425;&#1506;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#333;&#183;&#353;&#234;&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
