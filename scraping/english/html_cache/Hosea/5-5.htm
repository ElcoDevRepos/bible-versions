Arrogance here refers to Israel's refusal to acknowledge their dependence on God, choosing instead to trust in their own strength and alliances with foreign nations. This pride is seen as a witness against them, as it leads to their downfall. In biblical context, pride is often condemned (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>), and Israel's arrogance is contrasted with the humility God desires (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). The testimony against them is not just from God but from their own actions, which reveal their unfaithfulness.<p><b>Israel and Ephraim stumble in their iniquity;</b><br>Ephraim, representing the largest tribe, often symbolizes the Northern Kingdom of Israel. The stumbling indicates a moral and spiritual failure, a result of their persistent sin and idolatry. Iniquity here refers to their deviation from God's laws, particularly their worship of Baal and other Canaanite deities. This stumbling is prophetic of the eventual downfall and exile of the Northern Kingdom by Assyria in 722 BC. The imagery of stumbling is used throughout scripture to denote a fall from grace or a failure to uphold God's commandments (<a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14-15</a>).<p><b>even Judah stumbles with them.</b><br>Judah, the Southern Kingdom, is also implicated in the sin of Israel, showing that the corruption and idolatry have spread beyond the Northern Kingdom. This serves as a warning that Judah is not immune to judgment despite having the temple in Jerusalem. Historically, Judah would later face its own exile at the hands of Babylon in 586 BC. The inclusion of Judah emphasizes the unity of God's people in their failure and the comprehensive nature of the judgment. This also foreshadows the need for a new covenant, fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who would unite both kingdoms under His reign (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the Northern Kingdom, often characterized by its rebellion against God and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>A leading tribe in the Northern Kingdom, often used synonymously with Israel, representing its leadership and influence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The Southern Kingdom, which, although more faithful than Israel, is also warned of impending judgment due to its sins.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/arrogance.htm">Arrogance</a></b><br>The pride and self-reliance of Israel, which leads to their downfall and serves as a witness against them.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/iniquity.htm">Iniquity</a></b><br>The sinful actions and behaviors that cause Israel and Ephraim to stumble, highlighting their moral and spiritual failures.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>Pride is a significant spiritual danger that can lead to a fall.

The verse warns every generation that unchecked pride breeds sin, sin breeds stumbling, and stumbling becomes contagious. Humble, wholehearted return to the LORD is the only solid ground.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">The pride of Israel</span> may be either the true object of pride and boasting, viz., Jehovah Himself (comp. <a href="/amos/8-7.htm" title="The LORD has sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.">Amos 8:7</a>), or the false object of pride to which they had yielded. The latter interpretation is to be preferred, and is supported by <a href="/amos/6-8.htm" title="The Lord GOD has sworn by himself, said the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.">Amos 6:8</a>. Arrogance led Ephraim, on numerous occasions in earlier sacred history, to resent the supremacy of Judah. This jealousy culminated in the rebellion of Jeroboam I., and characterised their history till the reign of Ahab. Arrogance will be their ruin now; and in this Judah is represented as likewise involved. This last feature is a new note in prophetic utterance. (Comp <a href="/hosea/4-15.htm" title="Though you, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not you to Gilgal, neither go you up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD lives.">Hosea 4:15</a>.) We are therefore justified in regarding Hosea 5 as delivered at a later time than the oracle standing immediately before it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face.</span> This may be understood <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> of Jehovah, who was Israel's glory, as we read in <a href="/amos/7-7.htm">Amos 7:7</a> <span class="accented">of</span> "the excellency of Israel." This explanation suits at once the sense and the context. They knew not God, notwithstanding the special advantages they enjoyed for that knowledge; they had no liking to the knowledge of' Go,], they did not concern themselves about it; and now Jehovah, who should have been their excellency and glory, but who had been thus slighted by them, will testify against them and bear witness to their face by judgments. But <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> another interpretation recommends itself as equally or more suitable. This interpretation understands "pride" more simply to mean the prosperous state and flourishing condition of which Israel was proud, or rather, perhaps, the haughtiness of Israel, owing to those very circumstances of worldly wealth and greatness. This vain pride and self-exaltation was the great obstacle in the way of their turning to the Lord. If this sense of the word be accepted, the verb had better be rendered" humbled," a meaning which it often has; thus, "humbled shall be the pride of Israel to his face" (that is, in his own sight). Such is the translation of the LXX.: <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f38;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "The pride of Israel shall be brought low before his face;" while the Chaldee translates similarly, "<span class="accented">The</span> glory of Israel shall be humbled while they see it;" the Syriac has, "The pride of Israel shall be humbled in his presence," or before his eyes. Aben Ezra also takes the idea of the verb to be humiliation or depression; while Kimchi takes <span class="accented">gaon</span> not so much in the sense of the inward feeling, as of <span class="accented">those</span> outward circumstances that promoted it - their greatness and grandeur and glory; and, alluding to the words of the Chaldee rendering, "in their sight," he says, "While they are still in their land before their captivity, they shall perceive their humiliation and degradation, instead of the glory which they had at the beginning." Kimchi, however, as well as most other commentators, seems to have understood the verb in the sense of "testify;" thus, "Israel's pride will testify to his face, when he shall take upon him its punishment." Therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them. Pride usually goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. The consequence of Israel's pride was the fall here mentioned. The ten tribes composing the northern kingdom fell into gross and grievous sin, and therefore also into long-suffering and sore sorrow. Even Ephraim, that tribe pre-eminent for power as for pride, and the perpetual rival of Judah, shall fall as well as and with the rest. Judah also, that is, Judah proper, and Benjamin, participating in the same evil course, fell like Israel into sin, and, though more than a century later, into ruin.
