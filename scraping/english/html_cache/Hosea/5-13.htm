The "sickness" and "wound" symbolize the consequences of their idolatry and rebellion against God. This imagery is consistent with the prophetic tradition of using physical ailments to describe spiritual and moral decay (<a href="/isaiah/1-5.htm">Isaiah 1:5-6</a>). The division between Ephraim and Judah highlights the fractured state of the once-united Israelite kingdom.<p><b>then Ephraim turned to Assyria and sent to the great king</b><br>In their desperation, Ephraim sought help from Assyria, a rising power in the ancient Near East. This reflects a historical context where Israel and Judah often sought alliances with foreign powers rather than relying on God (<a href="/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19-20</a>). The "great king" refers to the Assyrian monarch, likely Tiglath-Pileser III, known for his military campaigns and expansionist policies. This action demonstrates a lack of faith in God's ability to deliver and heal them, contrasting with the biblical call to trust in the Lord alone (<a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>).<p><b>But he cannot cure you or heal your wound</b><br>The prophet Hosea emphasizes the futility of seeking salvation from human powers. Despite Assyria's might, it cannot provide the spiritual healing that Israel and Judah need. This statement underscores the biblical theme that true healing and restoration come only from God (<a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5-6</a>). It serves as a prophetic warning that reliance on worldly powers leads to disappointment and further judgment, as seen in the eventual Assyrian conquest of Israel (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). This also foreshadows the ultimate healing and redemption found in Jesus Christ, who is the true source of spiritual restoration (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephraim.htm">Ephraim</a></b><br>Represents the northern kingdom of Israel, often used synonymously with Israel in the prophetic books.

(On "Jareb," see <span class= "ital">Excursus.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">EXCURSUS A: ON JAREB (Hosea 5:13).</span><p>Schrader, in his "Cuneiform Inscriptions and the Old Testament," has the following note:--"King Combat, or Contention (Jareb), is not a proper name--none such being found in the Assyrian lists. In the prevailing uncertainty respecting Biblical chronology, it is hard to determine what Assyrian monarch is meant by this appellative. If we are to understand Salmanassar III. (781-772) as the king in <a href="/hosea/10-14.htm" title="Therefore shall a tumult arise among your people, and all your fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces on her children.">Hosea 10:14</a>, under the name Salman, the allusion here may be to <span class= "ital">Assur-dan-ilu</span> (771-754), who conducted a series of expeditions to the West." But when we turn to Schrader's comment on <a href="/hosea/10-14.htm" title="Therefore shall a tumult arise among your people, and all your fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces on her children.">Hosea 10:14</a>, we find that he abandons the theory that Salman is Salmanassar III. (see <span class= "ital">ad. Loc.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> On the other hand, Tiglath-pileser, whom Schrader and Sir H. Rawlinson identify with the Pul of Scripture, was a warrior of great prowess, to whom such a designation as "King Combat" from Hosea and his contemporaries would admirably apply. The verse might then be taken to refer to the events of the reign of Menahem (<a href="/2_kings/15-19.htm" title="And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.">2Kings 15:19</a>, see also <span class= "ital">Introduction</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> But this explanation, probable as it is, is complicated with questions of Biblical chronology. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to King Jareb</span>. Both kingdoms became conscious of their disease and decline; Ephraim felt its sickness or internal consumption, Judah its wound or external corruption (<span class="accented">mazor</span>, a festering wound, from <span class="accented">zur</span>, to squeeze out); they were both conscious of rottenness in their condition. That diseased condition was rather spiritual apostasy than political adversity, though these were connected as cause and effect. But, instead of applying to Jehovah, Ephraim had recourse to Assyria and its king for health and help, but in vain; for no earthly power could avert the Divine judgments. The punishment threatened in the twelfth verse prompts the efforts to obtain succor mentioned in this. The general sense of the verse is given by Kimchi as follows: "When Ephraim and Judah saw that the enemies were constantly invading and plundering them, they seek help from the King of Assyria; but turn not back to me, nor seek help from me, but from flesh and blood, which, however, cannot help them when it is not my pleasure." <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Some, as the Jewish interpreters, refer the first clause as a matter of course to Ephraim, but the second to Judah; thus, Jerome in like manner understands Ephraim's visit of that to Pul, recorded in <a href="/2_kings/15.htm">2 Kings 15</a>, and the message of Judah to Tiglath-pileser (<a href="/2_kings/16.htm">2 Kings 16</a>.); but an interval of thirty years lay between the two events thus described as synchronous. Rashi explains the former clause of Hoshea's visit to Shalmaneser the King of Assyria, and the second of Ahaz's to Tiglath-pileser; Kimchi, again, refers the former to Menahem visiting Pul, and the second of Ahaz to Tiglath-pileser (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/28-21.htm">2 Chronicles 28:21</a>). But <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Ephraim is the subject in both clauses, so that there is no need of a supposed reference to Judah in the second. Calvin correctly restricts them both to Ephraim, and accounts for the restriction as follows: "Why, then, does he name only Ephraim? Even because the beginning of this evil commenced in the kingdom of Israel; for they were the first who went to the King of Assur, that they might, by his help, resist their neighbors, the Syrians; the Jews afterwards followed their example. Since, then, the Israelites afforded a precedent to the Jews to send for aids of this kind, the prophet expressly confines his discourse to them." He admits, however, that the accusation had respect to both in common; or Ephraim may have applied on behalf of Judah as well as for herself. There is much diversity of opinion with regard to the word "Jareb." Some take it <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> for a proper name, either of an Assyrian king or of some place or city in the country of Assyria. as the LXX., Aben Ezra, and Kimchi; but the absence of the article is opposed to this, neither is <a href="/jeremiah/37-1.htm">Jeremiah 37:1</a>, "and Zechariah reigned as king" (<span class="accented">vayyimloch melech</span>), <span class="accented">a</span> proper parallel.
