In the context of ancient Israel, this stumbling represents the nation's idolatry and unfaithfulness to God. The imagery of stumbling during the day suggests that the people are blind to their own sinfulness, despite it being evident. This can be connected to other scriptures such as <a href="/isaiah/59-10.htm">Isaiah 59:10</a>, where the people grope like the blind. The idea of stumbling is also a metaphor for judgment, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/13-16.htm">Jeremiah 13:16</a>, where darkness and stumbling are linked to divine retribution.<p><b>and the prophet will stumble with you by night;</b><br>The prophets, who were supposed to be the spiritual leaders and guides, are also depicted as failing. Their stumbling at night suggests a deeper level of spiritual blindness and corruption, as they are unable to see or lead even in times of darkness. This reflects the failure of religious leaders to uphold God's truth, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/23-11.htm">Jeremiah 23:11</a>, where prophets and priests are described as profane. The night can symbolize a time of trial or judgment, and the prophets' inability to guide the people through it indicates a complete breakdown of spiritual leadership.<p><b>so I will destroy your mother&#8212;</b><br>The term "mother" here is often interpreted as a reference to the nation of Israel itself, or more specifically, the capital city, which represents the heart of the nation. The destruction of the "mother" signifies the impending judgment and downfall of Israel due to its persistent unfaithfulness. This is consistent with the covenantal curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to national calamity. The destruction is both a literal and symbolic act of divine judgment, emphasizing the seriousness of Israel's sin and the consequences of turning away from God. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, where Jesus, as the true prophet, priest, and king, fulfills what the failed leaders could not, offering redemption and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Hosea was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Northern Kingdom of Israel.

Yet God warns, &#8220;You will stumble by day&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/4-5.htm">Hosea 4:5</a>). Israel&#8217;s sin had so dulled spiritual sight that they tripped even when the path was obvious.<p>&#8226; Similar warnings appear in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Deuteronomy 28:29</a>, where disobedient Israel &#8220;gropes at noon as a blind man gropes in the dark,&#8221; and in <a href="/isaiah/59-10.htm">Isaiah 59:10</a>.<p>&#8226; The fault is moral, not circumstantial. Light is present, but rebellion shuts the eyes (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word remains true; when His people reject that Word, confusion follows (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a> vs. <a href="/proverbs/4-19.htm">Proverbs 4:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the prophet will stumble with you by night</b><p>Israel&#8217;s trusted religious guides were supposed to shine in the darker hours, yet &#8220;the prophet will stumble with you by night&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/4-5.htm">Hosea 4:5</a>).<p>&#8226; False prophets mirror the people&#8217;s sins (<a href="/jeremiah/14-13.htm">Jeremiah 14:13&#8211;16</a>). As <a href="/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5&#8211;7</a> shows, when seers chase personal gain, God removes vision, leaving them to &#8220;cover their lips&#8221; in shame.<p>&#8226; Nighttime images deeper moral darkness; if leaders collapse there, everyone crashes (<a href="/matthew/15-14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>).<p>&#8226; God holds both flock and shepherds accountable (<a href="/ezekiel/14-10.htm">Ezekiel 14:10</a>). The verse highlights shared guilt and shared judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so I will destroy your mother&#8212;</b><p>The closing dash signals a sobering climax: &#8220;so I will destroy your mother&#8212;&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/4-5.htm">Hosea 4:5</a>). &#8220;Mother&#8221; refers to the nation as a corporate whole (compare <a href="/hosea/2-2.htm">Hosea 2:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/50-1.htm">Isaiah 50:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Judgment is not mere individual hardship; it jeopardizes the very existence of the covenant community (<a href="/hosea/10-14.htm">Hosea 10:14</a>).<p>&#8226; God had pledged blessing for obedience (<a href="/leviticus/26-3.htm">Leviticus 26:3&#8211;13</a>) but also devastation for persistent rebellion (<a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14&#8211;39</a>). Hosea&#8217;s generation faced the latter.<p>&#8226; The warning underscores God&#8217;s holiness: unchecked sin invites real, historical consequences, proving His words unfailingly accurate (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hosea/4-5.htm">Hosea 4:5</a> paints a three-part portrait of judgment: daytime stumbling (spiritual blindness in clear light), nighttime stumbling of prophets (corrupt leadership in deepening darkness), and national ruin (&#8220;mother&#8221; destroyed). The verse affirms that when God&#8217;s truth is ignored, both people and leaders falter, and the entire community suffers the literal consequences God has promised.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) The priest's function is discharged in the day, and the prophet dreams in the night. Both will totter to their fall.<p><span class= "bld">Thy mother--</span><span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, thy nation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - The parallelism of this verse is marked by the peculiarity of dividing between the two members what belongs to the sentence as one whole. Instead of saying that the people would fall (literally, <span class="accented">stumble</span>) in the day, and the prophet with them in the night, the meaning of the sentence, divested of its peculiar form of parallelism, is that people and prophet alike would fall together, at all times, both by day and by night, that is to say, there would be no time free from the coming calamities; and there would be no possibility of escape, either for the sinful people or their unfaithful priests; the darkness of the night would not hide them, the light of the day would not aid them; destruction was the doom of priests and people, inevitable and at all times. <span class="cmt_word">And I will destroy thy mother</span>. Their mother was the whole nation as such - the kingdom of Israel. The expression is somewhat contemptuous, as though he said of the individual members that they were truly their mother's children - resembling her erewhile in sin and soon in sorrow. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Though the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5d4;</span> is seldom used in Qal to denote "likeness," Abarbanel, as quoted by Rosenm&uuml;ller, translates, "I have been like thy mother," and explains of the people addressing priest and prophet as a mother reproving her petulant children in order to improve them. Besides the far-fetched nature of such a rendering, there is the formidable grammatical objection that, in the sense of "similitude," this verb requires to be constructed with <span class="accented">le</span> or el. so that it should be <span class="accented">le immeka</span> or <span class="accented">el immeka</span>. "This word, when derived from <span class="accented">demuth</span>, likewise has el with <span class="accented">seghol</span> after it; but without el, it has the meaning of destroy," is the statement of Aben Ezra. The LXX., assigning to the verb the sense of "similarity," renders the phrase by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "I have compared thy mother to night." <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Jerome, connecting the verb with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5dd;</span> or <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, understands it in the sense of "silence:" "I have made thy mother silent in the night; that is, "Israel is delivered up in the dark night of captivity, sorrow, and overwhelming distress." The Syriac likewise has: "And thy mother has become silent" (if <span class="accented">shathketh</span> be read). The Chaldee, though more periphrastic, brings out nearly the same sense: "I will overspread your assembly with stupefaction." To the same purport is the exposition of Rashi: "My people shall be stupefied as a man who sits and is overwhelmed with stupor, so that no answer is heard from his mouth." The meaning "destroy" is well supported by the cognate Arabic, and gives a good sense; thus Gesenius renders: "I destroy thy mother, that is, lay waste thy country." Rather, the nation, collectively, is the mother; while the members individually are the children. Nor shall private persons escape in the public catastrophe - root and branch are to perish. Kimchi's comment on <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5de;&#x5d9;&#x5d7;&#x5d9;</span> is: "I will cut off the whole congregation, so that no congregation shall remain in Israel; for they shall be scattered in the exile, the one here, the other there." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/4-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You will stumble</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;&#183;&#353;al&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
