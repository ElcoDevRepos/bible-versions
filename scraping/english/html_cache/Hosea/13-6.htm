The imagery of pasture suggests a place of nourishment and rest, reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1-2</a>, where God is depicted as a shepherd leading His people to green pastures. Historically, the land of Canaan was described as "a land flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>), indicating its fertility and the prosperity it could provide. This abundance was a fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs, yet it also presented a spiritual test for the Israelites.<p><b>They became satisfied</b><br>Satisfaction here implies a sense of contentment and fulfillment that comes from having one's needs met. In <a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10-14</a>, God warned the Israelites that when they ate and were satisfied, they should not forget the Lord who brought them out of Egypt. Satisfaction can lead to complacency, where reliance on God diminishes as material needs are met. This satisfaction is not inherently wrong, but it becomes dangerous when it leads to spiritual neglect.<p><b>When they were satisfied, their hearts became proud</b><br>Pride is a recurring theme in the Bible, often associated with a turning away from God. <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a> warns that pride goes before destruction. The Israelites' pride was a result of their satisfaction and abundance, leading them to believe they were self-sufficient. This pride is contrasted with the humility that God desires, as seen in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, where walking humbly with God is emphasized. Pride can blind individuals to their dependence on God, leading to spiritual downfall.<p><b>And as a result they forgot Me</b><br>Forgetting God is a serious spiritual issue, as it indicates a severance of the relationship between God and His people. In <a href="/deuteronomy/6-12.htm">Deuteronomy 6:12</a>, Moses cautioned the Israelites not to forget the Lord who brought them out of slavery. Forgetting God often leads to idolatry and moral decay, as seen throughout the history of Israel. This forgetfulness is not merely a lapse in memory but a deliberate turning away from God's commandments and His covenant. It underscores the importance of continual remembrance and gratitude towards God, as emphasized in the practice of the Passover and other feasts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to in Hosea as Ephraim, which had turned away from God and was facing impending judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure who is addressing Israel through Hosea, expressing His disappointment and the consequences of their actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_complacency.htm">The Danger of Complacency</a></b><br>When we become satisfied with our material or spiritual state, we risk becoming complacent and forgetting our dependence on God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/pride_as_a_spiritual_hazard.htm">Pride as a Spiritual Hazard</a></b><br>Satisfaction can lead to pride, which distances us from God.

The gifts of Divine love concealing the giver.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According to their pasture so were they filled.</span> The literal rendering is, <span class="accented">according to their pasturing so were they filled</span>. The reference is rather to the care in pasturing than to the pasture-ground. By God's care to the sheep of his pasture they waxed full. <span class="cmt_word">They were filled, and their heart was exalted.</span> Two consequences followed from God's great goodness to Israel - the immediate consequence was pride of heart; the more remote was forgetfulness of God. Perhaps these results should rather be regarded as concurrent, being in point of time simultaneous or nearly so. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore have they forgotten me.</span> This forgetfulness of God is identified with the abandonment of his worship in the Chaldee Version, which is, "They have abandoned my service." The metaphor contained in this verse is taken from a domestic animal, which, in a too luxuriant pasture, becomes headstrong and unmanageable. Thus Rash: "As soon as they came into the land of their pasture, they were filled." The last clause of the verse notices the misuse which Israel made of the riches and blessing of Jehovah, by forgetting their gracious Benefactor; this the prophet attributes to the abuse of the blessings so richly bestowed upon them. Aben Ezra identifies the blessings here mentioned with those vouchsafed to them on their entrance into Canaan; thus: "The prophet enumerates the benefits which Jehovah bestowed on their fathers when they came out of the wilderness into the land of Canaan." Kimchi quotes, as a parallel to this passage, <a href="/deuteronomy/8.htm">Deuteronomy 8</a>, of which it is undoubtedly a reminiscence; he says, "When they entered into the place of their pasture, and it was the land of Canaan, they had all good, and were filled; and their heart was exalted, and they forgot me, as it is said in the Thorah that they were ready to do so. He said, 'Lest when thou hast eaten and art full... then thine heart be lifted up, and then forget the Lord thy God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt... who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness... who fed thee in the wilderness.'" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/13-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When they had pasture,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;mar&#183;&#8216;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
