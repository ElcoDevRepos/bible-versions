In the context of Hosea, "these things" refer to the teachings and prophecies delivered throughout the book, which include calls for repentance and warnings of judgment. Wisdom here is not merely intellectual but spiritual, requiring a heart aligned with God's will. The wise are those who fear the Lord and seek His guidance (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p><b>whoever is discerning, let him know them.</b><br>Discernment involves the ability to judge well, especially in spiritual matters. This phrase suggests that understanding God's ways requires more than just knowledge; it requires spiritual insight. The discerning person is one who can perceive the deeper truths of God's message, similar to the Bereans in <a href="/acts/17-11.htm">Acts 17:11</a>, who examined the Scriptures daily to see if what they were taught was true. This discernment is a gift from God, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, where spiritual truths are spiritually discerned.<p><b>For the ways of the LORD are right,</b><br>The "ways of the LORD" refer to His commandments, statutes, and the path of righteousness He sets before His people. These ways are described as "right," indicating their moral and ethical correctness. This aligns with <a href="/psalms/19-8.htm">Psalm 19:8</a>, which states that the precepts of the Lord are right, giving joy to the heart. God's ways are perfect and just, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>, and they reflect His holy nature.<p><b>and the righteous walk in them</b><br>The righteous are those who live in accordance with God's laws and commandments. Walking in God's ways implies a lifestyle of obedience and faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1-3</a>, where the blessed man delights in the law of the Lord and meditates on it day and night. This walking is not merely external compliance but an internal commitment to God's will, reflecting a transformed heart.<p><b>but the rebellious stumble in them.</b><br>The rebellious are those who reject God's ways and choose their own path. Stumbling indicates a failure to follow God's righteous path, leading to spiritual downfall. This is reminiscent of <a href="/proverbs/4-19.htm">Proverbs 4:19</a>, where the way of the wicked is described as deep darkness, causing them to stumble. The rebellious are contrasted with the righteous, highlighting the consequences of disobedience. This serves as a warning, similar to the warnings given to Israel throughout Hosea, where rebellion leads to judgment and separation from God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel during the 8th century BC, Hosea's ministry focused on calling Israel to repentance and warning of impending judgment due to their unfaithfulness to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted in Hosea as unfaithful to God, akin to an adulterous spouse, yet still called to return to the Lord.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, whose ways are described as right and just, calling His people to walk in righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_and_discernment.htm">Wisdom and Discernment</a></b><br>True wisdom involves understanding and applying God's ways.

Hosea has just revealed God&#8217;s call to repentance and His promise of restoration, so wisdom here means embracing God&#8217;s message with a humble heart.<p>&#8226; Wisdom in Scripture always begins with reverence for God (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus echoed this call: &#8220;He who has ears to hear, let him hear&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-15.htm">Matthew 11:15</a>), urging attentive, responsive listening.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, we are told to be doers of the word, not hearers only, underscoring that true wisdom acts on what it learns.<p>The prophet&#8217;s point is simple: the truly wise will pause, reflect, and align their lives with what God has just said.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whoever is discerning, let him know them</b><p>The second phrase (&#8220;whoever is discerning, let him know them&#8221;) tightens the focus from a general search for wisdom to the practice of discernment&#8212;grasping God&#8217;s truth and applying it accurately.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/5-14.htm">Hebrews 5:14</a> describes mature believers as those &#8220;who by constant use have trained their senses to distinguish good from evil,&#8221; showing that discernment grows through repeated obedience.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/25-9.htm">Psalm 25:9</a> promises that the humble will be taught God&#8217;s ways, linking discernment to a teachable spirit.<p>&#8226; Paul prayed for believers to &#8220;approve what is excellent&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/1-10.htm">Philippians 1:10</a>), emphasizing deliberate, thoughtful choice.<p>Hosea urges his hearers: don&#8217;t just perceive God&#8217;s word&#8212;embrace it until it becomes personal conviction and practice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For the ways of the LORD are right</b><p>Now the prophet underlines why wisdom and discernment matter: &#8220;For the ways of the LORD are right.&#8221; God&#8217;s paths are never arbitrary; they are always morally straight, trustworthy, and for our good.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a> proclaims, &#8220;All His ways are justice; a God of faithfulness without injustice.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7&#8211;8</a> declares that God&#8217;s law is perfect, right, and enlightening.<p>&#8226; Jesus confirmed this when He said, &#8220;Your word is truth&#8221; (<a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>).<p>Because God&#8217;s ways are right, they form the unchanging standard against which every human path must be measured.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the righteous walk in them</b><p>This clause describes the natural response of those justified and transformed by God: they choose His pathways.<p>&#8226; <a href="/bsb/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1</a> contrasts the blessed man who delights in God&#8217;s law with the wicked who won&#8217;t stand in judgment.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_john/2-6.htm">1 John 2:6</a> states, &#8220;Whoever claims to abide in Him must walk as Jesus walked,&#8221; tying righteousness to concrete lifestyle.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a> reminds us we are &#8220;created in Christ Jesus for good works&#8221; that God prepared beforehand.<p>For the righteous, obedience is not drudgery but delight, evidence that God&#8217;s Spirit is at work within.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But the rebellious stumble in them</b><p>Finally, Hosea exposes the stark alternative: those who refuse God&#8217;s authority trip over the very standards that would have blessed them.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/13-15.htm">Proverbs 13:15</a> observes, &#8220;The way of the transgressor is hard,&#8221; illustrating the inevitable pain of rebellion.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14&#8211;15</a> pictures the LORD as &#8220;a stone of stumbling&#8221; to those who disobey, the same idea Hosea conveys.<p>&#8226; Jesus warned that whoever falls on the stone will be broken (<a href="/matthew/21-44.htm">Matthew 21:44</a>), showing that rejecting God&#8217;s ways always leads to ruin.<p>Stumbling is not an accident here; it is the consequence of willful resistance to God&#8217;s clear, righteous path.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hosea/14-9.htm">Hosea 14:9</a> is a closing appeal:<p>&#8226; Wisdom listens; discernment embraces.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s ways are always correct, never shifting with culture or preference.<p>&#8226; The righteous prove their relationship with God by walking in His ways, enjoying the safety and blessing found there.<p>&#8226; The rebellious, refusing submission, crash against the same truth that could have rescued them.<p>The verse stands as both a promise and a warning: choose the Lord&#8217;s right paths and live, or resist them and fall.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Who is wise.</span>--Hosea hands his words over to all students of the ways of God. The exhortation to wisdom is expressed in the form of a question. "Wisdom" and "wise men" take in the later Hebrew literature the place of "prophecy" and "prophets." Wisdom interprets both the word and its fulfilment. Christ's own teaching goes beyond wisdom and prudence (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm" title="Come to me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.">Matthew 11:28</a>; comp. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-20.htm" title="Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?">1Corinthians 1:20</a>): it was spirit and life (<a href="/john/6-63.htm" title="It is the spirit that vivifies; the flesh profits nothing: the words that I speak to you, they are spirit, and they are life.">John 6:63</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall far therein.</span> This verse demands attention to all the prophet has written, whether for warning, or reproof, or correction in righteousness, or encouragement to piety and virtue, and evidently alludes to <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>.
