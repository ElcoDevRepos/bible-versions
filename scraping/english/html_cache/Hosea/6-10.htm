The "house of Israel" refers to the Northern Kingdom, which had separated from Judah after Solomon's reign. The term "horrible thing" suggests something detestable and abominable in the eyes of God, often associated with idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness. This echoes the language used in <a href="/jeremiah/5-30.htm">Jeremiah 5:30-31</a>, where similar expressions describe the people's rebellion against God.<p><b>Ephraim practices prostitution there,</b><br>Ephraim, one of the tribes of Israel, often represents the entire Northern Kingdom due to its size and influence. The term "prostitution" is metaphorical, symbolizing spiritual unfaithfulness and idolatry. This imagery is consistent with Hosea's broader theme, where Israel's relationship with God is likened to a marriage, and idolatry is seen as adultery. The practice of idolatry, often involving literal temple prostitution, was prevalent in Canaanite religion, which Israel had adopted, violating the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p><b>and Israel is defiled.</b><br>The defilement of Israel indicates a state of impurity and separation from God. In the Old Testament, defilement often results from contact with idolatry, sin, or anything unclean, rendering one unfit for worship (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-30</a>). This defilement is not just individual but corporate, affecting the entire nation. The prophetic message here is a call to repentance and a return to covenant faithfulness, as seen in the broader context of Hosea's ministry. The defilement also foreshadows the eventual judgment and exile of the Northern Kingdom, as prophesied in <a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6-23</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the 8th century BC, Hosea was called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Northern Kingdom of Israel.

The phrase tells us that the corruption Hosea describes is happening right inside the community that carries His name. Earlier in the book the Lord said, &#8220;Hear this, O priests; pay attention, O house of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/5-1.htm">Hosea 5:1</a>), showing the charge is aimed at leaders and laity alike. Like the warning given centuries before&#8212;&#8220;Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside and serve other gods&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-16.htm">Deuteronomy 11:16</a>)&#8212;the indictment stands as a sober reminder that privilege never guarantees purity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have seen a horrible thing</b><p>The language is God&#8217;s own eyewitness testimony. Jeremiah used similar words: &#8220;An appalling and horrible thing has happened in the land&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/5-30.htm">Jeremiah 5:30</a>). When the Lord calls something &#8220;horrible,&#8221; it is truly dreadful, not merely disappointing. His perfect vision uncovers every hidden sin, so nothing can be excused as misunderstanding or rumor. <a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1</a> declares, &#8220;O LORD, You have searched me and known me,&#8221; underscoring that divine sight reaches motives as well as actions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ephraim practices prostitution there</b><p>Ephraim, the dominant northern tribe, often stands for all ten tribes (<a href="/hosea/5-3.htm">Hosea 5:3</a>; 7:8). The &#8220;prostitution&#8221; is spiritual adultery&#8212;running after idol cults masquerading as religion. Remember <a href="/hosea/4-17.htm">Hosea 4:17</a>: &#8220;Ephraim is joined to idols; leave him alone!&#8221; Idolatry was commonly accompanied by literal temple prostitution (<a href="/2_kings/17-9.htm">2 Kings 17:9&#8211;11</a>), so the picture is both figurative and literal. The people broke covenant love, turning from the God who redeemed them (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2&#8211;3</a>) to gods of their own making.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Israel is defiled</b><p>Defilement in Scripture means ceremonial uncleanness and moral pollution. <a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24&#8211;25</a> warns that such impurity causes even the land to &#8220;vomit out its inhabitants.&#8221; By chasing idols Israel rendered itself unfit for worship or blessing. <a href="/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a> laments, &#8220;She who was once faithful has become a harlot.&#8221; Defilement spreads: leaders sin, families follow, society decays (<a href="/hosea/4-9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>). Yet the Lord&#8217;s holiness remains intact; He must judge sin to keep His people from deeper ruin (<a href="/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hosea/6-10.htm">Hosea 6:10</a> reveals God&#8217;s heartbroken verdict: inside His own nation He sees covenant treachery so vile He calls it prostitution, leaving the whole people defiled. The verse warns that no amount of religious heritage shields us if we abandon exclusive devotion to the Lord. It also highlights God&#8217;s faithfulness; because He sees and names the sin, He also stands ready to cleanse any who return to Him in genuine repentance (<a href="/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1-3</a>; <a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">House of Israel.</span>--This phrase means Ephraim and Judah subsequently discriminated. The "horrible thing" refers to polluting idolatry. This peculiar word occurs again in Jeremiah. According to the punctuation of the Hebrew the reciter hesitates before pronouncing the "horrible thing" which grated through his teeth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.</span> The house of Israel comprises <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the ten tribes of the northern kingdom, according to some; it seems more correct <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to understand it of the whole nation, including both the northern and southern kingdoms, in which case the remainder of the verse relates to the northern kingdom of the ten tribes, and the succeeding verse to the southern kingdom of the two tribes. Further, Israel is not synonymous with the parallel Ephraim, as Keil thinks; the latter is the principal tribe which led the way in Israel's apostasy. The "horrible thing" comprehends every sort of crime and abomination; while the" whoredom," literal or spiritual, is specified as an example thereof.
