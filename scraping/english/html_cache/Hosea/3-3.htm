Hosea, acting under divine instruction, represents God's voice to Israel. The prophet's actions and words are symbolic of God's relationship with His people. Hosea's role as a prophet is to convey God's message, often through personal experiences that mirror Israel's spiritual condition.<p><b>You must live with me for many days</b><br>This command reflects a period of restoration and purification. In the context of ancient Israel, "many days" suggests a significant time of waiting and transformation. It implies a process of renewal and repentance, mirroring Israel's need to return to God after a period of idolatry and unfaithfulness. This period can be seen as a type of probationary phase, where Gomer, representing Israel, is to demonstrate faithfulness.<p><b>you must not be promiscuous</b><br>The prohibition against promiscuity highlights the call to faithfulness and purity. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, promiscuity was often associated with idolatry, as pagan worship included ritualistic sexual practices. This command underscores the need for spiritual fidelity to God, rejecting the worship of other gods and the moral corruption that accompanies it.<p><b>or belong to another</b><br>This phrase emphasizes exclusivity in the relationship, reflecting the covenantal nature of marriage and, by extension, the covenant between God and Israel. Just as Gomer is to belong solely to Hosea, Israel is to belong solely to God. This exclusivity is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God demands undivided loyalty from His people (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p><b>and I will do the same for you</b><br>Hosea's commitment to Gomer mirrors God's unwavering faithfulness to Israel. Despite Israel's unfaithfulness, God promises to remain faithful, offering forgiveness and restoration. This reflects the nature of God's covenant, which is based on His steadfast love and mercy. The mutual commitment also points to the ideal of reciprocal faithfulness in relationships, both human and divine.<br><br>This passage, as a whole, serves as a powerful illustration of God's redemptive love and the call for His people to return to Him with sincerity and devotion. It foreshadows the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who embodies God's love and faithfulness, offering a new covenant to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to marry a promiscuous woman as a symbol of God's relationship with Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gomer.htm">Gomer</a></b><br>Hosea's wife, representing Israel's unfaithfulness to God through idolatry and alliances with other nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often unfaithful to God, symbolized by Gomer's actions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_covenant.htm">God's Covenant</a></b><br>The underlying theme of Hosea's marriage, representing God's enduring commitment to His people despite their unfaithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/restoration.htm">Restoration</a></b><br>The event of Hosea taking Gomer back, symbolizing God's willingness to restore Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_relationships.htm">Faithfulness in Relationships</a></b><br>Hosea's command to Gomer to live with him and not be promiscuous highlights the importance of faithfulness in marriage, reflecting God's desire for a faithful relationship with His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_unfailing_love.htm">God's Unfailing Love</a></b><br>Despite Israel's unfaithfulness, God remains committed to His covenant, just as Hosea remains committed to Gomer.

The "many days" are an indefinite period of amendment, while watchful care was being exercised over her.

So Aben Ezra, Kimchi, and others. That this was only to be a temporary discipline is evident from <a href="/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a> and Hosea 6.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shall not be for another man.</span> The prophet imposes certain restrictions of a very stringent character on his wife; he places her in a state of isolation; her past excesses and his purpose of effecting her reformation necessitate such measures, however strict and severe or even harsh they may appear. She is not to be admitted into full fellowship with her husband, nor is she to be allowed the possibility of intercourse with others. From friend, that is, husband and lovers, she is shut out; all sexual connection, whether illicit or legitimate, is peremptorily cut off. The clause, "thou shalt abide [or, 'sit still'] for me," denotes an attitude of waiting, not necessarily in sorrow, like the captive maiden who before marriage with her captor bewailed her parents for the period of a month, but in patient expectation of her husband's fortune and favor, though in seclusion from him, as also exclusion of all others. During this long period of "many days" she is not only debarred the society of her lawful partner, but forbidden either to play the harlot with several or to attach herself to a single paramour. Jerome directs attention to the fact that the word "another" has no place in the original text; otherwise it would imply that she was prohibited from intercourse with any other than her husband, while the real meaning makes the prohibition absolute and inclusive even of conjugal connection with her husband. <span class="cmt_word">So will I also be for thee</span>. The Hebrew expositors, Aben Ezra and Kimchi, repeat the negative flora the preceding clause and translate, "Nor shall I even come to you," that is, for marital society. This is not necessary to bring out the true sense, which is that, as she was to be restrained from intercourse with any and every other man, so he himself also would abstain from intercourse with her. "<span class="accented">And</span> also I will be for [unto] thee [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. thy husband] to preserve conjugal fidelity to thee, but hold aloof from thee during thy detention." Thus separated from both lovers and husband, Israel would for many a long day suspend her worship of idols, and be at the same time shut out from her covenant relation to Jehovah. Kimchi's comment mounts to pretty much the same, as does also that of Aben Ezra. The explanation of the former is, "I said to her, After thou hast committed adultery against me, thy punishment shall be that thou shalt abide in widowhood of life many days; and the meaning of 'for me' is, thou shalt be called by my name and not by another man's; thou shalt say, I am the wife of such a one, and thou shelf not play the harlot with others, and also thou shalt not be the wife of any other man than myself." Aben Ezra makes mention of another interpretation of the verse, to the effect, "If ye shall return to me, I also will return to you." With this the Chaldee Targum is in accord, which represents God as commanding the prophet to say, "O congregation of Israel, your sins have been the cause of your exile for many days; ye shall devote yourselves to my service, and not go astray nor worship idols, and I also will have compassion upon you." Maurer considers the expression <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span> equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d9;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span>, viz. <span class="accented">remhabere cum muliere</span>; but to this linguistic usage is opposed. Umbreit renders the phrase, "and I will <span class="accented">only</span> be for thee;" this, however, partakes more of the nature of a promise than of a punishment, and is not quite, therefore, in accord with the context. Ewald: "And yet I am kind to thee [<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. love thee];" this is a rather trivial, as also ill-supported idea. Calvin's exposition is pretty much the same as we have given, and is the following: "I also shall be for thee; that is, I pledge my faith to thee, or I subscribe myself as thy husband: but another time must be looked for; I yet defer my favor, and suspend it until thou givest proof of true repentance. I also shall be for thee; that is, thou shalt not be a widow in vain; if thou complainest that wrong is done to thee, because I forbid thee to marry any one else, I also bind myself in turn to thee." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/3-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then I said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1465;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
