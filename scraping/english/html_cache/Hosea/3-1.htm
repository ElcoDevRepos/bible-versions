The LORD's direct instruction to Hosea underscores the authority and authenticity of the message. Prophets often received direct words from God, as seen with Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>) and Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4-5</a>).<p><b>Go show love to your wife again</b><br>Hosea is commanded to demonstrate love to his wife, Gomer, symbolizing God's enduring love for Israel despite their unfaithfulness. This act of love is not merely emotional but involves commitment and action, reflecting the covenantal love God has for His people.<p><b>though she is loved by another and is an adulteress</b><br>Gomer's unfaithfulness represents Israel's spiritual adultery through idolatry. The historical context shows Israel's alliances with foreign nations and gods, paralleling Gomer's infidelity. This mirrors the spiritual adultery condemned in <a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-10</a>.<p><b>Love her as the LORD loves the Israelites</b><br>Hosea's love for Gomer is to mirror God's steadfast love for Israel. This typifies Christ's love for the Church, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25</a>, where Christ's sacrificial love is the model for marital love.<p><b>though they turn to other gods</b><br>Israel's idolatry is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, with the worship of Baal and Asherah being prevalent. This turning away from God is akin to spiritual adultery, as highlighted in <a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15-16</a> and <a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-13</a>.<p><b>and love to offer raisin cakes to idols</b><br>Raisin cakes were likely used in pagan rituals, symbolizing Israel's participation in idolatrous practices.

Such is the love of the Lord towards Israel; but they turn aside to the idols of the nations." The word <span class="accented">mr</span> is in contrast with '<span class="accented">techillath</span>, as the second part of Jehovah's continued discourse. It is erroneously and, contrary to the accents, constructed with "said" by Kimchi and others (Ewald considers it admissible, Umbreit preferable). Kimchi's comment on this verse is: "After the prophet finished his words of consolation, he returns to words of censure, turning to the men of his own time. And it is the custom of the prophets to intermingle reproofs with consolations in their discourses. But he says <span class="accented">yet</span> (again), because he had already commanded him to marry a wife of whoredoms, and now he speaks to him another parable." This time he does not employ the ordinary and usual word "take," but "love." plainly implying that he had already married her, so that her unfaithfulness took place in wedlock; or rather indicating the object of the union. <span class="cmt_word">Beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress</span>. Her friend or companion is <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> her lawful husband, but contemporaneously and continuously with her husband's love to her are her adulteries with others, as is implied by the participles. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5e2;</span>, being indefinite as not having article or suffix, is understood by some to be an acquaintance or lover, and preferred, as a milder term, to <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5d1;</span>. The contrast was realized in Jehovah's love for Israel, notwithstanding their spiritual adultery in worshipping other gods. <span class="cmt_word">According to the love of the Lord toward the children of Israel who look</span> (turn) <span class="cmt_word">to other gods</span>. Two expressions in this clause recall, if they do not actually reflect, the words of two older Scriptures; thus in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-8.htm">Deuteronomy 7:8</a> we read, "Because the Lord loved you;" and in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-18.htm">Deuteronomy 31:18</a>, "They are turned unto ether gods." <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> The LXX. has <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, having probably read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5d4;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;&#x5b6;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">And love flagons of wine</span> (margin, <span class="accented">grapes</span>). The term <span class="accented">ashishe</span>, according to Rashi and Aben Ezra, means "bowls," that is, "bowls of wine" (literally, "of grapes"). They probably connected the word with the root <span class="accented">shesh</span>, six, a sextorius, and hence any other wine-vessel. The Septuagint, however, renders the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "cakes with dried grapes." This meaning is to be preferred, whether we derive the word from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, to press together, or from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, fire; according to the former and correct derivation, the sense being cakes of grapes pressed together; according to the latter, cakes baked with fire. Gesenius differentiates the word from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e7;</span>, dried grapes, but not pressed together into a cake, and from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>, figs pressed together into a cake. These raisin-cakes were regarded as luxuries and used as delicacies; hence a fondness for such indicated a proneness to sensual indulgence, and figuratively the sensuous service belonging to idol-worship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/3-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
