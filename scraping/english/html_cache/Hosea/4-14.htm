In the cultural context of ancient Israel, prostitution was not only a moral failing but also a breach of the covenant with God. However, the emphasis here is on the broader societal failure, particularly the men's role in leading the nation astray. This reflects a divine judgment that focuses on the root cause of the sin rather than the symptoms. The lack of punishment can be seen as a form of divine irony, pointing out the hypocrisy of the men who condemn the women while engaging in similar or worse behaviors themselves.<p><b>nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery</b><br>Adultery was a serious offense under Mosaic Law, punishable by death (<a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>). However, the decision not to punish the daughters-in-law underscores the systemic nature of the sin in Israel. The cultural context suggests that the breakdown of family and societal values was widespread, and the men, who were supposed to be leaders and protectors, were complicit in this moral decay. This phrase serves as a critique of the patriarchal society that failed to uphold God's standards, leading to a collective moral failure.<p><b>For the men themselves go off with prostitutes</b><br>This phrase directly accuses the men of Israel of engaging in the same sins they might condemn in women. It highlights the hypocrisy and double standards prevalent in the society. The men&#8217;s actions are a direct violation of the covenant relationship with God, as they are not only engaging in sexual immorality but also participating in pagan rituals. This behavior reflects a deeper spiritual adultery, as they are unfaithful to God by turning to other deities and practices.<p><b>and offer sacrifices with shrine prostitutes</b><br>The mention of shrine prostitutes indicates the integration of Canaanite religious practices into Israelite worship. These practices were strictly forbidden (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-17.htm">Deuteronomy 23:17-18</a>) and represented a significant departure from the worship of Yahweh. The involvement with shrine prostitutes was not merely a moral failing but a spiritual one, as it involved idolatry and the worship of false gods. This reflects the syncretism that plagued Israel, where the worship of Yahweh was mixed with pagan rituals, leading to spiritual corruption.<p><b>So a people without understanding will come to ruin</b><br>This concluding phrase serves as a prophetic warning. The lack of understanding refers to a failure to know and follow God's law, which is the foundation of wisdom and life (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The ruin mentioned is both a natural consequence of their actions and a divine judgment. The people&#8217;s ignorance and rejection of God&#8217;s ways lead to their downfall, fulfilling the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.

Their own dishonor and disgrace, through the unfaithfulness of persons so near to them, would impress them with a sense of the dishonor done to God, the spiritual Husband of his people; their feeling of pain and shame in consequence would convey to them a clearer notion of the abhorrence which their offences had occasioned to God. But their punishment would become more severe, and their pain intensified by the Divine refusal to avenge them by punishing the lewdness that caused such dishonor. While punishment would prevent the sin and consequent reproach, impunity, or the postponement of punishment, would leave the offenders to go on in their course of sin and shame. Aben Ezra comments on this fourteenth verse as follows: "The sense is - It is not to be wondered at if the daughters commit whoredom; for they themselves, when they go up to the tops of the mountains to burn incense, eat and drink with harlots and commit whoredom - all of them. And, behold, the sense is, not that he shall not punish them at all, but he speaks in regard to, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in comparison with, the fathers; for they teach them to commit whoredom doing according to their works. Perhaps the daughters are still little, therefore I shall not punish." Rashi thinks that this threatening refers to the disuse of the bitter waters of jealousy, so that suspected guilt could not be detected. But there is nothing to intimate such a reference; nor would it be in keeping with the scope of the passage. Again, some, as in the margin of the Authorized Version, read the words, not indicatively, but interrogatively - "Shall I not punish," etc.? This would require such a meaning to be read into the passage as the following: "Assuredly I shall punish them; and not the daughters and daughters-in-law only, but the parents and husbands still more severely, because of their greater criminality." Equally unsatisfactory is the explanation of Theodoret, who, taking <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> in a good sense, which it has with the accusative, understands it of God's refusing any protection or preservation of their daughters and spouses from outrage at the hands of a hostile soldiery, so that such sins as they themselves had been guilty in private, would be committed with the females of their family in public. <span class="cmt_word">For they themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots.</span> The change of person appears to imply that God turns away with inexpressible disgust from such vileness, and, turning aside to a third party, explains the grounds of his procedure. The <span class="accented">Qedesheth</span> were females who devoted themselves to licentiousness in the service of Ashtaroth, the Sidonian Venus. Persons of this description were attached to idol temples and idolatrous worship in heathen lands in ancient times, as in India at the present time. The 'Speaker's Commentary' calls them "devotee-harlots," and cites an allusion to the custom from the Moabite Stone, as follows: "I did not kill the women and maidens, for I devoted them to Ashtar-kemosh." After stating the humiliating fact that fathers and husbands in Israel, instead of uniting with their wives in the worship of Jehovah, separated themselves, going aside with these female idolaters for the purpose of lewdness, and shared in their sacrificial feasts, the prophet, or rather God by the prophet, impatient of the recital of such shameless licentiousness, and indignant at such presumptuous sinning, closes abruptly with the declaration of the recklessness, and denunciation of the ruin of all such offenders, in the words - <span class="cmt_word">the people that doth not understand shall fall</span>; margin, be <span class="accented">punished</span>; rather, <span class="accented">dashed to the ground</span>, or <span class="accented">plunge into ruin</span> (<span class="accented">nilbat</span>). Both Aben Ezra and Kimchi give from the Arabic, as an alternative sense of <span class="accented">silbat</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> fall into error. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/4-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">punish</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1508;&#1456;&#1511;&#1448;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ep&#772;&#183;q&#333;&#183;w&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6485.htm">Strong's 6485: </a> </span><span class="str2">To visit, to oversee, muster, charge, care for, miss, deposit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your daughters</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1461;&#1497;&#1499;&#1462;&#1436;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#234;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural construct &#124;
