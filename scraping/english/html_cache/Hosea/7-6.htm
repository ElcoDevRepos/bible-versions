In biblical times, ovens were used for baking bread, requiring careful preparation and attention. The heart, in Hebrew thought, is the center of will and emotion. This imagery indicates a premeditated and passionate inclination towards wrongdoing. The metaphor of an oven implies hidden, internal processes that eventually manifest outwardly. This reflects the deceitful nature of sin, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>, where the heart is described as deceitful above all things.<p><b>while they lie in wait;</b><br>This phrase indicates a period of anticipation and plotting. The imagery of lying in wait suggests a predatory nature, akin to a hunter or an enemy preparing to ambush. This reflects the treacherous behavior of Israel's leaders and people, who were often involved in conspiracies and betrayal, as seen in the historical accounts of Israel's kings in 2 Kings. The idea of waiting also implies a lack of immediate action, highlighting the patience and cunning involved in their sinful plans.<p><b>all night their anger smolders;</b><br>The night is often associated with secrecy and evil deeds in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>, where people love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil. The smoldering anger suggests a slow-burning, unresolved wrath that festers over time. This can be linked to the internalization of sin and bitterness, which eventually leads to destructive actions. The imagery of smoldering indicates that the anger is not yet visible but is ready to erupt, similar to how unresolved anger can lead to sin, as warned in <a href="/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26-27</a>.<p><b>in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.</b><br>Morning, in contrast to night, often symbolizes revelation and judgment in the Bible. The transition from smoldering to blazing fire indicates the eventual manifestation of hidden sin. This reflects the inevitable consequences of sin, as hidden intentions become visible actions. The blazing fire symbolizes judgment and destruction, reminiscent of God's judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. This serves as a warning of the destructive power of unchecked sin and the certainty of divine judgment, as echoed in <a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26-27</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to in Hosea as Ephraim, which had turned away from God and was engaging in idolatry and political alliances with foreign nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who is addressing the sinful behavior of His people through the prophet Hosea.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oven.htm">The Oven</a></b><br>A metaphor used to describe the intense and consuming nature of the Israelites' sinful passions and deceitful schemes.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/intrigue_and_deceit.htm">Intrigue and Deceit</a></b><br>The sinful actions and conspiracies of the Israelites, particularly their political and spiritual unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_deceptive_heart.htm">The Deceptive Heart</a></b><br>Our hearts can be deceitful, leading us away from God.

The metaphor of <a href="/hosea/7-4.htm" title="They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceases from raising after he has kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.">Hosea 7:4</a> is resumed. The baker, having left his dough to become leavened and his fire to smoulder, can afford to sleep. The baker may mean the evil passion which has been raging. Indeed, Wnsche and Schmoller, by a slight change of punctuation, obtain the rendering "their anger," instead of "their baker," which is supported by the Targum and Syriac version.
