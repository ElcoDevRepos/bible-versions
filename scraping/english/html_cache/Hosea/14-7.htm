In the context of Hosea, Israel is called to repentance and promised renewal. The imagery of "shade" suggests safety and comfort, akin to a tree providing shelter from the harsh sun. Biblically, shade often symbolizes divine protection (<a href="/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>). Historically, Israel's return from exile is a theme of hope, reflecting God's enduring covenant with His people. This return is not just physical but spiritual, indicating a renewed relationship with God.<p><b>they will grow grain and blossom like the vine.</b><br>This imagery of agricultural abundance symbolizes prosperity and blessing. Grain and vines are staples of sustenance and joy in ancient Israel, representing both physical and spiritual nourishment. The vine is a frequent biblical metaphor for Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>), and here it suggests a flourishing and fruitful nation under God's care. The blossoming indicates revival and growth, pointing to a future where Israel thrives in obedience to God.<p><b>His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon.</b><br>Lebanon was famous for its high-quality wine, known for its richness and excellence. This comparison suggests that Israel's restored reputation will be renowned and celebrated, much like the esteemed wine. The mention of Lebanon connects to the broader biblical narrative where Lebanon's cedars and produce are symbols of strength and beauty (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12</a>). This renown is not just national but spiritual, indicating that Israel's transformation will be evident to all, reflecting God's glory and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, whose ministry focused on calling Israel back to faithfulness to God amidst their idolatry and moral decline.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted as unfaithful to God, yet the subject of God's redemptive promises.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/lebanon.htm">Lebanon</a></b><br>A region known for its fertile land and quality produce, symbolizing abundance and prosperity in biblical imagery.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_return.htm">Restoration and Return</a></b><br>God's promise of restoration is central.

Repentance is pictured as stepping out of scorching judgment and into the cool, protective &#8220;shade&#8221; of God&#8217;s presence.<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, shade speaks of refuge: &#8220;He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>). In <a href="/isaiah/4-6.htm">Isaiah 4:6</a> the Lord promises &#8220;a shelter and shade from the heat of the day,&#8221; again tying His covering to renewed fellowship.<p>&#8226; This shade is not temporary. It is &#8220;to dwell,&#8221; implying settled, ongoing safety&#8212;echoing God&#8217;s covenant promise in <a href="/leviticus/26-11.htm">Leviticus 26:11&#8211;12</a> that He will &#8220;walk among you and be your God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Literally, after exile Israel will live securely in the land under Messiah&#8217;s reign (<a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>, <a href="/zechariah/3-10.htm">Zechariah 3:10</a>), but spiritually every believer also finds the same covering in Christ (<a href="/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They will grow grain and blossom like the vine</b><p>&#8220;they will grow grain and blossom like the vine&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Return brings fruitfulness. Grain speaks of daily sustenance; the vine pictures joy and abundance. <a href="/joel/2-24.htm">Joel 2:24&#8211;26</a> shows the barns and vats overflowing when the LORD restores His people.<p>&#8226; The promise is agricultural and literal&#8212;crops once ruined by judgment will flourish (<a href="/amos/9-13.htm">Amos 9:13&#8211;14</a>). Yet the imagery also celebrates spiritual vitality: Jesus said, &#8220;I am the vine; you are the branches&#8230; you will bear much fruit&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Notice the progression: protected in His shade, then productive in His field. <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a> uses the same order&#8212;planted by streams, then yielding fruit in season.<p>&#8226; Restoration is holistic: land healed, people satisfied, worship revived (<a href="/ezekiel/36-29.htm">Ezekiel 36:29&#8211;30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon</b><p>&#8220;His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Lebanon&#8217;s wine was famous for its fragrance and richness. As the nation is renewed, the LORD&#8217;s reputation spreads with equal appeal.<p>&#8226; The verse may point to both Israel&#8217;s fame and, ultimately, Messiah&#8217;s. <a href="/isaiah/62-2.htm">Isaiah 62:2</a> promises, &#8220;You will be called by a new name that the mouth of the LORD will bestow.&#8221; When God lifts His people, the surrounding nations recognize His glory (<a href="/zephaniah/3-19.htm">Zephaniah 3:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; Wine also symbolizes celebration. At Cana, Jesus turned water into &#8220;choice wine&#8221; (<a href="/john/2-10.htm">John 2:10&#8211;11</a>), revealing His glory. Hosea foresees the day when God&#8217;s glory, like fine wine, is savored everywhere.<p>&#8226; Practically, every act of divine restoration becomes a testimony, inviting the world to &#8220;taste and see that the LORD is good&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hosea/14-7.htm">Hosea 14:7</a> promises that repentant Israel will:<p>&#8226; Find lasting shelter under God&#8217;s protective &#8220;shade.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Experience overflowing fruitfulness in every area of life.<p>&#8226; Spread the sweet fame of the LORD far and wide, like celebrated wine.<p>The verse reassures us that God literally keeps covenant promises, turning judgment into joy for all who return to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(</span>7<span class= "note">)</span> It would be more in accordance with the Hebrew idiom to render, <span class= "ital">The dwellers under its shadow shall once more cause the corn to grow.</span> The word translated "scent" (margin, "memorial") should be <span class= "ital">renown.</span> The form of these promises is derived from the external signs of national prosperity.
