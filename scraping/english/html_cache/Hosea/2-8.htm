In the agrarian society of ancient Israel, grain, new wine, and oil were essential for sustenance and prosperity. These gifts symbolize God's blessings and provision, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-13.htm">Deuteronomy 7:13</a>, where God promises to bless the fruit of the land. The lack of acknowledgment reflects a spiritual blindness and ingratitude, reminiscent of <a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a>, where people fail to honor God despite His evident provision.<p><b>who lavished on her silver and gold</b><br>Silver and gold represent wealth and prosperity, which God bestowed upon Israel. These metals were often used in trade and as currency, indicating economic stability and success. The abundance of silver and gold can be linked to the prosperity during the reigns of David and Solomon, as described in <a href="/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14-23</a>. This prosperity was intended to be a blessing, but Israel misused it, forgetting the source of their wealth.<p><b>which they crafted for Baal</b><br>This phrase underscores Israel's idolatry, as they used God's gifts to create idols. Baal was a Canaanite deity associated with fertility and weather, and worshiping him was a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). The crafting of silver and gold into idols is reminiscent of the golden calf incident in <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>, where the Israelites turned away from God to worship a man-made image.

Here we have an account of her ignorance of, and ingratitude to, the true and or of her mercies, together with her sinful misuse and sad abuse of those mercies. The products of the earth which God bestowed on her were corn and wine and oil - all that was needed for food, refreshment, and even luxury; the prosperity in trade or commerce with which he favored her resulted in the multiplied increase of silver and gold. The perversion of these blessings consisted in her employment of them in the service of Baal or of idolatry in general. The sin of refusing to acknowledge the Author of such manifold mercies was grievously augmented by this gross abuse of them. The last clause is a relative one, <span class="accented">asher</span>, as frequently being understood; while the words <span class="accented">asu labbaal</span> do not signify that they made those metals into images of Baal, as implied in the Authorized Version; nor vet that they offered them to Baal according to Gesenius; but that they prepared or employed them in the worship of that idol and the service of idolatry in general. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5df;</span> <span class="accented">rad</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5d2;&#x5d4;</span>, to cover, multiply, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. multitude and plenty covering ever everything; comp. <span class="accented">tego</span>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b6;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> <span class="accented">rad</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, take possession of the brain in intoxicating: <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e6;&#x5d4;&#x5e8;</span>, <span class="accented">rad</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d4;&#x5e8;</span>, to shine.
