The "great things" refer to the comprehensive and profound nature of the Mosaic Law, which includes moral, ceremonial, and civil instructions. The law was given to guide Israel in holiness and to set them apart as God's chosen people (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The law is not just a set of rules but a revelation of God's character and His expectations for His people. The giving of the law at Mount Sinai was a pivotal moment in Israel's history, marking them as a nation under God&#8217;s rule. This phrase also underscores the privilege Israel had in receiving divine revelation, a privilege not extended to other nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-7.htm">Deuteronomy 4:7-8</a>).<p><b>they regarded them as something strange</b><br>This part of the verse highlights Israel's failure to appreciate and adhere to God's law. Despite the clarity and importance of the law, the Israelites treated it as foreign or irrelevant. This reflects a spiritual decline and a turning away from God, which is a recurring theme in the prophetic books. The term "strange" suggests that the people had become so distant from God's commands that they no longer recognized them as their own. This estrangement can be linked to their idolatry and assimilation of pagan practices, which led them away from the covenant (<a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>). The prophets often rebuked Israel for their unfaithfulness and called them to repentance. This disregard for the law foreshadows the coming judgment and exile, as the people failed to live up to their covenantal responsibilities. The New Testament echoes this theme, where Jesus criticizes the religious leaders for their legalism and failure to understand the heart of the law (<a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel during the 8th century BC, Hosea's ministry focused on calling Israel back to faithfulness to God amidst widespread idolatry and moral decay.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to as Ephraim in Hosea, which had turned away from God, embracing idolatry and foreign alliances.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_law.htm">God's Law</a></b><br>Refers to the Torah, the divine instructions given to Israel, which were meant to guide them in righteousness and covenantal faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_god's_law.htm">The Value of God's Law</a></b><br>God's law is a treasure meant to guide and bless His people.

God Himself is the Author: &#8220;He gave Moses two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone written by the finger of God&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;wrote&#8221; underscores permanence; His Word is not a passing opinion but an enduring covenant (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-24.htm">Deuteronomy 31:24-26</a>).<p>&#8226; Writing &#8220;for them&#8221; reveals personal care&#8212;Scripture is tailored to bless, guide, and protect His covenant people (<a href="/psalms/147-19.htm">Psalm 147:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226;
