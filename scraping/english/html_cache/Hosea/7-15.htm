In the historical context, God had repeatedly delivered Israel from their enemies, equipping them with the strength and skills necessary for survival and victory. This can be seen in the numerous battles where God intervened on behalf of Israel, such as the victories under Joshua and the judges. The imagery of "arms" symbolizes military power and might, which God had granted to His people. This reflects God's covenant faithfulness, as He promised to be their God and protector. The training and strengthening can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual guidance and empowerment, as God provided the Law and the prophets to guide Israel in righteousness.<p><b>they plot evil against Me</b><br>Despite God's provision and protection, Israel's response was one of rebellion and ingratitude. The phrase "plot evil" indicates a deliberate and conscious decision to act against God. This reflects the spiritual adultery and idolatry that characterized Israel during Hosea's time. The historical context includes Israel's alliances with foreign nations and their worship of other gods, which were direct violations of their covenant with Yahweh. This rebellion is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where Israel's unfaithfulness is often compared to marital infidelity. The plotting of evil against God can also be seen as a type of the rejection of Christ, as the New Testament reveals the ultimate fulfillment of God's covenant in Jesus, whom many rejected despite His teachings and miracles. This phrase serves as a warning of the consequences of turning away from God's provision and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to as Ephraim in Hosea, which was experiencing moral and spiritual decline.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who is expressing His disappointment and judgment over Israel's unfaithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/evil_plotting.htm">Evil Plotting</a></b><br>The actions of Israel, who despite receiving strength and training from God, choose to rebel against Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_human_rebellion.htm">God's Provision and Human Rebellion</a></b><br>Despite God's continuous provision and empowerment, humans often choose to rebel.

God lovingly trained Israel and endowed them with strength, yet they used those very gifts to undermine Him.

Here we have another instance of God's goodness and Israel's ingratitude. He had done much for them, and would fain have done more; and yet the return they made was devising mischief against him. The arms are the seat and symbol of strength, as the hands and fingers symbolize skill; thus, in reference to the latter the psalmist says, "Blessed be the Lord my Strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight;" and with regard to the former he says, "He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms." Two benefits are here included in the prophet's enumeration. He instructed the arms, by which is meant that he showed them how and where to get strength. But this was not all; he not only directed to the source, and taught the secret of acquiring strength, he actually supplied strength, thereby giving them power to contend against and conquer their enemies. At a time when "there was not any shut up, nor any left [that is, 'neither bond nor free'] nor helper for Israel... the Lord... saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash." Notwithstanding all this, they <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> acted the part of apostates and rebels against him: they devised mischief against him by their idolatry which denied him the Godhead glory which was his due, and by their rebellion which aimed at depriving him of his kingly power and dignity. The reference of the last clause, <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> according to Ewald, is to the treaties which Israel entered into with Assyria and Egypt for safety and defense; and <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> according to Kimchi, to Israel's false representations of the government and providence of Jehovah: "For they say the good or evil does not come to them from me, but is purely accidental."
