This phrase reflects the biblical principle that increased blessings can lead to increased temptation and sin if not accompanied by gratitude and obedience to God. In <a href="/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11-14</a>, God warns Israel not to forget Him when they prosper. The multiplication of the people was a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>), yet it also brought challenges in maintaining faithfulness.<p><b>the more they sinned against Me</b><br>Despite God's blessings, Israel's response was increased sinfulness. This highlights the human tendency to turn away from God when life becomes comfortable. The sins of Israel included idolatry, injustice, and immorality, as detailed throughout the book of Hosea. This pattern of sin is reminiscent of the cycle seen in the Book of Judges, where Israel repeatedly falls into sin, faces consequences, repents, and is delivered, only to sin again.<p><b>they exchanged their Glory</b><br>The term "Glory" here refers to God Himself, who is the true source of Israel's honor and strength. By turning away from God, Israel exchanged the divine presence and favor for worthless idols. This echoes the warning in <a href="/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11</a>, where God laments that His people have exchanged their glory for what does not profit. The concept of exchanging God's glory for something lesser is a recurring theme in Scripture, illustrating the folly of idolatry.<p><b>for a thing of disgrace</b><br>The "thing of disgrace" refers to the idols and false gods that Israel pursued. These idols, often associated with the Canaanite religion, were not only powerless but also led to practices that were morally and spiritually degrading. The disgrace is not only in the act of idolatry itself but also in the consequences it brought upon the nation, such as moral corruption and eventual judgment. This exchange is a stark contrast to the call in <a href="/romans/1-23.htm">Romans 1:23</a>, where humanity is described as exchanging the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and creatures, leading to a downward spiral of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and hope.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often referred to in Hosea as Ephraim, which had turned away from God and engaged in idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure who is addressing the sins of Israel through the prophet Hosea.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry.htm">Idolatry</a></b><br>The act of worshiping idols or false gods, which was prevalent in Israel during Hosea's time.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/multiplication_of_people.htm">Multiplication of People</a></b><br>Refers to the growth and prosperity of the nation, which unfortunately led to increased sinfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_prosperity_without_god.htm">The Danger of Prosperity Without God</a></b><br>Prosperity can lead to complacency and sin if not grounded in a relationship with God.

These eat up, or fatten on, the very sins they ought to rebuke. The reference here may be either to the portion of sacrificial offerings which fell to the share of the priests, or (less probably) to the sin-money and trespass-money exacted in place of sin-offerings of <a href="/2_kings/12-16.htm" title="The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the LORD: it was the priests'.">2Kings 12:16</a>. (On the general condition of the priesthood at this time, see W. R. Smith, <span class= "ital">Prophets of Israel</span> pp. 99-101.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As they were increased</span>; rather, <span class="accented">multiplied</span>. Whether <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5bb;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> be taken as infinitive with suffix and prefix, or as a noun, it will amount to the same. The reference is rather to the multitude of the population than to the greatness of their prosperity or the abundance of their wealth. In the latter sense it is understood by the Chaldee paraphrase, but in the former by the Syriac translator. So also Kimchi, where he says, "As for Aaron the priest their father, the Law of truth was in his mouth; but now that his sons have multiplied and spread abroad, they have sinned against me and forgotten my law; according as I did them good they did evil." He also gives as the explanation of others, "As I increased them in wealth and riches, they sinned against me." <span class="cmt_word">Their glory will I change into shame.</span> The "therefore" of the Authorized Version is inserted unnecessarily. Both the Chaldee and Syriac render, "And they changed their glory into shame;" as they took <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> for the infinitive <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>, and that in the sense of the preterit; or the infinitive in the gerundival sense: "changing their glory into shame." Kimchi explains the meaning correctly: "Therefore I made them beads over the people and expiators, yet if they do not observe my Law I will change their glory into shame; and the people will contemn and despise them." Their numbers multiplied with the multiplication of idols, and the apostasy of the people kept pace with both; and now as a fit punishment they are to be deprived of their priestly glory - their dignity and splendor. <span class="cmt_word">They eat up the sin of my people.</span> The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d8;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5d4;</span> may be understood in either of two senses; and the meaning of the verse will correspond thereto. It may either mean that these faithless priests lived upon the sin of the people, deriving their livelihood and profit from the people's idolatrous practices; or that they were delighted with their sin, approving rather than reproving them for the same. The other explanation understands the word of sin offering, and is thus expressed by Kimchi: "They are only priests for eating up the sin and trespass offering which the people offer on account of sins, not for teaching the Law or right way." <span class="cmt_word">To their iniquity they lift</span> <span class="cmt_word">up</span> (each one) <span class="cmt_word">his soul</span>. They set their heart upon and eagerly desire the continued practice of sin on the part of the people that they may profit by the sacrifices. Thus Kimchi explains this clause in accordance with his exposition of the former: "The priests lift up every one his soul to the sin of the people, saying, When will they sin, and bring sin offering and trespass offering that we may eat?" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/4-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The more they multiplied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1467;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;rub&#183;b&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
