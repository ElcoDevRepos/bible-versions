The phrase indicates the inevitability of divine judgment due to persistent sin and idolatry. The concept of bearing guilt is rooted in the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where disobedience leads to consequences (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>). This reflects the principle of reaping what one sows (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p><b>because she has rebelled against her God</b><br>Rebellion against God in the context of Hosea involves idolatry and breaking the covenant. The Israelites turned to Baal worship and alliances with foreign nations, forsaking their unique relationship with Yahweh. This rebellion is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, highlighting the spiritual adultery of Israel (<a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12-13</a>).<p><b>They will fall by the sword</b><br>This phrase predicts the violent destruction that will come upon Samaria as a result of their rebellion. Historically, this was fulfilled when the Assyrians conquered Samaria in 722 BC. The sword is often a symbol of war and divine judgment throughout the Bible (<a href="/jeremiah/25-29.htm">Jeremiah 25:29</a>).<p><b>their little ones will be dashed to pieces</b><br>This graphic imagery underscores the severity of the coming judgment. It reflects the brutal realities of ancient warfare, where even the most vulnerable were not spared. Such acts were common in ancient Near Eastern conquests and serve as a stark warning of the consequences of sin (<a href="/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a>).<p><b>and their pregnant women ripped open</b><br>This phrase further emphasizes the totality of the destruction and the depth of the judgment. It is a hyperbolic expression of the horrors of war, intended to shock the audience into realizing the seriousness of their rebellion. This imagery is also found in other prophetic warnings (<a href="/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13</a>), illustrating the complete devastation that accompanies divine judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, representing the entire nation in this context.

In the latter sense it is from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5dd;</span>, to atone or suffer the punishment of contracted guilt; in the former sense it is from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5dd;</span>, and it is translated accordingly by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;</span> in the LXX., and <span class="accented">pereat</span> by Jerome; so also Aben Ezra: "It shall be laid waste;" Kimchi: "The <span class="accented">aleph</span> has <span class="accented">seh'wa</span> alone, and the signification 'desolation,' and so the dwellers therein shall be made desolate." He thus intimates that <span class="accented">aleph</span>, having <span class="accented">sch'aa</span> alone without seghol, does not belong to the root, which is not <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5dd;</span> (for its future would be <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5dd;</span>), but <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>. Rashi, however, understands it in the sense of "atone," or "find out her guiltiness;" he says, "From now will her guilt manifest itself." The reason of Samaria being thus mentioned is not only that it was the capital of the northern kingdom, but, as Kimchi says, "it confirmed Israel in the worship of the calves; for if the kings had been good, they would have brought back Israel to what was good." The <span class="accented">ki</span> assigns the reason of Samaria's desolation or guilt; it was rebellion against Jehovah, for Samaria was the seat and center of idolatry, and hence it spread throughout the land. <span class="cmt_word">They shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.</span> The destruction thus described was to be complete. The present population would perish by the sword; the future progeny would be extinguished and all posterity cut off. Not only the children already born, but those unborn, were devoted to destruction; and all this in the most savage and barbarous manner. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5dc;&#x5dc;</span>, to meddle, gratify one's self, indulge one's caprice) presents childhood on the side of playfulness or petulance. The pronominal suffix attached to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;</span> refers to the city; and the feminine noun itself, forming subject to verbs in the masculine, arises from the fact that the feminine of the imperfect plural becomes rarer; or because the feminine plural only gradually distinguishes itself by a peculiar form from the masculine. The cruelties here specified may have been occasioned by those of the same kind with which Menahem King of Samaria smote Tiphsah. On that occasion "all the women therein that were with child he ripped up" (compare, for the cruel practice, 'Iliad,' 6:58; ,<a href="/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12</a> and 2 Kings 15:16). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/13-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Samaria</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1469;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8111.htm">Strong's 8111: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samaria -- capital of northern kingdom of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will bear her guilt</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1488;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(te&#8217;&#183;&#353;am)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_816.htm">Strong's 816: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be guilty, to be punished, perish</span><br /><br /><span class="word">because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">she has rebelled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4784.htm">Strong's 4784: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be contentious or rebellious</span><br /><br /><span class="word">against her God.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1469;&#1488;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1462;&#1425;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;l&#333;&#183;he&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
