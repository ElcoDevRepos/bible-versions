Historically, Judah was the southern kingdom, distinct from the northern kingdom of Israel. God's compassion here is a reminder of His covenant faithfulness, as seen in His promises to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>). This compassion is not based on Judah's merit but on God's character, aligning with themes in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where God is described as merciful and gracious.<p><b>and I will save them</b><br>The promise of salvation for Judah points to God's sovereign ability to deliver His people. This salvation is not merely physical but also spiritual, foreshadowing the ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ. In the historical context, this could refer to events like the miraculous deliverance of Jerusalem from the Assyrian army during Hezekiah's reign (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35-36</a>).<p><b>not by bow or sword or war</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that Judah's deliverance will not come through conventional military means. It reflects the biblical theme that true victory comes from reliance on God rather than human strength, as seen in <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, "Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God."<p><b>not by horses and cavalry</b><br>Horses and cavalry were symbols of military power in the ancient Near East. By stating that salvation will not come through these means, the text underscores the futility of relying on human power. This echoes <a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>, where Israel's kings are warned against amassing horses, symbolizing trust in military might over divine provision.<p><b>but by the LORD their God</b><br>The deliverance of Judah is attributed solely to the LORD, highlighting His role as the ultimate savior. This phrase points to God's direct intervention in history, as seen in the deliverance narratives throughout the Old Testament. It also prefigures the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as the Savior, who brings salvation not through force but through His sacrificial love (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver His messages to the people, often using his own life as a symbolic representation of God's relationship with Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_judah.htm">House of Judah</a></b><br>The Southern Kingdom of Israel, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, which remained after the division of the united monarchy.

The prophetic outlook anticipates the fact that when Judah is captive and exiled, her restoration by the divine hand would take the form of mercy and forgiveness. (Comp. Psalms 76, <a href="/context/isaiah/40-1.htm" title="Comfort you, comfort you my people, said your God.">Isaiah 40:1-2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/hosea/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the Lord their God.</span> Thus the contrast expressed in this verse increases the painful feelings with which the threatened abandonment and consequent destruction of Israel would be regarded. The promised mercy to the house of Judah is emphasized by the peculiar form of the expression. Instead of the pronoun, the proper name of Jehovah is employed; instead of saying, "I will save them by myself," he says in a specially emphatic manner, "I will save them by <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>," adding at the same time the important adjunct of "thy God," to remind them of that relationship to himself in virtue of which he interposes thus personally and powerfully on their behalf. An expression somewhat similar in form occurs in <a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>, "Then the Lord [Jehovah] rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord [Jehovah] out of heaven." <span class="cmt_word">And will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle</span> (literally, war), <span class="cmt_word">by horses, nor by horsemen</span>. This enumeration is quite in accordance with the prophet's style, as may be seen at a glance by comparing <a href="/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5, 11, 22</a>; <a href="/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>; and Hosea 4:13. The manner of this deliverance is very peculiar and unusual; while prominence is given to the absence of those means of defense or deliverance on which the northern kingdom so much relied. The deliverance would be accomplished without the ordinary weapons of war - bow and sword, in the use of the former of which Israel was so celebrated; also without war, that is, without its appliances and <span class="accented">material</span> of whatever kind - skilful commanders, brave soldiers, and numerous troops; likewise without horses and horsemen, a great source of strength in those days (<span class="accented">parashim</span>, equivalent to "riders on horses," as distinguished from <span class="accented">rokebhim</span>, riders on camels). This deliverance, in fact, was to be entirely independent of all human resources. All this points plainly and positively to the deliverance of Judah from Sennacherib in the days of Hezekiah, when in one night the angel of the Lord smote a hundred and eighty-five thousand of the flower of the Assyrian host, and Jehovah thus by himself delivered Judah. Thus, too, Judah is saved from that power before which Israel had previously and entirely succumbed. (Compare, on this miraculous deliverance, <a href="/2_kings/19.htm">2 Kings 19</a>. and <a href="/isaiah/37.htm">Isaiah 37</a>.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/1-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Yet</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
