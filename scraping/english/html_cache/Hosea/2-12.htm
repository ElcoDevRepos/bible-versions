The destruction of these plants signifies the removal of Israel's blessings due to their unfaithfulness. This imagery is consistent with the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>, where disobedience leads to agricultural devastation. The vine and fig tree also represent security and abundance, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/4-25.htm">1 Kings 4:25</a>, where every man lived safely under his vine and fig tree during Solomon's reign. The destruction here is a direct consequence of Israel's idolatry and reliance on foreign alliances rather than God.<p><b>which she thinks are the wages paid by her lovers</b><br>Israel's "lovers" refer to the foreign nations and false gods they pursued, believing these alliances and idols provided their prosperity. This reflects a misunderstanding of the source of their blessings, which were actually from God. The term "wages" suggests a transactional relationship, highlighting Israel's spiritual adultery. This mirrors the theme in <a href="/ezekiel/16-33.htm">Ezekiel 16:33</a>, where Israel is depicted as an unfaithful wife who pays her lovers instead of being paid. The false security in these alliances is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, emphasizing the futility of trusting in anything other than God.<p><b>So I will make them into a thicket</b><br>The transformation of cultivated land into a thicket symbolizes neglect and desolation. This imagery is used in <a href="/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a>, where God allows a vineyard to become overgrown as a judgment. A thicket implies a return to wilderness, a reversal of the order and care God provided. This serves as a metaphor for the spiritual state of Israel, which has become wild and untamed due to their abandonment of God. The thicket also represents the chaos and disorder that result from sin and disobedience.<p><b>and the beasts of the field will devour them</b><br>The presence of wild beasts indicates a land left unprotected and abandoned, a common consequence of divine judgment as seen in <a href="/leviticus/26-22.htm">Leviticus 26:22</a>. This reflects the removal of God's protective hand over Israel, allowing natural consequences to follow. The devouring of the land by beasts is a vivid picture of destruction and loss, emphasizing the severity of Israel's punishment. It also serves as a warning of the dangers of spiritual infidelity, where the absence of God's presence leads to vulnerability and ruin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hosea.htm">Hosea</a></b><br>A prophet in the Northern Kingdom of Israel, called by God to deliver messages of judgment and redemption.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often depicted as an unfaithful wife in Hosea's prophecies, symbolizing the nation's spiritual adultery.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/vines_and_fig_trees.htm">Vines and Fig Trees</a></b><br>Symbols of prosperity and blessing in ancient Israel, representing the nation's material wealth and security.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prostitution.htm">Prostitution</a></b><br>Used metaphorically to describe Israel's idolatry and unfaithfulness to God, pursuing other gods and alliances.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/beasts_of_the_field.htm">Beasts of the Field</a></b><br>Representing destruction and desolation, often used in prophetic literature to signify judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_adultery_and_idolatry.htm">Spiritual Adultery and Idolatry</a></b><br>Just as Israel was unfaithful to God by pursuing other deities, we must examine our own lives for modern forms of idolatry, such as materialism or misplaced priorities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_unfaithfulness.htm">Consequences of Unfaithfulness</a></b><br>The destruction of vines and fig trees serves as a warning that turning away from God leads to loss and desolation.

By vowing to &#8220;destroy&#8221; them, the Lord signals the removal of every visible sign of blessing, just as He warned in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38-40</a>.<p>&#8211; The language is personal: &#8220;her&#8221; vines and figs. The nation assumed these gifts were secure, but the Giver Himself now claims the right to take them away (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>).<p>&#8211; This judgment mirrors <a href="/joel/1-7.htm">Joel 1:7</a>, where a foreign army &#8220;has laid waste My vine and barked My fig tree.&#8221; What God once planted for delight becomes evidence that covenant disobedience carries real-world consequences.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which she thinks are the wages paid by her lovers</b><p>&#8211; Israel misread prosperity as payment from idols and alliances, not as grace from God. Hosea had already said, &#8220;For she said, &#8216;I will go after my lovers&#8230;&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5</a>).<p>&#8211; Cross references sharpen the point: <a href="/hosea/9-1.htm">Hosea 9:1</a> warns, &#8220;For you have been unfaithful, forsaking your God. You love the wages of a prostitute.&#8221; <a href="/ezekiel/16-31.htm">Ezekiel 16:31-34</a> describes the same delusion&#8212;running after others yet paying them for the privilege.<p>&#8211; The Lord exposes this false economy. What looked like reward was actually spiritual bondage; what seemed earned was always unmerited favor from Him alone (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So I will make them into a thicket</b><p>&#8211; The fruitful landscape will turn into an impenetrable mass of briars. <a href="/isaiah/5-6.htm">Isaiah 5:6</a> pictures a similar reversal when God removes His hedge: &#8220;It will be a wasteland&#8230; briers and thorns will grow up.&#8221;<p>&#8211; A thicket signals abandonment. No pruning, no harvesting, no labor&#8212;only neglect. This fulfills the covenant curse of <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>, &#8220;Your land will become a desolation,&#8221; underscoring that sin deserts everything it touches.<p>&#8211; The shift from tended garden to wild scrub also foreshadows the exile, when Israel would lose control of the land promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the beasts of the field will devour them</b><p>&#8211; Once the vines become wild, &#8220;the beasts of the field&#8221; find easy access. Wild animals overrunning farmland is a trademark of divine discipline (<a href="/leviticus/26-22.htm">Leviticus 26:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-24.htm">Deuteronomy 32:24</a>).<p>&#8211; <a href="/jeremiah/5-6.htm">Jeremiah 5:6</a> links moral waywardness with predatory invasion: &#8220;A lion from the forest shall strike them down&#8230; because their transgressions are many.&#8221;<p>&#8211; The picture is total loss: no human protection, no harvestable crop, only animals feeding on what was meant for covenant people. The lesson resonates with Jesus&#8217; warning that treasures laid up apart from God are vulnerable to &#8220;moth and rust&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/hosea/2-12.htm">Hosea 2:12</a> paints a sobering portrait of divine justice. Israel&#8217;s vines and figs&#8212;symbols of God-given prosperity&#8212;will be ruined because the nation credited idols and foreign lovers for its abundance. The Lord vows to turn their gardens into thorny wastelands, exposing self-sufficiency and letting wild beasts consume what remains. The verse teaches that every blessing is God&#8217;s gift, that misplaced trust forfeits those gifts, and that only faithful reliance on the Lord preserves true fruitfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/hosea/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Destroy.</span>--For this read, with margin, <span class= "ital">make desolate.</span> The vine and fig tree are employed as the symbol of possession and peace (<a href="/1_kings/4-25.htm" title="And Judah and Israel dwelled safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.">1Kings 4:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/36-16.htm" title="Listen not to Hezekiah: for thus said the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat you every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink you every one the waters of his own cistern;">Isaiah 36:16</a>, &c.).

The vine and fig tree are usually conjoined, and by a common synecdoche convey the idea of all those sources that combine to support life and supply its luxuries. When the united kingdom of Judah and Israel, before the disruption, had obtained the zenith of prosperity in the reign of Solomon, it is thus expressed: Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon." Yet Israel knew not the time of her merciful visitation, and not only turned aside to idols, but most stupidly and most inexcusably attributed the many mercies she enjoyed to the idols which she worshipped. Like a foul adulteress despising the tokens of her husband's affection and delighting in the rewards of lewdness received from licentious paramours, Israel forfeited all her privileges, and forced the Lord to withdraw his bounties and destroy their very source. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5df;</span> <span class="accented">rad</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5e4;&#x5df;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5df;</span>, to be bent, from the arch made by its drooping boughs, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b0;&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, <span class="accented">rad</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5d0;&#x5df;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5df;</span>, to extend from its length. <span class="cmt_word">And I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.</span> The places where fig trees flourished and vines abounded shall be stripped of those trees, with their pleasant fruits - shall become a forest.

The explanation of the verse is well given by Kimchi in his commentary: "Because she said, 'These are the hire of my harlotry;' because she said that from the hand of her lovers came the corn and must and oil and all good things; - I will make them a desolation, that she may know whether she had those good things from me or from them. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>, because he has compared her to a harlot, he calls those good things <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>, equivalent to <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5d9;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span>; while their signification is identical with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;</span>, and their root, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span> [extend, reach, give], the aleph being prosthetic. But Jonathan renders <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5e0;&#x5d4;</span> by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, precious things. And he mentions the vine and the fig tree because grapes and figs are the best part of the food of man after the produce of the earth (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. corn); and already he had said, 'I will also take away my corn in its season.'" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/hosea/2-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will destroy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;ha&#774;&#183;&#353;im&#183;m&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
