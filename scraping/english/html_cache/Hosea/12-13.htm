The reference here is to Moses, who is considered one of the greatest prophets in Israel's history. Moses was instrumental in leading the Israelites out of Egypt, acting as God's mouthpiece. Prophets in the Old Testament often served as intermediaries between God and His people, providing guidance, warnings, and revelations. This highlights the importance of prophetic leadership in God's plan for His people.<p><b>the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt</b><br>This phrase refers to the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history where God delivered the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. The Exodus is a central theme throughout the Bible, symbolizing salvation and deliverance. It is a demonstration of God's power and faithfulness to His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The event is commemorated annually in the Jewish festival of Passover. Theologically, the Exodus prefigures the ultimate deliverance from sin through Jesus Christ, who is seen as the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>and by a prophet he was preserved</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes the role of the prophet in sustaining and guiding the people after their deliverance. Moses not only led the Israelites out of Egypt but also guided them through the wilderness, providing them with God's laws and instructions. The preservation of Israel through the wilderness journey is a testament to God's ongoing provision and care. It also underscores the importance of obedience to God's word as delivered through His prophets. This preservation can be seen as a type of Christ, who preserves and sustains His followers through His teachings and the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet.htm">Prophet</a></b><br>Refers to Moses, who was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt.
