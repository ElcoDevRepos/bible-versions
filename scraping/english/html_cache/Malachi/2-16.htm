In the cultural context of ancient Israel, marriage was a covenant not only between two individuals but also before God. Divorce was permitted under Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/24.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1-4</a>) but was not part of God's original design for marriage (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>). The strong language here underscores the seriousness with which God views the breaking of this covenant.<p><b>says the LORD, the God of Israel.</b><br>This designation emphasizes God's authority and His covenant relationship with Israel. It reminds the audience that these are not merely human opinions but divine declarations. The use of "the God of Israel" reinforces the idea that God is speaking to His chosen people, who are expected to uphold His standards.<p><b>He who divorces his wife covers his garment with violence,</b><br>The imagery of covering one's garment with violence suggests that divorce is not a neutral act but one that brings harm and injustice. In ancient Near Eastern culture, garments often symbolized one's status and identity. This metaphor indicates that divorce stains one's character and reputation. The phrase may also imply that divorce leads to social and familial chaos, akin to violence.<p><b>says the LORD of Hosts.</b><br>This title for God, "LORD of Hosts," highlights His supreme power and command over the heavenly armies. It serves as a reminder of God's ultimate authority and the seriousness of His pronouncements. The use of this title underscores the weight of the message and the expectation of obedience.<p><b>So guard yourselves in your spirit</b><br>This admonition calls for self-examination and vigilance. It suggests that the root of marital unfaithfulness begins in the heart and spirit. The call to guard oneself implies a proactive stance against sin and a commitment to uphold one's covenantal promises.<p><b>and do not break faith.</b><br>Breaking faith refers to the violation of trust and covenant, both with one's spouse and with God. In the broader biblical context, faithfulness is a key attribute of God's character (<a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>) and is expected of His people. This command serves as a reminder of the importance of integrity and fidelity in all relationships, reflecting God's own faithfulness to His covenant with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/malachi.htm">Malachi</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament, Malachi delivered God's messages to the Israelites, focusing on their spiritual and moral failures.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord,_the_god_of_israel.htm">The LORD, the God of Israel</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who expresses His disdain for divorce and injustice.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The original audience of Malachi's prophecy, who were struggling with faithfulness in their relationships and covenant with God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>A title emphasizing God's sovereignty and command over the heavenly armies, underscoring His authority in the matter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/divorce.htm">Divorce</a></b><br>The act of dissolving a marriage, which God explicitly states He hates, highlighting the importance of faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_view_on_marriage.htm">God's View on Marriage</a></b><br>Marriage is a sacred covenant designed by God, and He desires it to be a lifelong commitment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_impact_of_divorce.htm">The Impact of Divorce</a></b><br>Divorce not only affects the individuals involved but also disrupts the social and spiritual fabric of the community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_the_spirit.htm">Guarding the Spirit</a></b><br>Believers are called to protect their hearts and minds, ensuring they remain faithful to their commitments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/injustice_and_faithfulness.htm">Injustice and Faithfulness</a></b><br>God equates divorce with injustice, highlighting the moral and ethical dimensions of breaking faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflecting_christ's_love.htm">Reflecting Christ's Love</a></b><br>Marriages should mirror the love and faithfulness of Christ to the Church, serving as a testimony to the world.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Malachi_2_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Malachi 2:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Malachi_2_16_on_divorce_faithfulness.htm">How does Malachi 2:16 emphasize God's view on divorce and marital faithfulness?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_honor_God_s_view_on_divorce.htm">What actions can we take to align with God's hatred of divorce?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Malachi_2_16_Matthew_19_on_marriage.htm">How does Malachi 2:16 connect with Jesus' teachings on marriage in Matthew 19?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_protect_spirit_from_infidelity.htm">In what ways can we guard our spirit to prevent marital unfaithfulness?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Church_support_for_couples_per_Malachi_2_16.htm">How can the church support couples in light of Malachi 2:16's message?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_God_hate_divorce_in_Malachi.htm">Why does Malachi 2:16 say God hates divorce?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Malachi_2_16_s_link_to_marriage_vows.htm">How does Malachi 2:16 relate to marriage vows?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_influenced_Malachi_2_16.htm">What historical context influenced Malachi 2:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_malachi_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Malachi 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/bible's_stance_on_domestic_violence.htm">What does the Bible say about domestic violence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_a_christian_marriage.htm">What defines a Christian marriage?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_about_divorce.htm">What does the Bible say about divorce?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/is_the_christian_divorce_rate_50%.htm">Is the Christian divorce rate truly 50%?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Malachi 2:16 Mean</div><b>For I hate divorce,&#8221; says the LORD, the God of Israel</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s declaration is unambiguous; He personally &#8220;hates&#8221; divorce. This is not a mild dislike but a moral revulsion, flowing from His own covenant-keeping nature (see <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Marriage was created by God to be a lifelong, one-flesh covenant (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-6.htm">Matthew 19:6</a>). By stating His hatred, the Lord affirms that divorce violates the divine design, not merely social custom.<p>&#8226; God identifies Himself as &#8220;the God of Israel,&#8221; reminding the people that their national identity is rooted in His faithfulness. Their marriages were to mirror His covenant loyalty (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25, 31</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse does not condemn all divorc&#233;es indiscriminately; rather, it condemns the act of treacherous divorce, especially the faithless dismissals then common (<a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He who divorces his wife covers his garment with violence,&#8221; says the LORD of Hosts</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Covers his garment&#8221; evokes the imagery of a man&#8217;s robe symbolizing his character and relationships (<a href="/ruth/3-9.htm">Ruth 3:9</a>). To stain that garment with &#8220;violence&#8221; pictures the moral injury done to the wife&#8212;and to the covenant itself&#8212;when a husband casts her aside.<p>&#8226; Divorce, therefore, is not a neutral legal maneuver; it inflicts relational brutality. Jesus echoes this when He equates illegitimate divorce with adultery (<a href="/mark/10-11.htm">Mark 10:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Violence here can be emotional, economic, or physical, all flowing from the husband&#8217;s betrayal. God, as &#8220;LORD of Hosts,&#8221; the Commander of angelic armies, stands in defense of the wronged spouse (<a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Other prophets link marital treachery with social injustice (<a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a>). God sees the oppressed and will act.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So guard yourselves in your spirit and do not break faith</b><p>&#8226; The remedy is proactive vigilance: &#8220;guard yourselves.&#8221; Faithfulness begins in the inner person&#8212;&#8220;in your spirit&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; Marriage covenant requires ongoing spiritual watchfulness. Neglect leads to hardness of heart (<a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12-13</a>) and eventual rupture.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Do not break faith&#8221; ties back to the earlier charge (<a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14-15</a>). God values loyalty, whether to Him or to one&#8217;s spouse (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-7.htm">1 Corinthians 13:7</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>).<p>&#8226; By commanding both husband and wife to protect their spirits, God places responsibility for marital integrity squarely on believers. His grace empowers obedience (<a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/malachi/2-16.htm">Malachi 2:16</a> reveals God&#8217;s heart: He hates divorce because it violates His own covenant nature and harms those He loves. Divorce inflicts violence, staining the very identity of the one who initiates it. Therefore, God urges every believer to guard the inner life diligently and remain faithful. Marriage is designed to showcase divine fidelity; honoring that covenant honors the Lord who established it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/malachi/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "ital">For</span> [I] <span class= "ital">hate divorce</span> [of the first wife], <span class= "ital">saith the God of Israel, and he</span> [the divorcer of his first wife] <span class= "ital">covers his garment with injury, saith the LORD of Hosts; therefore take ye heed to your spirit, and do not be faithless.</span> According to our interpretation, the whole of these two verses must be taken as the words of the prophet. <span class= "ital">Any superiority.</span>--We take Heb. <span class= "ital">sh</span>'<span class= "ital">?r,</span> "remnant" in the sense of <span class= "ital">yithr?n,</span> "superabundance," "superiority." <span class= "ital">Any superiority of spirit</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> any such essential superiority as to justify him in treating his wife as a mere slave, and divorcing her against her will.

Keil takes the first verse as follows: <span class= "ital">No man who had ever a remnant of reason</span> [or a sense of right and wrong] <span class= "ital">has done</span> [<span class= "ital">sc.,</span> what ye are doing, <span class= "ital">viz.,</span> faithlessly putting away the wife of his youth. To this the people are supposed to object.] <span class= "ital">But what did the one</span> [Abraham] <span class= "ital">do?</span> [To this the prophet answers] <span class= "ital">He was seeking a seed of God</span> [viz., the child of promise: <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> he dismissed Hagar, because God promised to give him the desired posterity, not in Ishmael through the maid Hagar, but through Sarah in Isaac, so that in doing this he was simply acting in obedience to the word of God (<a href="/genesis/21-12.htm" title="And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in your sight because of the lad, and because of your female slave; in all that Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice; for in Isaac shall your seed be called.">Genesis 21:12</a>).] Others vary the translation slightly, and render, <span class= "ital">And has no one done this who has a remnant of spirit in him</span>? [This being supposed to be the objection on the part of the people. To this the prophet answers.] <span class= "ital">Wherefore did he so act? He was seeking a godly seed.</span> Moore takes the verse quite differently, and refers it to the saying of <a href="/malachi/2-10.htm" title="Have we not all one father? has not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?">Malachi 2:10</a>. His words are, "The prophet at the outset had argued the return of the Jewish people . . . therefore these marriages that violated their oneness were wrong . . . He asks again . . . <span class= "ital">Did not</span> [God] <span class= "ital">make</span> [us] <span class= "ital">one</span>? Did He not separate us from other nations into an isolated unity? Yet this was not done because the blessing was too narrow to be spread over other nations . . . <span class= "ital">for the residue of the spirit was with Him.</span> There remained an inexhaustible fulness of spiritual blessing that might be given to other nations. <span class= "ital">Why</span> [then did He choose] <span class= "ital">but one? He was seeking a seed of God</span> [a nation which He should train up to be the repository of His covenant, the stock of His Messiah]." Many other interpretations have been proposed, but these are the only ones which are at all admissible. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hateth putting away.</span> This is another reason against divorce: God hates it. It is contrary to his original institution, and was only allowed for the hardness of men's hearts (see <a href="/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>, etc.; <a href="/matthew/19-3.htm">Matthew 19:3-9</a>). Septuagint, "If thou hate her and dismiss her," etc.; Vulgate, "If thou hate her, put her away," which seems to encourage divorce, whereas in the context divorce is strongly condemned. Hence Jerome considers these words to be spoken by the Jews, quoting in their defence Moses' precept. Others think that they are ironical - Put her away, if you please; but you must bear the consequences. <span class="cmt_word">For one covereth violence with his garment.</span> He who thus divorces his wife shows himself openly to all beholders as an iniquitous man. So the clause is better rendered, <span class="accented">And one</span> (<span class="accented">who does so</span>) <span class="accented">covereth his garment with violence</span>, or, <span class="accented">violence</span> <span class="accented">covereth his garment.</span> Iniquity attaches itself to him plainly, encircling and enfolding him; the clothing of iniquity is the mark of the foul soul within. The notion of "garment" being here used figuratively for wife (as Hitzig supposes) is without proof. Such a metaphor is certainly unknown to Hebrew literature, though there is something like it in Arabic, "Wives are your attire, and ye are theirs" (Koran). Bishop Wordsworth considers that the phrase in the text refers to the custom of the bridegroom in espousals casting the skirt of his garment over her who was betrothed to him (see <a href="/ruth/3-9.htm">Ruth 3:9</a>). So the idea would be, "Ye cast your skirt over iniquity, and betroth violence to yourselves for a bride." But this seems somewhat forced. <span class="cmt_word">Take heed... treacherously.</span> A repetition of the warning in ver. 15. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/malachi/2-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I hate</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#257;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8130.htm">Strong's 8130: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hate</span><br /><br /><span class="word">divorce,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1463;&#1431;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;al&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7971.htm">Strong's 7971: </a> </span><span class="str2">To send away, for, out</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1428;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;and [I hate when a man] covers himself</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;is&#183;s&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
