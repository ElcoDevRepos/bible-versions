In the context of Malachi, the Israelites were questioning God's justice, and this statement serves as a reminder that God is not indifferent to sin. The concept of divine judgment is consistent throughout the Bible, seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/66-16.htm">Isaiah 66:16</a> and <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>, where God is portrayed as the ultimate judge who will hold all accountable.<p><b>And I will be a swift witness against sorcerers and adulterers and perjurers,</b><br>Here, God lists specific sins that were prevalent among the people. Sorcery was condemned in the Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>) as it involved seeking power apart from God. Adultery violated the sanctity of marriage, a covenant relationship that mirrors God's covenant with His people (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>). Perjury, or false testimony, undermines justice and truth, which are foundational to God's character (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). These sins reflect a departure from God's commandments and a breakdown of societal and spiritual integrity.<p><b>against oppressors of the widowed and fatherless,</b><br>The widowed and fatherless were particularly vulnerable in ancient society, and God repeatedly commands His people to care for them (<a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22-24</a>, <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>). Oppression of these groups is a grave sin because it exploits those who are defenseless, directly opposing God's nature as a protector and provider.<p><b>and against those who defraud laborers of their wages</b><br>This phrase highlights economic injustice, a recurring theme in the prophetic books. <a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14-15</a> emphasize fair treatment and timely payment for workers. Defrauding laborers is a violation of God's law and reflects a lack of love and respect for one's neighbor, contrary to the commandment to love others as oneself (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>).<p><b>and deny justice to the foreigner</b><br>The foreigner, or sojourner, was another group that God commanded His people to treat with fairness and compassion (<a href="/leviticus/19-33.htm">Leviticus 19:33-34</a>). Denying justice to foreigners contradicts the inclusive nature of God's kingdom, where all are invited to partake in His grace and mercy, as seen in the New Testament with the inclusion of Gentiles (<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12-19</a>).<p><b>but do not fear Me,&#8221; says the LORD of Hosts.</b><br>The root of these sins is a lack of reverence and fear of God. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>) and leads to righteous living. The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power, reminding the people of His authority over all creation. The absence of fear of God results in moral decay and societal injustice, as people act according to their desires rather than God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/malachi.htm">Malachi</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His message to the Israelites.
