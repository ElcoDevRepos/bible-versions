In <a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>, God foretells that "the older will serve the younger," indicating His sovereign election. The term "hated" here is understood in the context of preference and covenantal love, as seen in <a href="/romans/9-13.htm">Romans 9:13</a>, where Paul discusses God's sovereign choice. This does not imply personal animosity but rather a rejection of Esau's line in favor of Jacob's, through whom the covenant promises would continue.<p><b>and I have made his mountains a wasteland</b><br>The mountains refer to the region of Edom, Esau's descendants' territory, located southeast of Israel. Historically, Edom was a mountainous region, and its desolation is a fulfillment of prophetic judgment. <a href="/obadiah/1-8.htm">Obadiah 1:8-10</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/49-17.htm">Jeremiah 49:17-18</a> prophesy Edom's downfall due to its pride and hostility towards Israel. Archaeological evidence shows that Edom was indeed devastated and never regained its former power, aligning with the biblical narrative of divine judgment.<p><b>and left his inheritance to the desert jackals.&#8221;</b><br>The inheritance of Esau, or Edom, being left to "desert jackals" symbolizes complete desolation and abandonment. Jackals are often associated with desolate places in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/34-13.htm">Isaiah 34:13</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/9-11.htm">Jeremiah 9:11</a>. This imagery underscores the totality of Edom's destruction and serves as a warning of the consequences of opposing God's chosen people.

The phrase confirms that divine love and wrath are both real and literal, administered according to His holiness (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse assures God&#8217;s people that His commitment to them is unshakable, even when surrounding nations seem powerful or prosperous for a season (<a href="/psalms/73-18.htm">Psalm 73:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And I have made his mountains a wasteland</b><p>&#8226; Edom&#8217;s territory was rugged and fortified, stretching from the southern Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. God&#8217;s judgment stripped even those natural defenses (<a href="/jeremiah/49-16.htm">Jeremiah 49:16-18</a>).<p>&#8226; History records Babylonian and later Nabatean pressures that emptied Edom; the once-thriving trade routes fell silent, fulfilling <a href="/ezekiel/35-3.htm">Ezekiel 35:3-9</a>.<p>&#8226; The image of &#8220;mountains&#8221; turned to waste reminds us that no earthly stronghold can preserve a nation that hardens itself against the Lord (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; For Israel, hearing this in Malachi&#8217;s day reassured them that their present hardships under Persian rule did not signal divine neglect; God had already acted decisively against their ancient enemy (<a href="/isaiah/34-5.htm">Isaiah 34:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And left his inheritance to the desert jackals</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Inheritance&#8221; points to everything Edom expected to pass down&#8212;land, cities, legacy.

Their presence signals a permanent reversal of fortune, much like Babylon&#8217;s fall described in <a href="/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21-22</a> and echoed in <a href="/revelation/18-2.htm">Revelation 18:2</a>.<p>&#8226; The contrast with Israel is stark: though Judah had also experienced exile, God promised restoration (<a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10-14</a>), whereas Edom was promised no comeback (<a href="/bsb/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 18</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene cautions every generation that rejecting God&#8217;s ways ultimately surrenders future hopes to ruin (<a href="/proverbs/14-12.htm">Proverbs 14:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3</a> declares God&#8217;s sovereign choice, righteous judgment, and faithful love. Esau&#8217;s line, proud and hostile, reaped desolation, while Jacob&#8217;s line, though disciplined, remained the channel of blessing. The verse invites trust in God&#8217;s just character: He lifts the humble, opposes the proud, and keeps every promise to His covenant people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And I hated Esau.</span> St. Paul quotes these words (<a href="/romans/9-13.htm">Romans 9:13</a>) in order to illustrate his position, "that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth." Even before his birth Jacob was the chosen one, and Esau, the elder, was to serve the younger. This mystery of Divine election has seemed to some to be stated so harshly that they have thought that the words of the text need to be softened, or to be modified by their explanation. Thus they give the glosses, "I have preferred Jacob to Esau;" "I have loved Esau less than Jacob;" or they have limited the terms "love" end "hatred" to the bestowing or withholding of temporal blessings; or they have affirmed that Esau was hated because God foresaw his unworthiness, and Jacob was beloved owing to his foreseen piety and faithfulness. The whole question is discussed by Augustine, 'De Div. Quint. ad Simplic.,' 1:18 (11:433). He ends by saying, "Deus odit impietatem: in aliis etiam punit per damnationem, in aliis adimit per justificationem." But Malachi is not speaking of the predestination of the one brother and the reprobation of the other; he is contrasting the histories of the two peoples represented by them; as Jerome puts it, "In Jacob vos dilexi, in Esau Idumaeos odio habui." Both nations sinned; both are punished; but Israel by God's free mercy was forgiven and restored, while Edom was left in the misery which it had brought upon itself by its own iniquity. Thus is proved God's love for the Israelites (Knabenbauer). That it is of the two nations that the prophet speaks, rather than of the two brothers, is seen by what follows. <span class="cmt_word">Laid his mountains... waste.</span> While the Israelites were repeopling and cultivating their land, and their cities were rising from their ruins, and the temple and the capital were rebuilt, Edom, which had suffered at the hand of the same enemies, had never recovered from the blow, and still lay a scene of desolation and ruin. It seems that Nebuchadnezzar attacked and conquered Edom some few years after he had taken Jerusalem. This event happened during one of his expeditions against Egypt, one of which took place in the thirty-seventh year of his reign, as we learn from a record lately deciphered (see 'Transact. of Soc. of Bibl. Archaeology,' 7:210, etc.).
