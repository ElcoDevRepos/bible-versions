This knowledge included the Law given to Moses, which was central to the covenant relationship between God and His people. Priests were responsible for teaching the Law and ensuring that it was followed. This phrase emphasizes the importance of maintaining the purity and accuracy of God's Word. In the broader biblical context, this responsibility is echoed in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>, where priests are described as teaching God's ordinances to Israel. The preservation of knowledge is crucial for maintaining the community's spiritual health and fidelity to God.<p><b>and people should seek instruction from his mouth</b><br>This phrase highlights the priest's role as a teacher and guide for the people. In the historical context of Israel, priests were not only religious leaders but also served as judges and advisors. The people were expected to come to the priests for guidance on spiritual and legal matters. This is seen in passages like <a href="/leviticus/10-11.htm">Leviticus 10:11</a>, where priests are instructed to teach the Israelites all the decrees the LORD has given. The expectation that people seek instruction from the priest underscores the priest's authority and the trust placed in him to convey God's truth accurately.<p><b>because he is the messenger of the LORD of Hosts</b><br>The term "messenger" here is significant, as it denotes the priest's role as a representative of God. The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power, often associated with His command over the heavenly armies. This phrase indicates that the priest's authority comes directly from God, and his words should reflect God's will and purpose. The concept of a messenger is also seen in the prophetic tradition, where prophets are often referred to as messengers of God (e.g., <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>). This connection underscores the priest's duty to faithfully communicate God's message, much like the prophets who were called to speak on behalf of the LORD.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/malachi.htm">Malachi</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's message to the Israelites.
