The covenant of life and peace signifies God's promise of blessing and protection for those who faithfully serve Him. In the context of the Old Testament, the Levitical priesthood was established to mediate between God and Israel, ensuring the people's spiritual well-being. This covenant echoes the broader biblical theme of God's desire for His people to experience abundant life and peace, as seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/29-11.htm">Jeremiah 29:11</a> and <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>.<p><b>which I gave to him</b><br>God's initiative in establishing the covenant highlights His grace and sovereignty. The giving of the covenant underscores that it is not earned by human effort but is a divine gift. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of God choosing and equipping individuals for His purposes, as seen in the call of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>) and the anointing of David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12-13</a>).<p><b>it called for reverence</b><br>The covenant required a response of reverence, indicating a deep respect and awe for God's holiness and authority. Reverence is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the proper attitude towards God. <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a> states, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom," highlighting the importance of reverence in the believer's life. This reverence is not merely external but involves a heart posture of submission and worship.<p><b>and he revered Me</b><br>Levi's reverence for God serves as a model for faithful service. This reverence is demonstrated through obedience and devotion, qualities that are essential for those in spiritual leadership. The reverence of Levi can be seen as a type of Christ, who perfectly revered and obeyed the Father, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/8-29.htm">John 8:29</a>, where Jesus says, "I always do what pleases Him."<p><b>and stood in awe of My name</b><br>Standing in awe of God's name signifies recognizing His majesty and power. In biblical times, a name represented one's character and authority. To stand in awe of God's name is to acknowledge His supreme authority and holiness. This awe is reflected in the worship practices of Israel, such as the use of the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) with great reverence. The awe of God's name is also seen in the New Testament, where believers are called to honor the name of Jesus, as in <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where every knee will bow at His name.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/malachi.htm">Malachi</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament, Malachi's name means "my messenger."

The pronominal suffix "them" is not expressed in the Greek and Latin Versions, and is absent from many Hebrew manuscripts, which read, "I gave him fear." So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Dedi eis timorem et timuit me</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x1ff3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>, "I gave him the fear of me." This expresses man's part in the covenant: God gave him certain blessings on condition that he feared, reverenced, worshipped, and obeyed the Lord. The last part of the verse as now read is more simply explained, "and (my covenant with him was, or, I gave him) fear, and he did fear me." God's gifts were life and peace. Levi's part was fear of God: this he performed. The ideal priest observed all the duties of piety and reverence, and therefore in his case the covenant stood firm and was duly carried out. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/malachi/2-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;My covenant</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;
