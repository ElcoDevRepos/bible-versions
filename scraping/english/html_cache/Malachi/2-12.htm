This act is seen as a betrayal of the faith and a threat to the purity of worship among the Israelites. The context is the post-exilic period when the Israelites were re-establishing their identity and religious practices after returning from Babylonian captivity.<p><b>may the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob</b><br>The "tents of Jacob" symbolize the community of Israel, descended from Jacob. To be "cut off" implies severe divine judgment, possibly exclusion from the community or even death. This reflects the seriousness of maintaining covenantal purity and the consequences of disobedience. The phrase echoes the covenantal curses found in Deuteronomy for those who break God's commandments.<p><b>everyone who is awake and aware</b><br>This phrase suggests a comprehensive judgment on those who knowingly commit the sin. It implies that those who are conscious and deliberate in their actions will not escape God's judgment. The emphasis on awareness indicates that ignorance is not an excuse, and those who are complicit or indifferent are also accountable.<p><b>even if he brings an offering to the LORD of Hosts</b><br>This highlights the futility of religious rituals when one's heart and actions are not aligned with God's commands. The "LORD of Hosts" underscores God's sovereignty and power, reminding the Israelites that He is not appeased by mere offerings if there is underlying disobedience. This connects to the broader biblical theme that God desires obedience and righteousness over sacrifice, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a> and <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is addressing the unfaithfulness of His people through the prophet Malachi.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_who_does_this.htm">The man who does this</a></b><br>Refers to those in Israel who are guilty of marrying foreign women and being unfaithful to the covenant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tents_of_jacob.htm">The tents of Jacob</a></b><br>Symbolic of the people of Israel, descendants of Jacob, representing the community of God's chosen people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>A title emphasizing God's sovereignty and command over the heavenly armies, underscoring His authority and power.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/offerings_to_the_lord.htm">Offerings to the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the sacrifices and offerings brought to the temple, which are rendered meaningless by the people's disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_covenant_faithfulness.htm">The Importance of Covenant Faithfulness</a></b><br>God values faithfulness to His covenant above ritualistic offerings.

It is better to render it, "<span class= "ital">watchman and answerer: i.e.,</span> the watchman who cried in the city, "Who comes there?" and him who answers, "Friend," which is an exhaustive expression for all living persons, and so, in this context, "all posterity." This is the interpretation of Gesenius, who quotes in support of it an Arabic expression from the life of Tim&#163;r-lang (Timur the lame, <span class= "ital">Tamerlane</span>):--"When he left the city, there was not a <span class= "ital">crier or an answerer</span> in it"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> there was not a person left alive. "Neither root nor branch" is another exhaustive term used by our prophet (<a href="/malachi/4-1.htm" title="For, behold, the day comes, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yes, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that comes shall burn them up, said the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.">Malachi 4:1</a>).

But since the highest privilege of the Jew was to bring offerings to the Sanctuary, the words may be merely a repetition of the former expression in different terms, and mean "a descendant enjoying religious privileges." The intermarriage with heathens referred to here is that mentioned in <a href="/context/nehemiah/13-23.htm" title="In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:">Nehemiah 13:23-28</a>, not the earlier case recorded in Ezra 9, 10.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Will cut off.</span> The Hebrew is an imprecation, "May the Lord cut off" (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2, 3</a>).

In this case the term "cut off" must be taken in some milder sense than "exterminate." The present text, however, seems to be a kind of alliterative proverbial saying to express totality, everybody; though whence it arose, and what is its exact signification, are matters of great uncertainty. Some take the phrase to mean," every waking and speaking person," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> every living soul. The English and Latin Versions proceed on the assumption (which Pusey denies) that the first verb can be taken actively, "he that awakeneth," the teacher being so called as stimulating the scholar, who is named "the answerer." The Targum and Syriac explain it by "son and son's son." Of the various suggestions offered, the most probable is that it is a military phrase derived from the challenge of the sentinels and the answer thereto, which in time came to de. note the whole inhabitants of a camp or city. <span class="cmt_word">The tabernacles</span>.
