This phrase introduces a specific grievance God has against His people, emphasizing that their actions are part of a broader pattern of unfaithfulness. The context is a series of rebukes from God through Malachi, addressing the spiritual and moral decay among the Israelites after their return from exile.<p><b>You cover the altar of the LORD with tears,</b><br>The altar, central to Israelite worship, symbolizes the place where sacrifices are offered to God. The tears indicate a deep emotional response, possibly from the people or the priests, due to the perceived absence of God's favor. This imagery suggests a ritualistic display of sorrow without genuine repentance or change of heart, reflecting a disconnect between outward religious practices and inner spiritual reality.<p><b>with weeping and groaning,</b><br>These expressions of lamentation suggest a profound sense of loss or distress. In the cultural context, such displays were common in times of mourning or when seeking divine intervention. However, here they are portrayed as ineffective because they lack sincerity. The Israelites' weeping and groaning are not accompanied by true repentance or a return to covenant faithfulness.<p><b>because He no longer regards your offerings</b><br>God's refusal to accept their offerings indicates a broken relationship. In the Old Testament, offerings were a means of maintaining fellowship with God. The historical context reveals that the Israelites were neglecting the covenant, engaging in idolatry, and failing to uphold justice, which led to God's rejection of their sacrifices. This reflects the principle that God desires obedience and righteousness over mere ritual (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p><b>or receives them gladly from your hands.</b><br>The phrase underscores God's displeasure with the people's insincere worship. The hands, symbolizing action and responsibility, suggest that the offerings are tainted by the people's unfaithfulness. This rejection echoes other scriptural themes where God prioritizes the heart's condition over external religious acts (<a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>, <a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21-24</a>).

Their grief literally falls on the place of worship.<p>&#8226; God counts every tear His people shed (<a href="/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>).<p>&#8226; When worshipers mistreat others, their piety becomes hypocrisy (<a href="/isaiah/1-15.htm">Isaiah 1:15</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-14.htm">Matthew 23:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>With weeping and groaning</b><p>The emotion is loud and visible, yet the depth of repentance is shallow.
