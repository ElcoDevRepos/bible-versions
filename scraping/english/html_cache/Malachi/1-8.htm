Offering blind animals violated this command, reflecting a lack of reverence for God. This practice demonstrated the people's spiritual apathy and disregard for the holiness of God. The sacrificial system was a foreshadowing of Christ, the perfect Lamb of God, who was without blemish or defect (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>). Offering defective sacrifices undermined the typology of Christ's perfect sacrifice.<p><b>And when you present the lame and sick ones, is it not wrong?</b><br>Presenting lame and sick animals further emphasized the people's neglect of God's standards. Such offerings were not only physically inferior but also symbolized spiritual corruption and a heart far from God. The Israelites were called to honor God with their best, reflecting their devotion and gratitude. This mirrors the call for believers to offer their lives as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><b>Try offering them to your governor!</b><br>This rhetorical challenge highlights the absurdity of offering substandard gifts to God when even earthly authorities would reject them. In the ancient Near East, governors were representatives of the king and held significant power. Offering inferior gifts to a governor would be seen as disrespectful and unacceptable. This comparison underscores the greater honor and reverence due to God, the ultimate authority.<p><b>Would he be pleased with you or show you favor?&#8221;</b><br>The rhetorical question implies a negative response, emphasizing that such offerings would not be acceptable to human authorities, let alone to God. Favor in the biblical context often refers to grace or approval. The Israelites' actions showed a lack of understanding of God's holiness and the seriousness of their covenant relationship with Him. This serves as a reminder that God desires sincere worship and obedience, not mere ritualistic practices.<p><b>asks the LORD of Hosts.</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" underscores God's sovereignty and power as the commander of heavenly armies. It serves as a reminder of His authority and the seriousness of His words. This title is often used in contexts where God's majesty and might are emphasized, calling the people to recognize His rightful place as the supreme ruler. The use of this title in Malachi reinforces the call to honor God with genuine devotion and respect.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/malachi.htm">Malachi</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His message to the Israelites.

Careless worship distorts that picture.<p>&#8226; For believers today, the call is to present our bodies as a &#8220;living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>). Giving God less than our best is still wrong.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And when you present the lame and sick ones, is it not wrong?</b><p>The priests doubled down by offering lame and diseased animals.

By offering blind, lame, and sick animals, the priests revealed contempt for God&#8217;s holiness and a heart far from Him. If they would never present such gifts to a mere governor, how much more should they honor the King of kings? For believers today, the passage calls us to give God our first and best&#8212;in time, resources, and devotion&#8212;so that our worship reflects His worth and invites His favor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/malachi/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">If</span>.--Better, <span class= "ital">when.</span><p><span class= "bld">Blind . . . lame . . . sick.</span>--This was contrary to <a href="/leviticus/22-22.htm" title="Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a running sore, or scurvy, or scabbed, you shall not offer these to the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them on the altar to the LORD.">Leviticus 22:22</a>, &c.

Their conscience had grown so dull, and they had become so familiarized with constant dereliction of duty, that they saw no wrong in these violations of the Law, and never recalled the people to their duty in these matters. <span class="cmt_word">Offer it now unto thy governor.</span> The word for "governor" is <span class="accented">pechah</span>, as in <a href="/haggai/1-1.htm">Haggai 1:1</a> (where see note). It denotes a ruler set over a province by a Persian king. As Nehemiah had refused to be burdensome to the people (<a href="/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14-18</a>), it is thought that Malachi must have written this when some other person was acting as governor. But Nehemiah's generosity was exhibited in his earlier administration, and he may have thought it right to take the dues under a more prosperous state of affairs. The prophet may be putting the ease generally - Would you dare offer such things to your governor? At any rate, the question is not about provisions and dues supplied to the governor and liable to be exacted by him in his official capacity, but about voluntary offerings and presents, without which no inferior would presume to appear before his prince (see Introduction, &sect; II.). To offer to such a one what was mean and defective would be nothing less than an insult; and yet they thought this was good enough for God. <span class="cmt_word">Accept thy person.</span> Regard thee with favour (<a href="/genesis/19-21.htm">Genesis 19:21</a>;
