Historically, Edom was devastated by various conquests, including those by Babylon. Their declaration to rebuild reflects human pride and defiance against divine judgment. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of human arrogance against God's sovereignty, as seen in the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-4.htm">Genesis 11:4</a>).<p><b>this is what the LORD of Hosts says:</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's supreme authority over all heavenly and earthly armies. It underscores His power to execute judgment and fulfill His purposes, contrasting human plans with divine will. This title is frequently used in prophetic literature to assert God's control over history and nations.<p><b>&#8220;They may build, but I will demolish.</b><br>This statement highlights the futility of opposing God's decrees. Despite human efforts to restore and rebuild, God's judgment is final and unassailable. This echoes the theme found in <a href="/psalms/127.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>, where human endeavors are in vain without the Lord's blessing. It also serves as a warning to all nations that defy God's will.<p><b>They will be called the Land of Wickedness,</b><br>Edom's designation as the "Land of Wickedness" reflects their historical enmity with Israel and their sinful actions. This title signifies a divine judgment that marks them as an example of rebellion against God. It aligns with other biblical instances where lands or peoples are labeled based on their moral and spiritual state, such as Sodom and Gomorrah.<p><b>and a people with whom the LORD is indignant forever.</b><br>The perpetual indignation of the LORD signifies a lasting judgment, emphasizing the seriousness of Edom's offenses. This eternal aspect of God's anger is rare and underscores the depth of Edom's transgressions. It serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of persistent sin and rebellion, paralleling the eternal separation described in <a href="/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41</a> for those who reject God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother.
