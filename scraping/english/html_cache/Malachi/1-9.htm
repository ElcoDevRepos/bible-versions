In the context of Malachi, the Israelites are being urged to seek God's favor despite their disobedience. The concept of seeking God's favor is rooted in the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings are contingent upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28). The call to ask for favor implies a recognition of wrongdoing and a desire for restoration.<p><b>Will He be gracious?</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights the uncertainty of receiving grace when one is in a state of disobedience. It reflects the conditional nature of God's grace in the Old Testament, where grace is often extended in response to repentance and faithfulness. The question challenges the Israelites to consider their actions and the sincerity of their repentance. It echoes the sentiments found in <a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6-7</a>, where seeking the Lord while He may be found is emphasized.<p><b>Since this has come from your hands,</b><br>This phrase points to the actions and offerings of the Israelites, which have been defiled and unacceptable to God. The "hands" symbolize the works and deeds of the people, which in this context, are tainted by insincerity and disobedience. The offerings brought to God were blemished, contrary to the requirements in <a href="/leviticus/22-21.htm">Leviticus 22:21-22</a>, which demanded unblemished sacrifices. This reflects a broader theme of the prophets, where external religious observance without true devotion is condemned (<a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-17</a>).<p><b>will He show you favor?</b><br>The repetition of the question about favor underscores the seriousness of the situation. It serves as a warning that God's favor is not automatic but is contingent upon genuine repentance and change. This mirrors the message in <a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, where God promises to hear from heaven and heal the land if His people humble themselves and turn from their wicked ways.<p><b>asks the LORD of Hosts.</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power. It is a reminder of His authority over all creation, including the heavenly armies. This title is often used in contexts where God's majesty and might are being asserted, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>. It serves to remind the Israelites of who is speaking and the seriousness of the message being delivered. The use of this title reinforces the call to repentance and the need to align with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/malachi.htm">Malachi</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's message to the Israelites.

The word "God" is expressly used, rather than "the Lord," as a contrast to the human "governor" mentioned above.

Or, perhaps, in view of <a href="/malachi/1-8.htm" title="And if you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if you offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now to your governor; will he be pleased with you, or accept your person? said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 1:8</a>, and the wording of <a href="/malachi/1-10.htm" title="Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nothing? neither do you kindle fire on my altar for nothing. I have no pleasure in you, said the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.">Malachi 1:10</a>, we should render the words thus: "From <span class= "ital">your</span> hands is this [despicable offering] !" <span class= "ital">This</span> being used contemptuously like Lat. <span class= "ital">istud.</span> In either case the clause is parenthetical, so that "will he regard" must be taken in close connection with the preceding, "beseech God that he will be gracious unto us." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Beseech God;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the face of God.</span> This is not a serious call to repentance, but an ironical appeal.

Others interpret, "The thing depends on you," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whether God shows favour or not. <span class="cmt_word">Will he regard your persons?</span> Will he show favour to any one because ye intercede for him?
