It indicates a spiritual blindness or unwillingness to see their own faults. This rhetorical question is common in prophetic literature, where God often addresses the people's ignorance or denial of their sins (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3</a>).<p><b>It is because the LORD has been a witness</b><br>The concept of God as a witness underscores His omniscience and His role as a divine judge. In ancient Israel, witnesses were crucial in legal matters (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). Here, God Himself is the witness, emphasizing the seriousness of the accusation. This also connects to the idea that God sees all actions, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>.<p><b>between you and the wife of your youth</b><br>This phrase highlights the intimate and covenantal relationship between a husband and wife. The "wife of your youth" suggests a long-standing relationship, likely established when both were young. This reflects the cultural practice of marrying at a young age in ancient Israel. The phrase also evokes the idea of first love and the commitment that should endure over time (<a href="/proverbs/5-18.htm">Proverbs 5:18</a>).<p><b>against whom you have broken faith</b><br>Breaking faith implies betrayal and unfaithfulness, not just to the spouse but also to God, who is part of the marriage covenant. This mirrors the broader theme of Israel's unfaithfulness to God throughout the Old Testament, such as in Hosea, where Israel's idolatry is likened to marital infidelity.<p><b>though she is your companion</b><br>The term "companion" suggests partnership and equality, highlighting the relational aspect of marriage. This reflects the creation narrative where Eve is created as a suitable helper for Adam (<a href="/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>). It emphasizes the intended mutual support and companionship in marriage.<p><b>and your wife by covenant</b><br>Marriage is described as a covenant, a binding agreement not just between two individuals but also before God. This covenantal view of marriage is foundational in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> and reiterated by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4-6</a>.
