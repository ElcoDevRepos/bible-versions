It indicates a lack of reverence and a sense of burden in performing religious duties. This attitude is condemned throughout Scripture, as God desires sincere worship (<a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-15</a>). The phrase highlights the spiritual decline and apathy that had set in among the Israelites after their return from exile.<p><b>And you turn up your nose at it,&#8221; says the LORD of Hosts.</b><br>Turning up one's nose signifies disdain and contempt. The "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power, reminding the people of His authority over all creation. This phrase underscores the disrespect shown to God, contrasting with the reverence due to Him as the Almighty. It echoes the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-58.htm">Deuteronomy 28:58-59</a> about the consequences of not honoring God's name.<p><b>&#8220;You bring offerings that are stolen, lame, or sick!</b><br>The offerings described here violate the requirements set forth in <a href="/leviticus/22-20.htm">Leviticus 22:20-22</a>, which demand unblemished sacrifices. Bringing defective offerings reflects a deeper spiritual corruption and disregard for God's holiness. This practice is a direct violation of the covenant and shows a lack of faith and trust in God's provision. It also foreshadows the perfect sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb without blemish (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>).<p><b>Should I accept these from your hands?&#8221; asks the LORD.</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes God's rejection of insincere worship and improper sacrifices. It serves as a call to repentance and a reminder of God's standards for worship. The question challenges the people to examine their hearts and actions, aligning with the prophetic tradition of calling Israel back to covenant faithfulness (<a href="/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6-8</a>). It points to the ultimate acceptance of Christ's sacrifice, which fulfills the law and prophets (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/malachi.htm">Malachi</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivers His message to the Israelites.

It is perhaps not impossible that it may here be a later word for <span class= "ital">trephah,</span> "torn" (comp. the cogn. Arabic <span class= "ital">ajzal,</span> "galled on the back"), but it is not so used in post-Biblical Jewish writings. On the contrary, Rabbinic tradition uses our word when expressly mentioning <span class= "ital">that which is stolen</span> as unfit to be offered as a burnt offering--<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> the Sifr?, (<span class= "ital">Vayyikr?,</span> Perek 6, Parashta 5, <span class= "ital">ed.</span> Weis 7<span class= "ital">b</span>), commenting on the words of <a href="/leviticus/1-10.htm" title="And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.">Leviticus 1:10</a>, says: " 'From the flock,' and 'from the sheep,' and 'from the goats:' These words are limitations--viz., to exclude the sick (comp. also <a href="/malachi/1-8.htm" title="And if you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if you offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now to your governor; will he be pleased with you, or accept your person? said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 1:8</a>), and the aged, and that which has been dedicated in thought to an idol, and that which is defiled with its own filth; 'its offering' [English Version, <span class= "ital">his offering,</span> comp. Note on <a href="/zechariah/4-2.htm" title="And said to me, What see you? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are on the top thereof:">Zechariah 4:2</a>], to exclude <span class= "ital">that which is stolen.</span>" (See also Talmud Babli, <span class= "ital">Baba Kamma</span> 66<span class= "ital">b</span>.) The English Version has the same in view in its rendering of <a href="/isaiah/61-8.htm" title="For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.">Isaiah 61:8</a>, where it has the authority of Talmud Babli, <span class= "ital">Sukkah</span> 30a, and of Jerome and Luther. Perhaps the reason why people were inclined to offer a stolen animal may be, that it might very likely have a mark on it, which would render it impossible for the thief to offer it for sale, and so realise money on it, for fear of detection; so then he makes a virtue of a necessity, and brings as an offering to God that which he could not otherwise dispose of. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What a weariness is it!</span> The reference is to the table of the Lord.
