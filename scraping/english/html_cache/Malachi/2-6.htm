In the context of Malachi, the prophet is addressing the priests of Israel, who were responsible for teaching the Law to the people. The reference to "true instruction" underscores the necessity for leaders to convey God's Word faithfully. This aligns with the role of the Levites, who were set apart for teaching and maintaining the spiritual integrity of the nation (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>). The emphasis on truth echoes the biblical theme that God&#8217;s Word is truth (<a href="/john/17-17.htm">John 17:17</a>) and points to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is the embodiment of truth (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p><b>and nothing false was found on his lips</b><br>This phrase emphasizes integrity and honesty in speech, particularly for those in positions of spiritual leadership. The absence of falsehood is crucial for maintaining trust and authority. In the broader biblical narrative, false prophets and teachers are condemned for leading people astray (<a href="/jeremiah/23-16.htm">Jeremiah 23:16</a>). The New Testament continues this theme, warning against false teachers (<a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>). The phrase also reflects the character of Jesus, who spoke only what was true and from the Father (<a href="/john/8-28.htm">John 8:28</a>).<p><b>He walked with Me in peace and uprightness</b><br>Walking with God is a metaphor for living a life in accordance with His will. The mention of "peace and uprightness" suggests a harmonious relationship with God, characterized by moral integrity and righteousness. This echoes the covenantal relationship God desired with Israel, where obedience would lead to peace and blessing (<a href="/leviticus/26-3.htm">Leviticus 26:3-6</a>). The phrase also prefigures the life of Jesus, who perfectly walked in obedience to the Father (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>) and is our model for living a life of peace and righteousness (<a href="/romans/5.htm">Romans 5:1</a>).<p><b>and he turned many from iniquity</b><br>This phrase highlights the transformative power of godly leadership and teaching. The role of the priest was not only to instruct but also to guide people away from sin. This reflects the broader biblical mission of calling people to repentance (<a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30</a>). In the New Testament, John the Baptist and Jesus both preached repentance as a turning away from sin (<a href="/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>, <a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>). The ultimate turning from iniquity is found in Christ, who provides the means for forgiveness and transformation (1 <a href="/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/malachi.htm">Malachi</a></b><br>The last prophet of the Old Testament, Malachi's name means "my messenger."
