This unity is not merely physical but spiritual and covenantal, reflecting God's design for marriage as a lifelong commitment. The oneness in marriage is a reflection of God's covenant relationship with His people, emphasizing fidelity and unity.<p><b>having a portion of the Spirit?</b><br>The "portion of the Spirit" suggests that God's Spirit is involved in the marriage covenant, providing the spiritual bond that unites the couple. This implies that marriage is not just a social contract but a sacred union blessed by God. The presence of the Spirit indicates that marriage is meant to reflect God's holiness and purpose, aligning with the broader biblical theme of the Spirit's role in sanctification and guidance (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>).<p><b>And why one?</b><br>This rhetorical question emphasizes the purpose behind God's design for marriage. It invites reflection on the divine intention for unity and partnership. The question points to the deeper reasons for marriage beyond companionship, highlighting God's sovereign plan and purpose.<p><b>Because He seeks godly offspring.</b><br>The purpose of marriage, according to this passage, includes raising children who are godly and faithful. This reflects the biblical mandate for parents to teach their children the ways of the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>). The emphasis on godly offspring underscores the importance of a stable, faithful family environment for spiritual nurturing, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of God's covenant promises being passed down through generations.<p><b>So guard yourselves in your spirit</b><br>This admonition calls for vigilance and self-control, urging individuals to protect their inner spiritual life. It highlights the importance of maintaining integrity and faithfulness in one's relationship with God and others. The call to guard one's spirit is a recurring biblical theme, emphasizing the need for personal holiness and accountability (<a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>).<p><b>and do not break faith with the wife of your youth.</b><br>This phrase warns against infidelity and the breaking of marital vows. It underscores the seriousness of the marriage covenant and the expectation of lifelong faithfulness. The reference to "the wife of your youth" suggests a long-term commitment, reminding individuals of their initial love and promises. This aligns with the biblical condemnation of divorce and unfaithfulness (<a href="/matthew/19-6.htm">Matthew 19:6</a>), emphasizing the sanctity and permanence of marriage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who desires faithfulness and godly offspring.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophet_malachi.htm">The Prophet Malachi</a></b><br>The last prophet of the Old Testament, addressing the spiritual and moral decay of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who are being admonished for their unfaithfulness in marriage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wife_of_your_youth.htm">The Wife of Your Youth</a></b><br>A reference to the covenant relationship between a husband and his wife, emphasizing the importance of marital fidelity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/godly_offspring.htm">Godly Offspring</a></b><br>The desired result of a faithful marriage, highlighting the importance of raising children in the fear and knowledge of the Lord.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_marriage.htm">The Sanctity of Marriage</a></b><br>Marriage is a divine institution established by God, meant to reflect His covenantal faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_spirit.htm">The Role of the Spirit</a></b><br>The Spirit's involvement in marriage signifies its sacredness and the need for spiritual unity between spouses.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_faithfulness.htm">The Importance of Faithfulness</a></b><br>Faithfulness in marriage is not just a personal commitment but a spiritual obligation before God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/raising_godly_offspring.htm">Raising Godly Offspring</a></b><br>The purpose of marriage extends beyond companionship to include the responsibility of raising children who know and honor God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_your_spirit.htm">Guarding Your Spirit</a></b><br>Spiritual vigilance is necessary to maintain faithfulness in marriage and to resist temptations that lead to unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Malachi_2_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Malachi 2:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Malachi_2_15_on_marriage_faithfulness.htm">How does Malachi 2:15 emphasize the importance of faithfulness in marriage?

Therefore take heed to yourselves</span> [literally, <span class= "ital">your spirit</span>]<span class= "ital">, and with respect to the wife of thy youth</span>--<span class= "ital">Let none be faithless.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit.</span> The passage has always been a <span class="accented">crux</span>, and has received many interpretations. The Anglican rendering (which, however, is probably not correct) is thus explained: God made at first one man and one woman, to show the oneness of marriage, and God gave man the breath of life and the residue to the woman; he made them both equally living souls; therefore divorce was never contemplated in the first institution of marriage. Others take "one" to mean Abraham, and explain: Abraham did not do so, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> did not repudiate his legitimate wife, though barren; and he had a share of the spirit of right, or he had excellence of spirit. But these are very forced interpretations, and do not occur naturally from a consideration of the words. The Hebrew may be translated more satisfactorily, Not any one has done so who has a remnant of the spirit (<span class="accented">ruach</span>)." No one acts as you have done who has in him any of that Divine life which God at first breathed into man; in other words, no man of conscience and virtue has ever thus divorced his wife. The reading of the Septuagint varies here, the Vatican manuscript giving, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>; "Did he not well?" and the Alexandrian, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>: but both seem to imply an interpretation such as we have just given. <span class="cmt_word">And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed.</span> Why did one act in this way? was it that he might have godly children? Surely not. No one would divorce his lawful Hebrew wife, and marry an idolatress, who wished to leave a holy posterity behind him. Many commentators, thinking that Abraham is here meant, and that the prophet is meeting an objection which might be founded upon his action with regard to Hagar, translate, "And what did the one? He was seeking a godly seed." Abraham at Sarah's request took Hagar to wife, in order to have the promised seed; he dismissed her in order to carry out the purpose of God in confining the promise to Isaac. Therefore his conduct is no support for those who repudiate their own wives and marry strange women, not to raise up children for God, but to satisfy their carnal lusts. It is difficult, however, to see how the prophet's hearers could have understood the allusion without further explanation. As Ribera pithily observes (quoted by Knabenbauer), "Neque ita clare ex re allata designatur (Abraham), ut non potius divinatione quam explicatione opus sit ad eum eruendum." It may also be remarked that the reference to the patriarch would not have been altogether successful, if the auditors remembered the Keturahites, who, though sprung from Abraham, were not "a godly seed." The LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x7d;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>; "And ye said, What else than seed doth God seek?" as if the increase of population, from whatever source, was the only object required. This may have been one thought of the people, but it can hardly be got out of the present Hebrew text. <span class="cmt_word">Take heed to your spirit.</span> Beware lest ye lose the spirit which God has given you. By acting thus contrary to conscience and the light vouchsafed to them, they ran the risk of being deprived altogether of this heavenly guide, and losing all distinction between right and wrong. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/malachi/2-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Has not [the LORD]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
