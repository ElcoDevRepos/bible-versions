In the context of Malachi, this is a prophetic promise of renewal and repentance. The "he" refers to Elijah the prophet, as mentioned in <a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a>, who is to come before the "great and dreadful day of the LORD." This turning of hearts is a spiritual revival that prepares the people for the coming of the Lord. It reflects the importance of family in God's covenant community, where the faith and values are passed down through generations. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where John the Baptist is seen as fulfilling this role (<a href="/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>), preparing the way for Jesus Christ by calling people to repentance and restoring relationships.<p><b>and the hearts of the children to their fathers.</b><br>This continuation of the theme of reconciliation highlights the mutual nature of the restoration process. It is not only the responsibility of the fathers to turn towards their children but also the children towards their fathers. This mutual turning signifies a holistic healing of relationships, which is essential for the community's spiritual health. In the broader biblical narrative, this reflects the restoration of the covenant relationship between God and His people, where both parties turn towards each other in love and obedience. The emphasis on intergenerational unity underscores the biblical principle of honoring one's parents (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>) and the role of the family in God's redemptive plan.<p><b>Otherwise, I will come and strike the land with a curse.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase serves as a warning of the consequences of failing to heed the call to repentance and reconciliation. The "curse" mentioned here is a reference to the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, which would befall Israel if they turned away from God. The Hebrew word for "curse" here is "cherem," which implies total destruction or devotion to destruction. This warning underscores the seriousness of the call to repentance and the dire consequences of disobedience. It also points to the eschatological judgment that will come upon the earth, as seen in the prophetic literature. The New Testament reiterates this theme, where the coming of Christ brings both salvation and judgment (<a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>). This final verse of the Old Testament leaves the reader with a sense of urgency and anticipation for the coming Messiah, who will ultimately fulfill the promise of restoration and avert the curse through His redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/malachi.htm">Malachi</a></b><br>The last prophet of the Old Testament, whose name means "my messenger."
