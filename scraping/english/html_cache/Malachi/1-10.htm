The temple, located in Jerusalem, was the center of Jewish worship and sacrificial offerings. By suggesting the shutting of the temple doors, God is expressing a desire for the cessation of hypocritical and meaningless rituals. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-15</a>, where God rejects empty sacrifices. The temple's significance as a place of genuine worship is highlighted, and the call to shut its doors underscores the gravity of the people's spiritual corruption.<p><b>so that you would no longer kindle useless fires on My altar!</b><br>The "useless fires" refer to the sacrifices being offered without true devotion or obedience. In the Old Testament, the altar was central to the sacrificial system, representing atonement and worship. However, when sacrifices are made without genuine faith or repentance, they become meaningless. This is reminiscent of <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>, where obedience is valued over sacrifice. The phrase underscores the importance of the heart's condition in worship, aligning with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8-9</a> about honoring God with lips while hearts are far from Him.<p><b>I take no pleasure in you,&#8221; says the LORD of Hosts</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power over all heavenly and earthly armies. His declaration of taking no pleasure in the people highlights the broken relationship between God and Israel due to their disobedience and insincerity. This sentiment is echoed in <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>, where God desires mercy and knowledge of Him rather than burnt offerings. The phrase serves as a warning that religious activities without true devotion are displeasing to God.<p><b>and I will accept no offering from your hands.</b><br>God's refusal to accept offerings signifies the rejection of worship that is not accompanied by righteousness and genuine faith. This is a direct challenge to the priests and people who believed that ritual alone could secure God's favor. The rejection of offerings is a theme found throughout the prophets, such as in <a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21-24</a>, where God calls for justice and righteousness over ritual. This phrase foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfills the sacrificial system and offers a way for true reconciliation with God, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10.htm">Hebrews 10:1-10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/malachi.htm">Malachi</a></b><br>The last prophet in the Old Testament, Malachi's name means "my messenger."

Better to bar the temple doors than to continue hollow rituals.

Only wholehearted, obedient worship brings the smile of God&#8217;s approval.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/malachi/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) The prophet is now supposed by many commentators to say that the Temple might as well be closed, as far as concerns any pleasure the Lord takes in their offerings.<p><span class= "bld">Who is there even among you . . . doors . . . altar for nought</span>.--Those that take the above-mentioned view of the passage would render, <span class= "ital">O that there were one among even you who would shut the doors, that ye might not light mine altar to no purpose. </span>"To no purpose," like <span class= "greekheb">??????</span> (<a href="/galatians/2-21.htm" title="I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.">Galatians 2:21</a>). The rebuke contained in this verse is, according to this interpretation, very similar to that of <a href="/context/isaiah/1-11.htm" title="To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.">Isaiah 1:11-15</a>. But the word "even," which can only refer to "you" (Keil thinks differently), seems to us almost fatal to this interpretation. For we could only explain its use in the forced sense of: "Would that some one, among even you (who ought to be the promoters of God's service), would (since His service has now become a mockery) shut, &c." We are therefore inclined to retain the simple rendering of our venerable English Version. In that case, "even among you" (perhaps better, <span class= "ital">among even you</span>) would mean: "even among you whose duty it is, and chief pleasure it ought to be, to minister unto Me," which, in that context, so far from being forced, would be most natural.<p><span class= "bld">For nought.</span>--Comp. the attitude of the priests in <a href="/context/1_samuel/2-13.htm" title="And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a meat hook of three teeth in his hand;">1Samuel 2:13-16</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/malachi/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - The prophet continues his severe reprobation of the priests. <span class="cmt_word">Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for naught,</span> etc.? Thus rendered, the passage rebukes the mercenary spirit of the priests, who would not even shut the temple door nor kindle the altar fire unless they were paid for it; or else it means that, though all the officers of the temple were remunerated for their most trivial services, yet they were remiss in attending to their duties, and neglected the law of sacrifices.

But it is best to consider the passage as continuing the sarcastic strain of the preceding verse, and saying in effect that it would be better to have no pretence of worship at all than to have it thus profaned. Translate as in the Revised Version, <span class="accented">Oh that there were one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle fire on mine altar in vain!</span> The doors are those of the inner court of the temple, where the great altar stood; and the polluted sectaries is offered "in vain," because it offends God rather than propitiates him. <span class="cmt_word">An offering</span> (<span class="accented">minchah</span>). Here not sacrifice in general, as many commentators suppose, because it would be unnatural to take the word in one sense in this verse, and in a different sense in the following, where it is confessedly used in its restricted signification. The term is applied technically to the offering of fine flour combined with off and frankincense, burnt on the altar (<a href="/leviticus/2-1.htm">Leviticus 2:1</a>, etc.); though it is also occasionally used even of bloody sacrifices; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> of Abel's (<a href="/genesis/4-4.htm">Genesis 4:4</a>; comp. <a href="/1_samuel/2-17.htm">1 Samuel 2:17</a>). As liturgically employed, it denotes the unbloody offering. So in this verse we may note a kind of climax. God would not accept the victims sacrificed, no, nor even the meat offering, which was naturally pure and unpolluted, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/malachi/1-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Oh,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1490;&#1463;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7713;am-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1571.htm">Strong's 1571: </a> </span><span class="str2">Assemblage, also, even, yea, though, both, and</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1499;&#1462;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
