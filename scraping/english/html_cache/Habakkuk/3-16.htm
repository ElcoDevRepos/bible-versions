The trembling signifies a deep, visceral reaction to the divine message, similar to other biblical figures who experienced fear and awe in God's presence (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>, <a href="/daniel/10-7.htm">Daniel 10:7-8</a>). The internal trembling indicates a profound spiritual and emotional impact, highlighting the seriousness of the prophecy.<p><b>my lips quivered at the sound.</b><br>The quivering of lips suggests an overwhelming emotional response, often associated with fear or anxiety. This reaction is consistent with other biblical accounts where individuals encounter God's voice or presence (e.g., <a href="/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18-19</a>). The "sound" likely refers to the divine revelation or the anticipated judgment, emphasizing the power and authority of God's word.<p><b>Decay entered my bones;</b><br>This imagery of decay or rottenness entering the bones conveys a sense of weakness and helplessness. In ancient Near Eastern culture, bones were considered the seat of strength and vitality. The phrase suggests a debilitating fear that affects the very core of one's being, similar to Job's expressions of suffering (<a href="/job/30-17.htm">Job 30:17</a>).<p><b>I trembled where I stood.</b><br>The repetition of trembling underscores the intensity of Habakkuk's fear and reverence. Standing in this context may imply readiness or alertness, yet the trembling indicates vulnerability. This mirrors the human response to divine encounters throughout scripture, where physical manifestations of fear are common (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>).<p><b>Yet I must wait patiently for the day of distress</b><br>Despite the fear and trembling, Habakkuk resolves to wait patiently, demonstrating faith and trust in God's timing. This patience is a recurring theme in scripture, where believers are encouraged to wait on the Lord (e.g., <a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>, <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>). The "day of distress" refers to the prophesied judgment against the oppressors, aligning with the biblical principle of divine justice.<p><b>to come upon the people who invade us.</b><br>This phrase identifies the invaders as the object of God's forthcoming judgment. Historically, this likely refers to the Babylonians, who were used by God as instruments of judgment against Judah but would themselves face divine retribution. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over nations and His ultimate justice (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/25-12.htm">Jeremiah 25:12-14</a>). The anticipation of justice provides hope and assurance to the faithful, pointing to the ultimate victory of God's righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

Fear and faith meet: the prophet&#8217;s body quakes, his heart trusts, and his hope rests on the unchanging promise that God will vindicate His people and judge their oppressors in His perfect time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/habakkuk/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16-19) Habakkuk now reverts abruptly to the Divine sentence of <a href="/habakkuk/1-5.htm" title="Behold you among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which you will not believe, though it be told you.">Habakkuk 1:5</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.,</span> and describes with what emotion he meditates on the coming disasters, and on his own inability to prevent them. His anxiety is, however, swept aside by a joyful and overpowering confidence in God. These verses are a kind of appendix to the preceding poem.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">That I might rest</span> . . .--Better, <span class= "ital">that I should be resting quiet in the day of trouble, when he cometh up against the people who is to oppress them.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - &sect; 4. The <span class="accented">contemplation of the Divine judgments produces in the people of God at first, fear and trembling at the prospect of chastisement</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When I heard.</span> "When" is better omitted. "I heard" the report of thee (vex. 2). The LXX. refers to <a href="/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>, rendering, "I watched." If the former part is the paean of the congregation, the present is the prophet's own utterance expressive of his dismay at the prospect before him. <span class="cmt_word">My belly trembled.</span> My inmost part, my inward self, trembled with fear (comp. <a href="/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">My lips quivered at the voice.</span> My lips quivered with fear at the voice of God that sounded in me (<a href="/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>), proclaiming these awful judgments. The word rendered" quivered" (<span class="accented">tsalal</span>) <span class="accented">is</span> applied to the tingling of the ears (<a href="/1_samuel/3-11.htm">1 Samuel 3:11</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-12.htm">2 Kings 21:12</a>), and implies that the prophet's lips so trembled that he was scarcely able to utter speech. The LXX. renders, "from the voice of the prayers of my lips." <span class="cmt_word">Rottenness entered into my bones.</span> This is an hyperbolical expression, denoting that the firmest, strongest parts of his body were relaxed and weakened with utter fear, as if his very bones were cankered and corrupted, and there was no marrow in them. <span class="cmt_word">And I trembled in myself.</span> The last word (<span class="accented">tachtai</span>) is rendered variously: "under me," according to the Greek and Latin Versions, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in my knees and feet, so that I reeled and stumbled; or, "in my place," on the spot where I stand (as <a href="/exodus/16-29.htm">Exodus 16:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That I might rest in the day of trouble;</span> better, <span class="accented">I who shall rest in the day of tribulation.</span> The prophet suddenly expresses his confidence that he shall have rest in this affliction; amid this terror and awe he is sure that there remaineth a rest for the people of God. This sentiment leads naturally to the beautiful expression of hope in the concluding paragraph (ver. 17, etc.). Keil and others render, "tremble that I am to wait quietly for the day of tribulation;" that I am to sit still and await the day of affliction. But Pusey denies that the verb (<span class="accented">nuach</span>) ever means "to wait patiently for," or "to be silent about;" its uniform signification is "to rest" from labour or from trouble. Thus the Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>, "I will rest in the day of affliction;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ut requiescam in die tribulationis. <span class="cmt_word"></span>When he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.</span> This should be, <span class="accented">When he that invades with bands comes up against the people</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the day when the Chaldeans attack the Israelites (comp. <a href="/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>, where the word "bands" is also used). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: "To go up against the people of my sojourning;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ut ascendam ad populum aecinctum nostrum</span>, which is thus explained: "I will bear all things patiently, even death itself, that I may attain to the happy company of those blessed heroes who fought for their country and their God." It is obvious to remark that this is a gloss, not on the original text, but on the erroneous version. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/habakkuk/3-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I heard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;
