It signifies God's control over creation and His ability to intervene supernaturally in human affairs. The imagery suggests divine intervention and power, emphasizing God's sovereignty over the natural order. This also reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of celestial bodies as part of the divine realm, highlighting God's supremacy over all spiritual and physical forces.<p><b>at the flash of Your flying arrows</b><br>The imagery of "flying arrows" symbolizes God's swift and decisive judgment against His enemies. Arrows in ancient warfare were a primary weapon, representing speed and precision. This phrase may also allude to the divine warrior motif found throughout the Old Testament, where God is depicted as a warrior fighting on behalf of His people (e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-14.htm">Psalm 18:14</a>). The "flash" suggests the suddenness and brilliance of God's intervention, reminiscent of lightning, which is often associated with divine presence and power.<p><b>at the brightness of Your shining spear</b><br>The "shining spear" continues the theme of God as a divine warrior. The brightness indicates the glory and majesty of God, often associated with His holiness and righteousness. In ancient cultures, a shining weapon would symbolize not only power but also the purity and invincibility of the one wielding it. This imagery connects to other biblical passages where God's presence is described as radiant and overwhelming (e.g., <a href="/ezekiel/1-27.htm">Ezekiel 1:27-28</a>). The spear, like the arrows, underscores the theme of divine judgment and deliverance, pointing to God's active role in the salvation history of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the justice and sovereignty of God amidst the suffering of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sun_and_moon.htm">Sun and Moon</a></b><br>Celestial bodies that symbolize the natural order and the power of God over creation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_arrows_and_spear.htm">God's Arrows and Spear</a></b><br>Metaphorical representations of God's power and judgment, illustrating His might in battle and His ability to control the elements.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_creation.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Creation</a></b><br>The imagery of the sun and moon standing still highlights God's supreme authority over the natural world.

Overpowered with the splendour of God's presence, the heavenly luminaries hide their light in this day of the Lord (comp. <a href="/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>; <a href="/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2, 10, 31</a>; <a href="/joel/3-15.htm">Joel 3:15</a>; <a href="/amos/5-20.htm">Amos 5:20</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>). The miracle of Joshua (<a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12</a>, etc.) may have suggested some of the language here, but the idea is quite different. <span class="cmt_word">At the light of thine arrows they went;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the sun and moon fled away discomfited at the glory of God's weapons, his arrows gleaming with light. The idea may be that, in the absence of the sun and moon, the terrific scene was illuminated only by flashes of lightning. "Lightnings" are sometimes celled God's "arrows," as in <a href="/psalms/18-14.htm">Psalm 18:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/77-17.htm">Psalm 77:17</a>, etc.; but the image here is rather of the arms of a warrior. Many supply the relative in the sentence, and render, "arrows which shoot along." This seems to be unnecessary, and is not supported by the versions. There is no special reference to the hailstorm at Beth-horon, which discomfited the Cananites, but enabled the Israelites to pass on to victory (Joshua, <span class="accented">loc. cit</span>.).
