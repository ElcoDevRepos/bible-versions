Historically, the Chaldeans were known for their military prowess and brutality, often using violence to conquer and subdue nations. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using foreign nations as instruments of judgment, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a> with Assyria. The Chaldeans' intent on violence underscores the severity of the judgment God is allowing against Judah due to their disobedience and sin.<p><b>their hordes advance like the east wind;</b><br>The east wind in the Bible often symbolizes destruction and desolation, as seen in <a href="/exodus/10-13.htm">Exodus 10:13</a> with the plague of locusts and in <a href="/jeremiah/18-17.htm">Jeremiah 18:17</a>. The east wind is typically hot and dry, coming from the desert, and it can devastate crops and landscapes. This imagery emphasizes the swift and overwhelming nature of the Chaldean invasion, suggesting that their approach is unstoppable and devastating, much like the natural force of the east wind.<p><b>they gather prisoners like sand.</b><br>The simile of gathering prisoners like sand highlights the vast number of captives taken by the Chaldeans, indicating their military success and the extent of their conquests. Sand is often used in the Bible to denote innumerability, as in <a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a> regarding Abraham's descendants. This imagery conveys the overwhelming power of the Chaldeans and the helplessness of those they conquer. It also serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God, as the people of Judah experience the fulfillment of prophetic warnings about exile and captivity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the injustice he sees in Judah and the impending judgment through the Babylonians.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonians.htm">Babylonians (Chaldeans)</a></b><br>The empire God raises to execute judgment on Judah.

All of them come bent on violence &#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/1-9.htm">Habakkuk 1:9</a>a) pictures the invading Chaldeans as thoroughly committed to bloodshed.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Bent&#8221; carries the idea of determination; their violence is not accidental but intentional (compare <a href="/habakkuk/1-7.htm">Habakkuk 1:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/6-22.htm">Jeremiah 6:22&#8211;23</a> echoes the same threat: &#8220;They lay hold of bow and spear; they are cruel and show no mercy.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God is using this fierce nation as His rod of judgment (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5&#8211;6</a>), yet they themselves are morally accountable for their brutality (<a href="/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers, the verse reminds us that evil can serve God&#8217;s larger purposes without diminishing His holiness (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>their hordes advance like the east wind</b><p>&#8220; Their hordes advance like the east wind &#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/1-9.htm">Habakkuk 1:9</a>b) likens the Babylonian army to the scorching desert wind that sweeps in from the Arabian Desert.<p>&#8226; The east wind in Scripture is relentless and destructive (<a href="/exodus/10-13.htm">Exodus 10:13</a>; <a href="/jonah/4-8.htm">Jonah 4:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/18-17.htm">Jeremiah 18:17</a>).<p>&#8226; As that wind strips vegetation and parches the land, so the Chaldeans would strip nations of security, wealth, and life (<a href="/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>; <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The simile stresses speed and inevitability; nothing stands before a hot desert gale, and nothing would stop Babylon&#8217;s advance until God said so (<a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The picture also foreshadows God&#8217;s eventual reversal: just as He can summon the wind, He can still it (<a href="/psalms/107-25.htm">Psalm 107:25&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they gather prisoners like sand</b><p>&#8220;

Habakkuk later compares them to fishermen hauling in a massive catch (<a href="/habakkuk/1-15.htm">Habakkuk 1:15</a>), emphasizing ease as well as quantity.<p>&#8226; Historical records confirm multiple deportations from Judah alone (<a href="/jeremiah/52-28.htm">Jeremiah 52:28&#8211;30</a>), fulfilling the prophecy literally.<p>&#8226; The image underscores the helplessness of nations that spurn God, yet it also prepares the stage for Judah&#8217;s future restoration when the number of returning exiles would again be &#8220;like the sand&#8221; in God&#8217;s promise (<a href="/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/habakkuk/1-9.htm">Habakkuk 1:9</a> declares that the Babylonian army, God&#8217;s chosen instrument of discipline, would come with determined violence, sweep through lands with the unstoppable force of a scorching east wind, and carry away captives beyond counting. The verse exposes both the severity of divine judgment and the sovereignty of God over the nations, assuring believers that even the most fearsome powers remain under His ultimate control.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/habakkuk/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Their faces shall sup up as the east wind.</span>--Literally, if we could accept this interpretation, <span class= "ital">the eagerness of their faces is eastward.</span> The passage, however, is beset with philological difficulties. If the word <span class= "ital">kadimah</span> could be translated "east wind," the invading Chaldaean host would be compared to a blast from the east, passing over the land, and leaving it scorched and blighted. The captives ("captivity," Authorised Version) whom the invader carries off would then be likened to the cloud of dust, sand, &c., which accompanies this withering blast. This gives a good sense. Unfortunately, however, according to all analogy, <span class= "ital">kadimah</span> must mean either "eastwards" or "forwards." The meaning of <span class= "ital">m</span>'<span class= "ital">gammath</span> (used here only) is probably either "crowd" or "eager desire." Two plausible renderings are thus presented for our choice--"There is a crowd of their faces pressing forwards;" "Their faces turn eagerly forwards." For other interpretations, we must refer the Hebrew student to the critical commentaries.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They shall come all for violence.</span> All, every one of the invaders, come for violence - to repay that violence of which Habakkuk complained (ver. 2).

The Anglican rendering is virtually supported by other versions, e.g. Symmachus, Chaldee, and Syriac. The Vulgate, too, gives, <span class="accented">facies eorum ventus urens</span>, which Jerome explains, "As at the blast of a burning wind all green things dry up, so at the sight of these men all shall be wasted." This is the meaning of the Anglican Version, which, however, might be improved thus: <span class="accented">The aspect of their faces is as the east wind.</span> The Revisers have, <span class="accented">Their faces are set eagerly as the east wind</span>, which does not seem very intelligible. Other renderings are, "the endeavour," or "desire of their faces is directed to the east," or "forwards." (This rendering has the support of Orelli and others.) "The crowd of their faces," as equivalent to "the multitude of the army" which is not a Hebrew phrase found elsewhere. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> (agreeing with <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> in the first clause) <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "resisting with their adverse front."
