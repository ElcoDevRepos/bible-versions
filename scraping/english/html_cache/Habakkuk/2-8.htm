Historically, the Babylonian Empire, under leaders like Nebuchadnezzar II, expanded its territory through aggressive warfare, taking spoils from conquered lands. This behavior is condemned in the Bible, as it reflects greed and a lack of justice. The plundering of nations is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where God often warns against such actions (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/10-13.htm">Isaiah 10:13-14</a>). The moral lesson here is that unjust gain through violence and theft is ultimately unsustainable and will lead to divine retribution.<p><b>the remnant of the people will plunder you&#8212;</b><br>The concept of a "remnant" is significant in biblical theology, often referring to a small, faithful group preserved by God amidst judgment. Here, it suggests that those who survive the Babylonian conquests will eventually rise against their oppressors. This reversal of fortunes is a common biblical motif, where the oppressed become the victors (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/14-2.htm">Isaiah 14:2</a>). Historically, the Medes and Persians, who were once subjugated by Babylon, eventually overthrew the empire. This phrase underscores the principle of divine justice, where those who live by violence will ultimately fall by it.<p><b>because of your bloodshed against man</b><br>This phrase highlights the moral and ethical violations committed by the Babylonians, specifically their acts of violence and murder. Bloodshed is a serious offense in biblical law, as life is sacred (<a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>). The Babylonians' disregard for human life is a key reason for their impending judgment. This echoes the broader biblical theme that God is a defender of justice and will not allow the shedding of innocent blood to go unpunished (e.g., <a href="/psalms/9-12.htm">Psalm 9:12</a>).<p><b>and your violence against the land,</b><br>The violence against the land refers to the environmental and societal destruction caused by the Babylonians. In biblical times, the land was seen as a gift from God, meant to be stewarded and cared for. The Babylonians' exploitation and devastation of the land violated this principle. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of creation care and the responsibility to protect the earth (<a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>). The destruction of the land also symbolizes the broader impact of sin, which affects not just individuals but the entire creation.<p><b>the city, and all their dwellers.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the comprehensive nature of Babylonian violence, affecting urban centers and their inhabitants. Cities in the ancient Near East were often centers of culture, commerce, and governance. The destruction of cities by the Babylonians disrupted societal structures and caused immense suffering. This can be seen in the fall of Jerusalem, which was a significant event in biblical history (<a href="/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8-10</a>). The mention of "all their dwellers" underscores the indiscriminate nature of Babylonian aggression, affecting both the guilty and the innocent. This serves as a reminder of the far-reaching consequences of sin and the importance of seeking peace and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the justice and sovereignty of God amidst the violence and corruption he observes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonians.htm">Babylonians (Chaldeans)</a></b><br>The empire known for its military conquests and plundering of nations, which is the primary subject of God's judgment in this passage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the various peoples and lands that the Babylonians have conquered and plundered.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/remnant_of_the_peoples.htm">Remnant of the Peoples</a></b><br>The survivors or remaining people from the nations that were plundered, who will eventually rise against the Babylonians.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/violence_and_bloodshed.htm">Violence and Bloodshed</a></b><br>The acts of aggression and destruction committed by the Babylonians against other nations, which are condemned by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's justice is inevitable and will come upon those who commit acts of violence and oppression.

Because of men's blood. Because of the cruelty and bloodshed of which the Babylonians were guilty. For the violence of (done to) the land, of the city (see ver. 17).
