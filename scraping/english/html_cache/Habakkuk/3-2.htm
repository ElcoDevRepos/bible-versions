The "report" refers to the stories and testimonies of God's mighty works, such as the deliverance of Israel from Egypt and the conquest of Canaan. This acknowledgment is rooted in the oral and written traditions of the Israelites, which were passed down through generations. It highlights the importance of remembering and recounting God's deeds as a foundation for faith.<p><b>I stand in awe, O LORD, of Your deeds.</b><br>Habakkuk expresses a deep reverence and fear of the Lord, recognizing His power and sovereignty. The "deeds" refer to God's miraculous interventions and judgments throughout history. This awe is a common response to God's majesty, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/33-8.htm">Psalm 33:8</a>, which calls all the earth to fear the Lord. The prophet's awe is not just fear but a profound respect and admiration for God's holiness and justice.<p><b>Revive them in these years;</b><br>Here, Habakkuk is pleading for God to renew His mighty works in the present time. The request for revival indicates a desire for God to act as He did in the past, bringing about spiritual renewal and deliverance. This plea is relevant in times of spiritual decline or crisis, reflecting a longing for God's intervention. The concept of revival is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/85-6.htm">Psalm 85:6</a>, where the psalmist asks God to revive His people.<p><b>make them known in these years.</b><br>The prophet desires that God's works be evident and recognized by all, not just as stories of the past but as present realities. This reflects a longing for God's glory to be revealed to the current generation, similar to the prayer in <a href="/psalms/67-2.htm">Psalm 67:2</a> for God's ways to be known on earth. It underscores the importance of God's active presence and the manifestation of His power in the world.<p><b>In Your wrath, remember mercy!</b><br>This plea highlights the dual aspects of God's character: justice and mercy. While God is righteous and must judge sin, He is also compassionate and willing to forgive. This balance is a recurring theme in scripture, as seen in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>, where God is described as merciful and gracious, yet just. Habakkuk's prayer reflects a deep understanding of God's nature and a hope for mercy amidst impending judgment. This tension between wrath and mercy is ultimately resolved in the person of Jesus Christ, who embodies both God's justice and His grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the justice and sovereignty of His actions.

Pusey considers that both meanings are intended, viz. both what God had lately declared, and all that might be heard of God, his greatness and his workings. <span class="cmt_word">Was afraid.</span> The revelation of God's interposition makes the prophet tremble. <span class="cmt_word">Revive thy work.</span> God's work is the twofold judgment spoken of above; and the prophet prays God to "quicken" and make it live, because, though it brings temporary distress upon his countrymen, it will also cause the destruction of their enemies, and re-establish the Jews and crown them with salvation, and make the glory of God known to all the earth. Dr. Briggs ('Messianic Prophecy,' p. 234) translates, "Jahveh, I have heard the report of thee; I fear, Jahveh, thy work. In the midst of the years revive him (Israel)." He explains God's "work" to be his acts in theophany - his judgment, especially as in ver. 16, the cause of fear to the psalmist. <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the years.</span> The "years" are the period between the announcement of the judgment and its final accomplishment (<a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>); the prophet prays that God would manifest his power, not merely at the extreme limit of this epoch, but earlier, sooner. This overthrow of the world power forms, as it were, the central point of history, the beginning of a new age which shall culminate in the Messianic kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">Make known.</span> Let all the earth know and acknowledge thy work. The LXX. have given two or more versions of this passage, one of which is remarkable. Thus they read, "In the midst of two animals (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) thou shalt be known; when the years draw nigh thou shalt be well known; when the time is come thou shalt be revealed." The rendering, "two animals," arises from a confusion of words but many of the Fathers, who were conversant with the Greek Scriptures, saw herein a reference to the incarnation of our blessed Lord, as lying in the stable at Bethlehem between the ox and the ass, which was the mystical explanation of <a href="/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>, "The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib." Others interpreted the two animals of the two thieves between whom Christ was crucified; or of angels and men; or Jews and Gentiles; or the two Testaments; or Moses and Elias. Others again accented the word <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> so as to understand "two lives," the present and the future, in the midst of which the Judge shall appear; or the life of Christ before his death and after his resurrection. There is a great truth underlying most of these interpretations, namely, that this magnificent hymn is concerned with the victories of Christ and his Church. In wrath remember mercy. When thine anger is displayed by sending the Chaldeans against us, remember thy mercy, and make a speedy end of our misery, and mitigate our enemies' cruelty (comp. <a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>; and vers. 9, 13, 18, 19 of this chapter). The LXX. gives a double version, "In the troubling of my soul, in wrath, thou wilt remember mercy." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/habakkuk/3-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">O LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I have heard</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;ma&#8216;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the report of You;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1458;&#1498;&#1464;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;im&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
