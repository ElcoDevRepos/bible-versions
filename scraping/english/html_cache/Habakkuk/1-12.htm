The term "everlasting" reflects God's unchanging and eternal character, as seen in <a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>, which speaks of God being from "everlasting to everlasting." The use of "O LORD" (Yahweh) signifies a personal and covenantal relationship with God, highlighting His faithfulness and holiness. "My God, my Holy One" underscores a personal relationship and reverence, recognizing God's purity and moral perfection. This phrase sets the stage for Habakkuk's appeal to God's eternal and unchanging nature in the face of impending judgment.<p><b>We will not die.</b><br>This statement reflects a confident assurance in God's promises and His covenant with Israel. Despite the impending judgment, Habakkuk expresses faith that God will preserve a remnant of His people, as seen in the promises made to Abraham and reiterated throughout the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>). This assurance is rooted in the belief that God's purposes for His people will ultimately prevail, aligning with the prophetic hope found in passages like <a href="/isaiah/54-10.htm">Isaiah 54:10</a>, where God's covenant of peace is described as unbreakable.<p><b>O LORD, You have appointed them to execute judgment;</b><br>Here, Habakkuk acknowledges God's sovereignty in using the Babylonians as instruments of judgment against Judah. This reflects the biblical theme of God using foreign nations to discipline His people, as seen in the Assyrian conquest of Israel (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>) and the Babylonian exile (<a href="/2_kings/24-10.htm">2 Kings 24:10-16</a>). The term "appointed" indicates divine ordination, suggesting that even the actions of pagan nations are under God's control and serve His purposes, as echoed in <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>, where Assyria is described as the rod of God's anger.<p><b>O Rock, You have established them for correction.</b><br>The term "Rock" is a metaphor for God's strength, stability, and faithfulness, often used in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>). It conveys trust in God's unchanging nature amidst turmoil. The phrase "established them for correction" indicates that the Babylonians' rise to power is not random but part of God's corrective plan for His people. This reflects the biblical principle that God disciplines those He loves (<a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>), using even difficult circumstances to bring about repentance and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the justice and righteousness of His actions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal nature and faithfulness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chaldeans/babylonians.htm">The Chaldeans/Babylonians</a></b><br>A powerful empire used by God as an instrument of judgment against Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing impending judgment due to its disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rock.htm">The Rock</a></b><br>A metaphor for God, symbolizing His strength, stability, and reliability.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_eternal_nature.htm">God's Eternal Nature</a></b><br>Recognize that God is "from everlasting," which assures us of His unchanging nature and eternal perspective.

From Genesis to Revelation, Scripture presents the LORD as unbound by time (<a href="/psalms/90-2.htm">Psalm 90:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Calling God &#8220;my God&#8221; and &#8220;my Holy One&#8221; personalizes the relationship. The prophet is not addressing an abstract deity but the covenant-keeping LORD revealed to Israel (<a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>).<p>&#8226; By affirming God&#8217;s holiness, Habakkuk submits to a standard higher than human reasoning. Holiness guarantees that every action God takes is morally perfect (<a href="/1_samuel/2-2.htm">1 Samuel 2:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/15-4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The question &#8220;Are You not&#8230;?&#8221; is rhetorical; the expected answer is &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Habakkuk reminds himself&#8212;and his listeners&#8212;that the eternal, holy God is still on the throne despite present chaos.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We will not die.</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;We&#8221; refers to God&#8217;s covenant people. Habakkuk clings to the promise that, whatever discipline comes, God will preserve a remnant (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35&#8211;36</a>).<p>&#8226; This confidence echoes Moses&#8217; assurance after the golden calf incident: despite deserved judgment, Israel would not be annihilated (<a href="/exodus/32-13.htm">Exodus 32:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement also affirms God&#8217;s broader redemptive plan. Messiah must come through Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>; <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>), so total destruction is impossible.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>O LORD, You have appointed them to execute judgment;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Them&#8221; points to the Babylonians (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>). Habakkuk recognizes God&#8217;s sovereign right to raise up even a pagan nation as His instrument (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Appointment language underscores divine intentionality. God does not react; He ordains (<a href="/daniel/4-35.htm">Daniel 4:35</a>; <a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Judgment has a covenant purpose: to confront sin and call the people back to obedience (<a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14&#8211;45</a>; <a href="/amos/3-2.htm">Amos 3:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>O Rock, You have established them for correction.</b><p>&#8226; Calling God &#8220;Rock&#8221; stresses stability and faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>). Even when the means seem harsh, the foundation is secure.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Established&#8221; points to a fixed decree; the Babylonians will not overrun Judah by chance (<a href="/proverbs/16-4.htm">Proverbs 16:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Correction&#8221; clarifies God&#8217;s intent: not annihilation but discipline that leads to restoration (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6&#8211;11</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1</a>).<p>&#8226; This perspective keeps the faithful from despair. The same God who authorizes discipline also sets its limits (<a href="/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/29-10.htm">Jeremiah 29:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/habakkuk/1-12.htm">Habakkuk 1:12</a> is a confession of faith in God&#8217;s eternal, holy, and sovereign character. The prophet affirms that Israel&#8217;s survival is guaranteed, even as God wields Babylon as His chosen instrument of judgment and correction. By viewing present hardship through the lens of God&#8217;s unchanging nature and redemptive purposes, believers find assurance that discipline is controlled by a faithful Rock who seeks their ultimate restoration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/habakkuk/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12-17) Though sore perplexed, Habakkuk feels sure that the God whom this swaggering conqueror has insulted will at last vindicate Himself.<p>(12) <span class= "bld">We shall not die</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, God's people may suffer, but shall not be obliterated, shall not be "given over unto death." The rest of the verse runs literally, <span class= "ital">Jehovah, for judgment hast Thou appointed him, and O Rock, for chastisement hast Thou founded him.</span> "Him," means, of course, the Chaldaean invader, whom Habakkuk regards as raised up only to be God's instrument of correction. The term "<span class= "ital">Rock</span>" has been paraphrased in the Authorised Version. Used absolutely, it occurs as a Divine title in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm" title="He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>.

An affirmative answer is expected. This is one ground of confidence in the corrective nature of the chastisement. God is Jehovah, the covenant God, who has been in personal relation to Israel from time immemorial, and is himself eternal. <span class="cmt_word">Mine Holy One</span>. He speaks in the person of the righteous people, and he refers to God's holiness as a second ground of hope, because, although God must punish sin, he will not let the sacred nation, the chosen guardian of the faith, perish utterly. And then he expresses this confidence: <span class="cmt_word">We shall not die.</span> We shall be chastened, but not killed. The Masorites assert that the present reading is a correction of the scribes for "thou wilt not die," which the prophet wrote originally, and which was altered for reverence' sake.
