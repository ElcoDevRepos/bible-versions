In ancient times, a guard post was a place of watchfulness and alertness, often situated on city walls or towers. This imagery suggests a spiritual readiness and a disciplined approach to seeking God's guidance. The role of a watchman is also seen in <a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>, where God appoints Ezekiel as a watchman for Israel, emphasizing the responsibility to listen and respond to God's word.<p><b>and station myself on the ramparts.</b><br>Ramparts were defensive walls or embankments surrounding a city, providing a vantage point for observation. By positioning himself on the ramparts, Habakkuk symbolizes his desire to gain a higher perspective, both physically and spiritually. This act of positioning oneself to hear from God is akin to seeking a place of solitude and reflection, as Jesus often did, such as in <a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>, where He went to a solitary place to pray.<p><b>I will watch to see what He will say to me,</b><br>The act of watching implies an expectation and anticipation of divine communication. Habakkuk's approach is one of active waiting, demonstrating faith that God will indeed respond. This mirrors the attitude of the psalmist in <a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>, who waits expectantly for the Lord's answer. The phrase also suggests a visual aspect to receiving God's message, indicating that divine revelation can come through visions or signs, as seen in the prophetic experiences of Daniel and John in Revelation.<p><b>and how I should answer when corrected.</b><br>Habakkuk anticipates that God's response may include correction or reproof, highlighting the prophet's humility and openness to divine discipline. This readiness to be corrected is a key aspect of spiritual maturity, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>, which speaks of the Lord's discipline as an expression of His love. The phrase also underscores the importance of a teachable spirit, willing to adjust one's understanding and actions in light of God's truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the justice and righteousness of His actions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/guard_post.htm">Guard Post</a></b><br>A metaphorical place where Habakkuk positions himself to wait for God's response, symbolizing vigilance and readiness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/ramparts.htm">Ramparts</a></b><br>Defensive walls or embankments, representing a place of watchfulness and anticipation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine being whom Habakkuk is addressing, seeking answers and guidance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/correction.htm">Correction</a></b><br>The anticipated response from God, implying that Habakkuk is open to being corrected or instructed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/vigilance_in_prayer.htm">Vigilance in Prayer</a></b><br>Like Habakkuk, we should adopt a posture of watchfulness in our prayer life, expecting God to speak and guide us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/openness_to_correction.htm">Openness to Correction</a></b><br>We must be willing to receive correction from God, understanding that His guidance is for our growth and alignment with His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/positioning_for_revelation.htm">Positioning for Revelation</a></b><br>Just as Habakkuk stationed himself on the ramparts, we should position ourselves spiritually to receive God's revelations through His Word and Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/active_waiting.htm">Active Waiting</a></b><br>Waiting on God is not passive; it involves active engagement in prayer, study, and readiness to respond to His direction.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_watchmen.htm">Faithful Watchmen</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to be watchmen in our communities, discerning God's voice and sharing His truth with others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Habakkuk_2_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Habakkuk 2:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_stay_vigilant_spiritually_daily.htm">How can we "stand at my guard post" in our daily spiritual life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_watch_to_hear_Him_teach.htm">What does "watch to see what He will say" teach about divine guidance?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Habakkuk_2_1_Psalm_27_14_on_waiting.htm">How does Habakkuk 2:1 connect with waiting on God's timing in Psalm 27:14?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_prepare_for_reproof_response.htm">In what ways can we prepare to "answer when I am reproved"?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Habakkuk_2_1_inspire_prayer.htm">How can Habakkuk's approach in 2:1 inspire our prayer and meditation practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Lesson_of_patience_in_Habakkuk_2_1.htm">What does Habakkuk 2:1 teach about waiting for God's response?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_prophet_in_Habakkuk_2_1.htm">How does Habakkuk 2:1 illustrate the role of a prophet?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_the_watchtower_key_in_Habakkuk_2_1.htm">What is the significance of the watchtower in Habakkuk 2:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_habakkuk_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Habakkuk 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_patience.htm">What is the Bible's teaching on patience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_set_a_watchman_in_isaiah_21_6.htm">In Isaiah 21:6, why would a prophet instruct setting up a watchman, and is there any archaeological sign of such a practice? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/who_wrote_the_book_of_habakkuk.htm">Who is the author of the Book of Habakkuk?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_is_contemplative_prayer.htm">What is contemplative prayer?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Habakkuk 2:1 Mean</div><b>I will stand at my guard post</b><p>Habakkuk chooses the posture of a sentinel, not a casual observer. Like the watchmen of <a href="/isaiah/62-6.htm">Isaiah 62:6</a> who never keep silent, he commits himself to faithful, ongoing alertness. His stance is literal&#8212;he intends to take his place&#8212;but it also models spiritual readiness:<p>&#8226; Waiting in faith, as in <a href="/psalms/130-5.htm">Psalm 130:5&#8211;6</a>, where the psalmist&#8217;s soul &#8220;waits for the Lord more than watchmen for the morning.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Refusing to abandon position, reminiscent of <a href="/2_chronicles/20-17.htm">2 Chronicles 20:17</a>, where Judah is told, &#8220;Stand firm, hold your position, and see the salvation of the LORD.&#8221;<p>Habakkuk&#8217;s example urges us to plant our feet on the promises of God, unmoved by cultural winds or personal doubt.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and station myself on the ramparts</b><p>The prophet moves from ground level to the fortified walls, elevating his perspective. From that height, distractions are minimized and the horizon is clear&#8212;much like Moses ascending Sinai to meet God (<a href="/exodus/19-20.htm">Exodus 19:20</a>). The rampart is a place of:<p>&#8226; Separation&#8212;leaving the crowd below (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Safety&#8212;high ground protected from sudden assault (<a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>, &#8220;The name of the LORD is a strong tower&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Sight&#8212;gaining God&#8217;s vantage point, echoing <a href="/psalms/73-17.htm">Psalm 73:17</a> where understanding comes only after entering the sanctuary.<p>Habakkuk demonstrates that hearing from the Lord often requires deliberate withdrawal to a secure, elevated place of communion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will watch to see what He will say to me</b><p>Expectancy saturates these words. Habakkuk is confident God will speak, just as the boy Samuel said, &#8220;Speak, LORD, for Your servant is listening&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>). Note the paradox: &#8220;watch to see&#8221; suggests vision for hearing, underscoring that divine communication engages all senses. Key resonances include:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/5-3.htm">Psalm 5:3</a>&#8212;&#8220;In the morning I lay my requests before You and wait expectantly.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a>&#8212;&#8220;Call to Me and I will answer you and show you great and unsearchable things.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/12-37.htm">Luke 12:37</a>&#8212;servants whom the master finds watching will be blessed.<p>Habakkuk anticipates a personal, specific word&#8212;clear evidence that revelation is both real and relational.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and how I should answer when corrected</b><p>The prophet already anticipates God&#8217;s rebuke and readies a repentant response, reflecting <a href="/job/40-4.htm">Job 40:4</a>&#8212;&#8220;I am unworthy&#8212;how can I reply to You?&#8221; Three practical lessons emerge:<p>&#8226; Humility: correction is not merely possible; it is welcomed (<a href="/proverbs/9-8.htm">Proverbs 9:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Teachability: the wise &#8220;add to their learning&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/1-5.htm">Proverbs 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Accountability: every servant must answer&#8212;<a href="/luke/19-15.htm">Luke 19:15</a> shows the master calling servants to give account.<p>Habakkuk&#8217;s heart is open to adjustment, ensuring that the dialogue with God transforms him, not just informs him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a> portrays a prophet who literally climbs the wall, plants his feet, fixes his eyes, and bows his heart. His disciplined stance, elevated setting, watchful expectation, and humble readiness for correction give us a living model of how to seek, hear, and obey the sovereign Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/habakkuk/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">The Tower.</span>--The practice of ascending a high place to secure an extensive view suggests the figure here. (See <a href="/2_kings/9-17.htm" title="And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?">2Kings 9:17</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/18-24.htm" title="And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.">2Samuel 18:24</a>.) In a yet bolder metaphor Isaiah represents himself as appointing a watchman, who brings reports from his tower. We need not suppose that Habakkuk literally betook himself to a solitary height to wait for a revelation. Balaam, the heathen soothsayer, did so (<a href="/numbers/23-3.htm" title="And Balaam said to Balak, Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatever he shows me I will tell you. And he went to an high place.">Numbers 23:3</a>), but his conduct throws no light on the customs of the Jewish prophets.<p><span class= "bld">What he will say unto me.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">what He will say in me, and what answer I shall make to my complaint: i.e.,</span> of what solution of the perplexities I am deploring, Jehovah shall make me the mouthpiece.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - &sect; 5. <span class="accented">The prophet, waiting for an answer to his expostulation, is bidden to write the oracle in plain characters, because its fulfilment is certain.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Habakkuk speaks with himself, and, mindful of his office, waits for the communication which he confidently ex-poets (<a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I will stand upon my watch</span> (<a href="/isaiah/21-6.htm">Isaiah 21:6, 8</a>). As a watchman goes to a high place to see all around and discern what is coming, so the prophet places himself apart from men, perhaps in some secluded height, in readiness to hear the voice of God and seize the meaning of the coming event. Prophets are called "watchmen" (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/33-2.htm">Ezekiel 33:2, 6</a>; <a href="/micah/7-4.htm">Micah 7:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The tower;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> watch tower, either literally or metaphorically, as in the first clause.

There is no question here concerning the reproofs which others levelled against him, or concerning any rebuke conveyed to him by God - an impression given by the Anglican Version. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will stand</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1506;&#1457;&#1502;&#1465;&#1428;&#1491;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;&#8216;&#277;&#183;m&#333;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect Cohortative - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5975.htm">Strong's 5975: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stand, in various relations</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my guard post</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;mar&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
