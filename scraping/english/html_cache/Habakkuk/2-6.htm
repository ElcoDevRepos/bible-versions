The "all of these" refers to the nations and peoples who have suffered under the oppressive rule of the Babylonians. In the biblical context, a "taunt" is a form of poetic justice, where the oppressed are given a voice to speak against their oppressors. This reflects the biblical theme of divine retribution, where God allows the victims to express their grievances. The use of "mockery and derision" indicates a reversal of fortunes, where the once powerful are now subject to scorn, reminiscent of <a href="/proverbs/3-34.htm">Proverbs 3:34</a>, which states that God mocks the proud but gives grace to the humble.<p><b>&#8216;Woe to him who amasses what is not his</b><br>The "woe" is a prophetic declaration of judgment, common in the Old Testament, particularly in the books of the prophets. It signifies impending doom and divine displeasure. The phrase "amasses what is not his" highlights the sin of greed and theft, a violation of the Eighth Commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>). This is a direct critique of the Babylonian empire, known for its conquests and plundering of other nations. The accumulation of wealth through unjust means is condemned throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/james/5.htm">James 5:1-6</a>, where the rich are warned of the miseries that will come upon them for exploiting others.<p><b>and makes himself rich with many loans!</b><br>This part of the verse addresses the practice of exploiting others through financial means. In ancient times, loans often came with exorbitant interest rates, leading to the debtor's enslavement or loss of property. The Babylonians are depicted as creditors who enrich themselves at the expense of others, a practice condemned in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/25-36.htm">Leviticus 25:36-37</a>). This exploitation is a form of economic oppression, and the Bible consistently advocates for justice and fairness in financial dealings, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7</a>, which warns that the borrower is servant to the lender.<p><b>How long will this go on?&#8217;</b><br>This rhetorical question expresses the frustration and impatience of those suffering under injustice. It echoes the cries of the oppressed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/psalms/13.htm">Psalm 13:1</a>, where David asks, "How long, O LORD? Will You forget me forever?" It reflects a deep yearning for God's intervention and justice. The question also implies that the current state of affairs is unsustainable and that divine judgment is inevitable. This anticipation of God's righteous action is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where the ultimate hope is in God's deliverance and the establishment of His kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the justice and righteousness of His actions, particularly concerning the Babylonian empire.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chaldeans/babylonians.htm">The Chaldeans/Babylonians</a></b><br>The empire that God uses as an instrument of judgment against Judah, known for their greed and oppression.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_oppressed_nations.htm">The Oppressed Nations</a></b><br>The various nations and peoples who suffer under the Babylonian conquest and exploitation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who responds to Habakkuk's concerns and reveals His plans for justice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_taunt.htm">The Taunt</a></b><br>A prophetic declaration against the oppressor, highlighting the moral and spiritual consequences of their actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_greed.htm">The Consequences of Greed</a></b><br>Greed leads to moral and spiritual decay.

History, prophecy, and cross-scriptural witness confirm: prideful accumulation of ill-gotten gain invites certain, public, and humiliating ruin under the righteous rule of the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/habakkuk/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6-20) The destruction of the Chaldaeans has hitherto been only implied. It is now plainly foretold in a denunciatory song, put into the mouths of the invader's victims. In this song there are five strophes, of three verses each, 6-8; 9-11; 12-14; 15-17; 18-20.<p>(6-8) Woe on the reckless rapacity which has spared neither life nor property.<p>(6) <span class= "bld">How long?</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> how long shall this continual annexation be witnessed?<p><span class= "bld">That ladeth himself with thick clay.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">That accumulates to himself usury.</span> So the Targum.

The <span class="accented">destruction of the Babylonians is announced by the mouth of the vanquished nations, who utter five woes against their oppressor. The first woe: for their rapacity.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All these.</span> All the nations and peoples who have been subjugated and barbarously treated by the Babylonians (comp. <a href="/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A parable.</span> A sententious song (see note on Micah 2:4). <span class="cmt_word">A taunting proverb</span>. The Anglican Version combines the two Hebrew words, which stand unconnected, into one notion. So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">loquelam aenigmatum.</span> The latter of the two generally means "riddle," "enigma;" the other word (<span class="accented">melitzah</span>) is by some translated, "a derisive satirical song," or "an obscure, dark saying;" but, as Keil and Delitzsch have shown, is better understood of a bright, clear, brilliant speech. So the two terms signify "a speech containing enigmas," or a song which has double or ambiguous meanings (comp. <a href="/proverbs/1-6.htm">Proverbs 1:6</a>). Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Woe</span> (<a href="/nahum/3-1.htm">Nahum 3:1</a>). This is the first of the five "woes," which consist of three verses each, arranged in strophical form. Increaseth that which is not his. He continues to add to his conquests and possessions, which are not his, because they are acquired by injustice and violence. This is the first denunciation of the Chaldeans for their insatiable rapacity. <span class="cmt_word">How long?</span> The question comes in interjectionally - How long is this state of things to continue unpunished (comp. <a href="/psalms/6-3.htm">Psalm 6:3</a>; <a href="/psalms/90-13.htm">Psalm 90:13</a>)? <span class="cmt_word">That ladeth himself with thick clay;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>, "who loadeth his yoke heavily;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">aggravat contra se densum lutum.</span> The renderings of the Anglican and Latin Versions signify that the riches and spoils with which the conquerors load themselves are no more than burdens of clay, which are in themselves worthless, and only harass the bearers. The Greek Version seems to point to the weight of the yoke imposed by the Chaldeans on them; but Jerome explains it differently, "Ad hoc tantum saevit ut devoret et iniquitatis et praedarum onere quasi gravissima torque se deprimat." The difficulty lies in the <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;</span>, which forms an enigma, or dark saying, because, taken as two words, it might pass current for "thick clay," or "a mass of dirt," while regarded as one word it means "a mass of pledges," "many pledges." That the latter is the signification primarily intended is the view of many modern commentators, who explain the clause thus: The quantity of treasure and booty amassed by the Chaldeans is regarded as a mass of pledges taken from the conquered nations a burden of debt to be discharged one day with heavy retribution. Pusey, "He does in truth <span class="accented">increase against himself a strong pledge</span>, whereby not others are debtors to him, but he is a debtor to Almighty God, who careth for the oppressed (<a href="/jeremiah/17-11.htm">Jeremiah 17:11</a>)." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Will not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1458;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#774;&#183;l&#333;&#183;w-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;ul&#183;l&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of these</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">take up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5375.htm">Strong's 5375: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lift, carry, take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a taunt</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1443;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4912.htm">Strong's 4912: </a> </span><span class="str2">A pithy maxim, a simile</span><br /><br /><span class="word">against him,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;l&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with mockery</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1510;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#601;&#183;l&#238;&#183;&#7779;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4426.htm">Strong's 4426: </a> </span><span class="str2">Satire, a mocking poem</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and riddles</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1491;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#238;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2420.htm">Strong's 2420: </a> </span><span class="str2">A riddle, an enigmatic, perplexing saying or question</span><br /><br /><span class="word">against him,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">saying:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1463;&#1431;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;Woe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1434;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1945.htm">Strong's 1945: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ah!
