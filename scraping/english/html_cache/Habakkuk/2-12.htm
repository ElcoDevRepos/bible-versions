It is often used by prophets to signal divine displeasure and impending judgment. This expression is a warning to those who act unjustly, indicating that their actions will lead to their downfall. In the biblical context, "woe" is a serious admonition, often associated with the consequences of sin and rebellion against God.<p><b>who builds a city with bloodshed</b><br>This phrase highlights the use of violence and oppression in the establishment of power and infrastructure. Historically, many ancient cities were built through conquest and the exploitation of conquered peoples. The reference to "bloodshed" underscores the moral corruption and injustice involved in such endeavors. This can be connected to the story of Cain, who built a city after committing the first murder (<a href="/genesis/4-17.htm">Genesis 4:17</a>), symbolizing the perpetuation of sin and violence. It also echoes the practices of empires like Assyria and Babylon, known for their brutal conquests.<p><b>and establishes a town by iniquity!</b><br>"Iniquity" refers to gross injustice and wickedness. Establishing a town by iniquity suggests the use of deceit, corruption, and exploitation in governance and development. This reflects a society that prioritizes power and wealth over righteousness and justice. The Bible consistently condemns such practices, as seen in the prophetic critiques of Israel and Judah's leaders (e.g., <a href="/micah/3-10.htm">Micah 3:10-12</a>). This phrase serves as a reminder of God's justice and the ultimate futility of building a society on unrighteous foundations. It also foreshadows the coming of Christ, who establishes His kingdom on righteousness and justice, contrasting with the corrupt kingdoms of the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the justice and righteousness of His actions, particularly concerning the Babylonian empire.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire known for its military conquests and oppressive rule, often building its cities and power through violence and exploitation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was under threat from Babylon and whose people were questioning God's justice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who responds to Habakkuk's concerns, revealing His plans for justice and righteousness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chaldeans.htm">The Chaldeans</a></b><br>Another name for the Babylonians, who are used by God as an instrument of judgment but are also subject to His ultimate justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_injustice.htm">The Consequences of Injustice</a></b><br>Building a life or society on injustice and violence leads to divine judgment.

That mercy was not an attribute of Nebuchadnezzar we learn from Daniel's advice to him (<a href="/daniel/4-27.htm">Daniel 4:27</a>). The captives and deported inhabitants of conquered countries were used as slaves in these public works (see an illustration of this from Koyunjik, Rawlinson's 'Anc. Men.,' 1:497). What was true of Assyria was no less true of Babylon. Professor Rawlinson (2:528, etc.) tells of the extreme misery and almost entire ruin of subject kingdoms. Not only are lands wasted, cattle and effects carried off, the people punished by the beheading or impalement of hundreds or thousands, but sometimes wholesale deportation of the inhabitants is practised, tons or hundreds of thousands being carried away captive. "The military successes of the Babylonians," he says (3:332), "were accompanied with needless violence, and with outrages not unusual in the East, which the historian must nevertheless regard as at once crimes and follies. The transplantation of conquered races may, perhaps, have been morally defensible, notwithstanding the sufferings which it involved. But the mutilations of prisoners, the weary imprisonments, the massacre of non-combatants, the refinement of cruelty shown in the execution of children before the eyes of their fathers, - these and similar atrocities, which are recorded of the Babylonians, are wholly without excuse, since they did not so much terrify as exasperate the conquered nations, and thus rather endangered than added strength or security to the empire. A savage and inhuman temper is betrayed by these harsh punishments, one that led its possessors to sacrifice interest to vengeance, and the peace of a kingdom to a tiger-like thirst for blood...we cannot be surprised that, when final judgment was denounced against Babylon, it was declared to be sent in a great measure 'because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwelt therein.'" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/habakkuk/2-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Woe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1435;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1945.htm">Strong's 1945: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ah!
