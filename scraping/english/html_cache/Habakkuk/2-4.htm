In the context of Habakkuk, the "proud one" can be seen as the Babylonians, who were known for their arrogance and oppressive conquests. Pride is a recurring theme in the Bible, often associated with downfall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). The proud rely on their own strength and wisdom, setting themselves against God.<p><b>his soul is not upright&#8212;</b><br>The soul of the proud is described as not upright, indicating moral and spiritual corruption. This reflects a heart that is not aligned with God's will. In biblical terms, an "upright" soul is one that is righteous and in right standing with God. The lack of uprightness suggests a life lived in opposition to divine principles, which ultimately leads to judgment.<p><b>but the righteous will live by faith&#8212;</b><br>This phrase is pivotal in both the Old and New Testaments. It contrasts the proud with the righteous, who are characterized by their faith. In the historical context, the righteous in Judah were called to trust in God despite the impending Babylonian invasion. This principle is foundational in Christian theology, emphasizing that righteousness comes through faith, not works. The Apostle Paul cites this verse in <a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a> and <a href="/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11</a> to support the doctrine of justification by faith. It is also referenced in <a href="/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38</a>, highlighting its enduring significance. This faith is not merely belief but a trust that leads to a life lived in accordance with God's will, pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who embodies perfect faith and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the problem of evil and injustice in the world.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_proud_one.htm">The Proud One</a></b><br>Represents those who are arrogant and self-reliant, often seen as the Babylonians in the context of Habakkuk's prophecy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>Those who are justified and live in accordance with God's will, characterized by their faith and trust in God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire that God uses as an instrument of judgment against Judah, known for its pride and oppression.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing impending judgment due to its own unfaithfulness and injustice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_pride.htm">The Danger of Pride</a></b><br>Pride leads to a distorted soul and ultimately to downfall.

Habakkuk himself models this, waiting quietly for the Lord even while Babylon advances (<a href="/habakkuk/3-16.htm">Habakkuk 3:16&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; The New Testament cites this line three times&#8212;<a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11</a>, <a href="/hebrews/10-37.htm">Hebrews 10:37&#8211;38</a>&#8212;to show that justification and ongoing perseverance both rest on faith, not works.<p>&#8226; Practical implications:<p>&#8211; Faith looks upward&#8212;trusting God&#8217;s character when circumstances are dark.<p>&#8211; Faith looks outward&#8212;resting in Christ&#8217;s finished work instead of self-effort.<p>&#8211; Faith looks forward&#8212;anticipating God&#8217;s ultimate vindication when &#8220;the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Habakkuk 2:4</a> draws a sharp contrast. Pride bends the soul away from God and leads to ruin, but faith straightens the heart toward God and brings true life. In every age the Lord sets before us the same choice: stand with the proud whose confidence is in themselves, or stand with the righteous who live&#8212;now and forever&#8212;by trusting Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/habakkuk/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Behold his soul</span>. . . .--Better, <span class= "ital">Behold his soul within him is puffed up, it is not upright.</span> The soul of the Chaldaean invader is inflated with pride, self-dependence ousting from his mind all thoughts of God. It is therefore unsound and distorted. Habakkuk leaves the inference "and therefore it shall die" to be imagined, and hastens to the antithesis, "<span class= "ital">But the righteous man shall live by his faith.</span>" The word <span class= "ital">live</span> is emphatic. The reward promised to patient waitings on God is <span class= "ital">life</span>--deliverance from destruction. How far the promise extends, and whether it includes that aspiration after future life which is plainly expressed by many Hebrew poets and prophets, we cannot determine. The student must be cautioned against such renderings as "he that is righteous-by-faith shall live," or, "he that is justified-by-faith shall live," which have been suggested by the Pauline quotations <a href="/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a>, <a href="/galatians/3-11.htm" title="But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.">Galatians 3:11</a>. If the adjective could be taken in this close collocation with the substantive, "he that is consistent in-his-confidence shall live" would be the only possible rendering. Thus whatever force we assign to St. Paul's citation, here, at least, the words have no doctrinal significance. Their ethical importance is, however, undeniable. (See Introduction 4)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - &sect; 6. <span class="accented">The great principle is taught that the proud shall not continue, but the just shall live by faith.</span> The prophecy commences with a fundamental thought, applicable to all God's dealings with man. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him;</span> literally, <span class="accented">behold, puffed up, his soul is not upright in him.</span> This is a description of an evil character (especially of the Chaldean) in opposition to the character delineated in the following hemistich. One who is proud, presumptuous, thinks much of himself, despising others, and is not straightforward and upright before God, shall not live, shall not have a happy, safe life; he carries in himself the seeds of destruction. The result is not expressed in the first hemistich, but may be supplied from the next clause, and, as Knabenbauer suggests, may be inferred from the language in <a href="/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38, 39</a>, where, after quoting the Septuagint rendering of this passage, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, the writer adds, "But we are not of them that shrink back (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>) unto perdition." Vulgate, <span class="accented">Ecce</span>, <span class="accented">qui incredulus est, non erit recta anima ejus in semetipso</span>, which seems to confine the statement to the case of one who doubts God's word. <span class="cmt_word">But the just shall live by his faith.</span> The "faith" here spoken of is a loving trust in God, confidence in his promises, resulting in due performance of his will. This hemistich is the antithesis to the former. The proud and perverse, those who wish to be independent of God, shall perish; but, on the other hand, the righteous shall live and be saved through his faith, on the condition that he puts his trust in God. The Hebrew accents forbid the union, "the just by faith," though, of course, no one can be just, righteous, without faith. The passage may be emphasized by rendering, "As to the just, through his faith he shall live." This famous sentence, which St. Paul has used as the basis of his great argument (<a href="/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-11.htm">Galatians 3:11</a>; comp. <a href="/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38</a>), in its literal and contextual application implies that the righteous man will have perfect trust in God's promises and will be rewarded by being safe in the day of tribulation, with reference to the coming trouble at the hands of the Chaldeans. When the proud, greedy kingdom shall have sunk in ruin, the faithful people shall live secure. But the application is not confined to this circumstance. The promise looks beyond the temporal future of the Chaldeans and Israelites, and unto a reward that is eternal. We see how naturally the principle here enunciated is applied by the apostle to teach the doctrine of justification by faith in Christ. The LXX. gives, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x2c;&#x3b5;&#x2e;</span> "by faith in me." The Speaker is God. St. Paul omits <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Habakkuk gathers into one sentence the whole principle of the Law, and indeed all true religion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/habakkuk/2-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Look at</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo! behold!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the proud one;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1467;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;up&#183;p&#601;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Pual - Perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6075.htm">Strong's 6075: </a> </span><span class="str2">To swell, be elated</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his soul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(nap&#772;&#183;&#353;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
