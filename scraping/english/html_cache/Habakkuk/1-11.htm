The imagery of the wind suggests both speed and an uncontrollable force, emphasizing the power and ferocity of their conquests. Historically, the Babylonians were known for their rapid military campaigns, which allowed them to dominate much of the ancient Near East. This aligns with the biblical context of Habakkuk, where God is using the Babylonians as an instrument of judgment against Judah. The metaphor of the wind is also used in other scriptures, such as in <a href="/job/21-18.htm">Job 21:18</a> and <a href="/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>, to describe something transient and powerful.<p><b>They are guilty;</b><br>This phrase indicates the moral culpability of the Babylonians. Despite being used by God as a tool for judgment, they are not exempt from guilt. Their actions, driven by pride and violence, are inherently sinful. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God can use even unrighteous nations to fulfill His purposes, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-7</a> with Assyria. The concept of divine sovereignty over human actions is a recurring theme in scripture, highlighting God's ultimate control over history while still holding individuals and nations accountable for their sins.<p><b>their own strength is their god.&#8221;</b><br>Here, the Babylonians' idolatry is exposed. They worship their military might and rely on their power rather than acknowledging the true God. This self-reliance and pride are condemned throughout the Bible, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, which warns that pride precedes destruction. The worship of strength and power is a form of idolatry, replacing God with human achievement. This is contrasted with the biblical call to trust in God alone, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>, which emphasizes reliance on the Lord rather than on human power. This idolatry is a type of the ultimate rejection of God, which is fulfilled in the New Testament through the person of Jesus Christ, who embodies true strength through humility and obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the injustice he sees in Judah and the impending judgment through the Babylonians.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_chaldeans.htm">The Chaldeans (Babylonians)</a></b><br>A powerful empire used by God as an instrument of judgment against Judah.

But he is guilty, making this his strength his god.</span> By an abrupt transition the latter half of the verse diverts our attention from the human view of the world-conqueror to his appearance in God's sight. Men only see an irresistible force sweeping over the face of the earth like a whirlwind; here to-day, and to-morrow nothing but devastation and ruin to testify to its visit. And men are dazzled by this mighty display of power. But, even as Daniel at Belshazzar's feast, Habakkuk pronounces the oppressor's doom in the very hour of triumph. The description of the irresistible invader drops into the sudden depths of anti-climax, "But he is (counted) <span class= "ital">guilty.</span>" His guilt consists just in what men deem so glorious, in his self-reliant irresponsible pursuit of grandeur. The brute force of armaments is the supreme deity of the Chaldaean. His sword and spear are, as it were, his idols.

(Comp. <a href="/daniel/5-23.htm" title="But have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before you, and you, and your lords, your wives, and your concubines, have drunk wine in them; and you have praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand your breath is, and whose are all your ways, have you not glorified:">Daniel 5:23</a>.)
