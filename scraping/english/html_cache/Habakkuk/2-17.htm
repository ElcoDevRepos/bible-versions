The Babylonians, like other empires, sought the valuable resources of Lebanon, leading to deforestation and environmental degradation. This violence is symbolic of broader imperial aggression and exploitation. The prophecy indicates that the same violence they inflicted would return upon them, a principle seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, "Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows."<p><b>and the destruction of animals will terrify you</b><br>The destruction of animals highlights the ecological impact of Babylon's conquests. The Babylonians' actions led to the disruption of natural habitats, causing fear and chaos in the animal kingdom. This reflects a broader biblical theme of stewardship over creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, where humanity is given dominion over the earth to care for it, not exploit it. The terror that will come upon the Babylonians is a reversal of their own actions, emphasizing divine justice.<p><b>because of your bloodshed against men</b><br>This phrase underscores the Babylonians' brutal conquests and the bloodshed they caused among nations. The Bible consistently condemns unjust violence and murder, as seen in the commandment "You shall not murder" (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>). The bloodshed is a direct violation of God's law and a cause for divine retribution. The Babylonians' actions are reminiscent of Cain's murder of Abel, where God declares that Abel's blood cries out from the ground (<a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a>).<p><b>and your violence against the land</b><br>The violence against the land refers to the devastation and ruin left in the wake of Babylonian conquests. This destruction is not only physical but also spiritual, as the land is often seen as a gift from God to be cherished and preserved. The land's suffering is a recurring theme in the prophets, who often speak of the land mourning due to the sins of its inhabitants (<a href="/jeremiah/12-4.htm">Jeremiah 12:4</a>). This phrase highlights the interconnectedness of sin, humanity, and creation.<p><b>the city, and all their dwellers</b><br>The city represents the centers of human civilization and culture, which the Babylonians often destroyed or subjugated. The dwellers are the people who suffered under Babylonian rule, experiencing oppression and exile. This phrase emphasizes the comprehensive nature of Babylon's violence, affecting every aspect of life. The prophecy serves as a warning that such actions will lead to their downfall, as seen in the eventual fall of Babylon to the Medes and Persians (Daniel 5). The destruction of cities and their inhabitants is a recurring theme in biblical prophecy, often serving as a type of the final judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the justice and judgment upon Judah and the surrounding nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/lebanon.htm">Lebanon</a></b><br>A region known for its majestic cedar trees, often symbolizing strength and pride.

The "destruction of beasts" points, we think, to a raid on the cattle feeding on the sides of Lebanon. But more than this is probably included in the phrase <span class= "ital">the violence done to Lebanon.</span> Habakkuk probably foresees how the invader will cut down the cedar forests in Lebanon to adorn the palaces of Babylon. (Comp. <a href="/context/isaiah/14-7.htm" title="The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth into singing.">Isaiah 14:7-8</a>.) All these outrages shall in due time be Avenged on himself. Some commentators, however, explain the expression as a bold synecdoche, Lebanon representing the Holy Land (of which it was the beauty), or even the Temple, both of which Nebuchadnezzar laid waste.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee;</span> LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39b;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: <span class="accented">iniquitas Libani</span> (Vulgate). It would be plainer if translated, "the violence against," or "practised on, Lebanon," as the sentence refers to the devastation inflicted by the Chaldeans on the forests of Lebanon (comp. <a href="/isaiah/14-8.htm">Isaiah 14:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>). Jerome confines the expression in the text to the demolition of the temple at Jerusalem in the construction of which much cedar was employed; others take Lebanon as a figure for Palestine generally, or for Jerusalem itself; but it is best understood literally. The same devastation which the Chaldeans made in Lebanon shall "cover," overwhelm, and destroy them. <span class="cmt_word">And the spoil of beasts, which made them afraid.</span> The introduction of the relative is not required, and the passage may be better translated, <span class="accented">And the destruction of beasts made them</span> (others read "thee") <span class="accented">afraid.</span> Septuagint, "And the wretchedness of the beasts shall affright thee." Jerome, in his commentary, renders, "Et vastitas animalium opprimet te." The meaning is that the wholesale destruction of the wild animals of Lebanon, occasioned by the operations of the Chaldeans, shall be visited upon this people. They warred not only against men, but against the lower creatures too; and for this retributive punishment awaited them. <span class="cmt_word">Because of men's blood,</span> etc. The reason rendered in ver. 8 is here repeated.
