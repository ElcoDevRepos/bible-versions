Mountains, often seen as symbols of strength and permanence, are depicted as trembling before God. This imagery is reminiscent of other biblical events, such as Mount Sinai quaking when God gave the Law to Moses (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>). It underscores God's supreme power over nature and His ability to command even the most formidable elements of the earth. The quaking of mountains can also symbolize the upheaval and transformation that occurs when God intervenes in human history.<p><b>torrents of water swept by.</b><br>This part of the verse evokes the image of powerful, rushing waters, which can be seen as a metaphor for God's judgment and cleansing power. In the Bible, water often symbolizes chaos and destruction, as seen in the story of Noah's flood (Genesis 7). However, it can also represent purification and renewal, as in the waters of baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>). The sweeping torrents may allude to God's ability to wash away sin and bring about new beginnings, as well as His control over the forces of nature.<p><b>The deep roared with its voice</b><br>The "deep" refers to the primordial waters or the sea, often associated with chaos and mystery in ancient Near Eastern thought. The roaring of the deep signifies the overwhelming power and majesty of God, who commands even the most untamed aspects of creation. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/psalms/93-4.htm">Psalm 93:4</a>, where the Lord is described as mightier than the thunder of the great waters. The deep's voice can also be seen as a testament to God's sovereignty over all creation, including the chaotic and unknown.<p><b>and lifted its hands on high.</b><br>This phrase personifies the deep, suggesting a gesture of submission or praise. Lifting hands is a common biblical expression of worship and supplication (<a href="/psalms/134-2.htm">Psalm 134:2</a>). Here, it indicates that even the most chaotic elements of creation recognize and honor God's authority. This imagery can be connected to the idea of all creation longing for redemption and restoration, as described in <a href="/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19-22</a>. It also points to the ultimate reconciliation of all things under Christ, who has authority over heaven and earth (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mountains.htm">Mountains</a></b><br>Symbolic of stability and permanence, the mountains quaking signifies the power and majesty of God that even the most stable elements of creation respond to His presence.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/downpour_of_waters.htm">Downpour of Waters</a></b><br>Represents the overwhelming and cleansing power of God, often associated with His judgment and blessing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_deep.htm">The Deep</a></b><br>Refers to the primordial waters or the sea, which in Hebrew thought often symbolizes chaos.
