It echoes the biblical theme of God turning the plans of the wicked back on themselves, as seen in stories like Haman's gallows in <a href="/esther/7-10.htm">Esther 7:10</a>. The imagery of piercing the head signifies a fatal blow, symbolizing total defeat. This can be seen as a type of Christ's victory over Satan, where the cross, a tool of death, becomes the means of salvation (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<p><b>when his warriors stormed out to scatter us</b><br>The context here is one of impending invasion and destruction. The "warriors" represent the Babylonians, known for their military prowess and aggressive conquests. Historically, the Babylonian army was feared for its ability to scatter and subdue nations, as seen in the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC. This scattering is reminiscent of the curses for disobedience in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>, where God warns Israel of being scattered among the nations.<p><b>gloating as though ready to secretly devour the weak</b><br>This phrase captures the arrogance and cruelty of the oppressors. The imagery of "gloating" suggests a sense of pride and overconfidence, often condemned in Scripture (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). The idea of "secretly devour" implies treachery and exploitation of the vulnerable, a common theme in prophetic literature where God defends the oppressed (<a href="/isaiah/10.htm">Isaiah 10:1-2</a>). This can also be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's mission to protect and uplift the weak and marginalized (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the justice and sovereignty of God amidst the wickedness and suffering in Judah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in the book, who responds to Habakkuk's questions and reveals His plans for judgment and salvation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_enemy.htm">The Enemy</a></b><br>Represents the oppressors of God's people, often seen as the Babylonians in the context of Habakkuk, who are used by God as instruments of judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wretched_in_hiding.htm">The Wretched in Hiding</a></b><br>Symbolizes the faithful remnant of God's people who are oppressed and in need of deliverance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spear.htm">The Spear</a></b><br>A metaphor for God's intervention and judgment against the oppressors, turning their own weapons against them.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment</a></b><br>God is in control of all nations and uses them according to His purposes.

There is a difficulty in arriving at the meaning of this last word. The LXX. renders it, "mighty men;" Jerome, "warriors;" Chaldee, "army;" Delitzsch and many modern critics, "hordes" or "inhabitants of the plain;" others again, "rulers" or "judges."
