The imagery of God wielding a bow symbolizes His readiness to execute judgment and deliverance. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the bow was a powerful weapon, representing strength and authority. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where God is portrayed as a warrior, such as in <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>, "The LORD is a warrior; the LORD is His name." The bow also signifies God's covenant promises, as seen in <a href="/genesis/9-13.htm">Genesis 9:13</a>, where the rainbow is a sign of God's covenant with Noah.<p><b>You called for many arrows.</b><br>The calling for many arrows suggests an abundance of divine intervention and judgment. Arrows in the Bible often symbolize God's swift and precise judgment, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-23.htm">Deuteronomy 32:23</a>, "I will heap disasters upon them; I will spend my arrows against them." This phrase emphasizes God's control over creation and His ability to summon His forces to accomplish His purposes. It also reflects the idea of God as a commander, orchestrating events according to His will.<p><b>Selah</b><br>The term "Selah" is a musical or liturgical pause found frequently in the Psalms and occasionally in other poetic books like Habakkuk. Its exact meaning is uncertain, but it is generally understood as a pause for reflection or emphasis. In this context, it invites the reader to pause and consider the majesty and power of God as a divine warrior. It serves as a moment to reflect on the preceding imagery and its implications for understanding God's nature and actions.<p><b>You split the earth with rivers.</b><br>This phrase highlights God's sovereignty over nature and His ability to reshape the earth. The imagery of splitting the earth with rivers may allude to the creation narrative, where God separates waters and forms dry land (<a href="/genesis/1-9.htm">Genesis 1:9-10</a>). It also recalls the miraculous events during the Exodus, such as the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>) and the provision of water from the rock (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>). These acts demonstrate God's power to provide and protect His people. The splitting of the earth with rivers can also symbolize the transformative power of God's word and presence, bringing life and renewal to creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the justice and sovereignty of God amidst the suffering of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, depicted as a divine warrior preparing for battle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bow_and_arrows.htm">Bow and Arrows</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's power and readiness to execute judgment and deliverance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/earth_and_rivers.htm">Earth and Rivers</a></b><br>Represent the natural world, which responds to God's mighty acts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_judgment_and_deliverance.htm">God's Sovereignty in Judgment and Deliverance</a></b><br>The imagery of God brandishing a bow signifies His control over history and His ability to bring about justice and deliverance for His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god's_word.htm">The Power of God's Word</a></b><br>Just as arrows are sent forth with purpose, God's word accomplishes His will, reminding us of the power and effectiveness of Scripture in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/n/nature's_response_to_god's_authority.htm">Nature's Response to God's Authority</a></b><br>The splitting of the earth with rivers illustrates the natural world's submission to God's command, encouraging us to recognize His authority in all creation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/selah--a_call_to_reflect.htm">Selah - A Call to Reflect</a></b><br>The term "Selah" invites us to pause and reflect on the majesty and power of God, encouraging deeper meditation on His works and character.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_ultimate_plan.htm">Trust in God's Ultimate Plan</a></b><br>Despite current circumstances, we can trust in God's ultimate plan for justice and redemption, as He is actively working in the world.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Habakkuk_3_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Habakkuk 3:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Habakkuk_3_9_God_s_power_in_life.htm">How does Habakkuk 3:9 illustrate God's power and authority in your life?

Scripture records many occasions when God literally fought for His people&#8212;whether hurling hailstones in <a href="/joshua/10-11.htm">Joshua 10:11</a> or sending an angel army in <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>. Habakkuk recalls those factual interventions and expects the same God to act again.<p>&#8226; The image assures believers that the Lord never lays aside His power. When injustice seems to reign, His bow is already poised, guaranteeing both judgment on evil and protection for the faithful (<a href="/psalms/18-14.htm">Psalm 18:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You called for many arrows.

Just as <a href="/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a> speaks of arrows piercing the king&#8217;s foes, every shaft here will hit its mark; not one injustice escapes.<p>&#8226; Selah invites a pause&#8212;time to let the certainty of God&#8217;s decisive answers sink in before moving to the next scene.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You split the earth with rivers.</b><p>&#8226; The vision shifts from sky to soil. The same God who aimed arrows now tears open the ground, sending waters in every direction. <a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a> shows Him literally parting the Red Sea; <a href="/joshua/3-13.htm">Joshua 3:13</a> records the Jordan stopping in its course. Habakkuk&#8217;s phrasing echoes those events, affirming their historic reality while applying the lesson to future deliverance.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/74-15.htm">Psalm 74:15</a> declares, &#8220;You split open springs and streams,&#8221; confirming that geological upheaval is within His toolbox.

And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.">Exodus 17:6</a>; <a href="/numbers/20-11.htm" title="And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.">Numbers 20:11</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The prophet continues his description of the Lord as "a man of war" (<a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thy bow was made quite naked.</span> The sheath of the bow was laid aside to make it ready for use. In the Assyrian monuments the bow case forms part of the quiver, and holds only the lower half of the bow (Rawlinson, 'Anc. Mon.,' 2:55, edit. 1864). It was fastened to the side of the chariot or carried at the back of the archer. (For the general sense, comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/32-40.htm">Deuteronomy 32:40</a>, etc.; <a href="/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>.) In the Revelation (<a href="/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>) he that sits on the white horse has a bow. <span class="cmt_word">According to the oaths of the tribes, even thy word;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou doest all this to confirm the promises of deliverance and salvation made to the tribes of Israel This sense is satisfactory; but the Hebrew text is corrupt, and cannot be explained with any certainty. The Revised Version gives," The oaths to the tribes were a sure word;" in the margin, "Sworn were the chastisements (Hebrew, 'rods') of thy word." Thus Dr. Briggs: "Sworn are the rods of thy word." Orelli translates," Oaths, rods of the word," and explains the clause to mean that the Lord comes to execute the denounced punishment, which proceeds from his mouth like chastising rods. The word <span class="accented">mattoth</span> is translated "tribes" (as in <a href="/2_chronicles/5-2.htm">2 Chronicles 5:2</a>) or "rods." Keil contends for the latter, as instruments of chastisement, rendering," Rods are sworn by word" Henderson, taking the words as a military signal, curiously translates, "'Sevens of spears' was the word." Pusey supports the Authorized Version, which, indeed. gives a good sense, and is probably correct It is virtually supported by Jerome, who has, "Suscitans suscitabis arcum tuum, juramenta tribubus quae locutus es," "Thou wilt awaken the oaths," which, so long as the evil prospered, seemed to be forgotten and sleeping. The LXX. emits the word rendered "oaths," and translates <span class="accented">mattoth</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span>, thus: <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "Thou didst surely bend thy bow against sceptres." <span class="cmt_word">Selah</span>. A pause ensues before the introduction of a new series of natural phenomena, accompanying the Lord's epiphany (see on ver. 3). The next clause would be more fitly joined with ver. 10. <span class="cmt_word">Thou didst cleave the earth with</span> (or, <span class="accented">into</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>rivers</span>. This refers to some catastrophe like that which happened at the Flood, when "the fountains of the great deep were broken up" (<a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>; comp. <a href="/psalms/77-16.htm">Psalm 77:16</a>).
