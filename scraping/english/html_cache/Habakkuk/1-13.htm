In biblical context, God's holiness is a central theme, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>, where the seraphim declare, "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty." The idea that God cannot look upon evil underscores His separation from sin and His perfect nature. This purity is a standard that sets God apart from humanity, who is inherently sinful (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>). Theologically, this purity is essential for understanding the need for atonement and the role of Jesus Christ as the sinless sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>).<p><b>and You cannot tolerate wrongdoing</b><br>This statement reflects God's justice and righteousness. Throughout the Old Testament, God is portrayed as a just judge who cannot ignore sin (<a href="/psalms/5-4.htm">Psalm 5:4-5</a>). The historical context of Habakkuk involves the impending Babylonian invasion, a time when injustice and violence were rampant. God's intolerance of wrongdoing is a reassurance that He will ultimately judge and rectify all wrongs, aligning with the prophetic declarations of judgment found in books like Jeremiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>So why do You tolerate the faithless?</b><br>Here, Habakkuk questions God's apparent tolerance of the faithless, specifically the Babylonians, who were known for their cruelty and idolatry. This reflects a common biblical theme of questioning God's justice, as seen in Job and the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/73.htm">Psalm 73</a>). The faithless are those who do not follow God's covenant, contrasting with the faithful remnant of Israel. This tension highlights the struggle to understand God's ways, which are higher than human ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><b>Why are You silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?</b><br>This phrase captures the prophet's lament over the prosperity of the wicked and the suffering of the righteous, a theme also explored in <a href="/psalms/37.htm">Psalm 37</a> and Ecclesiastes. The historical context involves the Babylonian conquest, where the wicked (Babylonians) were used as instruments of judgment against Judah, who, despite their sins, were seen as more righteous than their conquerors. This raises questions about divine justice and theodicy. Theologically, it points to the ultimate justice of God, who will vindicate the righteous in His time (<a href="/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10-11</a>). The silence of God is a test of faith, encouraging believers to trust in His sovereign plan, as ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who suffered unjustly yet triumphed over evil (<a href="/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the problem of evil and injustice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The Holy and Righteous One, whose purity and justice are central themes in this verse.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wicked.htm">The Wicked</a></b><br>Refers to the Babylonians, known for their cruelty and idolatry, whom God is using as an instrument of judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_righteous.htm">The Righteous</a></b><br>Represents the people of Judah, who, despite their own failings, are seen as more righteous than the Babylonians.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing impending judgment and conquest by Babylon.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_holiness_and_justice.htm">God's Holiness and Justice</a></b><br>God's nature is inherently pure and just.

Habakkuk therefore expects immediate judgment on sin.<p>- The apparent delay in judgment creates tension. Yet Scripture repeatedly shows that God&#8217;s patience serves a redemptive purpose (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>), even while His intolerance of sin remains intact.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So why do You tolerate the faithless?</b><p>- &#8220;Faithless&#8221; points to the Babylonians (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6-7</a>), a nation with no covenant relationship to the Lord.<p>- Jeremiah voiced a similar cry: &#8220;Why does the way of the wicked prosper?&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/12-1.htm">Jeremiah 12:1</a>). The psalmist echoed, &#8220;Surely in vain have I kept my heart pure&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/73-13.htm">Psalm 73:13</a>).<p>- Habakkuk&#8217;s question is not unbelief but honest wrestling: If God hates wrongdoing, why allow godless oppressors to rise?<p>- The prophet reminds us that bringing questions to God is part of living faith; it drives us deeper into His character rather than away from Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why are You silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?</b><p>- Judah, though sinful, is &#8220;more righteous&#8221; than Babylon. Yet Babylon seems to triumph.<p>- Silence from heaven intensifies the dilemma (<a href="/psalms/10-1.htm">Psalm 10:1</a>). Job felt this same stillness amid injustice (<a href="/job/21-7.htm">Job 21:7-13</a>).<p>- God will answer in <a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3-4</a>: the vision &#8220;awaits an appointed time,&#8221; and &#8220;the righteous will live by faith.&#8221; Judgment is certain, but it is timed according to divine wisdom, not human impatience.<p>- History bears this out: Babylon&#8217;s fall (<a href="/bsb/jeremiah/51.htm">Jeremiah 51</a>), the cross where apparent silence ended in resurrection (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23-24</a>), and the promised return of Christ (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>) all testify that God&#8217;s silence is never indifference but often preparation for decisive action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a> captures the clash between what we know of God&#8217;s holy character and what we sometimes see in a fallen world. The verse affirms that God is impeccably pure and cannot condone evil, yet it also gives voice to the believer&#8217;s perplexity when divine justice seems delayed. Scripture answers that God&#8217;s timing serves His redemptive purposes; His silence is not approval but patience that ultimately magnifies His righteousness. The call is to trust His character, wait for His appointed time, and live by faith until His justice is fully revealed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/habakkuk/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) The prophet's confidence is tempered, however, with anxious fear.
