In biblical context, visions often convey divine messages or prophecies. The "appointed time" suggests God's sovereign control over history, indicating that events unfold according to His divine schedule. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's perfect timing, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, which states there is a time for every purpose under heaven. The concept of an appointed time is also echoed in <a href="/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>, where visions are tied to specific future events.<p><b>it testifies of the end and does not lie.</b><br>The vision's testimony "of the end" implies a future fulfillment, often associated with eschatological events. This phrase reassures the reader of the certainty and truthfulness of God's promises, as God cannot lie (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). The "end" may refer to the culmination of God's plan, similar to the prophetic visions in the Book of Revelation. The assurance that it "does not lie" emphasizes the reliability of God's word, paralleling <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, which declares that God's word will accomplish what He desires.<p><b>Though it lingers, wait for it,</b><br>The notion of lingering suggests a delay from a human perspective, yet it calls for patience and faith. This echoes the biblical principle of waiting on the Lord, as seen in <a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>. The call to "wait for it" encourages believers to trust in God's timing, even when immediate circumstances seem unchanged. This patience is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/james/5-7.htm">James 5:7-8</a>, which urges believers to be patient for the Lord's coming.<p><b>since it will surely come and will not delay.</b><br>This assurance underscores the certainty of the prophecy's fulfillment. The phrase "will surely come" reflects the inevitability of God's promises, reminiscent of the certainty expressed in <a href="/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a> about the earth being filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord. The apparent contradiction between lingering and not delaying highlights the difference between human perception and divine timing. This is similar to <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, which explains that the Lord is not slow in keeping His promise, but is patient, not wanting anyone to perish.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/habakkuk.htm">Habakkuk</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who dialogues with God about the justice and righteousness of His actions, particularly concerning the impending Babylonian invasion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire that God uses as an instrument of judgment against Judah, which is central to the context of Habakkuk's prophecies.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing judgment due to its disobedience and idolatry, prompting Habakkuk's lament and God's response.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision.htm">The Vision</a></b><br>Refers to the revelation given to Habakkuk concerning the future, including the eventual downfall of Babylon and the restoration of God's people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_appointed_time.htm">The Appointed Time</a></b><br>A divinely determined moment when God's plans will be fulfilled, emphasizing God's sovereignty over history.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_timing_is_perfect.htm">God's Timing is Perfect</a></b><br>Trust in God's timing, even when it seems delayed.

The psalmist models it: &#8220;Wait patiently for the LORD; be strong&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Delay tests faith, exposing whether we live by sight or by the certainty of God&#8217;s word (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p>&#8226; What feels slow to us is mercy from God, &#8220;not wanting anyone to perish&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>), giving time for repentance and growth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It will surely come and will not delay</b><p>&#8226; Divine delay is never denial; once the clock strikes God&#8217;s hour, fulfillment moves swiftly (<a href="/isaiah/60-22.htm">Isaiah 60:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The writer to the Hebrews echoes this verse: &#8220;In just a little while, He who is coming will come and will not delay&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-37.htm">Hebrews 10:37</a>), tying it to Christ&#8217;s return.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s promises are &#8220;Yes&#8221; and &#8220;Amen&#8221; in Jesus (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>); certainty flows from covenant faithfulness, not from circumstances.<p>&#8226; Like the closing words of Revelation&#8212;&#8220;Yes, I am coming soon&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20</a>)&#8212;the verse seals hope with divine certainty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a> assures us that God&#8217;s prophetic word operates on His flawless timetable, bears truthful witness to the climactic victory He has ordained, calls believers to patient, active trust amid apparent delay, and guarantees certain, unhindered fulfillment.
