The servant's action reflects the urgency and care in responding to the boy's condition. The cultural context shows the importance of family and community support in times of crisis. This act of carrying the boy to his mother can be seen as a gesture of compassion and duty, reminiscent of how believers are called to bear one another's burdens (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>).<p><b>the boy sat on her lap until noon</b><br>The image of the boy sitting on his mother's lap is poignant, symbolizing the close bond between mother and child. In biblical times, the lap was often a place of comfort and security, reflecting the nurturing role of the mother. The mention of "until noon" may indicate the passage of time and the mother's hope for her child's recovery. This scene can be compared to the nurturing care God provides to His children, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/66-13.htm">Isaiah 66:13</a>, where God comforts His people as a mother comforts her child.<p><b>and then he died</b><br>The death of the boy introduces a moment of deep sorrow and testing of faith. In the broader biblical narrative, death is a consequence of the fall (Genesis 3) and a reminder of human mortality. This event sets the stage for a miraculous intervention by the prophet Elisha, foreshadowing the power of God over life and death. It also parallels the resurrection power seen in the New Testament, particularly in the miracles of Jesus, such as the raising of Jairus's daughter (<a href="/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41-42</a>). This moment of death and subsequent resurrection serves as a type of Christ's own death and resurrection, offering hope of eternal life to believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shunammite_woman.htm">The Shunammite Woman</a></b><br>A notable woman from Shunem who showed hospitality to Elisha, the prophet.

Though servants and fathers may act, a mother&#8217;s embrace is often God&#8217;s chosen place of comfort.<p>&#8226; This transfer also underlines the boy&#8217;s genuine physical distress; he needed to be carried, confirming the seriousness that would soon culminate in death (<a href="/mark/5-35.htm">Mark 5:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the boy sat on her lap until noon</b><p>&#8226; The mother cradles him, just as Christ later &#8220;took the children in His arms and blessed them&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-16.htm">Mark 10:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Time passes&#8212;&#8220;until noon.&#8221; Midday can symbolize the height of natural light and strength, yet <a href="/psalms/91-6.htm">Psalm 91:6</a> speaks of destruction striking even &#8220;at noon,&#8221; reminding us that human vigor cannot forestall mortality.<p>&#8226; Her lap becomes an altar of waiting. Every minute deepens the mother&#8217;s awareness of impending loss and readies the stage for a miracle paralleling Elijah with the widow&#8217;s son (<a href="/1_kings/17-17.htm">1 Kings 17:17-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and then he died</b><p>&#8226; Scripture reports this plainly and literally; the child&#8217;s life ceased.
