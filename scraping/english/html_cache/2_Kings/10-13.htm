Ahaziah, king of Judah, was related to the house of Ahab through his mother, Athaliah, who was Ahab's daughter. This connection made Ahaziah's relatives potential targets in Jehu's purge. The meeting likely took place in the northern kingdom of Israel, as Jehu was traveling from Jezreel to Samaria. This encounter highlights the interconnectedness of the royal families of Israel and Judah during this period.<p><b>and asked, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</b><br>Jehu's question was likely a strategic inquiry to identify whether these individuals were allies or enemies. In the context of his mission, it was crucial for Jehu to discern the loyalties of those he encountered. This question also reflects the tension and uncertainty of the time, as Jehu was consolidating his power and eliminating threats to his rule.<p><b>&#8220;We are relatives of Ahaziah,&#8221; they answered,</b><br>The response indicates their familial connection to the king of Judah, which would have been significant in the context of the political alliances and enmities of the time. Their identification as relatives of Ahaziah placed them in a precarious position, given Jehu's mandate to destroy the house of Ahab. This statement also underscores the broader theme of kinship and its implications in the biblical narrative, where family ties often influenced political and spiritual outcomes.<p><b>&#8220;and we have come down to greet the sons of the king and of the queen mother.&#8221;</b><br>Their intention to greet the sons of the king and the queen mother suggests a visit of political or familial significance, possibly to maintain alliances or show loyalty. The "sons of the king" likely refers to the sons of Joram, king of Israel, who was recently killed by Jehu. The "queen mother" would be Jezebel, who wielded significant influence in the kingdom. This phrase highlights the practice of royal visits and the importance of maintaining relationships within the ruling class. It also foreshadows the impending judgment on the house of Ahab, as Jehu's mission was to eliminate all potential heirs and supporters of Ahab's dynasty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>The king of Israel, anointed by God to destroy the house of Ahab and eradicate Baal worship from Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/relatives_of_ahaziah.htm">Relatives of Ahaziah</a></b><br>These individuals were related to Ahaziah, the king of Judah, and were on their way to visit the royal family of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaziah.htm">Ahaziah</a></b><br>The king of Judah, who was allied with the house of Ahab through marriage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_the_king_and_queen_mother.htm">Sons of the King and Queen Mother</a></b><br>Refers to the royal family of Israel, specifically the descendants of Ahab and Jezebel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel_and_judah.htm">Israel and Judah</a></b><br>The divided kingdoms of God's chosen people, often at odds but sometimes allied through marriage and political agreements.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_judgment_and_justice.htm">Divine Judgment and Justice</a></b><br>God's justice is executed through Jehu, reminding us that God will not overlook sin and idolatry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_ungodly_alliances.htm">The Danger of Ungodly Alliances</a></b><br>The relatives of Ahaziah were caught in the crossfire due to their association with the house of Ahab, illustrating the risks of aligning with ungodly influences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>Jehu's actions, though violent, were in obedience to God's command to eradicate idolatry, emphasizing the importance of following God's directives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_sin.htm">The Consequences of Sin</a></b><br>The destruction of Ahab's house serves as a warning about the long-term consequences of sin and rebellion against God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_relationships.htm">Discernment in Relationships</a></b><br>The encounter between Jehu and Ahaziah's relatives underscores the need for discernment in our relationships and associations.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_10_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 10:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_10_13_Disobedience_s_outcome.htm">How does 2 Kings 10:13 illustrate the consequences of disobedience to God's commands?

By openly linking themselves to Ahaziah, they unwittingly admit alliance with the condemned house of Ahab (since Ahaziah&#8217;s mother was Athaliah, Ahab&#8217;s daughter). Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; Family connections carry moral consequences (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-9.htm">Deuteronomy 5:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Neutrality is impossible when God draws a line&#8212;association with evil invites shared judgment (<a href="/proverbs/13-20.htm">Proverbs 13:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-4.htm">Revelation 18:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and we have come down to greet the sons of the king and of the queen mother.&#8221;</b><p>Their purpose proves their alignment.

Jehu&#8217;s meeting with Ahaziah&#8217;s relatives illustrates how alliance with wickedness&#8212;even by kinship or casual visit&#8212;draws one into divine judgment.
