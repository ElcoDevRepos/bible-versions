The high priest held a crucial role in maintaining the spiritual integrity of the nation, serving as a mediator between God and the people. This command to "go up" indicates the importance of the task and the respect for the high priest's authority. Hilkiah's role in discovering the Book of the Law later in this chapter highlights his significance in the religious revival under Josiah.<p><b>and have him count the money</b><br>The counting of money suggests a need for accountability and transparency in the handling of temple funds. This practice was essential to ensure that the resources were used appropriately for the maintenance and repair of the temple. It reflects a broader biblical principle of stewardship and integrity in financial matters, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/2_corinthians/8-20.htm">2 Corinthians 8:20-21</a>, which emphasizes honorable conduct in financial dealings.<p><b>that has been brought into the house of the LORD</b><br>The "house of the LORD" refers to Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites. At this time, the temple had fallen into disrepair due to neglect and idolatrous practices by previous kings. The collection of money for its restoration signifies a return to proper worship and reverence for God. The temple's significance as a dwelling place for God's presence is echoed in passages like <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>, where the glory of the LORD fills the temple.<p><b>which the doorkeepers have collected from the people</b><br>Doorkeepers, or gatekeepers, were responsible for maintaining order and security at the temple entrances. Their role in collecting money indicates a structured system for receiving offerings from the people. This system ensured that contributions were gathered systematically and fairly. The involvement of the people in contributing to the temple's upkeep reflects a communal responsibility for worship and the maintenance of sacred spaces, similar to the collective efforts seen in the construction of the tabernacle in <a href="/exodus/35-20.htm">Exodus 35:20-29</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hilkiah_the_high_priest.htm">Hilkiah the High Priest</a></b><br>Hilkiah was the high priest during the reign of King Josiah.

As in the reign of Joash, after the impieties and idolatry of Athaliah, it was found necessary to collect money for the repair of the temple (<a href="/2_kings/12-4.htm">2 Kings 12:4-14</a>), so now, after the wicked doings of Manasseh and Amen, a renovation of the sacred building was required, and the money needed was being raised by a collection. Great care was taken in all such cases that an exact account should be kept and rendered. <span class="cmt_word">Which the keepers of the door</span> - literally, <span class="accented">of the threshold - <span class="cmt_word"></span>have gathered of the people.</span> The money had, apparently, been allowed to accumulate in a box or boxes (see <a href="/2_kings/12-9.htm">2 Kings 12:9</a>), from the time when the collection was first authorized, probably six years previously. The high priest was now required to count it, to take the sum of it, and undertake the distribution. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/22-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Go up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1461;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;l&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5927.htm">Strong's 5927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ascend, in, actively</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Hilkiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1433;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;il&#183;q&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2518.htm">Strong's 2518: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hilkiah -- 'my portion is Yah', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the high</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1491;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;wl)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
