This anger is not arbitrary but is a response to the people's persistent idolatry and disobedience. In <a href="/deuteronomy/29-24.htm">Deuteronomy 29:24-28</a>, the LORD's anger is described as a consequence of breaking the covenant. The prophets, including Jeremiah and Ezekiel, frequently warned of God's impending judgment due to the people's sins.<p><b>all this happened in Jerusalem and Judah</b><br>The phrase "all this" refers to the calamities that befell Jerusalem and Judah, including the Babylonian siege, destruction of the temple, and exile. Jerusalem, the capital city, held significant religious and political importance as the location of the temple, the center of Jewish worship. Judah, the southern kingdom, was the remnant of the once-united Israelite monarchy. The events fulfilled prophecies such as those in <a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9-11</a>, which foretold the Babylonian captivity.<p><b>until He finally banished them from His presence</b><br>The banishment from God's presence signifies the loss of divine favor and protection. This expulsion is reminiscent of Adam and Eve's expulsion from Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-23.htm">Genesis 3:23-24</a>) and Cain's punishment (<a href="/genesis/4-14.htm">Genesis 4:14</a>). Theologically, it represents a severe consequence of sin, where the people are removed from the land God promised to their ancestors. The exile to Babylon is a pivotal moment in Jewish history, marking a period of reflection and transformation.<p><b>And Zedekiah also rebelled against the king of Babylon</b><br>Zedekiah, the last king of Judah, was installed by Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon but later rebelled, leading to the final siege of Jerusalem. His rebellion is documented in <a href="/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/52-3.htm">Jeremiah 52:3</a>. This act of defiance against Babylon was politically motivated but spiritually misguided, as it went against the prophetic counsel of Jeremiah, who advised submission to Babylon as God's instrument of judgment. Zedekiah's rebellion ultimately led to the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC, fulfilling the warnings of the prophets and demonstrating the futility of resisting God's ordained plans.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, whose anger is kindled against Jerusalem and Judah due to their persistent disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem_and_judah.htm">Jerusalem and Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which is under divine judgment for its sins, leading to its eventual exile.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned during the final siege of Jerusalem by Babylon.

The date of his open revolt cannot be fixed. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For through the anger of the Lord it came to pus in Jerusalem and Judah.</span> It was "through the anger of the Lord" at the persistent impenitence of the people, that that came to pass which actually came to pass - the rejection of the nation by God and the casting of it out of his presence. In his anger he suffered the appointment of another perverse and faithless monarch, who made no attempt at a reformation of religion, and allowed him to run his evil course unchecked, and to embroil himself with his suzerain, and to bring destruction upon his nation. God's anger, long provoked (<a href="/2_kings/21-10.htm">2 Kings 21:10-15</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-26.htm">2 Kings 23:26, 27</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3, 4</a>), lay at the root of the whole series of events, not causing men's sins, but allowing them to go on until the cup of their iniquities was full, and the time had arrived for vengeance. <span class="cmt_word">Until he had east them out from his presence</span> (comp. <a href="/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18, 20</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-27.htm">2 Kings 23:27</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3</a>). To be "cast out of God's presence" is to lose his protecting care, to be separated off from him, to be left defenseless against our enemies. When Israel was once finally cast off, its fate was sealed; there was no further hope for it; the end was come. <span class="cmt_word">That Zedekiah rebelled against the King of Babylon</span>; rather, And <span class="accented">Zedekiah rebelled</span>, etc. The sentence is a detached one, and would, perhaps, better commence <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>. than terminate, as it does, <a href="/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24</a>. Zedekiah, when he received his investiture at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar (ver. 17), took a solemn oath of allegiance and fidelity (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-13.htm">Ezekiel 17:13</a>) to him and to his successors; but almost immediately afterwards he began to intrigue with Egypt, sent a contingent of troops to help Psamatik II. in his wars (Wiediemann, 'Geschichte AEgyptens,' p. 159), and thus sought to pave the way for an Egyptian alliance, on the strength of which he might venture upon a revolt. It was probably owing to the suspicions which these acts aroused that, in the fourth year of his reign, <span class="date">B.C. 594</span>, he had to visit Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/51-59.htm">Jeremiah 51:59</a>), where, no doubt, he renewed his engagements and assured the Babylonian monarch of his fidelity. But these proceedings were nothing but a blind. On the accession of Hophra (Apries) to the throne of Egypt in <span class="date">B.C. 591</span>, Zedekiah renewed his application to the Egyptian court, openly sending ambassadors (<a href="/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15</a>), with a request for infantry and cavalry. Thus was his rebellion complete, his "oath despised," and his "covenant broken" (<a href="/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15, 16</a>). The war with Babylon, and the siege of Jerusalem, were the natural consequences. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/24-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;
