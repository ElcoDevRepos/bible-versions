The phrase "to this day" suggests that the situation persisted for a significant period, highlighting the lasting impact of the events described. This ongoing rebellion reflects the fulfillment of earlier prophecies and the consequences of Israel's disobedience to God.<p><b>Edom has been in rebellion</b><br>Edom, a nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, had a long history of conflict with Israel. The rebellion mentioned here refers to Edom's successful revolt against Judah's control during the reign of Jehoram, as detailed earlier in <a href="/2_kings/8.htm">2 Kings 8</a>. This rebellion fulfilled Isaac's blessing to Esau in <a href="/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a>, where it was prophesied that Esau's descendants would eventually break free from Jacob's yoke.<p><b>against the hand of Judah</b><br>The "hand of Judah" symbolizes the authority and control that the kingdom of Judah had over Edom. Historically, Edom was a vassal state under Judah's dominion, paying tribute and subject to its rule. The rebellion signifies a significant shift in power dynamics, weakening Judah's influence and control in the region.<p><b>Likewise, Libnah rebelled</b><br>Libnah was a city in the Shephelah region of Judah. Its rebellion at the same time as Edom's indicates a period of instability and weakened central authority in Judah. The rebellion of Libnah may have been motivated by dissatisfaction with Jehoram's rule or inspired by Edom's successful revolt. This event underscores the internal and external challenges faced by Judah during this period.<p><b>at the same time</b><br>The simultaneous rebellions of Edom and Libnah suggest a coordinated or opportunistic response to Judah's vulnerabilities. This period of unrest reflects the broader geopolitical instability in the region and highlights the challenges faced by the kingdom of Judah in maintaining its territorial integrity and political influence. The timing of these events may also indicate divine judgment on Judah for its unfaithfulness, as seen in the broader narrative of the Kings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother.

When Jehoram &#8220;abandoned the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-10.htm">2 Chronicles 21:10</a>), God allowed Edom to throw off Judah&#8217;s &#8220;hand,&#8221; a biblical idiom for dominion.<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a> foretold that Esau&#8217;s line would eventually &#8220;break his yoke&#8221; from Jacob&#8217;s neck, and that prophecy comes into view here.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20-21</a> explains that Jehoram&#8217;s night raid failed; the king escaped, but the rebellion stuck.<p>&#8226; Obadiah later condemns Edom for hostile acts toward Judah, showing how a single breach in submission became entrenched hostility.<p>Takeaway: When spiritual compromise weakens God-appointed authority, even long-subdued enemies find opportunity to revolt.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Likewise, Libnah rebelled at the same time</b><p>Libnah, a Levitical town in the Judean lowlands (<a href="/joshua/21-13.htm">Joshua 21:13</a>), follows Edom&#8217;s lead. An internal city rising up signals Judah&#8217;s own fabric unraveling.<p>&#8226; Its defection is repeated verbatim in <a href="/2_chronicles/21-10.htm">2 Chronicles 21:10</a>, linking it directly to Jehoram&#8217;s apostasy.<p>&#8226; Libnah had once been a trophy of Joshua&#8217;s southern campaign (<a href="/joshua/10-29.htm">Joshua 10:29-30</a>). Now, instead of advancing God&#8217;s kingdom, it resists the line of David.<p>&#8226; The dual rebellions&#8212;one foreign, one domestic&#8212;illustrate God&#8217;s disciplinary word in <a href="/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14-23</a>, where the LORD &#8220;raised up adversaries&#8221; when kings turned from Him.<p>Lesson: When leaders forsake covenant faithfulness, even their own people may withdraw allegiance, exposing the hollowness of unfaithful rule.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/8-22.htm">2 Kings 8:22</a> records that Edom&#8217;s and Libnah&#8217;s breakaways were not fleeting flare-ups; they endured as standing judgments on Jehoram&#8217;s ungodly reign. The verse affirms Scripture&#8217;s theme: persistent rebellion erupts when God&#8217;s people or leaders desert the LORD. The cost of sin is both external opposition and internal fracture, and its effects can linger &#8220;to this day.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Yet.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">and</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, so).<p><span class= "bld">Unto this day.</span>--Down to the time of composition of the original account from which this epitome is extracted.

Edom continued a separate country, not subject to Judaea, and frequently at war with it, until the time of John Hyrcanus, by whom it was subjugated. "Unto this day" means, at the most, until the time when the Books of Kings took their present shape, which was before the return from the Captivity. <span class="cmt_word">Then Libnah revolted at the same time.</span> Libnah was situated on the borders of Philistia, in the Shefelah, or low country, but towards its eastern edge. Its exact position is uncertain; but it is now generally thought to be identical with the modern <span class="accented">Tel-es-Safi</span>, between Gath and Ekron, about long. 34&deg; 50' E., Int. 31&deg; 38' N.

Its people can scarcely have had any sympathy with the Edomites, and its revolt at this time can have had no close connection with the Edomite rebellion.
