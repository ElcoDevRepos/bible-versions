The Assyrian policy was to deport conquered peoples to prevent rebellion. Priests in Israel were originally from the tribe of Levi, but after the division of the kingdom, Jeroboam appointed non-Levitical priests (<a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>). This priest's return signifies an attempt to restore some form of religious order among the people left in the land.<p><b>came and lived in Bethel</b><br>Bethel was a significant religious site in the Northern Kingdom, originally a place where Jacob had a vision of God (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>). It later became a center of idolatrous worship under Jeroboam, who set up a golden calf there (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-29</a>). The priest's residence in Bethel indicates an effort to re-establish proper worship practices in a place that had been corrupted by idolatry.<p><b>and he began to teach them</b><br>The priest's role was to instruct the people in the ways of the LORD, highlighting the importance of teaching and preserving the knowledge of God&#8217;s laws. This reflects the biblical emphasis on the teaching of God's Word as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are instructed to teach their children diligently.<p><b>how they should worship the LORD</b><br>This phrase underscores the need for correct worship, which had been neglected in the Northern Kingdom. The worship of the LORD required adherence to the covenant and the Law given through Moses. The restoration of proper worship practices was crucial for the spiritual renewal of the people. This also foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on worshiping in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>), pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who is the true temple and high priest.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_priest.htm">The Priest</a></b><br>A priest who had been exiled from Samaria.
