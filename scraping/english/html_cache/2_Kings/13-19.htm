His anger reflects a deep disappointment in King Jehoash's lack of faith and understanding. Prophets often served as God's mouthpiece, and their emotions could reflect divine displeasure. Elisha's anger underscores the seriousness of the king's failure to fully grasp the opportunity God was providing. Prophets like Elisha were instrumental in guiding the kings of Israel, often confronting them with their shortcomings.<p><b>and said, &#8220;You should have struck the ground five or six times.</b><br>Striking the ground symbolizes an act of faith and determination. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, physical actions often accompanied prophetic words to symbolize or enact a prophecy. The number of times Jehoash was expected to strike the ground indicates the completeness and thoroughness of victory God intended for Israel over Aram. The number five or six suggests a more complete victory, aligning with biblical numerology where numbers often have symbolic meanings.<p><b>Then you would have struck down Aram until you had put an end to it.</b><br>Aram, a neighboring kingdom, was a frequent adversary of Israel. The promise of putting an end to Aram signifies a total victory, which was within reach had Jehoash demonstrated greater faith. This reflects God's willingness to deliver His people completely from their enemies, contingent upon their faith and obedience. Historically, Aram was a significant power, and its defeat would have been a major relief for Israel.<p><b>But now you will strike down Aram only three times.&#8221;</b><br>The limitation to three victories indicates a partial fulfillment of what could have been a complete deliverance. This serves as a lesson on the consequences of half-hearted faith and incomplete obedience. The number three, while often representing completeness in other contexts, here signifies a limited success due to the king's lack of full commitment. This partial victory foreshadows the ongoing struggles Israel would face due to their leaders' failures to fully trust in God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>The prophet of God who succeeded Elijah.

Jehoash&#8217;s timid three strikes betrayed limited faith, provoking Elisha&#8217;s anger and resulting in only three victories. The episode teaches that wholehearted, persistent trust taps into the fullness of God&#8217;s promises, while half-hearted obedience forfeits blessings that could have been ours.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">The man of God was wroth with him.</span>--Because his present want of zeal augured a like deficiency in prosecuting the war hereafter. The natural irritability of the sick man may also have had something to do with it. Thenius well remarks on the manifestly <span class= "ital">historical</span> character of the entire scene. It may be added that, to appreciate it fully, we must remember that <span class= "greekheb">???????????</span>, or soothsaying by means of arrows, was a practice of unknown antiquity in the Semitic world. Shooting an arrow, and observing where and how it fell, was one method of trying to fathom the secrets of that Power which overrules events and foreknows the future. The proceedings of David and Jonathan, recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/20-35.htm" title="And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.">1Samuel 20:35</a>, <span class= "ital">seq</span>., appear to have been an instance of this sort of divination, which in principle is quite analogous to <span class= "ital">casting lots,</span> a practice so familiar to readers of the Bible. The second process--that described in <a href="/2_kings/13-18.htm" title="And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said to the king of Israel, Smite on the ground. And he smote thrice, and stayed.">2Kings 13:18</a>--seems equally to have depended upon chance, according to modern ideas. The prophet left it to the spontaneous <span class= "ital">impulse</span> of the king to determine the number of strokes; because he believed that the result, whatever it was, would <a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm" title="The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.">Proverbs 16:33</a>). Elisha's <span class= "ital">anger</span> was the natural anger of the man and the patriot, disappointed at the result of a divination from which he had hoped greater things. In conclusion, it cannot be too often or too forcibly urged upon students of the true religion that the essential differences which isolate it from all imperfect or retrograde systems are to be found not so much in matters of outward organisation, form, and ritual, such as priesthoods and sacrifices, prophets and modes of divination, which were pretty much the same everywhere in Semitic antiquity; but in the inward spirit and substance of its teaching, in the vital truths which it handed on through successive ages, and, above all, in its steady progress from lower to higher conceptions of the Divine character and purposes, and of the right relations of man to God and his fellow-creatures.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the man of God</span> (comp. <a href="/2_kings/4-7.htm">2 Kings 4:7, 25</a>; <a href="/2_kings/6-6.htm">2 Kings 6:6, 9</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-4.htm">2 Kings 8:4</a>, etc.) <span class="cmt_word">was wroth with him.</span> Elisha was angered at the lukewarmness of Joash, and his lack of faith and zeal. He himself, from his higher standpoint, saw the greatness of the opportunity, the abundance of favor which God was ready to grant, and the way in which God's favor was stinted and narrowed by Joash's want of receptiveness. Had the king been equal to the occasion, a full end might at once have been made of Syria, and Israel might have been enabled to brace herself for the still more perilous struggle with Assyria, in which she ultimately succumbed. <span class="cmt_word">And said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it.</span> It has been suggested that Joash associated the number throe with the notion of completeness, and "thought that what was done thrice was done perfectly" (Bahr); but in this case the prophet would scarcely have been angered. It is far more consonant with the entire narrative to suppose that he stopped from mere weariness, and want of strong faith and zeal. If he had been earnestly desirous of victory, and had had faith in the symbolical action as divinely directed, he would have kept on smiting till the prophet told him it was enough, or at any rate would have smitten the ground five or six times instead of three. The idea that he abstained from modesty or from prudence, "lest too extravagant demands might deprive him of all" (Von Gerlach), finds no support in the text of the narrative. He abstained (as Keil says) because "he was wanting in the proper zeal for obtaining the full promises of God." Had it been otherwise, the complete success obtained by Jeroboam II.
