The "lattice" refers to a wooden or metal framework, often used in ancient architecture for ventilation and light. His fall indicates a sudden and unexpected accident, which could symbolize the instability of his reign. Samaria, as the capital, was a significant city, both politically and religiously, often associated with idolatry due to the influence of Jezebel. The injury sets the stage for the subsequent events, highlighting Ahaziah's vulnerability and the precariousness of his leadership.<p><b>So he sent messengers and instructed them:</b><br>Ahaziah's decision to send messengers reflects the common practice of seeking divine insight or intervention in times of crisis. This action demonstrates his reliance on external spiritual guidance rather than seeking the God of Israel. The sending of messengers also indicates the seriousness of his condition, as he was unable to go himself, emphasizing his desperation and the urgency of his situation.<p><b>&#8220;Go inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron,</b><br>Baal-zebub, meaning "lord of the flies," was a deity worshiped in Ekron, a Philistine city. This choice reveals Ahaziah's apostasy and the influence of his parents' idolatrous practices. Ekron was one of the five major Philistine cities, known for its pagan worship. The act of inquiring from a foreign god underscores the spiritual decline of Israel under Ahaziah's rule. This decision contrasts sharply with the expectation that an Israelite king should seek guidance from Yahweh, the God of Israel, as seen in the lives of faithful kings like David.<p><b>whether I will recover from this injury.&#8221;</b><br>Ahaziah's inquiry about his recovery shows his concern for his own life and reign. It reflects a lack of faith in the God of Israel, who had proven His power and faithfulness throughout Israel's history. This act of seeking a pagan god's counsel is a direct violation of the first commandment, which forbids the worship of other gods. The narrative sets the stage for God's response through the prophet Elijah, who will confront Ahaziah's idolatry and pronounce judgment, illustrating the theme of divine sovereignty and the futility of idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaziah.htm">Ahaziah</a></b><br>The king of Israel, son of Ahab and Jezebel, known for continuing the idolatrous practices of his parents.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital city of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, where Ahaziah ruled.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/baal-zebub.htm">Baal-zebub</a></b><br>A deity worshiped in Ekron, often associated with false gods and idolatry.

The word rendered "through" (<span class= "ital">b?'ad</span>) implies that Ahaziah was leaning out over the window-sill. (Comp. <a href="/2_kings/9-30.htm" title="And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.">2Kings 9:30</a>; <a href="/psalms/14-2.htm" title="The LORD looked down from heaven on the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.">Psalm 14:2</a>.) He perhaps fell into a gallery underneath, as the palace would be several storeys high, and he was not killed by his fall. The word <span class= "ital">s?b?kh?h</span> means "net" in <a href="/job/18-8.htm" title="For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walks on a snare.">Job 18:8</a>, and decorative "network" in metal in <a href="/1_kings/7-18.htm" title="And he made the pillars, and two rows round about on the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other capital.">1Kings 7:18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/4-12.htm" title="To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the capitals which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;">2Chronicles 4:12</a>.

It is implied that the <span class="cmt_word">upper chamber</span> had a single window, which was closed by a single <span class="accented">lattice</span>, or shutter of interlaced woodwork. The shutter may have been insufficiently secured; or the woodwork may have been too weak to bear his weight, Compare the fall of Eutychus (<a href="/acts/20-9.htm">Acts 20:9</a>), where, however, there is no mention of a "lattice." <span class="cmt_word">Was sick</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "was so injured that he had to take to his bed." <span class="cmt_word">Inquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron.</span> As a worshipper of Baal, bent on walking in the evil way of his father and of his mother (<a href="/1_kings/22-52.htm">1 Kings 22:52</a>), Ahaziah would naturally inquire of some form of the Baal divinity. Why he chose "Baal-zebub the god of Ekron," it is impossible to say. Perhaps Baal-zebub had at the time a special reputation for giving oracular responses. Perhaps the Ekron temple was, of all the ancient sites of the Baal-worship, the one with which he could most readily communicate. Philistia lay nearer to Samaria than Phoenicia did, and of the Philistine towns Ekron (now <span class="accented">Akir</span>) was the most northern, and so the nearest. "Baal-zebub" has been thought by some to be equivalent to "Beel-samen," "the lord of heaven" - a divine title well known to the Phoenicians; but this view is etymologically unsound, since <span class="accented">zebub</span> cannot possibly mean "heaven." "Baal-zebub" is "the lord of flies " - either the god who sends them as a plague on any nation that offends him (setup. <a href="/exodus/8-21.htm">Exodus 8:21-31</a>), or the god who averts them from his votaries and favorites, an equivalent of the Greek <span class="greek">&#x396;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, or the Roman "Jupiter Myiagrus," flies being in the East not infrequently a terrible plague.
