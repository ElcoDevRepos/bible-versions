This setting highlights the role of prophets as intermediaries between God and His people. Elisha's presence signifies divine guidance during a time of crisis, as the city of Samaria was under siege by the Arameans. Prophets often provided counsel and direction, as seen throughout the Old Testament, such as with Samuel and David.<p><b>the messenger came down to him</b><br>The messenger was sent by the king of Israel, likely Jehoram, during a desperate time. The phrase "came down" suggests urgency and the physical descent from the palace to where Elisha was. Messengers in biblical times were crucial for communication, especially during sieges when direct access was limited. This reflects the king's desperation and the critical nature of the situation.<p><b>And the king said</b><br>The king's direct involvement underscores the severity of the crisis. In ancient Israel, kings were seen as leaders responsible for the welfare of their people, often seeking prophetic insight during national emergencies. This interaction between the king and Elisha is reminiscent of other biblical narratives where kings sought prophetic counsel, such as Hezekiah consulting Isaiah.<p><b>&#8220;This calamity is from the LORD</b><br>The king acknowledges the divine origin of the disaster, recognizing God's sovereignty over national events. This reflects a common biblical theme where God uses calamities to bring about repentance or judgment, as seen in the plagues of Egypt or the Babylonian exile. The king's statement indicates an understanding of God&#8217;s control over both blessings and adversities.<p><b>Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?&#8221;</b><br>The king's question reveals his impatience and wavering faith. In times of distress, waiting on the Lord is a recurring biblical exhortation, as seen in Psalms and the prophets. This impatience contrasts with the faith of figures like Job or David, who trusted in God's timing. The king's doubt serves as a cautionary example of the struggle between human impatience and divine timing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet in Israel, successor to Elijah, known for his miracles and guidance to the kings of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_messenger.htm">The Messenger</a></b><br>Sent by the king of Israel, likely Jehoram, to confront Elisha during a time of crisis.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_israel.htm">The King of Israel</a></b><br>Likely King Jehoram, who is facing a dire situation due to the siege of Samaria by the Arameans.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, under siege, leading to severe famine.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is perceived by the king as the source of the disaster due to the siege.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Even in dire circumstances, recognize that God is in control and His plans are for our ultimate good.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_impatience.htm">The Danger of Impatience</a></b><br>Impatience can lead to doubt and rash decisions.

While Elisha calmly communicates the Lord&#8217;s message, the king barges in, blaming God for the siege and refusing to wait for His deliverance. The verse warns against impatience and unbelief, highlighting that every crisis is under God&#8217;s control and invites steadfast trust in His timing and promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">Yet talked.</span>--<span class= "ital">Was still speaking.</span><p><span class= "bld">The messenger.</span>--Ewal?s correction, "the king" (<span class= "ital">melek for ma??k</span>), is certainly right.

The reader is expected to supply missing links, and to understand that all happened as Elisha had predicted and enjoined - that the messenger came, that the elders stopped him, and that the king shortly arrived. The king was, of course, admitted, and, being admitted, took the word, and said, <span class="cmt_word">Behold, this evil is of the Lord; what</span> - rather, <span class="accented">why - <span class="cmt_word"></span>should I wait for the Lord any longer?</span> Jehoram had, apparently, to some extent repented of his hasty message, and had hurried after his messenger, to give Elisha one further chance of life. We must understand that they had been in communication previously on the subject of the siege, and that Elisha had encouraged the king to "wait for" an interposition of Jehovah. The king now urges that the time for waiting is over; matters are at the last gasp; "this evil" this terrible suffering which can no longer be endured - "is of the Lord," has come from him, is continued by him, and is not relieved. What use is there in his "waiting" any longer? Why should he not break with Jehovah, behead the lying prophet, and surrender the town? What has Elisha to say in reply? <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/6-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">While Elisha was still</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1462;&#1433;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7695;en&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb &#124;
