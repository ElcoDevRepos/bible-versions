Elisha, the prophet, is instructing his servant Gehazi to quickly approach the Shunammite woman. The urgency reflects the importance of hospitality and care in ancient Near Eastern culture, where visitors and those in distress were to be attended to promptly. This also shows Elisha's sensitivity to the needs of others, a characteristic of a true servant of God.<p><b>and ask, &#8216;Are you all right?</b><br>The question "Are you all right?" is a direct inquiry into the woman's well-being. In the Hebrew context, this question is about her "shalom," which encompasses peace, health, and overall welfare. This reflects the biblical principle of caring for others' holistic well-being, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-4.htm">Philippians 2:4</a>, which encourages looking out for the interests of others.<p><b>Is your husband all right?</b><br>The mention of the husband highlights the patriarchal structure of ancient Israelite society, where the husband was often seen as the head of the household. This question also shows the importance of family unity and the well-being of each family member, a theme echoed in <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-33</a>, which discusses the roles and responsibilities within a Christian marriage.<p><b>Is your child all right?&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The child in question is the miraculous son given to the Shunammite woman by God through Elisha's prophecy (<a href="/2_kings/4-16.htm">2 Kings 4:16-17</a>). This question underscores the value placed on children in biblical times, as they were seen as a blessing from God (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>). The inquiry into the child's well-being also foreshadows the unfolding miracle, as the child had died, and the woman's faith in seeking Elisha is pivotal.<p><b>And she answered, &#8220;Everything is all right.&#8221;</b><br>The woman's response, "Everything is all right," is a statement of faith and composure. Despite her son's death, she chooses to speak words of faith, reflecting a deep trust in God's power and the prophet's ability to intercede. This mirrors the faith seen in <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>, which defines faith as confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see. Her response can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, in the face of adversity, remained steadfast and trusting in God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God who succeeded Elijah.
