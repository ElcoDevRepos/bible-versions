This act of going to the gatekeepers highlights the importance of communication and the role of gatekeepers in ancient cities, who were responsible for the security and information flow.

The absence of the Arameans was a miraculous deliverance by God, fulfilling Elisha's prophecy of relief from the siege. This phrase underscores God's sovereignty and ability to deliver His people in unexpected ways. It also reflects the theme of divine intervention seen throughout the Bible, such as the parting of the Red Sea in Exodus.<p><b>only tethered horses and donkeys,</b><br>The presence of tethered animals indicates a hasty departure, suggesting panic and fear among the Arameans. This detail aligns with the biblical theme of God causing confusion among the enemies of His people, as seen in other instances like the defeat of the Midianites in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>. The animals left behind also symbolize God's provision, as they could be used for transportation and food.<p><b>and the tents were intact.&#8221;</b><br>The intact tents signify that the Arameans left in such a rush that they did not have time to dismantle their camp. This detail emphasizes the completeness of God's deliverance and provision. The intact tents can be seen as a type of God's abundant provision, similar to the manna provided in the wilderness.

Every detail&#8212;the empty camp, tethered animals, intact tents&#8212;verifies that the Lord single-handedly routed the enemy and provided abundantly for His people, calling them to trust His word and step into His prepared salvation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">The porter.</span>--The Oriental versions may be right in reading "porters," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, warders. The plural is implied by "they told <span class= "ital">them</span>," which immediately follows, and actually occurs in <a href="/2_kings/7-11.htm" title="And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house within.">2Kings 7:11</a>. But the reading of the LXX. and Vulg., "gate," implies the same consonants differently pointed, as those of the word "porter." This attests the antiquity of the reading. Probably, therefore, the word "porter" is here used collectively.<p><span class= "bld">No man . . . voice of man.</span>--The first word (<span class= "ital">'ish</span>) denotes an individual man, the second word (<span class= "ital">'?d?m</span>) denotes the <span class= "ital">species</span>, and so includes women and children.<p><span class= "bld">Horses.</span>--<span class= "ital">The horses</span>. Similarly, <span class= "ital">the asses.</span> Both words are singular (collectives) in the Hebrew.<p><span class= "bld">Tied</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, tethered and feeding.<p><span class= "bld">The tents.</span>--Omit <span class= "ital">the</span>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So they came and called unto the porter of the city</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to the guard of the gate nearest them. The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b9;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, "porter," or "gate-man," is used <span class="accented">collectively<span class="cmt_word"></span>. And they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.</span> The horses and asses within a camp were always "tied," or tethered, as we see from the monumental representations of Egyptian camps (Rawlinson, 'History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. 1. p. 476), and also learn from historians (Herod., 4:135). It is somewhat surprising that the horses were left behind, as they would have expedited the flight had they been saddled and mounted. But this was, perhaps, overlooked in the panic. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/7-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So they went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1431;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
