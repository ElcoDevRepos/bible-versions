In the ancient Near East, chariots were symbols of military power and prestige. The act of harnessing a chariot suggests preparation for a significant encounter. Joram, the king of Israel, is responding to the news of Jehu's approach, highlighting the tension and impending conflict. The chariot, a key military asset, underscores the seriousness of the situation.<p><b>Then Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah set out, each in his own chariot,</b><br>The alliance between Joram and Ahaziah reflects the political dynamics of the time. Despite being from different kingdoms, Israel and Judah, their cooperation suggests a shared interest or threat.

Jehu's encounter with the kings here is not coincidental; it serves as a divine appointment for judgment.

Joram was probably anxious to know the reasons which had induced the captain of his host to quit his post at Ramoth-Gilead. Ahaziah probably accompanied him out of politeness, though he too may have been curious to learn the news. If any disaster had overtaken the army of Israel, the safety of Judah might also be endangered.

The "portion of Naboth," or his plot of ground, lay outside the southeastern gate of the city, at no great distance from the walls; and it happened that Joram and Jehu met within its limits. Had the king started a little sooner, or had Jehu made less haste, the meeting would have taken place further from the town, and outside the "portion of Naboth." But Divine providence so ordered matters that vengeance for the sin of Ahab was exacted upon the very scene of his guilt, and a prophecy made, probably by Elisha, years previously, and treasured up in the memory of Jehu (ver. 26), was fulfilled to the letter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/9-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Harness!&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1505;&#1465;&#1428;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;s&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_631.htm">Strong's 631: </a> </span><span class="str2">To yoke, hitch, to fasten, to join battle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Joram</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;r&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3088.htm">Strong's 3088: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jehoram -- 'the LORD is exalted', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">shouted,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
