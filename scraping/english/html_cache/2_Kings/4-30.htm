She is a woman of faith and determination, previously introduced in <a href="/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8-37</a>. Her son, a miraculous gift from God through the prophet Elisha, has died unexpectedly. Her response is one of urgency and faith, seeking the prophet's intervention. This reflects the cultural context where women, though often in subordinate roles, could exhibit strong faith and influence.<p><b>&#8220;As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live,</b><br>This oath underscores the seriousness and urgency of her request. The phrase "as surely as the LORD lives" is a common biblical expression affirming the certainty and truth of one's words, seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_samuel/14-39.htm">1 Samuel 14:39</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/15-21.htm">2 Samuel 15:21</a>. It reflects her deep faith in the living God and her recognition of Elisha as His representative. The dual reference to the LORD and Elisha emphasizes her respect for both divine and prophetic authority.<p><b>I will not leave you.&#8221;</b><br>Her determination mirrors that of Ruth's commitment to Naomi in <a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16</a>. It signifies her unwavering resolve to stay with Elisha until her son is restored. This persistence is a testament to her faith and mirrors the biblical theme of perseverance in seeking God's intervention, as seen in the parable of the persistent widow in <a href="/luke/18.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>.<p><b>So he got up and followed her.</b><br>Elisha's response to the woman's insistence demonstrates his compassion and willingness to act on behalf of those in need. It highlights the role of prophets as intermediaries of God's power and mercy. This action foreshadows the ministry of Jesus Christ, who often responded to the faith and pleas of individuals, as seen in the healing of Jairus's daughter in <a href="/mark/5-21.htm">Mark 5:21-43</a>. Elisha's willingness to follow the woman also reflects the biblical principle of leaders serving others, as exemplified by Christ in <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mother.htm">The Mother (Shunammite Woman)</a></b><br>A woman of Shunem who showed great faith and persistence.

The speaker is the Shunammite woman whose son, a miraculous gift from God through Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/4-16.htm">2 Kings 4:16&#8211;17</a>), has suddenly died (v. 20).<p>&#8226; Her immediate reaction is not despair but purposeful action&#8212;she seeks out the prophet who spoke God&#8217;s promise.<p>&#8226; Like the widow of Zarephath who went to Elijah when her child died (<a href="/1_kings/17-17.htm">1 Kings 17:17&#8211;19</a>), she believes that the man of God is the God-ordained channel for help.<p>&#8226;

This double oath formula solemnly invokes both the living God and the living prophet, echoing Elisha&#8217;s own words to Elijah in <a href="/2_kings/2-2.htm">2 Kings 2:2, 4, 6</a>.<p>&#8226; It emphasizes two unshakable realities:<p>&#8211; The LORD is alive and actively involved (<a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a>).<p>&#8211; Elisha, God&#8217;s spokesman, is personally accountable to that living LORD.<p>&#8226; Similar language appears in <a href="/1_samuel/20-3.htm">1 Samuel 20:3</a> and <a href="/ruth/3-13.htm">Ruth 3:13</a>, underscoring covenant faithfulness.<p>&#8226;

Determined faith refuses to settle for partial solutions; she will not be satisfied until Elisha himself comes.<p>&#8226; Persistent, clinging faith is celebrated throughout Scripture&#8212;see Jacob wrestling in <a href="/genesis/32-26.htm">Genesis 32:26</a> and the Syrophoenician woman in <a href="/matthew/15-21.htm">Matthew 15:21-28</a>.<p>&#8226;

Elisha&#8217;s immediate response shows compassionate authority and divine approval.<p>&#8226; The prophet recognizes genuine faith and acts, just as Jesus later responded to Jairus (<a href="/mark/5-22.htm">Mark 5:22-24</a>) and to Martha and Mary (<a href="/john/11-28.htm">John 11:28-31</a>).<p>&#8226; God works through His servants, yet He remains the ultimate healer; the forthcoming miracle (<a href="/2_kings/4-34.htm">2 Kings 4:34-37</a>) validates both the prophet&#8217;s office and the mother&#8217;s faith.<p>&#8226;
