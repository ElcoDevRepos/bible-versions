The officer is likely a high-ranking official or advisor to the king, possibly the captain of the guard. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, such positions were often held by those who had proven their loyalty and competence. The phrase "on whose arm the king leaned" suggests a close relationship, indicating that the king relied on this officer for support and counsel. This reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient monarchies, where the king's inner circle held significant influence.<p><b>answered the man of God</b><br>The "man of God" refers to Elisha, a prominent prophet in Israel. Prophets were seen as messengers of God, delivering divine revelations and guidance. Elisha's role as a prophet is well-documented in the biblical narrative, where he performs miracles and provides counsel to kings. The officer's response to Elisha highlights a common theme in scripture: the tension between human skepticism and divine promise. Prophets often faced disbelief and opposition, even from those in positions of power.<p><b>&#8220;Look, even if the LORD were to make windows in heaven, could this really happen?&#8221;</b><br>This statement reflects skepticism and doubt. The officer questions the possibility of divine intervention in a dire situation. The reference to "windows in heaven" is a metaphorical expression, suggesting an outpouring of abundance from God. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>, where God promises to "open the windows of heaven" and pour out blessings. The officer's doubt contrasts with the biblical theme of God's ability to provide miraculously, as seen in the provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16) and the feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>).<p><b>&#8220;You will see it with your own eyes,&#8221; replied Elisha</b><br>Elisha's response is a prophetic declaration. He asserts that the officer will witness the fulfillment of God's promise, emphasizing the certainty of divine action. This statement underscores the biblical principle that God's word is trustworthy and will come to pass, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word is described as accomplishing its purpose. The phrase also foreshadows the officer's fate, highlighting the consequences of disbelief.<p><b>&#8220;but you will not eat any of it.&#8221;</b><br>This part of Elisha's prophecy serves as a warning and a judgment. The officer's skepticism leads to a personal consequence: he will see the fulfillment of the prophecy but will not partake in its benefits. This outcome is a recurring biblical theme, where disbelief and disobedience result in missed blessings, as seen in the story of Moses, who saw the Promised Land but was not allowed to enter (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-4.htm">Deuteronomy 34:4</a>). The officer's fate serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of faith and trust in God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God who succeeded Elijah and performed many miracles.

While the city enjoys sudden abundance (<a href="/2_kings/7-16.htm">2 Kings 7:16</a>), the officer dies at the city gate trampled by the crowd (v. 17).<p>&#8226; This fulfills <a href="/deuteronomy/28-2.htm">Deuteronomy 28:2, 15</a>&#8212;obedience draws blessing, disbelief draws curse.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/3-19.htm">Hebrews 3:19</a> warns that unbelief keeps people from entering rest; here it keeps one man from tasting relief.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/7-2.htm">2 Kings 7:2</a> contrasts human skepticism with God&#8217;s unfailing word. The royal officer, secure in rank yet insecure in faith, questions the possibility of divine intervention. Elisha affirms that God will act regardless of doubt, but unbelief will cost the skeptic personal participation in the miracle. The verse calls readers to trust God&#8217;s promises even when circumstances seem impossible, reminding us that faith opens the door to blessing while disbelief shuts us out from what God delights to give.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Then a lord.</span>--<span class= "ital">And the adjutant </span>(<span class= "ital">shalish</span>: comp. <a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm" title="These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.">2Samuel 23:8</a>; <a href="/1_kings/9-22.htm" title="But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no slaves: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.">1Kings 9:22</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/11-11.htm" title="And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.">1Chronicles 11:11</a>), or <span class= "ital">aide-de-camp or esquire</span> (equerry).<p><span class= "bld">On whose hand . . . leaned.</span>--Comp. the similar expression in reference to Naaman (<a href="/2_kings/5-18.htm" title="In this thing the LORD pardon your servant, that when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leans on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon your servant in this thing.">2Kings 5:18</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Leaned.</span>--<span class= "ital">Was leaning.</span><span class= "bld"><p>Behold, if the Lord . . . this thing be?</span>--This may be correct.

Or we may render, "Behold, Jehovah is going to make windows in the sky [<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, to pour down provisions upon us]. Can this thing come to pass?" In any case, the tone is that of scoffing unbelief. Reuss renders, with French point, "Voyez donc. Iaheweh en fera pleuvoir!

But the officer on whose arm he leans is not so reticent. Utterly incredulous, he expresses his incredulity in a scoffing way: "Could this possibly be, even if God were to 'make windows in heaven,' as he did at the time of the Flood (<a href="/genesis/7-11.htm">Genesis 7:11</a>), and pour through them, instead of rain, as then, a continual shower of fine meal and corn?" Disbelief is expressed, not only in the prophetic veracity of Elisha, but in the power of God. Hence Elisha's stern reply. <span class="cmt_word">And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.</span> At once a threat and a warning. If the thing was to be, and the lord to see it and yet not profit by it, the only reasonable conclusion was that his death was imminent. He was thus warned, and given time to "set his house in order," and to repent and make his peace with the Almighty. Whether he took advantage of the warning, or even understood it, we are not told. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/7-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But the officer</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1441;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;l&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
