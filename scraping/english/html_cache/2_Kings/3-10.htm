His exclamation "Alas" indicates a moment of despair and fear. This reflects the often tumultuous reigns of the kings of Israel, who frequently turned away from God, leading to instability and divine judgment. Jehoram's reaction is typical of a leader who lacks faith in God's providence, contrasting with leaders like David who sought God's guidance in times of trouble.<p><b>&#8220;for the LORD has summoned these three kings</b><br>The three kings referred to are Jehoram of Israel, Jehoshaphat of Judah, and the king of Edom. This alliance was formed to combat the rebellion of Moab. The phrase "the LORD has summoned" suggests a belief in divine orchestration, even in political and military matters. It reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding that deities were involved in the affairs of nations. Jehoshaphat, a godly king, often sought the Lord's counsel, which contrasts with Jehoram's lack of faith.<p><b>to deliver them into the hand of Moab!&#8221;</b><br>Moab, located east of the Dead Sea, was a frequent adversary of Israel. The Moabite rebellion under King Mesha is historically documented in the Mesha Stele, which corroborates the biblical account. The fear of being delivered into Moab's hand reflects the real threat posed by Moab's military strength. This phrase also highlights the recurring theme of Israel's enemies being used as instruments of God's judgment when Israel strayed from His commandments. The situation foreshadows the need for divine intervention, which ultimately comes through the prophet Elisha, pointing to the necessity of reliance on God's power rather than human alliances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_israel.htm">King of Israel</a></b><br>At this time, the king of Israel is Jehoram, the son of Ahab.
