The temple of Baal was a center for idolatrous worship, and its destruction signifies a return to the worship of Yahweh. This act fulfills the commandment against idolatry found in <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a> and reflects the covenant renewal seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in the reforms of King Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4-20</a>).<p><b>They smashed the altars and idols to pieces,</b><br>The destruction of altars and idols is a physical manifestation of repentance and a turning away from false gods. This act is reminiscent of Gideon's destruction of the altar of Baal in <a href="/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25-27</a>. It symbolizes the eradication of sin and the cleansing of the land from pagan influences, aligning with the Deuteronomic law that commands the destruction of pagan worship sites (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>).<p><b>and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.</b><br>Mattan, as a priest of Baal, represented the religious leadership that led Israel into idolatry. His execution is a decisive act of judgment against those who oppose the worship of the true God. This mirrors the actions of Elijah on Mount Carmel, where the prophets of Baal were also executed (<a href="/1_kings/18-40.htm">1 Kings 18:40</a>). It underscores the seriousness of leading God's people astray and the need for purging evil from the community.<p><b>And Jehoiada the priest posted guards for the house of the LORD.</b><br>Jehoiada's actions demonstrate his commitment to protecting the sanctity of the temple and ensuring the proper worship of Yahweh. By posting guards, he safeguards the newly restored worship practices and prevents any resurgence of idolatry. This act of vigilance is akin to the role of the Levites, who were charged with guarding the tabernacle (<a href="/numbers/1-53.htm">Numbers 1:53</a>).

In the fervour of their newly-awakened enthusiasm for Jehovah, the assembly may have hurried off at once to the work of demolition. It seems to be implied that the "house of Baal" stood on the Temple mount, in ostentatious rivalry with the sanctuary of Jehovah. (Comp, the introduction of idolatrous altars into the Temple itself by Manasseh, <a href="/context/2_kings/21-4.htm" title="And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.">2Kings 21:4-5</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-7.htm" title="And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:">2Kings 21:7</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-12.htm" title="And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and broke them down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.">2Kings 23:12</a>.) This house of Baal had, perhaps, been built by Athaliah. (Comp. <a href="/context/1_kings/16-31.htm" title="And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.">1Kings 16:31-32</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">His altars . . . his images.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">its</span> (the Temple's) <span class= "ital">altars . . . its images.</span><p><span class= "bld">And the priest appointed officers over the house of the Lord.</span>--The obviously close connection of this statement with what precedes, almost proves that the sanctuary of Baal had stood within the Temple precincts, probably in the outer court. After the destruction of it, Jehoiada appointed certain overseers--probably Levites of rank--to prevent any future desecration of the Temple by the practice of idolatrous rites (comp. <a href="/context/ezekiel/8-5.htm" title="Then said he to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.">Ezekiel 8:5-16</a>), or by wanton attacks of the Baal-worshippers, who might be cowed, but were certainly not exterminated (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/24-7.htm" title="For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow on Baalim.">2Chronicles 24:7</a>); and to see that the legitimate <span class= "ital">cultus</span> was properly carried out. (The sentence tells us what was done some time afterwards, in consequence of the reformation; thus finishing the subject in hand at the expense of the strict order of time.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all the people of the land</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all those who had come up to Jerusalem from the various cities of Judah to help Jehoiada (see <a href="/2_chronicles/23-2.htm">2 Chronicles 23:2</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">went into the house of Baal.</span> According to Josephus, "the house of Baal" here mentioned was built by Jehoram and Athaliah in the reign of the former ('Ant. Jud.,' 9:7. &sect; 4), But, if this was the case, it is rather strange that the writer of Chronicles, who enumerates so many of the evil acts of Jehoram (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-4.htm">2 Chronicles 21:4, 6, 11</a>), does not mention it. The present narrative shows that the temple was in, or very near, Jerusalem; but there is nothing to fix the site of it. <span class="cmt_word">And brake it down</span> - Josephus says they "razed it to the ground" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) - <span class="cmt_word">his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly.</span> It was common among the heathen to have several altars in one temple, and not uncommon to have several images even of the same god, especially if he was a god worshipped under different forms, as Baal was (whence the word "Baalim"). The Baalim of this temple are mentioned by the writer of Chronicles (see <a href="/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.</span> The name "Mattan" recalls that of the last King of Judah, which was originally Mattaniah, equivalent to "gift of Jehovah" (<a href="/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>). Mattan would be simply "gift." We may presume that, though only called "priest," he was the high priest. <span class="cmt_word">And the priest</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehoiada - <span class="cmt_word">appointed officers over the house of the Lord.</span> The parallel passage of Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-18.htm">2 Chronicles 23:18, 19</a>) explains this statement. We are there told that "Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the Lord by the hand of the priests the Levites... to offer the burnt offerings of the Lord, as it is written in the Law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David. And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the Lord, that none which was unclean in anything should enter in." During Athaliah's reign the temple service had ceased; breaches had been broken in the outer walls; and neither the priests nor the porters had served in their regular order; there had been no morning or evening sacrifice, and no antiphonal psalm-singing. Jehoiada re-established the regular courses and the worship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/11-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1501;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1448;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
