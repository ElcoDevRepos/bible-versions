Elijah's role as a prophet is significant, as he serves as God's spokesperson during a time when Israel is steeped in idolatry. The captain represents the authority of the king, who is seeking to exert control over Elijah. This encounter highlights the tension between the prophetic authority of God and the earthly authority of the king.<p><b>&#8220;If I am a man of God</b><br>Elijah's statement challenges the recognition of his divine appointment. The phrase "man of God" is a title used for prophets, indicating their role as God's representatives. Elijah's identity as a man of God is central to his authority and the miraculous events that follow. This phrase underscores the theme of divine validation of true prophets, contrasting with false prophets who lack God's power.<p><b>may fire come down from heaven</b><br>The invocation of fire from heaven is a demonstration of divine power and judgment. Fire is often associated with God's presence and judgment in the Bible, as seen in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>) and the fire on Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>). This request for fire serves as a test of Elijah's prophetic authority and God's willingness to act on his behalf.<p><b>and consume you and your fifty men.&#8221;</b><br>The consumption of the captain and his men by fire is an act of divine judgment. It serves as a warning against opposing God's chosen prophet and, by extension, God Himself. This event emphasizes the seriousness of rejecting God's message and the consequences of defying His authority. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God's protection over His servants.<p><b>And fire came down from heaven</b><br>The fulfillment of Elijah's words with fire descending from heaven confirms his status as a true prophet. This miraculous event is a direct intervention by God, affirming Elijah's message and authority. It parallels other instances where God uses fire to demonstrate His power and presence, reinforcing the idea that God actively defends His honor and those who serve Him.<p><b>and consumed the captain and his fifty men.</b><br>The complete destruction of the captain and his men serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of challenging God's authority. It illustrates the seriousness of divine judgment and the protection God provides to His prophets. This event foreshadows the ultimate judgment that will come upon those who oppose God, while also pointing to the power and authority of Jesus Christ, who will execute final judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God known for his boldness and miraculous acts.

Ewald considers this a mark of the later origin of this tradition about Elijah. The words "come down" are at any rate appropriate, as repeating the captain's bidding to the prophet.<p><span class= "bld">Consume.</span>--<span class= "ital">Eat, or devour.</span> (Comp. <a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm" title="Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench.">1Kings 18:38</a>.)

But there is no need of altering the translation, Elijah undoubtedly "commanded fire to come down from heaven" (<a href="/luke/9-54.htm">Luke 9:54</a>), or, in other words, prayed to God that it might come down, and in answer to his prayer the fire fell. The narrative may be set aside as an embellishment of later times, having no historical foundation, by those who (like Ewald) deny that miracles are possible; but, if it be accepted, it must be accepted as it stands, and Elijah must be regarded, not as having merely prophesied a result, but as having been instrumental in producing it. We must judge Elijah, not by the ideas of our own day, but by those of the age wherein he lived. He was raised up to vindicate God's honor, to check and punish idolatry, to keep alive a faithful remnant in Israel, when all the powers of the earth were leagued together to destroy and smother true religion. He was an embodiment of the Law - of absolute, strict, severe justice. The fair face of mercy was not revealed to him. Already, at Carmel, he had executed the Divine vengeance on idolaters after an exemplary fashion (<a href="/1_kings/18-40.htm">1 Kings 18:40</a>). Now, Ahaziah, the son of the wicked Jezebel, had challenged Jehovah to a trial of strength by first ignoring him, and then sending a troop of soldiers to arrest his prophet. Was Elijah to succumb without an effort, or was he to vindicate the majesty and honor of Jehovah? He had no power of himself to do either good or harm. He could but pray to Jehovah, and Jehovah, in his wisdom and perfect goodness, would either grant or refuse his prayer. If he granted it, the punishment inflicted would not be Elijah's work, but his. To tax Elijah with cruelty is to involve God in the charge.
