In the ancient Near East, water was a precious commodity, often symbolizing life and prosperity. By claiming to have dug wells and drunk foreign waters, Sennacherib is asserting his dominance over the lands he has conquered, suggesting that he has taken control of their most vital resources. This boast can be seen as a challenge to the God of Israel, who is often depicted as the provider of living water (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>, <a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>). The phrase also highlights the arrogance of human power in contrast to divine sovereignty, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible.<p><b>With the soles of my feet I have dried up all the streams of Egypt.</b><br>This part of the verse continues Sennacherib's arrogant claims, suggesting that his mere presence is enough to dry up the streams of Egypt, a land known for its reliance on the Nile River. The imagery of drying up streams is significant, as it implies a supernatural level of power and control over nature, which in biblical terms, is reserved for God alone (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>, <a href="/isaiah/44-27.htm">Isaiah 44:27</a>). Historically, Egypt was a formidable power, and the idea of Assyria having such control over it would have been a bold claim. This boast can be seen as a direct affront to the God of Israel, who demonstrated His power over the waters during the Exodus. Theologically, this phrase underscores the futility of human pride and the ultimate authority of God over all creation, as later events in the narrative reveal the downfall of Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35-37</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib.htm">Sennacherib</a></b><br>The Assyrian king who boasts of his conquests and power, claiming to have achieved great feats, including drying up the streams of Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during Sennacherib's invasion, who seeks God's intervention against the Assyrian threat.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>The dominant empire at the time, known for its military prowess and expansionist policies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A significant power in the ancient Near East, often seen as a rival to Assyria and a potential ally for smaller nations like Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital of Judah, under threat from Sennacherib's forces, and the focal point of Hezekiah's prayer for deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_folly_of_pride.htm">The Folly of Pride</a></b><br>Sennacherib's boasts highlight the danger of pride and self-reliance.

The Lord swiftly answers by revealing that every success Assyria enjoyed was granted, measured, and about to be revoked (<a href="/2_kings/19-28.htm">2 Kings 19:28-35</a>). The verse thus stands as a cautionary snapshot of pride opposed to God and a reminder that &#8220;the LORD is the everlasting God&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-28.htm">Isaiah 40:28</a>), not the mightiest human ruler.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">I have digged and drunk strange waters.</span>--Scarcity of water has hitherto been no bar to my advance.

Sennacherib means that this is what he is wont to do. As mountains do not stop him (ver. 23), so deserts do not stop him - he digs wells in them, and drinks water "strange" to the soil - never before seen there. <span class="cmt_word">And with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places</span>; rather, <span class="accented">will</span> 1 <span class="accented">dry up all the rivers of Egypt</span> (compare the Revised Version. "Mazor" is used for "Egypt" in <a href="/isaiah/19-6.htm">Isaiah 19:6</a> and <a href="/micah/7-12.htm">Micah 7:12</a>). It is the old singular from which was formed the dual Mizraim. Whether it meant "land of strength" (Pusey), or "land of distress" (Ewald), may be doubted, since we have no right to assume a Hebrew derivation. There was probably a native word, from which the Hebrew <span class="accented">Mazor</span>, the Assyrian <span class="accented">Muzr</span>, and the Arabic <span class="accented">Misr</span> were taken. Sennacherib's beast is that, as he makes deserts traversable by digging wells, so, if rivers try to stop him, he will find a way of drying them up. Compare the boasts of Alaric in Claudian ('Bell. Get.,' pp. 525-532), who had probably this passage of Kings in his thoughts - <p><span class="foreign">"To patior suadente fugam, cum cesserit omnis<br />Obsequiis natura meis?<br />Subsidere nostris Sub pedibus montes, arescere vidimus amnes<br />Fregi Alpes, galeisque Padum victricibus hausi."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/19-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_589.htm">Strong's 589: </a> </span><span class="str2">I</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have dug wells</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1463;&#1428;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(qar&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6979.htm">Strong's 6979: </a> </span><span class="str2">To trench, to throw forth,   to wall up</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and drunk</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1514;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
