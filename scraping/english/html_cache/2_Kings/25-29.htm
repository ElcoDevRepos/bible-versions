His change of clothes symbolizes a transition from captivity to freedom, reflecting a common biblical theme of transformation and redemption. This act signifies a restoration of dignity and status, reminiscent of Joseph's release from prison in <a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14</a>. The change of garments can also be seen as a type of spiritual renewal, akin to the "garments of salvation" mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>.<p><b>and he dined regularly at the king&#8217;s table</b><br>Dining at the king's table indicates a position of favor and honor. In ancient Near Eastern culture, sharing a meal with the king was a sign of acceptance and fellowship. This privilege granted to Jehoiachin suggests a reversal of fortune and a measure of grace extended to him. It parallels the story of Mephibosheth in <a href="/2_samuel/9.htm">2 Samuel 9</a>, who was also invited to eat at King David's table despite his previous misfortunes. This act can be seen as a foreshadowing of the Messianic banquet, where believers are invited to dine with Christ, as depicted in <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>.<p><b>for the rest of his life</b><br>The phrase underscores the permanence of Jehoiachin's new status. Unlike temporary reprieves, this change was enduring, highlighting the theme of God's enduring mercy and faithfulness. It reflects the biblical principle that God's grace is not fleeting but everlasting, as seen in <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>. Jehoiachin's lifelong dining at the king's table can be viewed as a type of eternal life promised to believers, where they will enjoy unending fellowship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiachin.htm">Jehoiachin</a></b><br>The former king of Judah who was taken captive by the Babylonians.

Our translators preferred the latter, our Revisers the former. In either case the general meaning is the same. Evil Merodach supplied suitable garments to the released monarch instead of his "prison garments," and Jehoiachin arrayed himself in the comely apparel before taking his seat among his equals. Dresses of honor are among the most common gifts which an Oriental monarch makes to his subjects (see <a href="/genesis/41-42.htm">Genesis 41:42</a>; <a href="/esther/6-8.htm">Esther 6:8, 11</a>; <a href="/esther/8-15.htm">Esther 8:15</a>; <a href="/daniel/5-29.htm">Daniel 5:29</a>; Xen., 'Cyrop.,' 5:1. &sect; 1). <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehoiachin - <span class="cmt_word">did eat bread continually before him.</span> Besides giving occasional great feasts (see <a href="/esther/1-3.htm">Esther 1:3-9</a>), Oriental monarchs usually entertain at their table daily a large number of guests, some of whom are specially invited, while others have the privilege of daily attendance (see ' Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 3. pp. 214, 215). It was to this latter class that Jehoiachin was admitted. Comp. <a href="/2_samuel/9-7.htm">2 Samuel 9:7-13</a>, which shows that the custom was one not unknown at the Jewish court. <span class="cmt_word">All the days of his</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehoiachin's - <span class="cmt_word">life.</span> Jehoisohin enjoyed this privilege till his death. Whether this fell in the lifetime of Evil-Merodach or not, is scarcely in the writer's thoughts. He merely means to tell us that the comparative comfort and dignity which Jehoiachin enjoyed after the accession of Evil-Merodach to the throne was not subsequently clouded over or disturbed. He continued a privileged person at the Baby-Ionian court so long as he lived. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/25-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Jehoiachin changed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1429;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;in&#183;n&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
