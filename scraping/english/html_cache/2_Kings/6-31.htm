In the context of ancient Israel, such announcements were often made in moments of crisis or decision. The king's role as a leader required him to address the people, especially during times of distress, such as the famine in Samaria.<p><b>&#8220;May God punish me, and ever so severely,</b><br>This is a common oath formula in the Old Testament, reflecting the seriousness of the speaker's intent. It invokes divine retribution as a guarantee of the speaker's commitment to their words. This type of oath is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/ruth/1-17.htm">Ruth 1:17</a>, where Ruth makes a similar vow to Naomi. It underscores the gravity of the situation and the king's desperation.<p><b>if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat</b><br>Elisha, the prophet, was the successor of Elijah and a prominent figure in the Northern Kingdom of Israel. His role as a prophet was to convey God's messages, often challenging the king and the people to return to faithfulness. The mention of "the head" signifies a threat of execution, a common practice for dealing with perceived enemies or traitors. Elisha's father, Shaphat, is mentioned to identify him clearly, as was customary in genealogical references.<p><b>remains on his shoulders</b><br>This phrase is a vivid expression of the king's intent to execute Elisha. It reflects the cultural and historical practice of beheading as a form of capital punishment. The king's anger towards Elisha likely stems from frustration over the ongoing famine and the belief that the prophet, as God's representative, should have intervened.<p><b>through this day!&#8221;</b><br>The urgency in the king's words indicates a critical moment, possibly due to the dire circumstances of the siege of Samaria by the Arameans. The phrase "through this day" suggests an immediate timeframe, highlighting the king's desperation and impulsive decision-making. This reflects the broader biblical theme of human impatience and the tendency to blame God's messengers during times of crisis.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet in Israel, successor of Elijah, known for performing miracles and providing guidance to the kings of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_israel.htm">King of Israel</a></b><br>The unnamed king during this time, likely King Jehoram, who is facing a dire situation due to the Aramean siege of Samaria.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, under siege by the Arameans, leading to a severe famine.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/arameans.htm">Arameans</a></b><br>The enemy nation besieging Samaria, causing distress and desperation among the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/siege_of_samaria.htm">Siege of Samaria</a></b><br>A significant event where the city is surrounded by the Arameans, leading to extreme famine and desperation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Despite dire circumstances, believers are called to trust in God's ultimate control and plan, as Elisha did.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_crisis.htm">Responding to Crisis</a></b><br>The king's reaction to blame Elisha contrasts with seeking God's guidance.

His rash vow, framed in pious language, showcases unbelief and impotence: while he threatens death, God is about to bring life-saving deliverance the very next day. The verse warns against hardening our hearts toward God&#8217;s word and assures us that no earthly power can silence the Lord&#8217;s faithful servants.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">Then he said.</span>--<span class= "ital">And he </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the king), <span class= "ital">said.<span class= "bld"></span><p>God do so . . . to me.<span class= "ital"></span></span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">So</span> <span class= "ital">may God do to me, and so may he add</span>: a common form of oath.

(Comp. with the oath that of Jezebel against Elijah, <a href="/1_kings/19-2.htm" title="Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not your life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time.">1Kings 19:2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> "continue on him" - <span class="cmt_word">this day.</span> The form of oath was a common one (comp. <a href="/ruth/1-17.htm">Ruth 1:17</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/3-17.htm">1 Samuel 3:17</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/25-22.htm">1 Samuel 25:22</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/19-13.htm">2 Samuel 19:13</a>; <a href="/1_kings/2-23.htm">1 Kings 2:23</a>; <a href="/1_kings/19-2.htm">1 Kings 19:2</a>, etc.). It was an imprecation of evil on one's self, if one did, or if one failed to do, a certain thing. Why Jehoram should have considered Elisha as responsible for all the horrors of the siege is not apparent; but perhaps he supposed that it was in Elisha's power to work a miracle of any kind at any moment that he liked. If so, he misunderstood the nature of the miraculous gift. In threatening to behead Elisha, he is not making himself an executor of the Law, which nowhere sanctioned that mode of punishment, but assuming the arbitrary power of the other Oriental monarchs of his time, who regarded themselves as absolute masters of the lives and liberties of their subjects. Beheading was common in Egypt, in Babylonia, and in Assyria. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/6-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He announced,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1429;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
