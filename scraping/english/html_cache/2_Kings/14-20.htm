The use of horses suggests a royal or honorable procession, as horses were often associated with nobility and military strength in ancient Israel. This reflects the respect given to a king, even in death, and aligns with the practices of other ancient Near Eastern cultures where royalty was transported with dignity. Horses were a symbol of power and prestige, often used in royal processions and military contexts (<a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>).<p><b>and buried him in Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem, the capital city of Judah, held significant religious and political importance. It was the site of the Temple, the center of Jewish worship, and the city of David, the revered king. Burial in Jerusalem was a mark of honor and continuity with the Davidic line. This practice underscores the importance of Jerusalem as a sacred and royal city, where the kings of Judah were laid to rest, maintaining the legacy of their forefathers (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-20.htm">2 Chronicles 21:20</a>).<p><b>with his fathers</b><br>This phrase indicates that Amaziah was buried in the royal tombs, alongside previous kings of Judah. It signifies continuity and respect for the Davidic dynasty, emphasizing the importance of family lineage and heritage in Israelite culture. The phrase "with his fathers" is a common biblical expression denoting burial in the family tomb, reflecting the belief in maintaining familial bonds even in death (<a href="/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29-31</a>).<p><b>in the City of David</b><br>The City of David refers to the ancient core of Jerusalem, established by King David as his capital. It is a historically and archaeologically significant area, often associated with the Davidic covenant and the promise of an everlasting dynasty (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). The burial of kings in this location highlights the connection to David, the ideal king, and the hope for a future messianic ruler from his line.
