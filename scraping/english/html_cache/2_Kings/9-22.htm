His inquiry about peace reflects the political instability and tension of the time. Jehu, a commander in the army, had been anointed by a prophet to become king and to execute judgment on the house of Ahab. The question of peace is ironic, as Joram is unaware of Jehu's divine mission to overthrow him. This moment is a turning point in Israel's history, as it marks the beginning of the end for the dynasty of Ahab, fulfilling the prophecy given to Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-24</a>).<p><b>&#8220;How can there be peace,&#8221; he replied,</b><br>Jehu's response highlights the impossibility of peace under the current spiritual and moral conditions in Israel. The rhetorical question underscores the divine mandate Jehu carries to cleanse Israel from the sins introduced by Ahab and Jezebel. This reflects the biblical principle that true peace cannot exist where there is persistent sin and rebellion against God. Jehu's mission is not just political but also spiritual, as he is tasked with eradicating the idolatry that has plagued the nation.<p><b>&#8220;as long as the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound?&#8221;</b><br>Jezebel, the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians, was notorious for promoting Baal worship and persecuting the prophets of Yahweh. Her influence led Israel into deep idolatry and witchcraft, practices that were abominations to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>). The mention of Jezebel's idolatry and witchcraft serves as an indictment of the spiritual corruption she introduced. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where leaders' sins have national consequences. Jehu's mission to eliminate Jezebel and her influence is a fulfillment of God's judgment pronounced by Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/21-23.htm">1 Kings 21:23</a>). This act of judgment is a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and evil, as Jehu's cleansing of Israel prefigures the final eradication of sin at Christ's return.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joram.htm">Joram (Jehoram)</a></b><br>The king of Israel, son of Ahab and Jezebel, known for continuing the idolatrous practices of his parents.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>Anointed by God through the prophet Elisha to be king over Israel and tasked with eradicating the house of Ahab and the worship of Baal.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jezebel.htm">Jezebel</a></b><br>The mother of Joram, infamous for promoting Baal worship and witchcraft in Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, often led astray by its kings into idolatry and away from the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/idolatry_and_witchcraft.htm">Idolatry and Witchcraft</a></b><br>Practices condemned by God, prevalent in Israel due to Jezebel's influence, representing spiritual adultery and rebellion against God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_idolatry.htm">The Consequences of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry leads to spiritual decay and separation from God.

Or possibly he maybe merely repeating the question put through his messengers, and still unanswered, Is all well with the army or no? Has there been any disaster?" Jehu, at any rate, chooses to understand his vague phrase in the former sense, as if he had asked, "Is it peace between thee and me?" and answers in the negative. <span class="cmt_word">And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witch-crafts are so many?</span> literally, <span class="accented">so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and those many witchcrafts of hers continue</span>. By "whoredoms" are meant idolatries, as so frequently in Scripture (<a href="/leviticus/19-29.htm">Leviticus 19:29</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-5.htm">Leviticus 20:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-2.htm">Jeremiah 3:2, 9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/13-17.htm">Jeremiah 13:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-17.htm">Ezekiel 16:17</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-30.htm">Ezekiel 20:30</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/23-11.htm">Ezekiel 23:11</a>, etc.; <a href="/hosea/2-2.htm">Hosea 2:2</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>; <a href="/hosea/5-4.htm">Hosea 5:4</a>; <a href="/nahum/3-4.htm">Nahum 3:4</a>, etc.); by "witchcrafts" all those magical practices which were so common at the time in Egypt, Assyria, and Babylonia, and no doubt also in Phoenicia, and which were so strictly forbidden by the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/22-18.htm">Exodus 22:18</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>). Besides the Baal-worship, Jezebel had introduced these unhallowed practices into the kingdom of Israel. Jehu reproaches Joram with allowing them, and declares that there can be no peace between him and his master under ouch circumstances. Having gained his object and got within bowshot of the unsuspecting monarch, he throws off the mask and declares uncompromising hostility. "No man could use such terms of the queen-mother who was willing any longer to be a subject." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/9-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Joram</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;r&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3088.htm">Strong's 3088: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jehoram -- 'the LORD is exalted', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1444;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(kir&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
