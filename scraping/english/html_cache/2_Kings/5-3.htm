Her position as a servant in a foreign land highlights the historical context of frequent conflicts between Israel and Aram (modern-day Syria). Despite her circumstances, she shows compassion and faith, which is significant given her status and the cultural norms of the time. Her boldness in speaking to her mistress reflects a deep trust in God's power and the prophets of Israel.<p><b>If only my master would go to the prophet</b><br>The young girl refers to the prophet Elisha, who was known for performing miracles and serving as a mouthpiece for God in Israel. Her statement underscores the belief in the power of God's prophets to perform acts of healing and deliverance. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God using prophets to demonstrate His power and communicate His will. The girl's faith in the prophet's ability to heal Naaman is a testament to the reputation Elisha had in Israel.<p><b>who is in Samaria</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel during this period. It was a significant city both politically and religiously. The mention of Samaria situates the narrative geographically and highlights the division between Israel and Aram. This division is important in understanding the miraculous nature of the events that follow, as it involves interaction between two often-hostile nations. The reference to Samaria also emphasizes the centrality of Israel as the place where God's power is manifested through His prophets.<p><b>he would cure him of his leprosy</b><br>Leprosy in biblical times was a term used for various skin diseases, often seen as a sign of impurity and divine judgment. The girl's confidence that the prophet could cure Naaman indicates a belief in God's power to heal and restore, transcending human limitations and societal boundaries. This foreshadows the New Testament accounts of Jesus healing lepers, drawing a parallel between Elisha's ministry and the ministry of Christ. The healing of Naaman serves as a type of Christ's redemptive work, offering cleansing and restoration to those who seek Him in faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_young_israelite_girl.htm">The Young Israelite Girl</a></b><br>A captive from Israel serving Naaman's wife.

In Israel lepers were excluded from society. Restoration to society implied restoration to health. Hence the same verb came to be used in the sense of healing as well as of receiving back the leper. Thenius, however, argues that as the phrase "from leprosy" is wanting in Numbers 12, the real meaning is, "to take a person away from leprosy," to which he had been, as it were, delivered up.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with the prophet that is in Samaria!</span> literally, <span class="accented">Oh that my lord were before the prophet who is in Samaria</span>! Elisha had a house in Samaria (<a href="/2_kings/6-32.htm">2 Kings 6:32</a>), where he resided occasionally. <span class="cmt_word">For he would recover him of his leprosy.</span> The "little maid" concludes from her small experience that, if her master and the great miracle-working prophet of her own land could be brought together, the result would be his cure. She has, in her servile condition, contracted an affection both for her master and her mistress, and her sympathies are strongly with them. Perhaps she had no serious purpose in speaking as she did. The words burst from her as a mere expression of goodwill. She did not contemplate any action resulting from them. "Oh that things could be otherwise than as they are! Had I my dear master in my own country, it would be easy to accomplish his cure. The prophet is so powerful and so kind. He both could and would recover <span class="accented">him</span>." Any notion of her vague wish being carried out, being made the ground of a serious embassy, was probably far from the girl's thought. But the "bread cast upon the waters returns after many days." There is no kind wish or kind utterance that may not have a result far beyond anything that the wisher or utterer contemplated. Good wishes are seeds that ofttimes take root, and grow, and blossom, and bear fruit beyond the uttermost conception of those who sow them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/5-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">She said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1433;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
