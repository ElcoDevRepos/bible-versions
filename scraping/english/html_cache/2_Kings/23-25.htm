Josiah's reforms and dedication to God set him apart from other kings. His reign is marked by a significant religious revival, as he sought to restore the worship of Yahweh and eliminate idolatry. This statement underscores the rarity of such devotion among the kings of Judah, emphasizing Josiah's exceptional commitment to God.<p><b>who turned to the LORD with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength</b><br>This phrase echoes the Shema, found in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, which commands love for God with all one's heart, soul, and strength. Josiah's actions reflect a comprehensive devotion to God, not just in outward reforms but in his inner life and motivations. His turning to the LORD signifies repentance and a wholehearted commitment to follow God's commandments, setting a standard for true worship and obedience.<p><b>according to all the Law of Moses</b><br>Josiah's reforms were based on the rediscovery of the Book of the Law during temple renovations (<a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8-13</a>). This discovery led to a renewed emphasis on the covenantal laws given through Moses.

Josiah&#8217;s reforms weren&#8217;t cosmetic; they sprang from an inner, personal relationship with the LORD (<a href="/psalms/119-10.htm">Psalm 119:10</a>).<p>&#8226; By removing idolatry from the temple precincts (<a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4&#8211;7</a>), Josiah demonstrated that true repentance starts with clearing out rival loves (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and with all his soul</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Soul&#8221; brings depth&#8212;life, identity, personhood (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>).

It is not, perhaps, necessary to insist upon any formal contradiction which may appear to result from a comparison of the two passages. A writer would not be careful to measure his words by the rule of strict proportion in such cases. Still, as the preceding account indicates, the Mosaic law does not appear to have been so rigorously carried out by any preceding king as by Josiah. (See Note on <a href="/2_chronicles/30-26.htm" title="So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 30:26</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">With all his heart . . .</span>--An echo of <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm" title="And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>.

The writer of Kings cannot be said to place Josiah above Hezekiah, or Hezekiah above Josiah. He accords them the same degree of praise, but, in Hezekiah's case, dwells upon his trust in God; in Josiah's, upon his exact obedience to the Law. On the whole, his judgment accords very closely with that of the son of Sirach (Ecclus. 49:4).
