Hezekiah, the king of Judah, is facing a terminal illness as prophesied by the prophet Isaiah. Turning his face to the wall signifies a withdrawal from the world around him, seeking privacy and solitude in his communication with God. This act can be seen as a symbolic gesture of turning away from human help and focusing solely on divine intervention. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, turning to the wall could also imply a posture of humility and earnestness in prayer.<p><b>and prayed to the LORD,</b><br>Hezekiah's immediate response to his dire situation is to pray, demonstrating his faith and reliance on God. This reflects the biblical principle of seeking God in times of trouble, as seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/psalms/50-15.htm">Psalm 50:15</a>, "Call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you will honor Me." Hezekiah's prayer is a model of sincere and heartfelt communication with God, emphasizing the importance of prayer in the believer's life. His action aligns with the teachings of other biblical figures who turned to God in prayer during crises, such as Daniel and David.<p><b>saying,</b><br>The introduction of Hezekiah's prayer highlights the personal and direct nature of his communication with God. It sets the stage for the content of his prayer, which is a plea for mercy and a reminder of his faithfulness and devotion to God. This moment underscores the biblical theme that God is attentive to the prayers of the righteous, as echoed in <a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>, "The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective." Hezekiah's prayer is not only a request for healing but also an expression of his relationship with God, rooted in trust and covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to restore proper worship in the temple.

Hezekiah does not argue with the prophet; instead, he responds immediately.<p>&#8226; Earlier Scripture paints Hezekiah as a man of steadfast trust: &#8220;Hezekiah trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel. No king of Judah either before him or after him was like him&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/18-5.htm">2 Kings 18:5</a>). His character explains why his first instinct when crisis strikes is to seek God rather than human help.<p>&#8226; This swift turn toward the LORD mirrors his earlier action during Assyria&#8217;s siege (<a href="/2_kings/19-1.htm">2 Kings 19:1</a>). Consistency in crisis reveals genuine faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Turned his face to the wall</b><p>&#8226; He physically shifts position, likely to avoid distraction and fix his thoughts solely on God. Privacy matters when pouring out the heart (see <a href="/matthew/6-6.htm">Matthew 6:6</a>, where Jesus commends secret prayer).<p>&#8226; Turning away from people&#8212;Isaiah, attendants, even the open room&#8212;symbolizes turning away from earthly resources. Like Ahab who &#8220;turned his face toward the wall&#8221; in sulking (<a href="/1_kings/21-4.htm">1 Kings 21:4</a>), Hezekiah turns, but with a godly purpose.<p>&#8226; The gesture speaks of determination: &#8220;Search for Him with all your heart and all your soul&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29</a>). Concentrated attention signals earnestness to heaven.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And prayed to the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Prayer is Hezekiah&#8217;s reflex, not a last resort. The same king had already laid Sennacherib&#8217;s blasphemous letter before the LORD (<a href="/2_kings/19-14.htm">2 Kings 19:14-19</a>). He knows God hears.<p>&#8226; He petitions the covenant Name&#8212;&#8220;the LORD&#8221; (YHWH)&#8212;reminding us that prayer rests on relationship, not ritual. <a href="/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4</a> echoes his experience: &#8220;I sought the LORD, and He answered me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture ties effective prayer to righteousness: &#8220;The prayer of a righteous person has great power to prevail&#8221; (<a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>).

He appeals to God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness and his own sincere walk.<p>&#8226; The openness of &#8220;saying&#8221; affirms that God invites candid speech.
