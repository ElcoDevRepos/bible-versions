His reign is marked by a return to idolatry and disobedience to God, contrasting with his father Josiah's reforms. This period is significant as it sets the stage for the Babylonian exile, a pivotal event in Jewish history. Jehoiakim's reign is also mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/22-18.htm">Jeremiah 22:18-19</a>, where the prophet condemns his actions and predicts his downfall.<p><b>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon invaded</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar II was one of the most powerful monarchs of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, known for his military conquests and the construction of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. His invasion of Judah was part of a larger campaign to expand Babylonian influence and control over the region. This invasion fulfilled the warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah and Habakkuk about the consequences of Judah's unfaithfulness. The Babylonian invasion is a key event that leads to the eventual destruction of Jerusalem and the temple in 586 BC.<p><b>So Jehoiakim became his vassal for three years</b><br>As a vassal, Jehoiakim was required to pay tribute to Babylon and acknowledge Nebuchadnezzar's supremacy. This arrangement was common in the ancient Near East, where weaker states often became vassals to more powerful empires. The vassalage of Jehoiakim is a fulfillment of the prophecies in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-47.htm">Deuteronomy 28:47-48</a>, where disobedience to God would lead to servitude under foreign powers. This period of vassalage is also a time of political tension and unrest in Judah.<p><b>until he turned and rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar</b><br>Jehoiakim's rebellion against Babylon was likely influenced by shifting political alliances and the hope of support from Egypt. This decision to rebel was ill-advised and led to further suffering for Judah, as prophesied by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-8.htm">Jeremiah 25:8-11</a>). The rebellion resulted in punitive actions by Nebuchadnezzar, including further invasions and the eventual siege of Jerusalem. This act of rebellion highlights the theme of human pride and defiance against God's ordained plans, contrasting with the humility and obedience exemplified by Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiakim.htm">Jehoiakim</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this period, known for his disobedience to God and his eventual rebellion against Babylon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon, a powerful ruler who expanded his empire and exerted control over Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The empire that rose to power under Nebuchadnezzar, known for its significant role in the history of Israel and Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/vassalage.htm">Vassalage</a></b><br>The state of being a vassal, which in this context means Jehoiakim was subject to Nebuchadnezzar's authority for a period.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebellion.htm">Rebellion</a></b><br>Jehoiakim's decision to rebel against Nebuchadnezzar, which had significant consequences for Judah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Jehoiakim's rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar, despite being warned by prophets like Jeremiah, illustrates the severe consequences of disobedience to God's commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_world_events.htm">God's Sovereignty in World Events</a></b><br>The rise of Nebuchadnezzar and Babylon demonstrates God's control over nations and history, using even pagan rulers to fulfill His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_heeding_prophetic_warnings.htm">The Importance of Heeding Prophetic Warnings</a></b><br>The events in <a href="/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24:1</a> remind us of the importance of listening to God's messengers and the dangers of ignoring divine warnings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_rebellion.htm">The Cost of Rebellion</a></b><br>Jehoiakim's rebellion serves as a cautionary tale about the cost of defying authority, especially when it is part of God's ordained plan.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trusting_god's_plan_amidst_political_turmoil.htm">Trusting God's Plan Amidst Political Turmoil</a></b><br>In times of political upheaval, believers are encouraged to trust in God's ultimate plan and remain faithful to His word.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_24_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 24:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_24_1_God_s_rule_over_nations.htm">How does 2 Kings 24:1 illustrate God's sovereignty over nations and rulers?

According to Berosus, he was not at the time of this expedition the actual sovereign of Babylonia, but only the crown prince, placed by the actual king, Nabopolassar, at the head of his army. It is possible that his father may have associated him in the kingdom, for association was not unknown at Babylon; or the Jews may have mistaken his position; or the historian may call him king by <span class="accented">prolepsis</span>, as a modern might say, "The Emperor Napoleon invaded Italy and defeated the Austrians at Marengo" (see Pusey's 'Daniel,' p. 400). His father had grown too old and infirm to conduct a military expedition, and consequently sent his son in his place, with the object of chastising Nechoh, and recovering the territory whereof Nechoh had made himself master three years before (see <a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29-33</a>, and compare below, ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoiakim became his servant</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> submitted to him, and became a tributary king - <span class="cmt_word">three years</span> (from <span class="date">B.C. 605</span> to <span class="date">B.C. 602</span>): <span class="cmt_word">then he turned and rebelled against him.</span> How Jehoiakim came to venture on this step we are not told, and can only conjecture. It is, perhaps, most probable that (as Josephus says, 'Ant. Jud.' 10:6, &sect; 2) he was incited to take this course by the Egyptians, who were still under the rule of the brave and enterprising Nechoh, and who may have hoped to wipe out by fresh victories the disaster experienced at Carehemish. There is, perhaps, an allusion to Jehoiakim's expectation of Egyptian succors in the statement of ver. 7, that "the King of Egypt came not again any more out of his land." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/24-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">During Jehoiakim&#8217;s reign,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;m&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
