In the context of <a href="/2_kings/11.htm">2 Kings 11</a>, the command comes from Jehoiada the priest, who is orchestrating a coup to protect the young Joash and overthrow the usurper queen Athaliah. The role of a priest giving military orders highlights the intertwining of religious and political leadership in ancient Israel. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israelite society, where religious leaders often played crucial roles in governance and national affairs.<p><b>&#8220;This is what you are to do:</b><br>The specificity of the instructions underscores the careful planning and strategic thinking involved in the operation. It suggests a well-organized plan to ensure the safety of the rightful king and the success of the coup.

The Sabbath was a day of rest and worship, but it also provided a practical opportunity for a shift change among the guards, minimizing suspicion. This reflects the importance of the Sabbath in Jewish life, as a day set apart for rest and religious observance, as commanded in <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>.<p><b>shall guard the royal palace,</b><br>The royal palace was the center of political power and the residence of the king. Guarding it was crucial to maintaining control over the kingdom. This task was assigned to a third of the guards, indicating the importance of protecting the king and the seat of power. The palace's protection is reminiscent of the divine protection promised to the Davidic line, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>, where God promises David that his house and kingdom will endure forever.

The troops of the royal guard regularly succeeded each other on duty just as they do in modern European capitals. That the Sabbath was the day on which they relieved each other is known only from this passage; but the priestly and Levitical guilds did the same, and their organisation in many ways resembled that of an army.<p><span class= "bld">The watch of the king's house.</span>--There were two places to be occupied for the success of the present movement--viz., the royal palace and the Temple, "the king's house" and "the house of the Lord." In the former was Athaliah, the usurping queen, whose movements must be closely watched, and whose adherents must be prevented from occupying and defending the palace; in the latter, the young heir to the throne, who must be protected from attack. That "the king's house" here means the palace proper is evident from <a href="/2_kings/11-16.htm" title="And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain.">2Kings 11:16</a>; <a href="/2_kings/11-19.htm" title="And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house.

The LXX. adds, "at the entry" (<span class= "greekheb">?? ?? ??????</span>)--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the grand entrance to the palace itself.

The <span class="accented">immediate</span> arrangement made between Jehoiada and the centurions was that they should "go throughout the whole land" (Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 9:7. &sect; 2), visit "all the cities of Judah" (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-2.htm">2 Chronicles 23:2</a>), and gather out of them a strong force of Levites and priests (Josephus), together with a certain number of other representative Israelites, which force they should bring with them to Jerusalem, and place at his disposal. To accomplish this must have taken some weeks. When the force had arrived, Jehoiada summoned it to meet him in the courts of the temple, and swore it to a similar covenant to that which he had made with the centurions. He then bided his time, completed his arrangements, utilized the store of arms laid up in the temple armory (ver. 10), and finally gave two charges - one to the centurions, which is given here (vers. 5-8), and the other to the force collected from the cities of Judah, which is given in Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-4.htm">2 Chronicles 23:4-7</a>). The orders given to the two forces were very similar, but not identical. <span class="cmt_word">A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath.</span> The royal body-guard consisted of five divisions, each probably of a hundred men, and each commanded by its own captain (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-1.htm">2 Chronicles 23:1</a>). It was usual on the sabbath for three divisions out of the five to mount guard at the royal palace, while two were engaged outside, keeping order in the city, and especially at the temple. We do not know the ordinary disposition of the guard, either inside or outside the palace. On this occasion Jehoiada commanded that the palace-guard should be disposed as follows: one division at the palace proper, in the courts and halls and antechambers; a second at one of the issues from the palace, known as "the gate of Sur;" and a third at an issue called "the gate of the guard," which was certainly towards the east, where the palace fronted the temple. The object was to secure the palace, but not to prevent the queen from leaving it. <span class="cmt_word">Shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the royal palace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/11-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and commanded them,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1510;&#1463;&#1493;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7779;aw&#183;w&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
