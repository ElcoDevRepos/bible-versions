Elijah, known as the Tishbite, is a prominent prophet in Israel, hailing from Tishbe in Gilead. His role as a prophet is to convey God's messages, often confronting idolatry and apostasy in Israel.<p><b>Go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria</b><br>The king of Samaria refers to Ahaziah, the son of Ahab and Jezebel, who ruled the northern kingdom of Israel. Samaria was the capital of the northern kingdom, established by King Omri. Elijah is instructed to intercept the king's messengers, indicating the urgency and importance of the divine message.<p><b>and ask them, &#8216;Is it because there is no God in Israel</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights Israel's covenant relationship with Yahweh, who had proven His power and presence repeatedly. The question underscores the absurdity and faithlessness of seeking foreign gods when the true God is present in Israel. It serves as a rebuke to Ahaziah's lack of faith and reliance on pagan deities.<p><b>that you are on your way to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?&#8217;</b><br>Baal-zebub, meaning "lord of the flies," was a deity worshiped in Ekron, a Philistine city. This name is a derogatory alteration of Baal-zebul, "lord of the high place," reflecting the biblical disdain for idolatry. The Philistines were long-time adversaries of Israel, and seeking their god's counsel was a direct violation of Israel's exclusive worship of Yahweh. This act of seeking guidance from Baal-zebub illustrates the spiritual decline and syncretism prevalent in Israel during Ahaziah's reign.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/angel_of_the_lord.htm">Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger who delivers God's instructions to Elijah.
