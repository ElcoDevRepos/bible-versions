The famine was so severe that it led to acts of cannibalism, which were considered abominable and a sign of extreme desperation. This event fulfills the warnings given in <a href="/leviticus/26-29.htm">Leviticus 26:29</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53</a>, where God warned Israel that disobedience would lead to such dire consequences. The act of boiling and eating a child underscores the depth of the crisis and the moral and spiritual decay that had befallen the people. It also serves as a grim reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>and the next day I said to her, &#8216;Give up your son, that we may eat him.&#8217;</b><br>This part of the narrative highlights the broken trust and the collapse of social and familial bonds during the siege. The agreement between the two women to eat their children on successive days shows the extent of their desperation. It also reflects the fulfillment of prophetic warnings about the horrors that would befall a disobedient nation. The request to "give up your son" is a tragic echo of the earlier agreement, emphasizing the hopelessness and moral confusion that had overtaken the city.<p><b>But she had hidden her son.&#8221;</b><br>The woman's decision to hide her son reveals a glimmer of maternal instinct and the innate desire to protect one's offspring, even in the face of starvation. This act of hiding her son can be seen as a desperate attempt to preserve life amidst death. It also introduces a moment of conflict and betrayal, as the initial agreement is broken. This situation illustrates the breakdown of societal norms and the extreme measures people resort to in times of crisis. The narrative serves as a powerful illustration of the consequences of sin and the need for repentance and reliance on God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_israel.htm">The King of Israel</a></b><br>The unnamed king during this time, likely King Jehoram, who was ruling the Northern Kingdom of Israel.

The account is literal, describing the horrors inside besieged Samaria (<a href="/2_kings/6-24.htm">2 Kings 6:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; God had warned Israel that covenant disobedience would bring famine so fierce that parents would consume their own children (<a href="/leviticus/26-29.htm">Leviticus 26:29</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-52.htm">Deuteronomy 28:52-57</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse shows that those warnings were not empty; sin&#8217;s consequences arrive exactly as foretold.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And ate him</b><p>&#8226; The phrase conveys the depth of despair: parental love, normally one of the strongest human bonds, has been overrun by hunger.<p>&#8226; Cannibalism appears elsewhere in Scripture as the nadir of judgment (<a href="/lamentations/2-20.htm">Lamentations 2:20</a>; 4:10).<p>&#8226; It reminds us that when a nation rejects God, even the basic boundaries of morality collapse (<a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The next day I said to her</b><p>&#8226; A pragmatic arrangement had been made between the two mothers&#8212;one child today, the other tomorrow.<p>&#8226; This matter-of-fact tone underscores how famine numbed consciences (cf. <a href="/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11-12</a>, where spiritual famine parallels physical).<p>&#8226; The king hears the story (<a href="/2_kings/6-26.htm">2 Kings 6:26</a>) and tears his robe, signaling the nation&#8217;s spiritual bankruptcy (<a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Give up your son, that we may eat him.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226;

The demand also fulfills <a href="/deuteronomy/28-57.htm">Deuteronomy 28:57</a>, where the siege would drive &#8220;the most gentle woman&#8221; to such acts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But she had hidden her son</b><p>&#8226;

The verse is not hyperbole but a sober warning: when God&#8217;s word is dismissed, even the strongest natural affections disintegrate, justice becomes twisted, and deception reigns. Yet the surrounding narrative ultimately points forward to God&#8217;s deliverance (<a href="/2_kings/7-1.htm">2 Kings 7:1-2</a>), reminding us that while judgment is real, His mercy awaits all who return to Him in faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">she hath hid her son.</span>--Perhaps to save him.
