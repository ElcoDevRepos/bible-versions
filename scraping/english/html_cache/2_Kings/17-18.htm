The anger of the LORD is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often resulting from the breaking of the covenant established at Sinai (Exodus 19-24). The Israelites had turned to worship Baal and other Canaanite deities, violating the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This anger is not arbitrary but a response to Israel's repeated rejection of God's laws and prophets (<a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13-17</a>). The anger of God is also a reflection of His holiness and justice, as He cannot tolerate sin.<p><b>and He removed them from His presence</b><br>This removal refers to the Assyrian exile of the northern kingdom in 722 BC, when the Assyrians conquered Samaria and deported the Israelites. Being removed from God's presence signifies a loss of divine favor and protection, as well as a physical displacement from the Promised Land, which was a central aspect of the covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). The presence of God was symbolically associated with the temple in Jerusalem, and being removed from His presence implies a severance from the spiritual and communal life centered around worship. This exile fulfilled the warnings given by prophets like Amos and Hosea, who had foretold the consequences of Israel's unfaithfulness.<p><b>Only the tribe of Judah remained</b><br>This phrase highlights the division of the united monarchy into two kingdoms after Solomon's reign: Israel in the north and Judah in the south. Judah's survival at this point is significant, as it is the tribe from which David's lineage comes, and through which the Messiah, Jesus Christ, would eventually be born (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1-16</a>). The preservation of Judah is seen as part of God's redemptive plan, maintaining a remnant through which His promises would be fulfilled. Despite Judah's own failings, they were spared at this time, possibly due to the reforms of kings like Hezekiah and Josiah, who sought to return to the worship of Yahweh. This remnant theme is crucial in biblical theology, emphasizing God's faithfulness to His covenant even amidst human unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is just and righteous, and whose anger is kindled against Israel due to their persistent disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, consisting of ten tribes, which repeatedly turned away from God, leading to their eventual exile by the Assyrians.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The Southern Kingdom, consisting of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, which remained after Israel's exile.

Earlier verses (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-17</a>) recount idolatry, child sacrifice, and rejection of God&#8217;s statutes&#8212;behaviors God had clearly forbidden in passages such as <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s wrath here is not impulsive; it follows centuries of patience and prophetic warnings (<a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-4.htm">Jeremiah 25:4-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross references emphasize the personal nature of God&#8217;s anger toward persistent rebellion: <a href="/psalms/78-58.htm">Psalm 78:58-60</a> and <a href="/hosea/8-5.htm">Hosea 8:5-14</a> both describe Israel provoking God&#8217;s jealousy and inviting judgment.<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that sin has real consequences, fulfilling <a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-33</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>, where exile is listed as the penalty for covenant unfaithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He removed them from His presence</b><p>&#8220;&#8216;&#8230;and He removed them from His presence.&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18</a>)<p>&#8226; &#8220;Presence&#8221; points to the land where God chose to place His Name (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>). Being driven out meant separation from that blessing.<p>&#8226; The removal was historical and literal: the Assyrian conquest of 722 BC (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). Exile was God&#8217;s instrument to purify and to display His holiness (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Other passages confirm that losing God&#8217;s presence is the ultimate tragedy of sin: see <a href="/1_samuel/4-21.htm">1 Samuel 4:21-22</a> (Ichabod), <a href="/psalms/51-11.htm">Psalm 51:11</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18-19</a>.<p>&#8226; Yet even in judgment, God preserves hope; prophets like <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-12</a> and <a href="/amos/9-14.htm">Amos 9:14-15</a> foresee a future regathering, showing that exile is disciplinary, not annihilative.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Only the tribe of Judah remained</b><p>&#8220;&#8216;Only the tribe of Judah remained.&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18</a>)<p>&#8226; After the fall of the northern kingdom (ten tribes), Judah and the smaller tribe of Benjamin continued under the Davidic line (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-12.htm">2 Chronicles 11:12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-19.htm">2 Kings 8:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Judah&#8217;s survival underscores God&#8217;s promise to David in <a href="/2_samuel/7-13.htm">2 Samuel 7:13-16</a>&#8212;a covenant ultimately fulfilled in Jesus (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<p>&#8226; This remnant theme runs throughout Scripture (<a href="/isaiah/37-31.htm">Isaiah 37:31-32</a>; <a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>), showing God&#8217;s faithfulness even when the majority fall away.<p>&#8226; Judah, however, was not immune; later, Babylonian exile came (<a href="/bsb/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24-25</a>), proving that privilege requires obedience (<a href="/jeremiah/7-3.htm">Jeremiah 7:3-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/17-18.htm">2 Kings 17:18</a> records the climax of Israel&#8217;s long-term rebellion: God&#8217;s righteous anger leading to exile.
