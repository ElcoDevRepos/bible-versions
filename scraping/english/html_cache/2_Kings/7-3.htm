These men were likely isolated from the community due to their condition, as prescribed by Mosaic Law, which required lepers to live outside the camp (<a href="/numbers/5-2.htm">Numbers 5:2-3</a>). The city gate was a place of social and economic activity, but these men were on the outskirts, highlighting their exclusion. Their presence at the gate during a time of siege (<a href="/2_kings/6-24.htm">2 Kings 6:24-25</a>) underscores their desperation, as they were cut off from the city&#8217;s resources.<p><b>and they said to one another,</b><br>This phrase indicates a communal decision-making process among the lepers. In their marginalized state, they relied on each other for companionship and survival. This reflects the broader biblical theme of community and mutual support, seen in passages like <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-10</a>, which emphasizes the strength found in unity.<p><b>&#8220;Why just sit here until we die?</b><br>The lepers' question reveals their dire situation and the urgency of their plight. It reflects a moment of introspection and a decision to take action despite their bleak circumstances. This mirrors the biblical principle of faith leading to action, as seen in <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>, which states that faith without works is dead. Their decision to act can be seen as a step of faith, trusting in the possibility of a better outcome despite the risks. This moment also foreshadows the deliverance that God would provide, aligning with the biblical theme of God using unlikely individuals to fulfill His purposes, as seen in the stories of Gideon (Judges 6-7) and David (1 Samuel 16-17).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/four_men_with_leprosy.htm">Four Men with Leprosy</a></b><br>These men were outcasts due to their disease, living outside the city gates as per the Levitical laws.

Four lepers, excluded from the city, and on the point of perishing of hunger, felt that they could be no worse off, and might better their condition, if they deserted to the Syrians. They therefore drew off from the city at nightfall, and made for the Syrian camp. On arriving, they found it deserted. The entire host, seized with a sudden panic, had fled, about the time that they began their journey. The lepers' first thought was to enrich themselves by plunder, but after a while it occurred to them that, unless they hastened to carry the good news to Samaria, inquiry would be made, their proceedings would be found out, and they would be severely punished. So they returned to the capital, and reported what they had discovered. Jehoram, on receiving the news, feared that the Syrians had prepared a trap for him, and declined to move. He consented, however, to send out scouts to reconnoiter. The scouts found evident proof that the entire army had actually fled and was gone, whereupon there was a general raid upon the camp and its stores, which were so abundant that Elisha's prophecy was fulfilled ere the day ended. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate</span>; or, at the <span class="accented">entrance to the gate-house</span>.

They were thrust out when the disease developed itself, and forced to dwell without the walls. No doubt their friends within the city ordinarily supplied them with food; and hence they congregated about the city gates. <span class="cmt_word">And they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die?</span> In the extreme scarcity, it is probable that no food was brought to them, the inmates of the city having barely enough wherewith to sustain themselves (<a href="/2_kings/6-25.htm">2 Kings 6:25</a>).
