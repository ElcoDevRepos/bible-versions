Succoth-benoth is believed to be a deity associated with fertility or protection, though specific details are scarce. The name may mean "booths of daughters," suggesting a connection to temple prostitution, a practice common in some ancient Near Eastern religions. This reflects the syncretism that occurred when the Assyrians resettled conquered peoples, including the Israelites, leading to the introduction of foreign gods into Israel. This practice was in direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and highlights the spiritual decline that led to Israel's downfall.<p><b>The men of Cuth made Nergal</b><br>Cuth, or Cuthah, was another region in Mesopotamia, and its inhabitants brought with them the worship of Nergal, a god associated with war, death, and the underworld. Nergal was often depicted as a lion, symbolizing strength and ferocity. The introduction of Nergal into Israelite worship illustrates the blending of religious practices that diluted the worship of Yahweh. This syncretism is condemned throughout the Old Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/12-30.htm">Deuteronomy 12:30-31</a>, which warn against adopting the religious practices of other nations.<p><b>The men of Hamath made Ashima</b><br>Hamath was a city-state located in modern-day Syria. Ashima is less well-documented, but it is thought to be a deity possibly linked to sheep or goats, given the name's similarity to the Hebrew word for "guilt" or "sin" (asham). The worship of Ashima by the people of Hamath further exemplifies the religious pluralism that characterized the Northern Kingdom of Israel after the Assyrian conquest. This pluralism was a direct challenge to the exclusive worship of Yahweh, as emphasized in passages like <a href="/2_kings/17-35.htm">2 Kings 17:35-39</a>, where God reminds Israel of their covenant obligations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>A significant city in ancient Mesopotamia, known for its influence and power.

These newcomers &#8220;built for themselves shrines on every high hill and under every spreading tree,&#8221; continuing the pattern Israel had followed.<p>&#8226; By fashioning Succoth-benoth, the Babylonians introduced a brand-new false god into the heartland that God had set apart for His name alone (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-7</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>, the first commandment, still spoke with full authority: &#8220;You shall have no other gods before Me&#8221;.

The explanation of the word as "tents" or "huts of daughters," which Satisfied Selden, Calmer, Gesenius, Winer, Keil, and others, is rendered absolutely impossible by the context, which requires that the word, whatever its meaning, should be the name of a deity. The Septuagint interpreters, while as much puzzled as others by the word itself, at least saw this, and rendered the expression by <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c7;&#x1f7c;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x392;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b8;</span>, showing that they regarded it as the name of a goddess. The Babylonian goddess who corresponds most nearly to the word, and is most likely to be intended, would seem to be Zirat-banit, the wife of Merodach ('Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology,' vol. 4. pp. 136-147). <span class="accented">Zirat-banit</span> means "the creating lady;" but the Hebrew interpreter seems to have mistaken the first element, which he confounded with <span class="accented">Zarat</span>, the Baby-Ionian for "tents," and so translated by "Succoth." The goddess Zirat-banit was certainly one of the principal deities of Babylon, and would be more likely to be selected than any ether goddess. Probably she was worshipped in combination with her husband, Merodach. <span class="cmt_word">And the men of Cuth</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Cuthah" - <span class="cmt_word">made Nergal.</span> Nergal was the special deity of Cutha. He was the Babylonian war-god, and had a high position in the Assyrian pantheon also. His name appears as an element in the "Ner-gal-sharezer" of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3, 13</a>) and the Neriglissar of Ptolemy and Berosus. <span class="cmt_word">And the men of Hamath made Ashima.</span> The-nius conjectures that "Ashima" represents the Phoenician Eshmoun,one of the Cabiri, or eight "Great Ones." But the etymological resemblance of the two words is not close, and it is not at all certain that the Hamathites at any time acknowledged the Phoenician deities. The Hamathite inscriptions are in the character now known as "Hittite;" and there is reason to believe that the people were non-Semitic. This identification, therefore, must be regarded as very doubtful. Perhaps "Ashima" represents Simi, the daughter of Hadad (see Melito, 'Apologia'). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/17-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1504;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;an&#183;&#353;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
