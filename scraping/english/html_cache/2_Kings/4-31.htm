This action reflects the urgency and seriousness of the situation. In biblical times, servants often acted on behalf of their masters, and Gehazi's role here is to prepare the way for Elisha's miracle. This mirrors the role of John the Baptist, who went ahead to prepare the way for Jesus.<p><b>and laid the staff on the boy&#8217;s face</b><br>The staff symbolizes the authority and power of the prophet, akin to Moses' staff in Exodus. In ancient Near Eastern culture, objects associated with holy men were believed to carry spiritual power. The act of laying the staff on the boy's face is an attempt to transfer divine power for healing, similar to how Jesus used physical touch in His healings.<p><b>but there was no sound or response</b><br>The lack of response indicates that the miracle did not occur through Gehazi's actions. This highlights the necessity of Elisha's personal involvement and the direct intervention of God. It underscores the theme that true power and life come from God alone, not through mere ritual or objects.<p><b>So he went back to meet Elisha</b><br>Gehazi's return to Elisha signifies the failure of the initial attempt and the need for further divine intervention. This reflects the biblical principle that human efforts are insufficient without God's presence and power, as seen in the story of the disciples unable to cast out a demon without Jesus' help (<a href="/mark/9-28.htm">Mark 9:28-29</a>).<p><b>and told him, &#8220;The boy has not awakened.&#8221;</b><br>The term "awakened" is significant, as it implies that death is like sleep, a concept echoed in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/john/11-11.htm">John 11:11-14</a>). This foreshadows the resurrection power of Christ, who is the ultimate source of life.

Gehazi&#8217;s statement sets the stage for Elisha&#8217;s personal intervention and God&#8217;s ultimate display of resurrection power, foreshadowing Christ&#8217;s own triumph over death (<a href="/luke/7-14.htm">Luke 7:14-16</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/4-31.htm">2 Kings 4:31</a> portrays earnest, faith-filled action that nevertheless meets with initial silence.

The verse prepares us to witness God&#8217;s greater glory when Elisha arrives, teaching dependence, obedience, and ultimate trust in the Lord who alone can awaken the dead.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">There was neither voice, nor hearing.</span>--<a href="/1_kings/18-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.">1Kings 18:29</a>; see margin, and <a href="/isaiah/21-7.htm" title="And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he listened diligently with much heed:">Isaiah 21:7</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Wherefore he went again.</span>--<span class= "ital">And he came back to meet him</span> (Elisha).<p><span class= "bld">The child is not awaked.</span>--<span class= "ital">The</span> lad woke not.<p>The Rabbis explain Gehazi's failure by assuming that he had disobeyed his master's injunction by loitering on the way. This is contradicted by the narrative itself. He had acted with all despatch. Others blame him on other grounds, which, in the absolute silence of the text, cannot be substantiated. The prophet says no word of censure when he receives the announcement of the failure. Bahr thinks that Elisha himself was at fault in supposing he could transfer the spirit and power of a prophet to his servant; and acted in over-haste without a Divine incentive. (Comp. <a href="/2_samuel/7-3.htm" title="And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in your heart; for the LORD is with you.">2Samuel 7:3</a> seq.)<p>The true explanation is suggested in the Note on <a href="/2_kings/4-29.htm" title="Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go your way: if you meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute you, answer him not again: and lay my staff on the face of the child.">2Kings 4:29</a>. (Bahr is wrong in taking <span class= "ital">the staff</span> to be other than a <span class= "ital">walking</span> staff. A different word would be used for <span class= "ital">rod or sceptre</span>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing.</span> Gehazi did as he had Been told, executed his mission faithfully; but there was no apparent result. The child was not reused by the staff being placed across his face. All remained still and silent as before. Although on some occasions it has pleased God to allow miracles to be wrought by the instrumentality of lifeless objects, as when Elisha's hones resuscitated a dead man (<a href="/2_kings/13-21.htm">2 Kings 13:21</a>), and when virtue went out from the hem of our Lord's garment (<a href="/mark/5-25.htm">Mark 5:25-34</a>), and still more remarkably, when "handkerchiefs or aprons from the body of Paul were brought unto the sick, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits were case out of them" (<a href="/acts/19-12.htm">Acts 19:12</a>); yet the instances are, comparatively speaking, rare, and form exceptions to what may be called the usual Divine economy of miracles. Miracles are, as a general rule, attached in Scripture to intense unwavering faith - faith, sometimes, in those that are the objects of them, almost always in those that are the workers of them. The present case was not to be an exception to the general rule, the circumstances not calling for an exception. The power of faith was to be shown forth once more in Elisha, as not long previously in Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17-19.htm">1 Kings 17:19-23</a>); and Israel was to be taught, by a second marvelous example, how much the effectual fervent prayer of a faithful and righteous man avails with the Most High. The lesson would have been lest had the staff been allowed to effect the resuscitation. <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore he</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> Gehazi - <span class="cmt_word">went again to meet him</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> Elisha - <span class="cmt_word">and told him, saying, The child is not waked.</span> It is clear from this, that Gehazi had expected an awakening; but there is nothing to show what the prophet himself had expected. We are certainly not entitled to conclude, with Peter Martyr,' that "Elisha did wrong in attempting to 'delegate his power of working miracles to another;" or even, with Starke, that "Elisha gave the command to Gehazi from over haste, without having any Divine incentive to it." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/4-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Gehazi</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1461;&#1495;&#1458;&#1494;&#1460;&#1438;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7713;&#234;&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;z&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
