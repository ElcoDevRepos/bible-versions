The prophet Isaiah delivers a message from God, providing assurance and a sign to Hezekiah. Signs in the Old Testament often served as divine confirmation of God's promises or actions (e.g., <a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>, <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>). This sign is meant to reassure Hezekiah of God's deliverance and faithfulness.<p><b>This year you will eat what grows on its own:</b><br>The phrase refers to the practice of eating volunteer crops, which are plants that grow without being intentionally sown. This would occur due to the disruption of normal agricultural activities caused by the Assyrian invasion. The Israelites were familiar with the concept of sabbatical years (<a href="/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25:1-7</a>), during which the land was left to rest, and they relied on what grew naturally. This situation mirrors that practice, emphasizing God's provision even in times of crisis.<p><b>And in the second year what springs from the same:</b><br>The continuation of eating from volunteer crops in the second year suggests ongoing disruption, likely due to the aftermath of the Assyrian siege. This period of reliance on naturally occurring produce underscores a time of recovery and transition. It also highlights God's sustaining power, as He provides for His people even when normal agricultural cycles are interrupted.<p><b>But in the third year you will sow and reap;</b><br>The promise of returning to normal agricultural activities in the third year signifies restoration and stability. Sowing and reaping are fundamental to agrarian life and symbolize a return to peace and prosperity. This assurance would have been particularly comforting to Hezekiah and the people of Judah, as it indicated the end of Assyrian oppression and a return to self-sufficiency.<p><b>You will plant vineyards and eat their fruit:</b><br>Planting vineyards and enjoying their produce is a sign of long-term security and blessing. Vineyards require several years to mature, so this promise indicates a future of sustained peace and prosperity. In biblical symbolism, vineyards often represent abundance and blessing (e.g., <a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>, <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>).

The prophet turns from Sennacherib to Hezekiah, and proceeds to give him a sign, and otherwise speak to him encouragingly. Signs were at the time freely offered and given by God both to the faithful and the unfaithful (see <a href="/2_kings/20-4.htm">2 Kings 20:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-11.htm">Isaiah 7:11, 14</a>). They generally consisted in the prediction of some near event, whose occurrence was to serve as a pledge, or evidence, of the probable fulfillment of another prediction of an event more distant. Such signs are not necessarily miraculous. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves.</span> The Assyrian invasion, coming early in the spring, as was usual, had prevented the Israelites from sowing their lands. But they would soon be gone, and then the Israelites could gather in such self-sown corn as they might find in the corn-lands. The next year, probably a sabbatical year, they were authorized to do the same, notwithstanding the general prohibition (<a href="/leviticus/25-5.htm">Leviticus 25:5</a>); the third year they would return to their normal condition.
