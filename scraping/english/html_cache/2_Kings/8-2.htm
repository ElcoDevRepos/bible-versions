Her obedience to Elisha's instruction demonstrates her faith and trust in God's prophetic word. This act of obedience is reminiscent of other biblical figures who followed divine instructions, such as Noah building the ark (<a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>) and Abraham leaving his homeland (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-4</a>). The phrase underscores the importance of heeding God's guidance through His prophets, a recurring theme in the Old Testament.<p><b>And she and her household lived as foreigners for seven years</b><br>Living as foreigners implies a significant disruption to their lives, as they had to leave their homeland and adapt to a new culture and environment. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or divine perfection in the Bible, suggesting that this period was divinely appointed. This experience of living in a foreign land can be compared to the Israelites' sojourn in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/1.htm">Exodus 1:1-14</a>) and later in Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/29-4.htm">Jeremiah 29:4-7</a>), where they were called to maintain their faith and identity amidst foreign influences.<p><b>in the land of the Philistines.</b><br>The Philistines were a significant group in the ancient Near East, often in conflict with Israel. Their territory was located along the coastal plain of what is now modern-day Israel and Gaza. The choice of the Philistine land as a place of refuge is notable, as it was traditionally an enemy territory. This situation highlights God's sovereignty in providing for His people even in unexpected places. It also foreshadows the New Testament theme of God's people being in the world but not of it (<a href="/john/17-14.htm">John 17:14-16</a>), living as sojourners and exiles (<a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>This refers to the Shunammite woman who had previously shown hospitality to Elisha and whose son was miraculously restored to life by him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man_of_god.htm">The Man of God</a></b><br>Elisha, the prophet, who had a significant role in the lives of the people of Israel, providing guidance and performing miracles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_the_philistines.htm">The Land of the Philistines</a></b><br>A region outside of Israel, often at odds with the Israelites, where the woman and her household sought refuge during the famine.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_famine.htm">The Famine</a></b><br>A divinely ordained period of scarcity that affected the land, prompting the woman to leave her home.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_household.htm">The Household</a></b><br>The family and servants of the Shunammite woman who accompanied her to the land of the Philistines.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_word.htm">Obedience to God&#8217;s Word</a></b><br>The Shunammite woman's immediate compliance with Elisha's instruction exemplifies the importance of trusting and obeying God's guidance, even when it requires significant life changes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_in_times_of_need.htm">God&#8217;s Provision in Times of Need</a></b><br>Just as God provided for the Shunammite woman during the famine, He remains faithful to provide for His people in times of need, often in unexpected ways.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The woman's faith is demonstrated through her actions.
