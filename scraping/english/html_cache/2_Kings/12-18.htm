The sacred objects mentioned were likely items dedicated to the LORD, used in temple worship, and held significant religious and cultural value. Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah were Joash's predecessors, each contributing to the temple's wealth and religious artifacts. This act of taking sacred objects indicates a moment of desperation or political necessity, as these items were meant to honor God and not to be used for political bargaining.<p><b>along with his own consecrated items</b><br>Joash's own consecrated items would have been those he dedicated during his reign, possibly as part of his efforts to restore the temple (as seen earlier in his reign). This inclusion shows the extent of the sacrifice Joash was willing to make to protect Jerusalem, highlighting the severity of the threat posed by Hazael.<p><b>and all the gold found in the treasuries of the house of the LORD and the royal palace,</b><br>The treasuries of the house of the LORD and the royal palace were repositories of wealth, including gold, which was a symbol of divine blessing and royal power. The use of these treasures indicates a significant depletion of resources, reflecting the dire circumstances faced by Judah. This act can be seen as a failure to trust in divine protection, contrasting with other biblical instances where faith led to deliverance.<p><b>and he sent them to Hazael king of Aram.</b><br>Hazael was the king of Aram (Syria), a powerful adversary of Israel and Judah during this period. By sending these treasures, Joash was essentially paying tribute to Hazael to avert an attack on Jerusalem. This action reflects the political realities of the time, where smaller kingdoms often paid tribute to more powerful neighbors to ensure peace. It also underscores the ongoing conflict between Aram and the Israelite kingdoms, a theme prevalent in the narratives of the Kings.<p><b>So Hazael withdrew from Jerusalem.</b><br>Hazael's withdrawal signifies the success of Joash's strategy, albeit at a great cost. This outcome highlights the temporary nature of political solutions that rely on material wealth rather than spiritual faithfulness. It also serves as a reminder of the complex interplay between divine providence and human agency in the biblical narrative. The withdrawal can be seen as a moment of reprieve for Judah, though it came at the expense of the temple's sanctity and resources.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (King of Judah)</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned during a time of both religious reform and political challenge.

The verse traces a downward slide from inherited faithfulness to expedient compromise: sacred objects, personal vows, temple gold, and palace wealth are all surrendered to an enemy king. Though Hazael departs, the cost is spiritual impoverishment and future judgment. The passage warns that relying on material resources rather than the LORD empties worship of its glory and exposes a nation&#8212;and a believer&#8212;to greater loss.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">The hallowed things that . . . Jehoram, and Ahaziah . . . had dedicated</span>--Although these kings had sought to naturalise the Baal-worship, they had not ventured to abolish that of Jehovah. On the contrary, as appears from this passage, they even tried to conciliate the powerful priesthood and numerous adherents of the national religion, by dedicating gifts to the sanctuary. The fact that there was so much treasure disposable is not to be wondered at, even after the narrative of the way in which funds were raised for repairing the Temple; because the treasure in question, especially that of the Temple, appears to have been regarded as a reserve, only to be touched in case of grave national emergency like the present.<p><span class= "bld">And he went away from Jerusalem</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, withdrew his forces. Thenius asserts that the present expedition of Hazael is distinct from that recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/24-23.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them to the king of Damascus.">2Chronicles 24:23</a>, <span class= "ital">seq</span>., which he admits to be historical. But it is not said here that Hazael went in person against Jerusalem. (Comp, <a href="/2_kings/12-17.htm" title="Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.">2Kings 12:17</a>, "set his face to go up," <span class= "ital">i.e., prepared</span> to march thither.) The serious defeat of the army of Jehoash, related in Chronicles, accounts very satisfactorily for the sacrifice of his treasures here specified'; while the withdrawal of the Syrians after their victory, as told in Chronicles, is explained by the bribe which Jehoash is here said to have paid them. The two narratives thus supplement each other.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoash King of Judah took all the hallowed things.</span> The writer of Chronicles tells us that, first of all, there was a battle. "The army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the Lord delivered a very great host into their hand" (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-24.htm">2 Chronicles 24:24</a>). The loss was especially heavy among the nobles, who officered the Jewish army. Much plunder was taken by the visitors (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23</a>). Then, probably, the siege of the city was commenced, and Joash, like Rehoboam and Asa before him (<a href="/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>; <a href="/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>), and Hezekiah subsequently (<a href="/2_kings/18-15.htm">2 Kings 18:15, 16</a>), had recourse to the temple treasures, and with them bought off the invader. It is noticeable that Athaliah had not deprived the temple of them previously. <span class="cmt_word">That Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated.</span> Though Jehoram and Ahaziah apostatized so far as to maintain the Baal-worship in Jerusalem, and even to force attendance on it (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-11.htm">2 Chronicles 21:11</a>), yet they did not relinquish altogether the worship of Jehovah. That Jehoram called his son, Ahaziah, "possession of Jehovah," and Ahaziah one of his sons, Joash, "whom Jehovah supports," is indicative of this syncretism, which was common in ancient times, but against which pure Judaism made the strongest possible protest. <span class="cmt_word">And his own hallowed things</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the gifts which he had himself made to the temple - <span class="cmt_word">and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the Lord.</span> This was probably not much; but some "vessels of gold" had been made (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-14.htm">2 Chronicles 24:14</a>) out of the residue of the money subscribed for the repairs. <span class="cmt_word">And in the king's house.</span> The royal palace had been plundered by the Arabs and Philistines combined in the reign of Jehoram (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16, 17</a>); but in the thirty years that had since elapsed there had been time for fresh accumulations. <span class="cmt_word">And sent it to Hazael King of Syria: and he went away from Jerusalem.</span> The personal presence of Hazael at the siege seems to be here implied, while <a href="/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23</a> rather implies his absence.
