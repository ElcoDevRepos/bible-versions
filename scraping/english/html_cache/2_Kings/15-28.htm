The "evil" refers to actions contrary to God's commandments, often involving idolatry and injustice. The phrase "in the sight of the LORD" emphasizes that God's judgment is based on His omniscient view, not human standards. This evaluation is consistent with the Deuteronomic history, which measures kings by their faithfulness to the covenant with Yahweh.<p><b>and did not turn away from the sins</b><br>The failure to "turn away" suggests a lack of repentance and reform. In the biblical narrative, repentance is a turning back to God, often accompanied by the removal of idols and a return to the worship of Yahweh alone. This phrase highlights the king's persistence in sinful practices, which is a recurring theme in the history of Israel's monarchy. The concept of repentance is central to the prophetic messages throughout the Old Testament, calling Israel to return to God.<p><b>that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit</b><br>Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, established a pattern of idolatry by setting up golden calves at Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>). This act was a direct violation of the first two commandments and led Israel into sin. The phrase underscores the enduring influence of Jeroboam's actions, which set a precedent for subsequent kings. This reference to Jeroboam's sin serves as a historical and theological marker, illustrating the long-term consequences of disobedience to God. The legacy of Jeroboam's sin is a cautionary tale about the impact of leadership and the importance of faithfulness to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pekahiah.htm">Pekahiah</a></b><br>The king of Israel during this time, who continued in the sinful practices of his predecessors.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam_son_of_nebat.htm">Jeroboam son of Nebat</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, known for leading Israel into idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, distinct from Judah, often led astray by its kings into idolatry and sin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who consistently calls His people to righteousness and faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sins_of_jeroboam.htm">The Sins of Jeroboam</a></b><br>Refers to the idolatrous practices initiated by Jeroboam, including the worship of golden calves.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_leadership.htm">The Consequences of Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders have a profound impact on the spiritual direction of their people.

Scripture&#8217;s yardstick for every ruler is the LORD&#8217;s own character; here God declares Pekah&#8217;s reign morally bankrupt.<p>&#8211; &#8220;In the sight of the LORD&#8221; reminds us that nothing is hidden from Him (<a href="/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13&#8211;15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/5-21.htm">Proverbs 5:21</a>).

That counterfeit worship became Israel&#8217;s national religion.<p>&#8211; Pekah &#8220;did not turn away.&#8221; No reforms, no repentance&#8212;just the same pragmatic idolatry that had snared every northern king before him (<a href="/1_kings/13-33.htm">1 Kings 13:33&#8211;34</a>; 16:19).<p>&#8211; The pattern shows how sin entrenches itself when leaders refuse to break with the past. Hosea, prophesying during these years, pleads, &#8220;Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/14-1.htm">Hosea 14:1</a>), yet the king stayed the course.<p>&#8211; Persistence in Jeroboam&#8217;s sin finally led to Israel&#8217;s exile (<a href="/2_kings/17-21.htm">2 Kings 17:21&#8211;23</a>), proving God&#8217;s warnings true (<a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/15-28.htm">2 Kings 15:28</a> paints a sober snapshot of Pekah&#8217;s reign: God sees, judges, and records that he stayed on the idolatrous path blazed by Jeroboam. Refusal to repent kept Israel under the shadow of divine judgment and paved the way for national collapse.
