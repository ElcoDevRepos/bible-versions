He set up golden calves in Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>) to prevent the Israelites from going to Jerusalem to worship, which was a direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). This act of idolatry became a "sin" that led Israel astray. The phrase indicates that the Israelites continued in these practices, showing a deep-seated rebellion against God's commandments. This persistence in sin highlights the spiritual decline and moral decay that characterized the northern kingdom, ultimately leading to its downfall and exile by the Assyrians in 722 BC.<p><b>and did not turn away from them.</b><br>The refusal to turn away from sin reflects a hardened heart and a rejection of God's call to repentance. Throughout the prophetic books, God repeatedly called Israel to return to Him (e.g., <a href="/hosea/14.htm">Hosea 14:1</a>, <a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>), but they ignored these warnings. This phrase underscores the theme of stubbornness and spiritual blindness. The failure to repent is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often leading to judgment. In the New Testament, repentance is a central message of Jesus' ministry (<a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>) and is essential for salvation (<a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>). The Israelites' refusal to turn from their sins serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of persistent disobedience and the importance of heeding God's call to repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The northern kingdom of Israel, consisting of ten tribes, who were led into idolatry and sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam.htm">Jeroboam</a></b><br>The first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the division of the united monarchy.
