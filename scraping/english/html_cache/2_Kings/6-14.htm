The Arameans were a significant power in the region during this period, often in conflict with Israel. Horses and chariots were symbols of military strength and technological advancement in ancient warfare, indicating the seriousness of the threat. This action reflects the king's desperation to capture Elisha, who had been revealing his military plans to the king of Israel (<a href="/2_kings/6-8.htm">2 Kings 6:8-12</a>). The deployment of a "great army" underscores the perceived threat Elisha posed to Aram, emphasizing the spiritual warfare theme where physical might is pitted against divine insight.<p><b>They went there by night</b><br>The decision to move by night suggests a strategic attempt to surprise and capture Elisha without alerting the city. Nighttime operations were risky but could provide a tactical advantage, reflecting the urgency and secrecy of the mission. Biblically, night often symbolizes danger or evil (<a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>), contrasting with the light of God's presence and protection. This setting foreshadows the miraculous intervention that follows, where God's power is revealed in the face of human schemes.<p><b>and surrounded the city</b><br>The city in question is Dothan, a small town in the northern kingdom of Israel. Its mention connects to earlier biblical narratives, such as Joseph's story (<a href="/genesis/37-17.htm">Genesis 37:17</a>), where Dothan is also a place of divine intervention. The act of surrounding the city indicates a siege, a common military tactic to cut off supplies and force surrender. This situation sets the stage for God's deliverance, as seen in the subsequent verses where Elisha's servant's eyes are opened to see the heavenly army (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>). The surrounding of the city by enemy forces serves as a metaphor for the spiritual battles believers face, where God's unseen protection is always present.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_aram.htm">The King of Aram</a></b><br>The ruler who is determined to capture Elisha, the prophet of Israel, due to Elisha's ability to reveal his military plans to the king of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>The prophet of God who is the target of the king of Aram's military action.
