Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, set up golden calves to prevent the Israelites from worshiping in Jerusalem (<a href="/1_kings/12-26.htm">1 Kings 12:26-30</a>). This act was a direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>) and led Israel into sin.

Bethel, located near the southern border of the northern kingdom, and Dan, in the far north, made worship accessible to all Israelites, but it was a counterfeit worship. Archaeological findings at Dan have uncovered a high place that aligns with biblical descriptions, confirming the historical accuracy of these events. The golden calves symbolized a syncretism that mixed Yahweh worship with pagan practices, a recurring issue in Israel's history (<a href="/exodus/32-4.htm">Exodus 32:4-6</a>).

With whatever intent the worship had been set up by its author, the curse of God had been pronounced against it by the chief prophet of the time (<a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>), and his word had been attired as from heaven by two miracles (<a href="/1_kings/13-4.htm">1 Kings 13:4, 5</a>). Jehu ought to have known that the calf-worship, if not as hateful to God as the Baal-worship, at any rate was hateful, was a standing act of rebellion against Jehovah, and laid the nation under his displeasure. But, while his own interests were entirely detached from the one, they were, or at least would seem to him to be, bound up with the other. The calf-worship was thought to be essential to the matureance of the divided kingdom. Abolish it, and all Israel would "return to the house of David" (<a href="/1_kings/12-26.htm">1 Kings 12:26-30</a>). Jehu was not prepared to risk this result. His "zeal for Jehovah" did not reach so far. Thus his "reformation of religion" was but a half-reformation, a partial turning to Jehovah, which brought no permanent blessing upon the nation.
