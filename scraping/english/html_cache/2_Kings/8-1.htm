The woman referred to here is the Shunammite woman, who showed hospitality to Elisha and was blessed with a son despite her initial barrenness (<a href="/2_kings/4-8.htm">2 Kings 4:8-17</a>). Elisha later restored her son to life after he died suddenly (<a href="/2_kings/4-32.htm">2 Kings 4:32-37</a>). This miracle prefigures the resurrection power of Jesus Christ, who also raised individuals from the dead, such as Lazarus (<a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43-44</a>). The mention of the woman's son being restored to life highlights Elisha's role as a prophet who brings life and hope, similar to the ministry of Jesus.<p><b>&#8220;Arise, you and your household; go and live as a foreigner wherever you can.</b><br>Elisha instructs the woman to leave her homeland and live as a foreigner, which implies a significant disruption to her life. This command reflects the biblical theme of obedience to God's word, even when it requires sacrifice or hardship. Living as a foreigner would have been challenging, as it involved leaving behind familiar surroundings and possibly facing hostility or discrimination in a new land. This situation is reminiscent of Abraham's call to leave his country and go to a land God would show him (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>). It also foreshadows the Christian call to live as "foreigners and exiles" in the world (<a href="/1_peter/2-11.htm">1 Peter 2:11</a>), emphasizing the transient nature of earthly life compared to eternal life with God.<p><b>For the LORD has decreed that a seven-year famine will come to the land.&#8221;</b><br>The seven-year famine is a divine judgment or test, similar to other famines in biblical history, such as the one during Joseph's time in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-27.htm">Genesis 41:27</a>). Famine often serves as a tool for God to bring about repentance or to fulfill His purposes. The number seven is significant in the Bible, often symbolizing completeness or perfection, indicating that this famine is part of God's perfect plan. The decree of the LORD underscores His sovereignty over nature and history, reminding believers of God's ultimate control over all circumstances. This event also points to the importance of heeding prophetic warnings and trusting in God's provision, as seen in the provision for Elijah during a previous famine (<a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17:1-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God who succeeded Elijah.
