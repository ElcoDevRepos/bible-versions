Uzziah, also known as Azariah, was a king of Judah who reigned for 52 years, a period marked by prosperity and military success (<a href="/2_chronicles/26.htm">2 Chronicles 26:1-15</a>). His reign is significant for its length and stability, contrasting with the turmoil in the northern kingdom of Israel. Uzziah's reign is also noted for his pride leading to his downfall, as he unlawfully entered the temple to burn incense and was struck with leprosy (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-21</a>). This context highlights the contrast between the relative stability in Judah and the instability in Israel.<p><b>Shallum son of Jabesh became king</b><br>Shallum's brief reign is a part of the chaotic period in Israel's history, characterized by rapid changes in leadership and political instability. Shallum assassinated King Zechariah, the last of Jehu's dynasty, fulfilling the prophecy given to Jehu that his descendants would sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation (<a href="/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30</a>). This act of usurpation reflects the violent and tumultuous nature of Israel's monarchy during this time. The name "Shallum" means "retribution" or "recompense," which may be seen as indicative of his short-lived rule and the divine judgment on the house of Jehu.<p><b>and he reigned in Samaria</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the northern kingdom of Israel, established by King Omri (<a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>). It served as the political and cultural center of Israel. The city was strategically located on a hill, making it defensible and significant in the region. Samaria's history is marked by idolatry and apostasy, as it became a center for the worship of Baal and other foreign gods, leading to its eventual downfall and conquest by the Assyrians in 722 BC (<a href="/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5-6</a>). The mention of Samaria underscores the spiritual decline of Israel during this period.<p><b>one full month</b><br>Shallum's reign lasted only one month, indicating the extreme instability and rapid turnover of leadership in Israel at the time. This brief tenure is a testament to the political chaos and the lack of divine favor, as seen in the frequent assassinations and coups. The brevity of his reign is reminiscent of other short-lived rulers in Israel's history, highlighting the consequences of departing from God's covenant. This period of instability contrasts with the more stable reigns in Judah, where the Davidic line continued despite challenges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azariah.htm">Azariah (Uzziah)</a></b><br>King of Judah during whose reign Shallum became king of Israel.

While Judah enjoyed a long, mostly stable reign under Uzziah (cf. 2 Chron 26:1&#8211;5), Israel was cycling through kings rapidly (cf. <a href="/2_kings/15-8.htm">2 Kings 15:8&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word highlights the contrast: one king rules Judah for more than half a century (<a href="/2_kings/15-2.htm">2 Kings 15:2</a>), while Israel churns through several rulers in mere months or years. The instability in Israel fulfills earlier warnings that rejecting the Lord brings national upheaval (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36&#8211;37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Shallum son of Jabesh became king</b><p>&#8226; Shallum is introduced without any prior royal lineage, underscoring Israel&#8217;s break with God-ordained succession (cf. <a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_kings/15-10.htm">2 Kings 15:10</a> records that Shallum seized the throne by assassinating Zechariah, ending Jehu&#8217;s four-generation dynasty&#8212;just as the Lord had prophesied it would last only to the fourth generation (<a href="/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty stands out: even violent coups cannot thwart His word. Every change of ruler still unfolds inside His predetermined plan (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he reigned in Samaria one full month</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;He reigned in Samaria one full month&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/15-13.htm">2 Kings 15:13</a>) reads almost like a footnote, yet it signals profound judgment.<p>&#8226; The brevity of Shallum&#8217;s rule (thirty days) exposes the emptiness of rebellion. His fleeting power echoes the Psalmist&#8217;s verdict: &#8220;Like grass they wither quickly&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/37-2.htm">Psalm 37:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Menahem promptly assassinated Shallum (<a href="/2_kings/15-14.htm">2 Kings 15:14</a>). Israel&#8217;s rapid-fire violence illustrates <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a> in political form: &#8220;the wages of sin is death.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/15-13.htm">2 Kings 15:13</a> captures Israel&#8217;s turmoil in one sentence. While Judah enjoys the longevity of Uzziah&#8217;s reign, Israel spirals through leaders who rise by bloodshed and fall by the same. Shallum&#8217;s one-month reign fulfills God&#8217;s earlier prophecy to Jehu, spotlighting the precision of Scripture and the Lord&#8217;s control over history. The verse challenges us to trust God&#8217;s word, recognizing that every kingdom&#8212;ancient or modern&#8212;stands or falls under His sovereign hand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">A full month.</span>--Literally, as margin.
