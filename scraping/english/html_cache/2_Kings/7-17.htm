The officer was likely a high-ranking official or advisor to the king, possibly a captain or a chief officer. The phrase "on whose arm he leaned" suggests a close relationship, indicating reliance and confidence in this officer's counsel and abilities. This reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient Near Eastern courts, where kings often depended on trusted officials for governance and military matters.<p><b>to be in charge of the gate</b><br>The gate of a city was a critical point of defense and commerce, often serving as a place for legal matters and public announcements. Being in charge of the gate was a significant responsibility, as it involved controlling who entered and exited the city, maintaining security, and managing trade. This role underscores the officer's importance and the trust placed in him by the king.<p><b>but the people trampled him in the gateway</b><br>This phrase highlights the chaos and desperation of the people during the famine in Samaria. The trampling indicates a frenzied rush, likely due to the sudden availability of food following the miraculous end of the siege by the Arameans. The officer's death by trampling signifies the uncontrollable nature of the crowd, driven by hunger and relief. It also serves as a narrative device to demonstrate the fulfillment of prophecy and the consequences of disbelief.<p><b>and he died, just as the man of God had foretold</b><br>The "man of God" refers to the prophet Elisha, who had previously prophesied the officer's death as a consequence of his disbelief in God's provision (<a href="/2_kings/7-2.htm">2 Kings 7:2</a>). This fulfillment of prophecy underscores the authority and reliability of God's word through His prophets. It serves as a reminder of the importance of faith and the dangers of skepticism towards divine promises.<p><b>when the king had come to him</b><br>This phrase indicates that the prophecy was given in a direct encounter between the king and the prophet Elisha. It suggests that the king sought Elisha's counsel during the crisis, reflecting the role of prophets as intermediaries between God and the people. The king's approach to Elisha highlights the recognition of prophetic authority, even amidst political and social turmoil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_israel.htm">The King of Israel</a></b><br>Likely King Jehoram, son of Ahab, who was ruling during the time of the prophet Elisha.

The verse underscores that God&#8217;s word is unfailingly accurate, rewards faith, and executes judgment on unbelief.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(</span>17<span class= "ital">)</span> <span class= "bld">And the king appointed.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">Now the king had appointed.</span><p><span class= "bld">The lord.</span>--<span class= "ital">The adjutant</span> (<a href="/2_kings/7-2.htm" title="Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?

This probably happened, as Thenius suggests, when the crowd was <span class= "ital">returning</span> from the Syrian camp, wild with excess of food and drink, after their long abstinence. Thus he "saw the plenty with his eyes, but did not eat thereof" (<a href="/2_kings/7-2.htm" title="Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?

If retained in the text, we must render, "And he died, according to that which the man of God spake, <span class= "ital">which he spake</span> when the king," &c. But perhaps the reading of one Hebrew MS. is correct: "And he died, <span class= "ital">according to the word</span> of the man of God, which he spake," &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate.</span> Anticipating disorder, unless special care were taken, through the probable eagerness of the people to purchase the corn which was offered to them at so moderate a rate, Jehoram appointed the officer on whose arm he had leant when he visited the house of Elisha (see ver. 2), to have the charge of the gate, and preside over the sale. Probably there was no thought of the post being one of danger. <span class="cmt_word">And the people trod upon him in the gate, and he died.</span> It has been questioned whether the death was accidental (Bahr), and suggested that the eager and famished people resisted his authority, and violently bore down his attempts to control them. But there is nothing in the text that is incompatible with an accidental death. Such deaths ate not uncommon in dense crowds of anxious and excited people. <span class="cmt_word">As the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him.</span> The varieties of reading here do not affect the general sense. The writer's intention is to lay special stress on the fulfillment of Elisha's prophecy; and to emphasize the punishment that follows on a lack of faith. The concluding passage of the chapter is, as Bahr says, "a finger of warning to unbelievers." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/7-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
