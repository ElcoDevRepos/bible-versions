Lachish was a significant fortified city in Judah, second only to Jerusalem.

The departure of the king from Lachish indicates a strategic military movement, as Lachish was a key target in Assyria's campaign to subdue Judah.<p><b>he withdrew</b><br>The withdrawal of the Rabshakeh suggests a shift in military focus or a response to new intelligence.

Its mention here highlights the ongoing Assyrian campaign to conquer Judah's strongholds.

Sennacherib&#8217;s siege there appeared unstoppable.<p>&#8226; By leaving Lachish, Sennacherib signals that his campaign is encountering obstacles.

No further communication was held with him. He had outraged all propriety by his appeal to the "men upon the wall" (<a href="/2_kings/18-27.htm">2 Kings 18:27-35</a>); and it seems to have been thought most dignified to give him no answer at all.
