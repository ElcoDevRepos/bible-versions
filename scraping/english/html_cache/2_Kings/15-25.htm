This act of conspiracy aligns with the pattern of violent power transitions seen throughout the history of Israel's kings.<p><b>along with Argob, Arieh, and fifty men of Gilead.</b><br>Argob and Arieh are mentioned as co-conspirators, though little else is known about them.

This detail highlights the organized and premeditated nature of the coup.<p><b>And at the citadel of the king&#8217;s palace in Samaria,</b><br>The citadel in Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom, was a fortified area within the city, serving as the king's residence and a symbol of royal authority.
