Uriah the priest, mentioned here, was complicit in Ahaz's reforms, which included altering the temple worship to align with Assyrian customs. This reflects a period of spiritual decline in Judah, where the king's authority over religious practices overshadowed the priestly duty to uphold God's commandments.<p><b>Offer on the great altar the morning burnt offering, the evening grain offering</b><br>The "great altar" refers to the new altar Ahaz had constructed, modeled after one he saw in Damascus. The morning and evening offerings were part of the daily sacrifices commanded by God in <a href="/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>, symbolizing continual dedication and reliance on God. Ahaz's use of a foreign altar for these offerings indicates a departure from the prescribed worship, showing a blending of pagan and Hebrew practices.<p><b>and the king&#8217;s burnt offering and grain offering</b><br>These offerings were likely personal sacrifices made by the king, which were not part of the regular temple service. The inclusion of the king's offerings on the new altar suggests Ahaz's desire to integrate his personal religious practices with the national worship, further indicating his influence over religious matters in Judah.<p><b>as well as the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings of all the people of the land</b><br>This phrase shows that Ahaz's changes affected not only the royal offerings but also those of the entire nation. The burnt, grain, and drink offerings were integral to Israelite worship, representing atonement, dedication, and fellowship with God. By altering the place and manner of these offerings, Ahaz led the people away from the covenantal worship established by God.<p><b>Splatter on the altar all the blood of the burnt offerings and sacrifices</b><br>The splattering of blood was a significant part of the sacrificial system, symbolizing atonement and purification (<a href="/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). By commanding this act on the new altar, Ahaz was attempting to legitimize his changes by maintaining some elements of the traditional worship, despite the underlying disobedience to God's instructions.<p><b>But I will use the bronze altar to seek guidance</b><br>The bronze altar, originally built by Solomon, was the legitimate altar for sacrifices in the temple. Ahaz's decision to use it for seeking guidance, possibly through divination or other unauthorized means, further illustrates his departure from true worship. This act reflects a syncretism that compromised the distinctiveness of Israel's faith, contrasting with the biblical call to exclusive worship of Yahweh (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahaz.htm">King Ahaz</a></b><br>The king of Judah who is known for his unfaithfulness to God, including adopting pagan practices and altering the temple worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/u/uriah_the_priest.htm">Uriah the Priest</a></b><br>A priest who complied with King Ahaz's orders, demonstrating a lack of resistance to the king's unfaithful commands.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_great_altar.htm">The Great Altar</a></b><br>A new altar built by King Ahaz, modeled after one he saw in Damascus, which he prioritized over the original bronze altar.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bronze_altar.htm">The Bronze Altar</a></b><br>The original altar in the temple, which Ahaz relegated to a secondary role for his personal use in seeking guidance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where these events took place, under the rule of King Ahaz.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_worship.htm">Faithfulness in Worship</a></b><br>Ahaz's actions remind us of the importance of adhering to God's instructions for worship.
