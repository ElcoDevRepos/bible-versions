His young age suggests a lack of experience, which may have contributed to his inability to effectively govern or resist external pressures. This period is characterized by the decline of the Davidic dynasty, fulfilling earlier prophecies of judgment against Judah due to persistent idolatry and disobedience (<a href="/2_kings/21-10.htm">2 Kings 21:10-15</a>).<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem three months</b><br>Jehoiachin's brief reign highlights the instability of the kingdom during this era. The short duration of his rule underscores the rapid succession of events leading to the Babylonian exile. This period of three months is significant as it marks the transition from the independence of Judah to its subjugation under Babylonian control. The brevity of his reign is a fulfillment of the prophetic warnings given by Jeremiah and other prophets regarding the consequences of Judah's unfaithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24-30</a>).<p><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan</b><br>Nehushta's mention indicates the importance of maternal lineage in the royal records, which often provided legitimacy and continuity to the throne. Her name, meaning "bronze" or "serpent," may reflect cultural or familial significance. Elnathan, her father, is possibly the same Elnathan mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/26-22.htm">Jeremiah 26:22</a>, who was sent by King Jehoiakim to bring back the prophet Uriah from Egypt, suggesting a family with political influence.<p><b>she was from Jerusalem</b><br>Nehushta's origin from Jerusalem emphasizes the centrality of the city in the narrative of Judah's kings. Jerusalem, as the political and spiritual heart of the nation, is significant in biblical history as the site of the Temple and the Davidic throne. Her being from Jerusalem may also imply a connection to the city's elite or priestly class, further legitimizing Jehoiachin's claim to the throne. The city's eventual fall to Babylon is a pivotal moment in biblical history, symbolizing the end of an era and the beginning of the exile, which had profound theological implications for the Jewish people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiachin.htm">Jehoiachin</a></b><br>The young king of Judah who ascended the throne at eighteen and reigned for a brief period of three months.

The short reign of Jehoisshin is now described. It lasted but three months. For some reason which is unrecorded, Nebuchadnezzar, who had placed him on the throne, took offence at his conduct, and sent an army against him to effect his deposition. Jehoiachin offered scarcely any resistance. He "went out" of the city (ver. 12), with the queen-mother, the officers of the court, and the princes, and submitted himself to the will of the great king. But he gained nothing by his pusillanimity. The Babylonians entered Jerusalem, plundered the temple and the royal palace, made prisoners of the king, his mother, the princes and nobles, the armed garrison, and all the more skilled artisans, to the number altogether of ten thousand souls (Josephus says 10,832, 'Ant. Jud.,' 10:7. &sect; 1), and carried them captive to Babylon. Zedekiah, the king's uncle, was made monarch in his room. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign.</span> In <a href="/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a> he is said to have been only eight years old, but this is probably an accidental corruption, the <span class="accented">yod</span>, which is the Hebrew sign for ten, easily slipping out. As he had "wives" (ver. 15) and "seed" (<a href="/jeremiah/22-28.htm">Jeremiah 22:28</a>), he could not well be less than eighteen. <span class="cmt_word">And he reigned in Jerusalem three months.</span> "Three months and ten days," according to 2 Chronicles (<span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>) and Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' <span class="accented">l</span>.<span class="accented">s</span>.<span class="accented">c</span>.). <span class="cmt_word">And his mother's name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.</span> Elnathan was one of the chief of the Jerusalem princes under Jehoiakim (<a href="/jeremiah/26-22.htm">Jeremiah 26:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/36-12.htm">Jeremiah 36:12, 25</a>). His daughter, Nehushta - the Noste of Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:6. &sect; 3) - was probably the ruling spirit of the time during her son's short reign. We find mention of her in Jeremiah 26:26; 29:2; and in Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 10:6. &sect; 3, and Jeremiah 10:7. &sect; 1. Ewald suggests that she "energetically supported" her son in the policy whereby he offended Nebuchadnezzar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/24-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Jehoiachin</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;&#1464;&#1499;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#238;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3078.htm">Strong's 3078: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jehoiachin -- 'the LORD appoints', a king of Judah</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was eighteen</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1465;&#1504;&#1462;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#333;&#183;neh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8083.htm">Strong's 8083: </a> </span><span class="str2">A cardinal number, eight, eighth</span><br /><br /><span class="word">years old</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">when he became king,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;m&#257;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
