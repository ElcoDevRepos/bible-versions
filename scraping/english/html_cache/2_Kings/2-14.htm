In biblical times, a cloak was often a symbol of one's office or calling. Elijah's mantle falling to Elisha signifies the transfer of prophetic leadership. This act is reminiscent of Elijah's initial calling of Elisha when he threw his cloak over him (<a href="/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19</a>), indicating the passing of his prophetic role.<p><b>and struck the waters.</b><br>Striking the waters with the cloak is an act of faith and a demonstration of the power of God working through His prophets. This action mirrors Moses' parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>) and Joshua's crossing of the Jordan River (<a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14-17</a>), both of which were significant events in Israel's history that demonstrated God's miraculous intervention and guidance.<p><b>&#8220;Where now is the LORD, the God of Elijah?&#8221; he asked.</b><br>Elisha's question is both a cry for divine presence and an acknowledgment of the source of Elijah's power. It reflects a desire for confirmation that the same God who empowered Elijah will now empower him. This invocation of the "God of Elijah" emphasizes the continuity of God's work through His chosen servants and highlights the importance of divine presence in fulfilling one's calling.<p><b>And when he had struck the waters, they parted to the right and to the left,</b><br>The parting of the waters is a miraculous sign that confirms Elisha's succession as the prophet of Israel. It serves as a divine endorsement of Elisha's ministry, similar to how God confirmed Joshua's leadership after Moses by parting the Jordan River. This miracle also foreshadows the many signs and wonders that Elisha would perform, demonstrating God's power and presence with him.<p><b>and Elisha crossed over.</b><br>Elisha's crossing over the Jordan River marks the beginning of his prophetic ministry. It signifies a transition from being a disciple of Elijah to becoming the leading prophet in Israel. This crossing can be seen as a type of baptism, symbolizing a new beginning and the empowerment of the Holy Spirit for the tasks ahead. It also connects to the broader biblical theme of crossing over into new phases of God's redemptive plan, as seen in the Israelites' entrance into the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet and the successor of Elijah, who performed many miracles and was a significant figure in the history of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A major prophet in Israel who was taken up to heaven in a whirlwind, leaving his cloak behind for Elisha.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>A significant river in the biblical account, often symbolizing a place of transition and divine intervention.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cloak_of_elijah.htm">The Cloak of Elijah</a></b><br>A symbol of prophetic authority and the transfer of Elijah's prophetic spirit to Elisha.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_parting_of_the_waters.htm">The Parting of the Waters</a></b><br>A miraculous event demonstrating God's power and the continuation of Elijah's ministry through Elisha.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_continuation_of_god's_work.htm">The Continuation of God's Work</a></b><br>God's work does not end with one person; it continues through those He calls and equips.

Thenius objects that this use of <span class= "ital">'aph</span> is doubtful, and supports Houbigant's correction, <span class= "ital">'?pho</span>, an enclitic then--"Where, then, is Jehovah, the God of Elijah? and he smote," &c. Perhaps <span class= "ital">'eph?h</span> ("where") was the original reading: "Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah? Where?"--an emphatic repetition of the question. Or it may be that the words <span class= "ital">'aph h-' wayyakkeh</span> should be transposed: "and he smote--he also (like Elijah)," &c. The Vulgate has the curious renderings, "And with the cloak of Elias which had fallen from him, he smote the waters, and they were not divided; and he said, Where is the God of Elias now also? And he smote the waters, and they were divided," &c. Such also is the reading of the Complutensian LXX.; but the variation is simply an old attempt to account for the twofold "and he smote the waters."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him; and smote the waters</span> - imitated, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the action of Elijah (ver. 8), as Elijah had imitated the action of Moses at the passage of the Red Sea - <span class="cmt_word">and said, Where is the Lord God of Elijah?</span> The present Hebrew text reads, "Where is the Lord God of Elijah, <span class="accented">even he</span>?" the last two words being emphatic; but the emphasis scarcely appears to be needed. Hence the translators have very generally detached the two words from Elisha's question, and, attaching them to the succeeding clause, have rendered it, <span class="cmt_word">And when he also had smitten the waters</span>; but the position of the van conjunctive, after <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e3;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span> and before <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>, makes this division of the clauses impossible. It has therefore been proposed by some to read <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>, "now," for <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e3;&#x5be;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span>, "even he" (Houbigant, Thenius, Schultz, Botteher, Dathe), and to translate, "Where <span class="accented">now</span> is the Lord God of Elijah?" Is he still here, with me, or has he withdrawn himself from earth with his prophet, and left me alone to my own unaided strength? This gives a good meaning, but is perhaps too bold a change. The LXX. had evidently our present Hebrew text before them, and, as they could make nothing of it, transcribed it into Greek characters, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x397;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3c6;&#x1f7d;</span>; <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>they parted hither and thither: and Elisha wont over.</span> God showed, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, that he was still with Elisha by enabling him to repeat Elijah's last miracle, and thus gave him an assurance that he would be with him thenceforth An his prophetic ministry. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/2-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then he took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
