His role as a prophet is to convey God's instructions and perform miracles that demonstrate God's power and provision. The command "Go" signifies an imperative action, indicating urgency and faith in following divine instructions. Elisha's authority as a prophet is recognized, and his words are seen as carrying the weight of God's will.<p><b>"borrow empty jars from all your neighbors."</b><br>The act of borrowing jars from neighbors highlights the communal aspect of ancient Israelite society, where neighbors were often involved in each other's lives. This request requires humility and faith from the widow, as she must rely on her community for assistance. The empty jars symbolize potential and readiness to be filled, reflecting the widow's need and God's impending provision. This act of borrowing also foreshadows the miraculous multiplication, similar to the provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16) and the feeding of the 5,000 in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>).<p><b>"Do not gather just a few."</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the abundance of God's provision and the need for faith in His promises. The instruction to gather many jars suggests that the miracle will be as large as the widow's faith and preparation allow. It reflects the biblical principle that God often blesses according to the measure of faith and expectation (<a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>). This abundance is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in the overflowing cup in <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a> and the abundant life promised by Jesus in <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet in Israel, successor to Elijah, known for performing miracles and providing guidance to the people of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_widow.htm">The Widow</a></b><br>A woman whose husband, a member of the company of prophets, has died, leaving her in debt and at risk of losing her sons to slavery.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbors.htm">Neighbors</a></b><br>The people living around the widow, from whom she is instructed to borrow jars.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jars.htm">Jars</a></b><br>Empty vessels that the widow is instructed to collect, which will be used in the miracle of multiplying oil.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miracle_of_oil.htm">The Miracle of Oil</a></b><br>An event where God, through Elisha, miraculously provides for the widow by multiplying the oil she has, allowing her to pay her debts and live off the remainder.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The widow's obedience to Elisha's instructions demonstrates active faith.

The widow must move her feet before she sees God move His hand. Scripture regularly ties God&#8217;s provision to obedience in motion&#8212;Abram was told, &#8220;Go from your country&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>); Naaman was told, &#8220;Go, wash in the Jordan seven times&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/5-10.htm">2 Kings 5:10</a>); the disciples were told, &#8220;Go therefore and make disciples&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). Each instance highlights that faith is demonstrated, not just discussed. For the widow, going meant stepping out while still broke and bereaved, trusting the Lord who &#8220;directs the steps of the righteous&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/37-23.htm">Psalm 37:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>borrow empty jars</b><p>The instruction to borrow signals dependence on what she does not yet possess. The jars must be empty, ready to be filled&#8212;a picture echoed when Jesus told servants, &#8220;Fill the jars with water&#8221; before turning it to wine (<a href="/john/2-7.htm">John 2:7</a>). God delights in filling emptiness: &#8220;He satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/107-9.htm">Psalm 107:9</a>). By borrowing, she admits her need, yet she also positions herself for overflow, much like the trench-digging command that preceded a miraculous supply of water (<a href="/2_kings/3-16.htm">2 Kings 3:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from all your neighbors</b><p>Need drives her beyond private pride into communal humility. The body of believers is designed for mutual aid&#8212;&#8220;Carry one another&#8217;s burdens&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>). Israel&#8217;s exodus was financed by neighbors&#8217; gifts (<a href="/exodus/12-35.htm">Exodus 12:35-36</a>), and the early church &#8220;had everything in common&#8221; when needs arose (<a href="/acts/4-34.htm">Acts 4:34-35</a>). Gathering jars from every neighbor invites them to witness the forthcoming miracle, turning a personal crisis into a community testimony.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not gather just a few</b><p>The scope of her faith will set the ceiling on her blessing. Elisha urges her to think big because God &#8220;is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all we ask or imagine&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>). Similar language appears in <a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>: &#8220;Test Me&#8230; and see if I will not open the floodgates of heaven and pour out for you a blessing without measure.&#8221; Had she limited her collection, the oil would have stopped sooner; faith plans for more than enough, not barely enough.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/4-3.htm">2 Kings 4:3</a> invites us to act promptly, come empty, engage community, and expect abundance.
