In the historical context, prophets often acted as intermediaries between God and His people, providing guidance and assistance. Elisha's willingness to help mirrors the character of God, who is attentive to the needs of His people. This phrase also highlights the role of prophets in Israel as both spiritual and practical leaders, addressing the immediate needs of individuals while pointing them to divine solutions.<p><b>&#8220;Tell me, what do you have in the house?&#8221;</b><br>Elisha's inquiry about the woman's possessions emphasizes the principle of God using what is already available to perform miracles. This reflects a recurring biblical theme where God uses the ordinary to accomplish the extraordinary, as seen in the feeding of the 5,000 with five loaves and two fish (<a href="/matthew/14-17.htm">Matthew 14:17-21</a>). It also encourages self-examination and resourcefulness, prompting individuals to recognize and utilize what God has already provided.<p><b>She answered, &#8220;Your servant has nothing in the house but a jar of oil.&#8221;</b><br>The widow's response underscores her dire situation, common in ancient Near Eastern societies where widows often faced financial hardship. Oil was a valuable commodity in biblical times, used for cooking, lighting, and anointing, symbolizing the presence and blessing of God. Her acknowledgment of having only a jar of oil sets the stage for God's miraculous provision, illustrating that even the smallest offering can be multiplied by divine intervention. This foreshadows the New Testament account of the widow's mite (<a href="/mark/12-41.htm">Mark 12:41-44</a>), where a seemingly insignificant contribution is honored by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet in Israel, successor to Elijah, known for performing miracles and providing guidance to the people of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_widow.htm">The Widow</a></b><br>A woman whose husband, a member of the company of prophets, has died, leaving her in debt and at risk of losing her sons to slavery.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jar_of_oil.htm">The Jar of Oil</a></b><br>The only possession of value the widow has, which becomes central to the miracle Elisha performs.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_in_desperation.htm">God's Provision in Desperation</a></b><br>God often uses what we already have, no matter how small, to provide for our needs.

This is, no doubt, in part, because she is a widow. Widows were, in the Law, especially commended to the attention and care of the faithful. As Bahr says, "It is a well-known feature of the Mosaic Law, one which is distinctly prominent, that it often and urgently commands to succor the widows and the fatherless, and to care for them (<a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22-24</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17, 19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/27-19.htm">Deuteronomy 27:19</a>).
