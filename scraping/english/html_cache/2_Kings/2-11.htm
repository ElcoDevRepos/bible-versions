Walking and talking together signifies mentorship and fellowship, a common practice among prophets and their followers. This setting underscores the importance of discipleship in spiritual growth, as seen in other mentor-mentee relationships in the Bible, such as Moses and Joshua or Paul and Timothy.<p><b>suddenly a chariot of fire with horses of fire appeared</b><br>The sudden appearance of the chariot and horses of fire signifies divine intervention. Fire often represents God's presence and power, as seen in the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>) and the pillar of fire (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). The chariot of fire symbolizes God's heavenly army, indicating Elijah's significant role as a prophet. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>, where Elisha's servant sees the hills full of horses and chariots of fire.<p><b>and separated the two of them</b><br>The separation of Elijah and Elisha by the chariot of fire signifies the end of Elijah's earthly ministry and the beginning of Elisha's. This moment marks a transition of prophetic authority, similar to the passing of leadership from Moses to Joshua. It emphasizes the continuity of God's work through different individuals.<p><b>and Elijah went up into heaven in a whirlwind</b><br>Elijah's ascension into heaven is unique, as he did not experience death. This event prefigures the ascension of Jesus Christ (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>), who also ascended into heaven. Elijah's ascension is a testament to his righteousness and God's approval of his ministry. It also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5</a>, which speaks of Elijah's return before the "great and dreadful day of the Lord," pointing to John the Baptist's ministry as a type of Elijah (<a href="/matthew/11-14.htm">Matthew 11:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A prophet of God known for his powerful ministry and miracles, including the confrontation with the prophets of Baal.

The popular conception, which we see embodied in such pictures as William Blake's Translation of Elijah, that the prophet ascended to heaven in a fiery car drawn by horses of fire, is plainly read into, rather than gathered from, the sacred text. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked</span> (comp. <a href="/luke/24-50.htm">Luke 24:50, 51</a>,). The antitype answers to the type in little details as well as in the general outline. <span class="cmt_word">That behold, there appeared a chariot of firs, and horses of fire.</span> God's "angels are spirits, and his ministers <span class="accented">a flaming fire"</span> (<a href="/psalms/104-4.htm">Psalm 104:4</a>). When the eyes of Elisha's servant were opened, and he saw the angelic host that protected his master, it appeared to him that "the mountain was full of horses and chariots <span class="accented">of fire</span> round about Elisha" (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>). Material fire is, of course, not to be thought cf. But the glory and brightness of celestial beings, when made visible to man, has some analogy with fire, or at any rate brings the conception of fire before the mind. The historian doubtless reports the account which Elisha gave of what he saw on this memorable occasion. <span class="cmt_word">And parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and Elijah went up in a storm into the heavens</span>. There is no mention of a "whirlwind;" and "the heavens" are primarily the visible firmament or sky which overhangs the earth. Elijah, like our Lord, rose bodily from the earth into the upper region of the air, and was there lost to sight. Three only of the seed of Adam - Enoch, Elijah, Jesus - have passed from earth to heaven without dying. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/2-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As they</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1443;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;m&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1992.htm">Strong's 1992: </a> </span><span class="str2">They</span><br /><br /><span class="word">were walking along</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1465;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#333;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and talking together,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1428;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;ab&#183;b&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
