In the context of <a href="/2_kings/19.htm">2 Kings 19</a>, God is addressing the Assyrian king Sennacherib, who has threatened Jerusalem. The phrase underscores that God is aware of Sennacherib's actions and intentions, even in his private moments. This reflects <a href="/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a>, where David acknowledges God's knowledge of his sitting and rising, illustrating that nothing is hidden from God.<p><b>your going out and coming in</b><br>This part of the verse further illustrates God's comprehensive awareness of human activities. In ancient Near Eastern culture, "going out and coming in" was a common expression denoting the entirety of one's daily life and activities. It signifies that God is aware of all movements and plans, not just those made in public or in secret. This is reminiscent of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-6.htm">Deuteronomy 28:6</a>, where blessings are pronounced on those who are obedient to God in their daily comings and goings.<p><b>and your raging against Me</b><br>Here, God directly addresses the hostility and arrogance of Sennacherib against Him. The Assyrian king's military campaigns and blasphemous words against the God of Israel are seen as a direct challenge to God's authority. This phrase highlights the futility of opposing God, as seen in the broader narrative of <a href="/2_kings/19.htm">2 Kings 19</a>, where God ultimately delivers Jerusalem from Assyrian threat. The "raging" can be compared to <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-4</a>, where the nations' rage against God is met with divine laughter, emphasizing God's sovereignty over earthly powers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah during the time of the Assyrian threat.

Nothing as ordinary as where and when Sennacherib sits escapes God&#8217;s sight.<p>- This underscores divine omniscience. David marveled likewise: &#8220;You know when I sit and when I rise&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/139-2.htm">Psalm 139:2</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s watchful awareness reaches into the minute and the mundane&#8212;reminding every believer that no circumstance is outside His providence (see <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29&#8211;30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>your going out and coming in</b><p>- Ancient Hebrew idiom for the whole course of daily life&#8212;every departure, every arrival.<p>- &#8220;The LORD will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/121-8.htm">Psalm 121:8</a>).<p>- For Sennacherib, the Lord announces: every campaign, every council, every march is fully known. For God&#8217;s people, this same truth guarantees safe paths: &#8220;Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you be when you go out&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-6.htm">Deuteronomy 28:6</a>).<p>- Practical take-away:<p>&#8226; No step is hidden from the Lord.<p>&#8226; Confidence grows when we recognize His continuous oversight.<p>&#8226; Sin&#8217;s secrecy is an illusion; obedience flourishes under His ever-present gaze (see <a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and your raging against Me</b><p>- The Assyrian king&#8217;s blasphemous threats (<a href="/2_kings/19-22.htm">2 Kings 19:22&#8211;23</a>) are labeled &#8220;rage.&#8221; God measures hostility as personally directed toward Himself.<p>- &#8220;Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1</a>). Earthly power arrays itself against heaven but ultimately meets divine rebuke (<a href="/psalms/2-4.htm">Psalm 2:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>- The Lord&#8217;s awareness is not passive; it foreshadows judgment. In the next verses He promises to &#8220;put My hook in your nose&#8221; and turn Sennacherib back (<a href="/2_kings/19-28.htm">2 Kings 19:28</a>).<p>- For believers:<p>&#8226; Comfort&#8212;God defends His own honor and His people.<p>&#8226; Caution&#8212;rage against God is never ignored; He resists the proud (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Assurance&#8212;He will vindicate His name and fulfill every promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>God&#8217;s declaration in <a href="/2_kings/19-27.htm">2 Kings 19:27</a> showcases His total knowledge of the Assyrian king&#8217;s posture, movements, and hostility. He sees the small things (&#8220;sitting down&#8221;), the everyday journeys (&#8220;going out and coming in&#8221;), and the overt rebellion (&#8220;raging against Me&#8221;). That same all-seeing, covenant-keeping Lord guards and guides His people while promising sure judgment on proud opponents.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">But I know thy abode</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">and thy down sitting, and thy going out, and thy coming in I know.</span> Clearly something has fallen out at the opening of the sentence.

(See <a href="/psalms/139-2.htm" title="You know my sitting down and my rising up, you understand my thought afar off.">Psalm 139:2</a>.) The thought thus expressed is this: I know all thy plans and thy doings; I see also thy present rebellion against me.

Jehovah claims an absolute knowledge of all that Sennacherib does or thinks, both when he is in action and when he is at rest. Nothing is hid from him (comp. <a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1-16</a>). Human pride should stand abashed before such absolute knowledge. <span class="cmt_word">And thy rage against me.</span> Opposition to their will fills violent men with fury and rage. Sennacherib's anger was primarily against Hezekiah, but when once he was convinced that Hezekiah really trusted in Jehovah (ver. 10), his fury would turn against God himself (see <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-3</a>, where the Lord's anointed is primarily David). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/19-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But I know</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1425;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#601;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your sitting down,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1435;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;i&#7687;&#183;t&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
