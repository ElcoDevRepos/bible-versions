His death marked the end of a significant era of apostasy and conflict with the prophets of Yahweh, notably Elijah. Ahab's reign was characterized by political alliances and military campaigns, but also by spiritual decline. His death, as prophesied by Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>), was a turning point for Israel, creating a power vacuum and uncertainty about the nation's future direction.<p><b>Moab rebelled against Israel</b><br>Moab was a neighboring nation to the east of Israel, across the Dead Sea. Historically, Moab had been subjugated by Israel during the reign of David (<a href="/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>) and had remained a vassal state, paying tribute to Israel. The rebellion of Moab signifies a shift in regional power dynamics following Ahab's death. This rebellion can be seen as a fulfillment of the instability prophesied due to Israel's disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-47.htm">Deuteronomy 28:47-48</a>). The Moabite Stone, an archaeological artifact, provides additional context, recording the Moabite King Mesha's perspective on this rebellion and his victories over Israel. This event sets the stage for the subsequent military campaigns and the involvement of the prophet Elisha, highlighting the ongoing struggle between Israel and its neighbors.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>The seventh king of Israel, known for his idolatry and wickedness, particularly his marriage to Jezebel and the promotion of Baal worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A neighboring nation east of Israel, often in conflict with Israel.

Ahab&#8217;s passing therefore signals the accelerating fulfillment of those covenant consequences.<p>&#8226; The phrase also reminds students that human power is fleeting, but the Lord&#8217;s word stands firm (<a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Moab rebelled</b><p>&#8220;Moab rebelled&#8221; spotlights a vassal kingdom throwing off Israelite control.<p>&#8226; David had subdued Moab centuries earlier (<a href="/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>), and it remained tributary until Omri and Ahab&#8217;s line (<a href="/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>).<p>&#8226; With Ahab gone, Moab sensed vulnerability and stopped paying tribute&#8212;an economic and military blow to Israel (<a href="/2_kings/3-5.htm">2 Kings 3:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The revolt illustrates <a href="/proverbs/28-2.htm">Proverbs 28:2</a>, &#8220;When a land transgresses, it has many rulers.&#8221; Sin had eroded national stability, inviting foreign resistance.<p>&#8226; God sometimes uses outside pressures to chastise His people and call them back to covenant faithfulness (<a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>; <a href="/amos/3-11.htm">Amos 3:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against Israel</b><p>The rebellion was &#8220;against Israel,&#8221; underscoring the divided kingdom&#8217;s fragility.<p>&#8226; Northern Israel had already fractured from Judah (<a href="/bsb/1_kings/12.htm">1 Kings 12</a>); now its sphere of influence shrank further.<p>&#8226; Loss of Moab hinted at larger judgments soon to come&#8212;first from Aram (<a href="/2_kings/6-8.htm">2 Kings 6:8</a>), then Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the phrase reminds readers that opposition often rises when God&#8217;s people wander from Him (<a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-25.htm">Jeremiah 5:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet even amid rebellion, the Lord remained sovereign; He later delivered victory over Moab under Jehoshaphat and Elisha&#8217;s direction (<a href="/2_kings/3-13.htm">2 Kings 3:13&#8211;27</a>), proving His ongoing faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/1-1.htm">2 Kings 1:1</a> is more than a historical footnote.

The verse signals God&#8217;s covenant discipline: sin diminishes strength, invites rebellion, and pushes His people to recognize their need for Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>1.THE REIGN OF AHAZIAH CONTINUED.<p>EPISODE CONCERNING ELIJAH.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Then.</span>--And.<p><span class= "bld">Moab rebelled against Israel.</span>--David reduced Moab to vassalage (<a href="/2_samuel/8-2.htm" title="And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive.

After that event, Scripture is silent as to the fortunes of Moab. It probably took occasion of the troubles which ensued upon the death of Solomon, to throw off the yoke of Israel. The famous Moabite stone suplements the sacred history by recording the war of liberation which Mesha, king of Moab, successfully waged against the successors of Ahab. The inscription opens thus: "I am Mesha, son of Chemosh-gad, king of Moab the Dibonite. My father reigned over Moab thirty years, and I reigned after my father. And I made this <span class= "ital">bamah</span> ("high place," "pillar") for Chemosh in Korha, a <span class= "ital">bamah</span> of salvation, for he saved me from all the assailants, and let me see my desire upon mine enemies . . . Omri, king of Israel, and he oppressed Moab many days, for Chemosh was angry with his land. And his son (i.e., Ahab) succeeded him, and he, toe, said, 'I will oppress Moab.' In m? days he said (it), but I saw my desire upon him and his house, and Israel perished utterly for ever. And Omri occupied the land of Medeba, and dwelt therein, and (they oppressed Moab he and) his son forty years. And Chemosh looked (?) on it (i.e., Moab) in my days." From this unique and unhappily much injured record it appears that Omri had reduced Moab again to subjection, and that Ahab, who, like his father, was a strong sovereign, had maintained his hold upon the country. The death of Ahab and the sickness of Ahaziah would be Moab's opportunity. The revolt of Moab is mentioned here parenthetically. The subject is continued in <a href="/context/2_kings/3-4.htm" title="And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep master, and rendered to the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.">2Kings 3:4-27</a>. (See the Notes there.)<p>(2?16) A new and (according to Ewald and Thenius) later fragment of the history of Elijah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Moab rebelled</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and Moab rebelled</span>, but with an idea, not merely of sequence, but of consequence. The "Moabite Stone," discovered in 1869, throws considerable light on the character and circumstances of this rebellion. <span class="cmt_word">Moab</span> had, we know, been subjected by David (<a href="/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>), and had been very severely treated. Either in the reign of Solomon, or more probably at his death, and the disruption of his kingdom, the Moabites had revolted, and resumed an independent position, which they had maintained until the reign of Omri. Omri, who was a warlike monarch, the greatest of the Israelite monarchs after Jeroboam, after settling himself firmly upon the throne of Israel, attacked the Moabite territory, and in a short time reduced it, making the native king, Chemosh-gad, his tributary. At the death of Omri, Ahab succeeded to the suzerainty, and maintained it during his lifetime, exacting a tribute that was felt as a severe "oppression" (Moabite Stone, line 6; comp. <a href="/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>). The death of Ahab in battle and the defeat of his army encouraged Mesha, who had succeeded his father, Chemosh-gad, to raise the standard of revolt once more, and to emancipate his country after a period of subjection which he estimates roughly at "forty years." The "Stone" is chiefly occupied with an account of the steps by which he recovered his territory. <span class="cmt_word">After the death of Ahab.</span> Probably, as soon as he heard of it. In Oriental empires the death of a brave and energetic monarch is constantly the signal for a general revolt of the subject peoples. They entertain a hope that his successor will not inherit his vigor and capacity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/1-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_310.htm">Strong's 310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The hind or following part</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the death</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4194.htm">Strong's 4194: </a> </span><span class="str2">Death, the dead, their place, state, pestilence, ruin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Ahab,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1469;&#1489;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7717;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_256.htm">Strong's 256: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ahab -- 'father's brother', a king of Israel, also a false prophet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Moab</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4124.htm">Strong's 4124: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moab -- a son of Lot,also his descendants and the territory where they settled</span><br /><br /><span class="word">rebelled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1444;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yip&#772;&#183;&#353;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
