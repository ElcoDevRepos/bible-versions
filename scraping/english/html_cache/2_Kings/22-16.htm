In the biblical context, when a prophet declares "this is what the LORD says," it signifies a direct communication from God, underscoring the seriousness and certainty of the message. This is a common prophetic formula found throughout the Old Testament, indicating that the message is not of human origin but divinely inspired.<p><b>I am about to bring calamity on this place:</b><br>The "place" refers to Jerusalem and the kingdom of Judah. Historically, this prophecy is set during the reign of King Josiah, a time when Judah was under threat from surrounding nations. The calamity foretold is the impending Babylonian invasion and the subsequent destruction of Jerusalem, which occurred in 586 BC. This serves as a fulfillment of earlier warnings given by prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah, who spoke of judgment due to the people's persistent idolatry and disobedience.<p><b>and on its people:</b><br>The judgment is not only on the physical location but also on the inhabitants of Judah. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and His people, where blessings and curses were contingent upon their obedience to the Law (Deuteronomy 28). The people's collective sin, particularly their idolatry and abandonment of God's commandments, has led to this impending judgment.<p><b>according to all the words of the book:</b><br>This refers to the Book of the Law, likely Deuteronomy, which was discovered during the temple renovations ordered by King Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8</a>). The rediscovery of the Law led to a national religious reform, as Josiah sought to align the kingdom with God's commandments. The "words of the book" include the blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience, which are now being realized due to the nation's failure to uphold the covenant.<p><b>that the king of Judah has read:</b><br>King Josiah's response to the reading of the Law was one of repentance and reform (<a href="/2_kings/22-11.htm">2 Kings 22:11-13</a>). His actions demonstrate a sincere attempt to avert the prophesied disaster by turning the nation back to God. However, despite his efforts, the accumulated sin of previous generations had set the course for judgment. Josiah's reading and response highlight the importance of Scripture in guiding leaders and nations, and his story serves as a type of Christ, who also sought to bring people back to God through His life and teachings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_josiah.htm">King Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms after discovering the Book of the Law in the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hilkiah_the_high_priest.htm">Hilkiah the High Priest</a></b><br>The priest who found the Book of the Law during temple repairs.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shaphan_the_scribe.htm">Shaphan the Scribe</a></b><br>The scribe who read the Book of the Law to King Josiah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, and the center of worship in Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_book_of_the_law.htm">The Book of the Law</a></b><br>Likely a portion of Deuteronomy, which was discovered in the temple and led to the reforms.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_scripture.htm">The Importance of Scripture</a></b><br>The discovery of the Book of the Law led to significant reforms.
