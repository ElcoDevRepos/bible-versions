His acts, though not extensively detailed in the biblical narrative, are significant enough to be recorded in the annals of Israel's history. This phrase suggests that Shallum's actions, though not fully recounted in the biblical text, were noteworthy in the context of Israel's turbulent political landscape. His short reign reflects the instability and frequent power struggles during this period in the Northern Kingdom.<p><b>along with the conspiracy he led</b><br>Shallum's rise to power was marked by conspiracy and assassination, as he killed King Zechariah to seize the throne. This act of treachery is indicative of the political chaos and moral decline in Israel, fulfilling the prophecy given to Jehu that his descendants would sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation (<a href="/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30</a>).

These records, now lost, would have provided additional details about the political and social events of the time. The mention of these chronicles highlights the historical nature of the biblical narrative and the importance of written records in preserving the history of God's people.

Compare how Scripture frequently says &#8220;the rest of the acts&#8221; about other kings (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/14-19.htm">1 Kings 14:19</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-17.htm">2 Kings 21:17</a>), underscoring divine completeness in record-keeping.<p>&#8226; Although Shallum&#8217;s reign was fleeting, it mattered. <a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a> and <a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36</a> echo that nothing in any life escapes God&#8217;s notice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with the conspiracy he led</b><p>&#8226; The Holy Spirit singles out the conspiracy because it defined Shallum&#8217;s character: he advanced himself through violence rather than covenant faithfulness (<a href="/2_kings/15-10.htm">2 Kings 15:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel had endured a string of such plots&#8212;Baasha against Nadab (<a href="/1_kings/15-27.htm">1 Kings 15:27</a>), Zimri against Elah (<a href="/1_kings/16-9.htm">1 Kings 16:9&#8211;10</a>), Jehu against Joram (<a href="/2_kings/9-14.htm">2 Kings 9:14&#8211;24</a>).

By directing readers there, the author differentiates between mundane state affairs and the theological narrative preserved in Kings.<p>&#8226; Repeated references to this archive (<a href="/1_kings/14-19.htm">1 Kings 14:19</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-28.htm">2 Kings 23:28</a>) invite us to value Scripture&#8217;s selective focus on covenant fidelity over mere statistics of power.<p>&#8226; The contrast underscores that lasting significance rests not in earthly records but in God&#8217;s evaluation (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/15-15.htm">2 Kings 15:15</a> uses a familiar formula to remind us that even a one-month king like Shallum is fully known to God. His violent conspiracy exemplifies the destructive cycles of sin in Israel&#8217;s northern kingdom, yet the verse also reassures us of Scripture&#8217;s accuracy and of God&#8217;s exhaustive record of human actions. Earthly archives may vanish, but the Lord&#8217;s assessment endures, calling each person to live faithfully under His watchful eye.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made</span> (see ver. 10), <span class="cmt_word">behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/15-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As for the rest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1433;&#1514;&#1462;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;ye&#183;&#7791;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3499.htm">Strong's 3499: </a> </span><span class="str2">An overhanging, an excess, superiority, remainder, a small rope</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the acts</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(di&#7687;&#183;r&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Shallum,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;al&#183;l&#363;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7967.htm">Strong's 7967: </a> </span><span class="str2">Shallum -- the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">along with the conspiracy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1512;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;qi&#353;&#183;r&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7195.htm">Strong's 7195: </a> </span><span class="str2">An, alliance</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he led,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1425;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7194.htm">Strong's 7194: </a> </span><span class="str2">To tie, gird, confine, compact, in love, league</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they are indeed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
