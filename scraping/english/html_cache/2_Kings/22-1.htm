His father, Amon, was assassinated, leading to Josiah's early coronation. This situation underscores the political turmoil and the need for divine intervention in the leadership of Judah. Josiah's youth also sets the stage for his later reforms, as he would have been heavily influenced by his advisors and the high priest Hilkiah, who played a significant role in his spiritual development. This early start is reminiscent of other young leaders in the Bible, such as Samuel and David, who were called by God at a young age.<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years</b><br>Josiah's reign, lasting thirty-one years, was marked by significant religious reforms and a return to the worship of Yahweh. This period of stability and reform is crucial in the history of Judah, as it represents a temporary reprieve from the idolatry and apostasy that characterized much of the nation's history. Josiah's reign is often seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy given to the unnamed prophet in <a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>, which foretold the coming of a king named Josiah who would destroy the altars of Bethel. His long reign allowed for the implementation of extensive reforms, including the repair of the temple and the rediscovery of the Book of the Law, which led to a national revival.<p><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah</b><br>The mention of Josiah's mother, Jedidah, and her lineage, highlights the importance of maternal influence in the biblical narrative. While the Bible does not provide extensive details about Jedidah, her inclusion suggests that she may have played a role in Josiah's upbringing and spiritual formation. The name Jedidah means "beloved," which could imply a positive influence on Josiah's life. The maternal lineage is often noted in the Bible to establish legitimacy and heritage, as seen in other genealogical records.<p><b>she was from Bozkath</b><br>Bozkath was a town in the territory of Judah, mentioned in <a href="/joshua/15-39.htm">Joshua 15:39</a>. Its inclusion here provides geographical context and ties Josiah's family to the southern kingdom of Judah. The mention of Bozkath may also indicate the social standing or tribal affiliation of Josiah's family, as towns and cities often held significance in terms of identity and heritage. This connection to a specific location within Judah underscores the continuity of the Davidic line and the fulfillment of God's promises to David regarding his descendants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The young king of Judah who began his reign at the age of eight.

This literal detail highlights the sovereignty of God, who can entrust leadership even to a child.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s pattern of using the young appears elsewhere: He called Samuel while still a boy (<a href="/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1&#8211;10</a>) and chose David when he was &#8220;the youngest&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11&#8211;13</a>). Josiah fits the same mold&#8212;evidence that age is no barrier when the Lord appoints a servant.<p>&#8226; A child-king required divine protection and guidance. The Lord provided it through faithful advisors such as Hilkiah the priest (<a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8&#8211;14</a>). Just as &#8220;the LORD was with&#8221; young Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19</a>), He was with Josiah, preserving him for a vital reform mission (<a href="/2_kings/23-1.htm">2 Kings 23:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years</b><p>&#8226; Thirty-one years of stability in Judah&#8217;s capital gave Josiah both the time and authority to implement sweeping reforms. His tenure contrasts sharply with the rapid turnovers of earlier kings (e.g., Zechariah&#8217;s six months, <a href="/2_kings/15-8.htm">2 Kings 15:8&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8226; Length matters: a protracted reign allowed the rediscovered Book of the Law (<a href="/2_kings/22-8.htm">2 Kings 22:8</a>) to shape the nation&#8217;s life. By the eighteenth year of his reign, Josiah had mobilized a full covenant renewal (<a href="/2_kings/23-1.htm">2 Kings 23:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Long reigns often mark God&#8217;s favor (cf. Asa&#8217;s &#8220;forty-one years&#8221; in <a href="/1_kings/15-10.htm">1 Kings 15:10</a>). Likewise, the chronicler notes, &#8220;All his days they did not turn away from following the LORD&#8221; under Josiah (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-33.htm">2 Chronicles 34:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah; she was from Bozkath</b><p>&#8226; Naming Josiah&#8217;s mother underscores the powerful influence a mother can wield over a monarch. <a href="/proverbs/31-1.htm">Proverbs 31:1</a> credits a mother&#8217;s counsel for shaping royal wisdom; Jedidah likely played such a role.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Jedidah&#8221; means &#8220;beloved,&#8221; suggesting affection that may have nurtured Josiah&#8217;s tender heart toward God (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-3.htm">2 Chronicles 34:3</a> states he began seeking the LORD at age sixteen).<p>&#8226; Bozkath, a town in Judah&#8217;s lowlands (<a href="/joshua/15-39.htm">Joshua 15:39</a>), ties Josiah to ordinary Judahite soil rather than purely courtly circles. This local connection balances palace life with grassroots identity, echoing the humility God values (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often links a king&#8217;s righteousness to godly mentors: Joash followed the LORD &#8220;all the days of Jehoiada the priest&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/12-2.htm">2 Kings 12:2</a>). Jedidah may have served a similar steadying purpose for her young son.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/22-1.htm">2 Kings 22:1</a> presents three straightforward facts&#8212;Josiah&#8217;s age, length of reign, and maternal lineage&#8212;but each fact pulses with meaning. God&#8217;s choice of an eight-year-old king showcases His sovereignty; a thirty-one-year reign provides the platform for national revival; and the mention of Jedidah points to the quiet, faithful influences God uses to shape leaders. Together, these details set the stage for one of Judah&#8217;s greatest seasons of reform, reminding believers that the Lord orchestrates every circumstance&#8212;age, tenure, and family&#8212;to accomplish His redemptive purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">XXII.<p>THE REIGN OF JOSIAH</span> (2 Kings 22, <a href="/2_kings/23-30.htm" title="And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own sepulcher.
