By eliminating high places, sacred pillars, Asherah poles, and even the revered bronze serpent, he restored exclusive, wholehearted worship of the LORD. The passage calls believers to confront and remove whatever competes with God&#8217;s sovereignty, demonstrating that authentic devotion is obedient, uncompromising, and centered on Him alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">He removed.</span>--<span class= "ital">He it was who removed.</span> According to this statement, Hezekiah made the Temple of Jerusalem the only place where Jehovah might be publicly worshipped.

He began, as we learn from Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-3.htm">2 Chronicles 29:3, 17</a>), "in the first year of his reign, the first month, and the first day," by reopening the temple, which Ahaz had shut up, removing from it all the "filthiness" which Ahaz had allowed to accumulate (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-5.htm">2 Chronicles 29:5</a>), gathering together the priests and Levites and exhorting them (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-4.htm">2 Chronicles 29:4-11</a>), restoring and renewing the vessels which Ahaz had cut in pieces (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-19.htm">2 Chronicles 29:19</a>), and then re-establishing the temple-worship with all due solemnity (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-20.htm">2 Chronicles 29:20-35</a>). He next resolved on holding a grand Passover-festival, in the second month, as it had not been possible to keep it in the first (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-2.htm">2 Chronicles 30:2, 3</a>), and invited thereto, not only his own subjects, but the Israelites of the neighboring kingdom who were not yet carried off, but were still under the rule of Hoshea (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-10.htm">2 Chronicles 30:10, 11, 18</a>). It was not until this festival was over that the removal of the high places was taken in hand. Then, in a fit of zeal, which no doubt the king encouraged, a multitude of those who had kept the feast went forth from Jerusalem, first into the cities of Judah and Benjamin, and then into several of the cities of Israel, and "brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars... and utterly destroyed them all" (see <a href="/2_chronicles/31-1.htm">2 Chronicles 31:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And brake the images, and cut down the groves</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the grove</span>, according to the present text; but, as all the versions have the plural, Thenius thinks <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span> should be changed into <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Keil and Bahr, on the contrary, would retain the singular, but understand it "collectively." That idolatry was practiced at some of the high places seems clear from this place, as well as from <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And brake in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made</span> (see <a href="/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>). Difficulties are raised with respect to this statement. Some argue that the serpent, having served its purpose, would have been left hanging at the place where it was set up in the wilderness; others, that Moses would have destroyed it, lest the Israelites should make it an idol; others, again, that it was not likely to have lasted seven hundred years from the Exodus, even if it was brought into Palestine and taken care cf. It is supposed, therefore, that an imitation of the original serpent had been made by the Jews in the reign of Ahaz, had been called "the serpent Of Moses," and was now destroyed. But there is no sufficient reason for any of these suppositions. Considering what the serpent typified (<a href="/john/3-14.htm">John 3:14</a>), it is not surprising that Moses should have been instructed to preserve it with the furniture of the tabernacle, or that, when once attached to that structure, it should have been preserved as a religious relic for seven hundred years. Many Egyptian figures in bronze now exist which are from three thousand to four thousand years old. The statement of the writer of Kings, that Hezekiah did now destroy "the serpent <span class="accented">that Moses had made</span>," is of more weight than a thousand speculations concerning what is likely, or not likely, to have happened. <span class="cmt_word">For unto these days the children of Israel did burn incense to it.</span> Not, certainly, "from Moses' time to Hezekiah's," but from a date left vague and undetermined to the time when Hezekiah took his religious reformation in hand. Hezekiah found the practice continuing; the writer is not concerned to say - perhaps does net know - when it began. He implies, however, that it was of long standing. Serpent-worship was widely spread in the East, and there was more excuse for directing religious regard toward this serpent than toward any other. <span class="cmt_word">And he called it Nehushtan</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and it was called Nehushtan</span>. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e7;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;</span> is a singular with indefinite subject ("one called"), equivalent to "they called," or "it was called" (comp. <a href="/genesis/25-26.htm">Genesis 25:26</a>; <a href="/genesis/38-29.htm">Genesis 38:29, 30</a>). Nehushtan is not from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> "serpent," but from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5ea;</span>, "brass," and means "the little brass thing," <span class="hebrew">&#x5df;</span> being a diminutive, expression of tenderness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/18-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He removed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1461;&#1505;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#234;&#183;s&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5493.htm">Strong's 5493: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn aside</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the high places,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(hab&#183;b&#257;&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
