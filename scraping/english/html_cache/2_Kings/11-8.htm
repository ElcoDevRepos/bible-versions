In the context of <a href="/2_kings/11.htm">2 Kings 11</a>, this refers to the protection of young King Joash, who was the rightful heir to the throne of Judah. The use of weapons signifies the seriousness of the threat posed by Queen Athaliah, who had usurped the throne. This protection is reminiscent of the divine protection God provides to His chosen leaders, as seen in other biblical narratives such as David's protection from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>). The imagery of surrounding the king can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is surrounded by His angels and protected by divine power (<a href="/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>).<p><b>and anyone who approaches the ranks must be put to death</b><br>This directive underscores the severity of the situation and the need for absolute loyalty and obedience to the king's protection. It reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of ensuring the security of the monarch at all costs. The command to put to death anyone who breaches the ranks indicates the high stakes involved in preserving the Davidic line, which was crucial for the fulfillment of God's covenant with David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). This also foreshadows the ultimate protection and authority of Christ, the King of Kings, who will judge and rule with righteousness (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>).<p><b>You must stay close to the king wherever he goes</b><br>This phrase highlights the necessity of constant vigilance and loyalty. The close proximity to the king signifies not only physical protection but also unwavering support and allegiance. In the historical context, this was vital to ensure the stability of the kingdom and the continuation of the Davidic dynasty. Spiritually, this can be seen as a call for believers to remain close to Christ, our King, abiding in Him and following His guidance (<a href="/john/15-4.htm">John 15:4-5</a>). The loyalty and dedication required of the guards reflect the commitment expected of Christ's followers, who are called to be faithful and steadfast in their devotion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiada_the_priest.htm">Jehoiada the Priest</a></b><br>A key figure in this chapter, Jehoiada orchestrates the protection and coronation of Joash, ensuring the Davidic line continues.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>The young king of Judah, hidden and protected by Jehoiada and others to preserve the Davidic lineage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/athaliah.htm">Athaliah</a></b><br>The usurping queen who had seized power in Judah, known for her idolatry and attempts to destroy the royal family.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_of_the_lord.htm">The Temple of the LORD</a></b><br>The central place of worship and the setting for Joash's coronation, symbolizing God's presence and authority.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_royal_guard.htm">The Royal Guard</a></b><br>The group of soldiers tasked with protecting Joash, ensuring his safety during the transition of power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection_and_providence.htm">Divine Protection and Providence</a></b><br>God's hand is evident in the preservation of Joash, reminding us of His sovereignty and faithfulness to His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_godly_leadership.htm">The Role of Godly Leadership</a></b><br>Jehoiada's courage and wisdom highlight the impact of righteous leadership in guiding and protecting God's people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience_and_vigilance.htm">The Importance of Obedience and Vigilance</a></b><br>The guards' strict adherence to their duty reflects the necessity of obedience and vigilance in our spiritual lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preservation_of_god's_promises.htm">Preservation of God's Promises</a></b><br>The protection of Joash illustrates God's commitment to His covenant, encouraging us to trust in His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare_and_defense.htm">Spiritual Warfare and Defense</a></b><br>The physical defense of Joash can be likened to the spiritual armor we must wear to protect our faith and integrity.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_11_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 11:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_11_8_Protect_God_s_anointed.htm">How does 2 Kings 11:8 emphasize the importance of protecting God's anointed leader?

The order was that if any one entered the temple, and attempted to break through the ranks of the guard, either in front of the king or behind him, he should instantly be put to death.
