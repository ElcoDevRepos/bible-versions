His reign is noted for prosperity and military success, as well as a tragic end due to leprosy (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-21</a>). The reference to the fiftieth year of his reign provides a chronological anchor, situating Pekahiah's ascension in the broader timeline of the divided monarchy. This period was marked by political instability in Israel, contrasting with Judah's relative stability under Azariah.<p><b>Pekahiah son of Menahem became king of Israel</b><br>Pekahiah was the son of Menahem, who had seized the throne of Israel through violence (<a href="/2_kings/15-14.htm">2 Kings 15:14</a>). Menahem's reign was characterized by brutality and heavy taxation to pay tribute to the Assyrian king Pul (<a href="/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19-20</a>). Pekahiah's succession indicates a continuation of his father's dynasty, albeit briefly. His name, meaning "Yahweh has opened the eyes," contrasts with his short and troubled reign.<p><b>and reigned in Samaria</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, established by Omri (<a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>). It served as the political and religious center of Israel, often associated with idolatry and apostasy (<a href="/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31-33</a>). The city's strategic location made it a focal point for conflict and conquest, particularly by the Assyrians. Samaria's significance is underscored by its frequent mention in prophetic literature, symbolizing Israel's unfaithfulness.<p><b>two years</b><br>Pekahiah's reign was notably brief, lasting only two years. This short duration reflects the ongoing political turmoil and frequent coups in the Northern Kingdom. His assassination by Pekah, one of his own officers (<a href="/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a>), underscores the instability and violence that plagued Israel during this period. The brevity of his reign highlights the contrast with the longer, more stable reigns in Judah, such as that of Azariah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azariah.htm">Azariah (Uzziah)</a></b><br>King of Judah during whose reign Pekahiah became king of Israel.
