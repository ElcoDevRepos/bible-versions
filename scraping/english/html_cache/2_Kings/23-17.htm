The "monument" refers to a grave or tomb, indicating a place of significance. Josiah's inquiry shows his interest in understanding the historical and spiritual significance of the sites he encounters. This reflects his commitment to restoring true worship in Judah, aligning with his efforts to remove pagan altars and high places.<p><b>And the men of the city replied,</b><br>The men of the city are likely inhabitants of Bethel, a city with a complex religious history. Bethel was a center of idolatrous worship established by Jeroboam I, who set up golden calves there (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-29</a>). The response of the city's men indicates their awareness of the site's historical and prophetic significance, suggesting that the memory of the "man of God" and his prophecy had been preserved over generations.<p><b>&#8220;It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah</b><br>The "man of God" refers to the unnamed prophet from Judah who confronted King Jeroboam at Bethel (<a href="/1_kings/13.htm">1 Kings 13:1-2</a>). This prophet's journey from Judah to Bethel underscores the division between the northern and southern kingdoms and highlights the ongoing conflict between true worship and idolatry. His actions and subsequent burial in Bethel serve as a testament to his faithfulness and the fulfillment of his prophecy.<p><b>and proclaimed these things that you have done to the altar of Bethel.&#8221;</b><br>The prophecy mentioned here is found in <a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>, where the man of God foretold the desecration of the altar at Bethel by a future king named Josiah. This prophecy is fulfilled in <a href="/2_kings/23-15.htm">2 Kings 23:15-16</a>, as Josiah destroys the altar and burns human bones on it, defiling it.
