The time period is during the reign of King Jotham of Judah, who ruled from approximately 750 to 735 BC. This era was marked by political instability and external threats to the kingdom of Judah.<p><b>the LORD began to send</b><br>This indicates divine intervention and sovereignty over the affairs of nations. The LORD's involvement suggests that the events were part of a larger divine plan or judgment. This aligns with the biblical theme that God uses nations to accomplish His purposes, as seen in other instances such as the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities.<p><b>Rezin king of Aram</b><br>Rezin was the king of Aram, also known as Syria, with its capital in Damascus. Aram was a significant regional power and often in conflict with Israel and Judah. Rezin's involvement highlights the geopolitical tensions of the time. Archaeological findings, such as inscriptions, confirm the existence of Aram and its interactions with neighboring kingdoms.<p><b>and Pekah son of Remaliah</b><br>Pekah was the king of Israel, the northern kingdom, and reigned from approximately 752 to 732 BC. His alliance with Rezin against Judah is part of the Syro-Ephraimite War, a significant conflict in the region. This alliance is also mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7</a>, where the prophet Isaiah addresses the threat posed by these two kings.<p><b>against Judah</b><br>Judah, the southern kingdom, was under threat from this alliance. The political and military pressure from Rezin and Pekah was a significant challenge for King Jotham and his successor, Ahaz. This period of conflict is a backdrop for the prophecies of Isaiah, who reassured the house of David of God's protection despite the immediate threats.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who orchestrates events according to His divine will and purpose.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rezin.htm">Rezin</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria), who becomes an adversary to Judah during this period.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pekah_son_of_remaliah.htm">Pekah son of Remaliah</a></b><br>The king of Israel, who joins forces with Rezin against Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which is under threat from external enemies due to its disobedience to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/aram.htm">Aram (Syria)</a></b><br>A neighboring nation to Israel, often in conflict with the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_sovereignty_and_judgment.htm">Divine Sovereignty and Judgment</a></b><br>God is in control of nations and their leaders.
