This coalition was formed to combat the rebellion of Moab against Israel. The alliance is significant as it shows a rare moment of cooperation between Israel and Judah, despite their divided kingdoms. The inclusion of Edom, a vassal state under Judah's influence, underscores the strategic importance of regional alliances in ancient Near Eastern politics. This cooperation can be seen as a temporary unification against a common enemy, reflecting the complex political landscape of the time.<p><b>and after they had traveled a roundabout route for seven days</b><br>The "roundabout route" suggests a strategic or possibly misguided path taken by the coalition. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or divine intervention in the Bible, which may imply that their journey was under divine scrutiny or had a predetermined outcome. The geographical context indicates that the armies were likely traveling through the arid regions south of the Dead Sea, which would have been challenging terrain. This detour could have been an attempt to surprise the Moabites or avoid direct confrontation until they were better prepared.<p><b>they had no water for their army or for their animals</b><br>The lack of water is a critical logistical failure, highlighting the harsh realities of desert warfare and the dependence on natural resources. In the ancient Near East, water was a precious commodity, essential for survival and military success. This predicament sets the stage for divine intervention, as seen later in the chapter, where Elisha prophesies the provision of water. The situation also serves as a test of faith and leadership for the kings involved, particularly Jehoshaphat, who seeks the counsel of the Lord. This mirrors other biblical narratives where God provides for His people in times of need, such as the provision of manna and water in the wilderness during the Exodus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_israel.htm">King of Israel (Jehoram)</a></b><br>The son of Ahab, Jehoram was the king of Israel during this time.

God had already promised Judah&#8217;s king victory when he consulted Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/3-14.htm">2 Kings 3:14</a>). In other eras He likewise used political unions for His purposes&#8212;think of <a href="/joshua/10-5.htm">Joshua 10:5</a>, where five Amorite kings gathered and the Lord overruled their plans.<p>- Their partnership also contrasts times when Israel stood alone because of sin (<a href="/judges/6-1.htm">Judges 6:1</a>). Here, despite Jehoram&#8217;s compromised faith (<a href="/2_kings/3-2.htm">2 Kings 3:2</a>), the presence of Judah&#8217;s godly king draws God&#8217;s favor, echoing <a href="/proverbs/28-2.htm">Proverbs 28:2</a>: &#8220;with a discerning and wise ruler, there is stability.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They set out</b><p>- Action follows intention. The three kings do not linger in planning; they march (<a href="/2_kings/3-9.htm">2 Kings 3:9</a>). Faith often requires movement before sight (<a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8</a>).<p>- Their departure from Samaria toward Moab mirrors earlier journeys of obedience, such as Judah&#8217;s advance under Asa (<a href="/2_chronicles/14-11.htm">2 Chronicles 14:11</a>) and Israel leaving Sinai at God&#8217;s command (<a href="/numbers/10-11.htm">Numbers 10:11&#8211;13</a>).<p>- Even though Jehoram&#8217;s motives are partly political, God can still steer human plans (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A roundabout route for seven days</b><p>- Instead of a direct northern march, they swing south through the wilderness of Edom&#8212;strategic, yet arduous (<a href="/2_kings/3-8.htm">2 Kings 3:8</a>). Scripture repeatedly shows God permitting longer paths to expose hearts: Israel&#8217;s detour after the exodus (<a href="/exodus/13-17.htm">Exodus 13:17&#8211;18</a>) and the wilderness circuit in <a href="/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>.<p>- The &#8220;seven days&#8221; recalls completion and testing&#8212;Noah&#8217;s seven-day wait (<a href="/genesis/7-4.htm">Genesis 7:4</a>) and Israel&#8217;s seven-day march around Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-15.htm">Joshua 6:15</a>). Here the week-long trek becomes a divinely timed setup for miraculous intervention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>No water for army or animals</b><p>- Physical scarcity presses the kings to acknowledge dependence on the Lord. Similar crises appear in <a href="/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1&#8211;7</a> and <a href="/numbers/20-2.htm">Numbers 20:2&#8211;13</a>, where lack of water revealed either faith or grumbling.<p>- <a href="/psalms/63-1.htm">Psalm 63:1</a> captures the spiritual parallel: &#8220;My soul thirsts for You in a dry and weary land with no water.&#8221; God often allows literal thirst to point to a deeper need, later satisfied fully in Christ, the giver of &#8220;living water&#8221; (<a href="/john/4-13.htm">John 4:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>- Without water, their military strength evaporates; <a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a> reminds us, &#8220;The horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory belongs to the LORD.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/3-9.htm">2 Kings 3:9</a> portrays three allied kings confidently marching, only to face life-threatening thirst after a week-long detour. The verse underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty over political alliances, His purpose in prolonged paths, and His use of need to reveal dependence on Him. What looks like a logistical failure is actually a divinely crafted moment that will set the stage for His miraculous provision in the verses that follow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">The king of Edom.</span>--A vassal king appointed by Jehoshaphat (<a href="/1_kings/22-48.htm" title="Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.">1Kings 22:48</a>).<p><span class= "bld">They fetched a compass.</span>--<span class= "ital">Went round</span> (scil., the Dead Sea) <span class= "ital">a journey of seven days.</span> The confederates appear to have lost their way among the mountains of Seir.

It is to be remarked that, when Edom was last mentioned, she was ruled by a "deputy," who received his appointment from the King of Judah (<a href="/1_kings/22-47.htm">1 Kings 22:47</a>).
