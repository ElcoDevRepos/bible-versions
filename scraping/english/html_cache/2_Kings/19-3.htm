In the context of <a href="/2_kings/19.htm">2 Kings 19</a>, Hezekiah sends his officials to the prophet Isaiah, seeking divine guidance. This reflects the importance of prophets as intermediaries between God and the people.<p><b>&#8220;This is what Hezekiah says:</b><br>Hezekiah, the king of Judah, is portrayed as a leader who seeks God's counsel in times of crisis. His reliance on God contrasts with the idolatry of previous kings. This phrase underscores the king's humility and recognition of his need for divine intervention.<p><b>Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace;</b><br>The "day of distress" refers to the siege of Jerusalem by the Assyrian army under Sennacherib. The terms "rebuke" and "disgrace" suggest a sense of divine judgment and national humiliation. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where disobedience leads to consequences.<p><b>for children have come to the point of birth,</b><br>This metaphor illustrates a situation of extreme urgency and helplessness. It evokes the image of a woman in labor, emphasizing the critical nature of the crisis. The imagery is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe times of great peril (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/37-3.htm">Isaiah 37:3</a>).<p><b>but there is no strength to deliver them.</b><br>The lack of strength to deliver the children symbolizes Judah's inability to save itself from the Assyrian threat. It highlights human weakness and the need for divine intervention.
