The sending of a second horseman indicates the urgency and seriousness of the situation. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, messengers on horseback were often used for rapid communication, especially in times of potential conflict. The king's repeated sending of messengers underscores his anxiety and the importance of the message.<p><b>who went to them and said, &#8220;This is what the king asks: &#8216;Have you come in peace?&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The question "Have you come in peace?" reflects the king's concern about Jehu's intentions. Peace, or "shalom" in Hebrew, was a common greeting but also a significant concept in Israelite society, encompassing not just the absence of conflict but also well-being and harmony. The king's inquiry highlights the tension and uncertainty surrounding Jehu's approach. This question is reminiscent of other biblical instances where peace is sought, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/16-4.htm">1 Samuel 16:4-5</a> when Samuel visits Bethlehem and the elders ask if he comes in peace.<p><b>&#8220;What do you know about peace?&#8221; Jehu replied.</b><br>Jehu's response is confrontational and dismissive, indicating that he has no intention of negotiating or offering peace under the current circumstances. This rhetorical question challenges the messenger's understanding of the situation and foreshadows the impending judgment Jehu is about to execute. Jehu's mission is divinely ordained, as seen earlier in <a href="/2_kings/9-6.htm">2 Kings 9:6-10</a>, where he is anointed to destroy the house of Ahab. His response can be seen as a rejection of false peace, similar to the warnings of false prophets in <a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a> who proclaim "Peace, peace" when there is no peace.<p><b>&#8220;Fall in behind me.&#8221;</b><br>Jehu's command to the horseman to "fall in behind me" signifies his authority and the inevitability of his mission. It implies that the horseman should join Jehu's cause, recognizing the divine mandate behind his actions. This phrase can be seen as a call to align with God's purposes, reminiscent of Jesus' call to His disciples to follow Him (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>). Jehu's leadership and decisive action are crucial in fulfilling the prophecy against the house of Ahab, demonstrating the theme of divine justice and the fulfillment of God's word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>Anointed by God to be king over Israel, Jehu is a central figure in this passage.

He hopes the approaching force means no harm to his compromised dynasty. Compare:<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_samuel/18-28.htm">2 Samuel 18:28</a>, where a messenger to David announces peace after Absalom&#8217;s rebellion.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/6-14.htm">Jeremiah 6:14</a>, where false prophets cry &#8220;Peace, peace&#8221; when judgment is at the door.<p>Joram wants reassurance that the status quo will continue, but God&#8217;s word has already decreed its end (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21&#8211;24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;What do you know about peace?&#8221; Jehu replied.</b><p>Jehu&#8217;s counter-question slices through royal politeness. Literally, &#8220;What is it to you&#8212;peace?&#8221; In other words, &#8220;You are in no position to define peace when your master stands under divine judgment.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Just three verses later Jehu says to Joram, &#8220;How can there be peace as long as the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound?&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/9-22.htm">2 Kings 9:22</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/57-21.htm">Isaiah 57:21</a> declares, &#8220;There is no peace,&#8221; says my God, &#8220;for the wicked.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a> warns of sudden destruction upon those who mouth &#8220;Peace and safety.&#8221;<p>Real peace is inseparable from submission to God&#8217;s righteousness&#8212;something Ahab&#8217;s line has rejected.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Fall in behind me.&#8221;</b><p>Jehu does not negotiate; he commands.

Joram sends messengers seeking &#8220;peace,&#8221; but Jehu, God&#8217;s newly anointed king, exposes the emptiness of that word in a corrupt kingdom. He asserts divine authority, recruits the very envoys sent to stop him, and presses on to fulfill the LORD&#8217;s prophecy against Ahab&#8217;s house. Real peace comes only through wholehearted alignment with God&#8217;s revealed will; anything less is mere illusion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Then.</span>--<span class= "ital">Literally, And he sent a second rider of a horse.</span><p><span class= "bld">Is it peace?</span>--So the versions, many editions, and some MSS.
