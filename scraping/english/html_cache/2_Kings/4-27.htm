The mountain is likely Mount Carmel, a significant location for prophetic activity, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a> with Elijah's confrontation with the prophets of Baal. This setting underscores the spiritual significance of the encounter. The woman is the Shunammite, who had previously shown hospitality to Elisha and was blessed with a son through his prophecy. Her journey to the mountain indicates urgency and desperation, reflecting her faith in Elisha's connection to God.<p><b>she clung to his feet</b><br>Clinging to someone's feet was a gesture of deep respect and supplication in ancient Near Eastern culture. It signifies the woman's desperation and her recognition of Elisha's authority and ability to intercede with God. This act parallels other biblical instances where individuals sought mercy or favor, such as the woman with the issue of blood touching Jesus' garment (<a href="/mark/5-27.htm">Mark 5:27-28</a>).<p><b>Gehazi came over to push her away</b><br>Gehazi, Elisha's servant, attempts to protect his master from what he perceives as an inappropriate or overwhelming approach. This reflects a common cultural practice where servants or disciples would manage access to their masters. Gehazi's action contrasts with Jesus' response to children being brought to Him in <a href="/matthew/19-14.htm">Matthew 19:14</a>, highlighting different approaches to accessibility and compassion.<p><b>but the man of God said, &#8220;Leave her alone</b><br>Elisha's command to Gehazi to leave the woman alone demonstrates his sensitivity to her distress and his understanding of the importance of compassion over protocol. This mirrors Jesus' actions in the New Testament, where He often prioritized individual needs over societal norms, emphasizing the value of each person.<p><b>for her soul is in deep distress</b><br>The phrase indicates profound emotional turmoil, suggesting a crisis beyond ordinary grief. The Hebrew word for "soul" (nephesh) encompasses the whole being, indicating that her distress affects her entire person. This aligns with biblical themes of God caring for the brokenhearted, as seen in <a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>.<p><b>and the LORD has hidden it from me and has not told me</b><br>Elisha acknowledges that God has not revealed the cause of the woman's distress to him, highlighting the prophet's reliance on divine revelation rather than personal insight. This moment underscores the mystery of God's ways and the limits of human understanding, even for prophets. It also reflects the biblical theme that God sometimes withholds information for His purposes, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shunammite_woman.htm">The Shunammite Woman</a></b><br>A woman of Shunem who showed great faith and hospitality to Elisha, the prophet.
