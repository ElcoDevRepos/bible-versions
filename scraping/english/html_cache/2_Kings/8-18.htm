The "ways of the kings of Israel" typically refer to the worship of Baal and other Canaanite deities, which was initiated by Jeroboam I and perpetuated by subsequent kings. This phrase indicates a departure from the Davidic tradition of worshiping Yahweh exclusively. The influence of Israel's practices on Judah highlights the political and religious entanglements between the two kingdoms during this period.<p><b>just as the house of Ahab had done</b><br>The house of Ahab is notorious for its promotion of Baal worship, largely due to Ahab's marriage to Jezebel, a Phoenician princess and ardent Baal worshiper. Ahab's reign is marked by significant opposition to the prophets of Yahweh, most notably Elijah. By aligning himself with the house of Ahab, Jehoram is seen as adopting these same corrupt practices, which were condemned by the prophets. This connection underscores the pervasive influence of Ahab's dynasty on the spiritual decline of both Israel and Judah.<p><b>For he married a daughter of Ahab</b><br>Jehoram's marriage to Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, was likely a political alliance intended to strengthen ties between Israel and Judah. However, this union brought the idolatrous practices of Ahab's house into Judah. Athaliah's influence is evident in the subsequent events in Judah, including her later usurpation of the throne and the promotion of Baal worship. This marriage serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of forming alliances that compromise spiritual integrity.<p><b>and did evil in the sight of the LORD</b><br>The phrase "did evil in the sight of the LORD" is a common biblical expression used to describe actions that are contrary to God's commandments and expectations. In Jehoram's case, this evil is primarily associated with idolatry and the abandonment of the covenantal faithfulness required of the Davidic kings. This evaluation reflects the Deuteronomic perspective, which emphasizes obedience to God's law as the standard for righteousness. Jehoram's actions are seen as a direct affront to the LORD, leading to divine judgment and consequences for the nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoram.htm">Jehoram (King of Judah)</a></b><br>The son of Jehoshaphat, who became king of Judah and followed the sinful ways of the house of Ahab.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_ahab.htm">House of Ahab</a></b><br>A royal family in the Northern Kingdom of Israel known for their idolatry and evil practices, particularly under King Ahab and Queen Jezebel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab's_daughter.htm">Ahab&#8217;s Daughter (Athaliah)</a></b><br>The wife of Jehoram, who influenced him to follow the idolatrous practices of her family.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Jehoram reigned as king.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is displeased with Jehoram's actions and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/influence_of_relationships.htm">Influence of Relationships</a></b><br>The people we associate with can significantly impact our spiritual walk.

That choice was not a minor detour but a conscious pattern&#8212;&#8220;ways&#8221; points to an ingrained lifestyle. Other examples show where those &#8220;ways&#8221; head: <a href="/1_kings/16-30.htm">1 Kings 16:30&#8211;33</a> traces Ahab&#8217;s introduction of Baal worship, and every king who copied him fell under judgment (<a href="/1_kings/22-52.htm">1 Kings 22:52</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-21.htm">2 Kings 17:21-23</a>). When Scripture states the fact, it is declaring literal history and an unchanging spiritual principle: follow a wrong model and you will reap the same results.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as the house of Ahab had done</b><p>The verse tightens the focus: Jehoram&#8217;s blueprint was Ahab&#8217;s family. God had already said of Ahab, &#8220;There was no one like Ahab, who sold himself to do evil in the sight of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/21-25.htm">1 Kings 21:25</a>). That household normalized Baal shrines, persecuted prophets (<a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>), and celebrated violence (<a href="/bsb/1_kings/21.htm">1 Kings 21</a>). By paralleling Jehoram with them, the text signals full-blown apostasy, not a lapse. The northern dynasty&#8217;s sins migrated south because one man admired and adopted them. Patterns of sin spread when they are admired, just as holiness spreads when it is honored (cf. <a href="/hebrews/13-7.htm">Hebrews 13:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For he married a daughter of Ahab</b><p>The hinge of the verse is the marriage alliance&#8212;Jehoram wed Athaliah, Ahab and Jezebel&#8217;s daughter (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-6.htm">2 Chronicles 21:6</a>; 22:10). Marriage is never merely political; it joins hearts, homes, and worship. <a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a> had warned that intermarriage with idolaters would &#8220;turn your sons away from following Me.&#8221; Centuries later the apostle would echo, &#8220;Do not be unequally yoked&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>); bad company really does corrupt good morals (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a>). Athaliah brought Baal devotion into Judah&#8217;s palace, and her influence lingered beyond Jehoram&#8212;she later seized the throne and almost wiped out David&#8217;s line (<a href="/2_kings/11-1.htm">2 Kings 11:1-3</a>). One covenant-breaking marriage opened the door to national calamity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and did evil in the sight of the LORD</b><p>The closing phrase is God&#8217;s verdict. People may label policies &#8220;progressive&#8221; or alliances &#8220;strategic,&#8221; but heaven&#8217;s court measures everything by the unchanging standard of His law. &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are in every place&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>), so He alone defines evil. Jehoram&#8217;s reign therefore triggered divine discipline: Edom revolted (<a href="/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20-22</a>), Libnah rebelled, and finally a terrifying illness struck Jehoram himself (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-12.htm">2 Chronicles 21:12-19</a>). The Lord&#8217;s assessment became tangible judgment, proving once again that He keeps His word both in blessing and in warning (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/8-18.htm">2 Kings 8:18</a> records more than a biographical footnote; it is a sober lesson in cause and effect. Jehoram copied Israel&#8217;s apostate kings, intentionally aligned with Ahab&#8217;s household through marriage, and the result was evil that drew God&#8217;s judgment on Judah and on himself. The verse underlines three timeless truths: (1) the examples we follow shape our destiny, (2) the relationships we enter can draw us either toward or away from the Lord, and (3) God sees, records, and responds to every choice. In a single sentence, Scripture traces the path from compromise to catastrophe&#8212;and calls every reader to choose a different path.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">In the way of the kings of Israel.</span>--This is further explained by the following clause, "As did the house of Ahab," or rather, <span class= "ital">to wit, as the house of Ahab acted, i.e.</span>, Jehoram, as son-in-law of Ahab and Jezebel, lent his countenance to the <span class= "ital">cultus</span> of the Tyrian Baal. Under the influence of his wife Athaliah, as it may be surmised, Jehoram slew his six brothers directly after his accession to the throne (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-4.htm" title="Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brothers with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.">2Chronicles 21:4</a>). In this connection the remarks of Michaelis are interesting: "In the reign of Jehoram falls the building of Carthage; Dido, her husband Sichaeus, her brother Pygmalion, king of Tyre, and murderer of Sichaeus. By marriage Tyre brought its then prevalent spirit, and a vast amount of evil,into the two Israelitish kingdoms." (The Syriac, Arabic, and Vulg. read "in the ways.") The reason why the details added in Chronicles are here omitted is to be found in the studied brevity of the compiler in the case of less important characters.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he introduced into Judah the Baal and Astarte worship, which Ahab had introduced into Israel from Phoenicia. (On the nature of this worship, see the ' Commentary on the First Book of Kings,' p. 374.) The "house of Ahab" maintained and spread the Baal-worship, wherever it had influence. Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, championed it in Israel (<a href="/1_kings/22-53.htm">1 Kings 22:53</a>); Jehoram, his brother, allowed its continuance (<a href="/2_kings/10-18.htm">2 Kings 10:18-28</a>); Jehoram of Judah was induced by his wife, Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab, to countenance it in Judaea; Athaliah, when she usurped the throne upon the death of her son Ahaziah, made it the state religion in that country. "Evil communications corrupt good manners." The alliance of the two separated kingdoms, concluded between Jehoshaphat and Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/22-2.htm">1 Kings 22:2-4</a>), had no tangible result beyond the introduction into Judah of the licentious and debasing superstition which had previously overspread the sister country. <span class="cmt_word">For the daughter of Ahab was his wife.</span> In ver. 26 Athaliah, the wife of Jehoram, is called "the daughter of Omri;" but by "daughter" in that place must be meant "descendant" or "granddaughter." Athaliah has been well called "a second Jezebel." <span class="cmt_word">And he did evil in the sight of the Lord.</span> The wicked actions of Jehoram are recorded at some length in Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-2.htm">2 Chronicles 21:2-4, 11-13</a>). Shortly after his accession he put to death his six brothers - Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Ahaziah (?), Michael, and Shephatiah - in order to "strengthen himself." At the same time, he caused many of the "princes of Israel" to be executed. Soon afterwards he "made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> to become idolaters), "and compelled Judah thereto." That the idolatry, which he introduced, was the Baal-worship is clear, both from the present passage and from <a href="/2_chronicles/21-13.htm">2 Chronicles 21:13</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/8-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And [Jehoram] walked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1436;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
