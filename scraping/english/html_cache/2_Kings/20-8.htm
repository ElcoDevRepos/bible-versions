This relationship is significant as it highlights the role of prophets in advising and guiding kings in ancient Israel. Isaiah, a major prophet, often served as a conduit for God's messages to the king. This interaction underscores the importance of seeking divine guidance through God's appointed messengers.<p><b>&#8220;What will be the sign</b><br>In biblical times, signs were often requested as confirmation of God's promises or actions. Hezekiah's request for a sign reflects a common practice in the Old Testament, where individuals sought tangible evidence of divine intervention. This mirrors other instances, such as Gideon's fleece in <a href="/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36-40</a>, where signs were sought to confirm God's will.<p><b>that the LORD will heal me</b><br>Hezekiah is seeking assurance of his healing from a life-threatening illness. This reflects the belief in God's power to heal and intervene in human affairs. Healing is a recurring theme in the Bible, often associated with faith and divine mercy. The request for healing also points to the personal relationship between Hezekiah and God, where the king feels comfortable seeking direct intervention.<p><b>and that I will go up to the house of the LORD</b><br>The "house of the LORD" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites. Hezekiah's desire to return to the temple signifies not only physical healing but also spiritual restoration and the ability to participate in communal worship. This reflects the importance of the temple as a place of God's presence and the center of religious life in Judah.<p><b>on the third day?&#8221;</b><br>The mention of the "third day" is significant in biblical typology, often symbolizing completeness and divine intervention. The third day is a recurring motif in Scripture, seen in events such as Jonah's deliverance from the fish (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>) and, most notably, the resurrection of Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>).
