His questioning of Gehazi, his servant, indicates a moment of divine insight and authority. Prophets in the Old Testament were known for their ability to discern truth and expose wrongdoing, as seen in other instances like Nathan confronting David (<a href="/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-7</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Did not my spirit go with you</b><br>This phrase suggests a supernatural awareness or discernment granted to Elisha by God. It reflects the close relationship between the prophet and God, where Elisha is able to perceive events beyond his physical presence. This mirrors the New Testament gift of discernment (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>) and foreshadows the omniscience of Christ (<a href="/john/1-48.htm">John 1:48</a>).<p><b>when the man got down from his chariot to meet you?</b><br>The man referred to is Naaman, a Syrian commander who was healed of leprosy by Elisha. The act of getting down from a chariot signifies respect and urgency. In ancient Near Eastern culture, chariots were symbols of power and status, and dismounting from one was a gesture of humility or deference.<p><b>Is this the time to accept money and clothing,</b><br>Elisha's rhetorical question highlights the inappropriateness of Gehazi's actions. Prophets were expected to serve without seeking personal gain, emphasizing reliance on God rather than material wealth. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus instructs His disciples to freely give as they have received (<a href="/matthew/10-8.htm">Matthew 10:8</a>).<p><b>olive groves and vineyards,</b><br>These items represent wealth and prosperity in ancient Israelite society. Olive oil and wine were staples of the economy and daily life, often used in trade and religious rituals. The mention of these goods underscores the gravity of Gehazi's greed and the temptation to prioritize earthly riches over spiritual integrity.<p><b>sheep and oxen,</b><br>Livestock were valuable assets in agrarian societies, symbolizing wealth and sustenance. The inclusion of sheep and oxen in Elisha's rebuke points to the comprehensive nature of Gehazi's covetousness, as he sought to amass a wide range of possessions.<p><b>menservants and maidservants?</b><br>Servants were considered part of one's household wealth and status. The desire for servants indicates a longing for power and control, contrasting with the servant leadership exemplified by Jesus Christ (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>). Elisha's question serves as a reminder of the prophet's role to serve God and others selflessly, without succumbing to the allure of power and materialism.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet in Israel, successor to Elijah, known for his miracles and strong stance on faithfulness to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gehazi.htm">Gehazi</a></b><br>Elisha's servant who succumbed to greed and deceit, leading to his downfall.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/naaman.htm">Naaman</a></b><br>A Syrian commander healed of leprosy by Elisha, who initially offered gifts in gratitude.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom where Elisha ministered, often struggling with idolatry and unfaithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/chariot.htm">Chariot</a></b><br>Represents Naaman's status and wealth, highlighting the temptation Gehazi faced.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_greed.htm">The Danger of Greed</a></b><br>Gehazi's account warns against the destructive power of greed, which can lead to spiritual and physical consequences.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_service.htm">Integrity in Service</a></b><br>As servants of God, maintaining integrity is crucial.

Elisha opens with a probing question, not because he lacks information but to draw Gehazi into confession&#8212;similar to the Lord&#8217;s &#8220;Where are you?&#8221; to Adam in <a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a> and Nathan&#8217;s question to David in <a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>.

Just as Peter knew Ananias and Sapphira&#8217;s deception by the Spirit (<a href="/acts/5-3.htm">Acts 5:3&#8211;4</a>), Elisha knows Gehazi&#8217;s movements. This underscores God&#8217;s omniscience: &#8220;Nothing in all creation is hidden from God&#8217;s sight&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When the man got down from his chariot to meet you</b><p>Elisha recounts the exact moment Naaman halted his chariot, a detail Gehazi thought concealed. Like Elisha, Jesus described Nathanael&#8217;s secret location under the fig tree (<a href="/john/1-48.htm">John 1:48</a>). The servant learns that secret sin is never truly secret (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is this the time</b><p>Timing matters in obedience. Elisha had just refused Naaman&#8217;s reward to spotlight God&#8217;s free grace (<a href="/2_kings/5-15.htm">2 Kings 5:15&#8211;16</a>). By seizing the moment for personal gain, Gehazi distorted that testimony. <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a> reminds us there is &#8220;a time for every purpose,&#8221; but this was not the time for profit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To accept money and clothing, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and oxen, menservants and maidservants?</b><p>Elisha piles up treasures Gehazi hoped to acquire, exposing the covetous chain reaction:<p>&#8226; Money and clothing (cf. <a href="/joshua/7-21.htm">Joshua 7:21</a>)<p>&#8226; Land and produce&#8212;olive groves, vineyards (<a href="/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a>)<p>&#8226; Livestock (<a href="/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a>)<p>&#8226; Even the ambition to own servants (<a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39&#8211;46</a>)<p>The list reveals how greed escalates. Scripture warns, &#8220;The love of money is a root of all kinds of evil&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>). Gehazi&#8217;s grab for short-term wealth forfeited lasting ministry, much like Judas trading fellowship with Christ for silver (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14&#8211;15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/5-26.htm">2 Kings 5:26</a> shows Elisha exposing Gehazi&#8217;s hidden greed through Spirit-given knowledge, stressing God&#8217;s omniscience, the sacred timing of divine generosity, and the danger of escalating covetousness. The verse teaches that no sin is concealed, God&#8217;s grace must remain untainted by selfish gain, and unchecked desire can derail a servant&#8217;s calling.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Went not mine heart . . . meet thee?</span>--Rather, Nor did my heart (i.e., consciousness) go away, when a man turned (and alighted) from his chariot to meet thee. The prophet, in severe irony, adopts Gehazi's own phrase: Maurer, "Non abierat animus meus;" "I was there in spirit, and witnessed everything." The sentence has given the commentators much trouble. (See the elaborate Note in Thenius. We might have expected <span class= "ital">w?lo</span>, and <span class= "ital">w</span> may have been omitted, owing to the preceding <span class= "ital">w</span>; but it is not absolutely necessary.)

The LXX., pointing the Hebrew differently, reads: <span class= "greekheb">??? ??? ?????? ?? ???????? ??? ??? ?????? ?? ?????? ???</span><span class= "ital">.</span> ("And now thou receivedst the money," &c.). So also the Vulg. and Arabic, but not the Targum and Syriac. B&#8221;ttcher, retaining the interrogative particle of the Hebrew, adopts this: "Didst thou then take the money?" &c. But the Masoretic pointing appears to be much more suitable. The prophet's question comes to this: "Was that above all others a proper occasion for yielding to your desire of gain, when you were dealing with a heathen? Ought you not to have been studiously disinterested in your behaviour to such an one, that he might learn not to confound the prophets of Jehovah with the mercenary diviners and soothsayers of the false gods?" The prophet's disciple is bound, like his master, to seek, not worldly power, but spiritual; for the time is one of ardent struggle against the encroachments of paganism.<p><span class= "bld">And oliveyards . . . maidservants</span>?--The prophet develops Gehazi's object in asking for the money: he wished to purchase lands, and live stock, and slaves--whatever constituted the material wealth of the time. The Targum inserts the explanatory: "And thou thoughtest in thy heart to purchase oliveyards," &c. So Vulg.: "ut emas oliveta."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee</span>? There is no "with thee" in the original; and the words have been taken in quite a different sense. Ewald regards <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, "my heart," as designating Gehazi, and meaning "my loved one, my favorite disciple." "Thou hast denied that thou wentest any whither; but did not my favorite disciple in truth go forth, when the man turned again from his chariot, as Naaman did?" (ver. 21). But no parallel instance can be adduced of any such use of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>, which is altogether too strong a term to be applied to a mere favorite servant. The irony, moreover, of the term under the circumstances would be too great. Maurer's interpretation of <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> by "my prophetic power" (my prophetic power had not departed from me) is no better, since it requires <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5da;</span> to be taken in two different senses in the two most closely connected clauses of vers. 25 and 26. Altogether, our version would seem to be the best rendering that has been suggested. It accords with the Septuagint, with Theodoret, and with the Vulgate; and it gives a satisfactory sense: "Did not my spirit go forth with thee when thou wentest forth, etc.? Was I not present in spirit during the whole transaction?" <span class="cmt_word">When the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee?</span> (see ver. 21). <span class="cmt_word">Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive yards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?</span> The prophet follows Gehazi's thoughts, which had been to purchase, with the money obtained from Naaman, olive yards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, etc.; and asks - Was this a time for such proceedings? Keil well explains, "Was this the time, when so many hypocrites pretend to be prophets from selfishness and avarice, and bring the prophetic office into contempt with unbelievers, for a servant of the true God to take money and goods from a non-Israelite... that he might acquire property and luxury for himself?" It was evidently a most unfit time. As Thenius says, "In any other case better than in this mightest thou have yielded to thy desire for gold and goods." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/5-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But Elisha questioned him,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
