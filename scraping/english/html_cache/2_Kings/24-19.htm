His reign was marked by political instability and spiritual decline. The phrase "did evil in the sight of the LORD" is a recurring theme in the books of Kings, indicating a failure to adhere to the covenantal laws given to Israel. Zedekiah's actions included idolatry and rebellion against Babylon, which were contrary to the prophetic warnings given by Jeremiah. This phrase underscores the moral and spiritual failures that led to Judah's downfall.<p><b>just as Jehoiakim had done</b><br>Jehoiakim, Zedekiah's predecessor and brother, also "did evil in the sight of the LORD." His reign was characterized by heavy taxation, idolatry, and disregard for prophetic messages, notably burning the scroll of Jeremiah. The comparison to Jehoiakim highlights a pattern of disobedience and rebellion against God among the Judean kings. This continuity of sinfulness among the leaders of Judah contributed to the nation's eventual conquest and exile by Babylon. The phrase serves as a reminder of the consequences of persistent disobedience to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned during a tumultuous period leading to the Babylonian exile.

Installed by Nebuchadnezzar, he ruled for eleven turbulent years. Though he was Josiah&#8217;s son, he abandoned his father&#8217;s reforms, choosing political maneuvering and self-interest over covenant faithfulness (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-11.htm">2 Chronicles 36:11</a>). Jeremiah repeatedly warned him to submit to Babylon as God&#8217;s discipline (<a href="/jeremiah/27-12.htm">Jeremiah 27:12&#8211;15</a>), but he refused. His name sits at the doorstep of Judah&#8217;s collapse, reminding us that lineage and position never guarantee obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>did evil</b><p>Scripture sums up his reign in three stark words: &#8220;did evil.&#8221; What did that look like?<p>&#8226; Rejected prophetic counsel&#8212;tore up Jeremiah&#8217;s letters, imprisoned him, and silenced truth (<a href="/jeremiah/38-6.htm">Jeremiah 38:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Continued idolatry and high-place worship that Josiah had destroyed (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-12.htm">2 Chronicles 36:12&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Allowed oppression and injustice, reneging on a covenant to free Hebrew slaves (<a href="/jeremiah/34-8.htm">Jeremiah 34:8&#8211;11</a>).<p>Like his predecessors, Zedekiah measured policies by political advantage, not by God&#8217;s law. <a href="/2_chronicles/36-12.htm">2 Chronicles 36:12</a> underscores that he &#8220;did not humble himself before the prophet Jeremiah who spoke from the mouth of the LORD.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the sight of the LORD</b><p>The phrase signals God&#8217;s perfect awareness and holy standard. &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are in every place, watching the wicked and the good&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>). Kings, priests, and commoners all live before that all-seeing gaze (<a href="/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13&#8211;15</a>). Zedekiah may have hidden schemes from Babylon or courtiers, but nothing escaped the One who &#8220;judges the thoughts and intentions of the heart&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). The covenant spelled out blessings for obedience and curses for rebellion (<a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>); Zedekiah stood on the curse-side of that ledger.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>just as Jehoiakim had done</b><p>Jehoiakim, Zedekiah&#8217;s brother, reigned eleven years earlier and set the pattern of rebellion (<a href="/2_kings/23-36.htm">2 Kings 23:36&#8211;37</a>). His hallmark sins included:<p>&#8226; Heavy taxation to pay tribute, burdening the people (<a href="/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33&#8211;35</a>).<p>&#8226; Burning Jeremiah&#8217;s scroll, despising God&#8217;s word (<a href="/jeremiah/36-20.htm">Jeremiah 36:20&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; Murdering the prophet Uriah, shedding innocent blood (<a href="/jeremiah/26-20.htm">Jeremiah 26:20&#8211;24</a>).<p>Zedekiah copied the same script instead of learning from history. The repetition highlights a generational hardening that hastened divine judgment&#8212;Babylon&#8217;s siege, Jerusalem&#8217;s fall, and temple destruction (<a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1&#8211;10</a>). God&#8217;s patience with Judah had limits; persistent imitation of evil ensured the same outcome.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/24-19.htm">2 Kings 24:19</a> diagnoses Zedekiah&#8217;s reign in one sentence: he followed the same sinful path as Jehoiakim, under the penetrating gaze of the LORD. The verse reminds us that God sees, evaluates, and ultimately judges rulers and nations. Imitating past sin guarantees repeating past consequences, while true humility and obedience remain the only way to avert disaster.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">THE REIGN OF ZEDEKIAH, the last KING OF JUDAH</span> (<a href="/2_kings/24-17.htm" title="And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.">2Kings 24:17</a> to <a href="/2_kings/25-7.htm" title="And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass, and carried him to Babylon.">2Kings 25:7</a>; comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/36-11.htm" title="Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 36:11</a> <span class= "ital">seq.;</span> Jeremiah 52).<p>This section and the parallel in Jeremiah appear to have been derived from the same historical work.

The contemporary state of religion is vividly reflected in the pages of Ezekiel (2Kings viii--11); who, moreover, denounces Zedekiah's breach of faith with the king of Babylon (<a href="/context/ezekiel/17-11.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 17:11-21</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</span> Keil says, "His attitude towards the Lord exactly resembled that of his brother Jehoiakim, except that Zedekiah does not appear to have possessed so much energy for that which was evil." He allowed the people to continue their "pollutions" and" abominations" (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-14.htm">2 Chronicles 36:14</a>). He let the "princes" have their way, and do whatever they pleased (<a href="/jeremiah/38-5.htm">Jeremiah 38:5</a>), contenting himself with sometimes outwitting them, and counteracting their proceeding (<a href="/jeremiah/38-14.htm">Jeremiah 38:14-28</a>). He fell into the old error of "putting trust in Egypt" (<a href="/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5-7</a>), and made an alliance with Apries (Pharaoh-Hophra), which was an act of rebellion, at once against God and against his Babylonian suzerain. He was, upon the whole, rather weak than wicked; but his weakness was as ruinous to his country as active wickedness would have been. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/24-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And [Zedekiah] did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
