The servant's role highlights the presence of informants or advisors in royal courts, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern cultures. This setting underscores the tension between Aram and Israel during this period.<p><b>&#8220;No one, my lord the king.</b><br>The servant assures the king that there is no traitor among them. This reflects the loyalty expected in royal courts and the high stakes of espionage and intelligence in ancient warfare. The phrase "my lord the king" shows the servant's respect and submission to the king's authority, a common cultural practice in addressing royalty.<p><b>For Elisha, the prophet in Israel,</b><br>Elisha is identified as a prophet, a significant figure in Israel who succeeded Elijah. Prophets in Israel were seen as God's mouthpieces, often involved in political and military matters. Elisha's role as a prophet is crucial, as he is depicted as having divine insight, which is a recurring theme in his ministry. His presence in Israel signifies God's ongoing communication and intervention in the nation's affairs.<p><b>tells the king of Israel</b><br>This indicates that Elisha has a direct line of communication with the king of Israel, likely Jehoram at this time. The relationship between prophets and kings in Israel was complex, often involving guidance, rebuke, and support. Elisha's ability to inform the king of Aram's plans demonstrates the divine favor and protection over Israel, as well as the prophet's influence in political matters.<p><b>the very words you speak in your bedroom.&#8221;</b><br>This hyperbolic expression emphasizes Elisha's prophetic insight, suggesting that nothing is hidden from him, even the most private conversations. It underscores the belief in God's omniscience and the power of prophecy. The mention of the "bedroom" symbolizes the most intimate and secretive of settings, highlighting the extent of divine revelation. This phrase also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the futility of opposing His will, as seen in other biblical narratives where God reveals hidden things to His prophets (e.g., <a href="/daniel/2-22.htm">Daniel 2:22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet in Israel known for his powerful miracles and close relationship with God.
