His leadership was crucial in the overthrow of Queen Athaliah, who had usurped the throne. The "commanders of hundreds" refers to military leaders responsible for groups of soldiers, indicating a well-organized military structure. This phrase highlights the collaboration between religious and military leadership, a common theme in Israel's history where priests often played significant roles in national affairs (e.g., Samuel in <a href="/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9-13</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Bring her out between the ranks, and put to the sword anyone who follows her.&#8221;</b><br>Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, had seized power in Judah after the death of her son, King Ahaziah. Her reign was marked by idolatry and violence, including the massacre of the royal family. Jehoiada's command to "bring her out" signifies a strategic move to remove her from the temple, preserving its sanctity. The instruction to "put to the sword anyone who follows her" underscores the seriousness of purging idolatry and rebellion from the nation, reflecting the Deuteronomic law's emphasis on eradicating evil (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5</a>).<p><b>For the priest had said, &#8220;She must not be put to death in the house of the LORD.&#8221;</b><br>The temple was considered a sacred space, and executing someone within its confines would defile it. This reflects the high regard for the holiness of the temple, a central theme in the Old Testament (<a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). Jehoiada's insistence on maintaining the temple's sanctity aligns with the broader biblical principle of separating the sacred from the profane. This action also prefigures the New Testament's emphasis on the purity of God's dwelling place, now understood as the body of believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16-17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiada_the_priest.htm">Jehoiada the Priest</a></b><br>A key religious leader who played a crucial role in the preservation of the Davidic line and the overthrow of Queen Athaliah.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/commanders_of_hundreds.htm">Commanders of Hundreds</a></b><br>Military leaders who were given orders by Jehoiada to execute Athaliah's followers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/athaliah.htm">Athaliah</a></b><br>The queen who usurped the throne of Judah and attempted to destroy the royal line of David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD</a></b><br>The temple in Jerusalem, a sacred place where Jehoiada insisted that Athaliah should not be executed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_army.htm">The Army</a></b><br>The military force that supported Jehoiada's plan to restore the rightful king to the throne.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_sacred_spaces.htm">Respect for Sacred Spaces</a></b><br>Jehoiada's insistence that Athaliah not be executed in the temple underscores the importance of maintaining the sanctity of places dedicated to God.
