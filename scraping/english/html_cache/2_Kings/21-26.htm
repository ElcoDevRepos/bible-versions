In ancient Israelite culture, burial practices were significant, often reflecting one's status and legacy. Amon's burial in his own tomb suggests a continuation of royal customs, despite his short and troubled reign. The practice of preparing a personal tomb was common among kings, indicating a desire for a lasting legacy and a place of honor in death.<p><b>in the garden of Uzza,</b><br>The garden of Uzza is mentioned as the burial site for both Amon and his father, Manasseh. This location is somewhat unusual, as royal burials typically took place in the City of David. The garden of Uzza may have been a private or royal garden, possibly named after a notable figure or family. Its mention highlights a deviation from traditional burial sites, which could reflect the spiritual and political turmoil during their reigns. The choice of burial location might also indicate a lack of favor with the religious establishment or a personal preference by the king.<p><b>and his son Josiah reigned in his place.</b><br>Josiah's ascension to the throne marks a significant turning point in Judah's history. Unlike his father Amon and grandfather Manasseh, Josiah is remembered as a reformer king who sought to restore the worship of Yahweh and rid the nation of idolatry. His reign is characterized by a return to the covenantal faithfulness outlined in the Law of Moses. Josiah's reforms are detailed in later chapters, where he is credited with significant religious and cultural changes. His reign fulfills prophecies concerning the house of David and serves as a type of Christ, foreshadowing the ultimate restoration and righteousness brought by Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amon.htm">Amon</a></b><br>The king of Judah who was assassinated by his own officials.

Unlike his godly grandfather Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/20-21.htm">2 Kings 20:21</a>), Amon&#8217;s burial follows divine judgment for persistent idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/21-22.htm">2 Kings 21:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; The brevity echoes the pattern in 1 Kings, where wicked kings receive minimal honor in death (<a href="/1_kings/16-6.htm">1 Kings 16:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in his tomb</b><p>&#8226; Amon had a personal tomb prepared, indicating forethought yet offering no spiritual security. King Asa likewise &#8220;buried him in the tomb that he had cut out for himself&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-14.htm">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Royal tombs usually lay in the City of David; Amon&#8217;s separate tomb hints at diminished honor.
