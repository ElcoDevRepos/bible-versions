Mediums and spiritists were believed to communicate with the dead or spirits, practices that were common in surrounding pagan cultures but strictly prohibited for the Israelites. This removal signifies a return to covenant faithfulness and a rejection of syncretism.<p><b>the household gods and idols</b><br>Household gods, or "teraphim," were small idols often kept in homes for protection or divination. Their presence indicates the extent of idolatry that had infiltrated Judah. Josiah's removal of these idols aligns with the first and second commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>), emphasizing the exclusive worship of Yahweh. This act also echoes the reforms of earlier kings like Hezekiah, who similarly sought to eliminate idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4</a>).<p><b>and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem</b><br>The term "abominations" refers to practices and objects detestable to God, often associated with idolatry and pagan worship. The mention of both Judah and Jerusalem highlights the widespread nature of these practices, even reaching the heart of the nation's religious life. Josiah's reforms were comprehensive, targeting both rural and urban areas, and demonstrate his zeal for spiritual renewal.<p><b>He did this to carry out the words of the law</b><br>Josiah's actions were motivated by a desire to align the nation's practices with the covenantal stipulations found in the Law of Moses. This reflects a theocratic understanding of kingship, where the king is subject to God's law. The reforms were not merely political but deeply spiritual, aiming to restore the nation's relationship with God.<p><b>written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had found in the house of the LORD</b><br>The discovery of the book, likely a form of Deuteronomy, was a pivotal moment in Josiah's reign. It underscores the importance of Scripture in guiding the community's faith and practice. Hilkiah's role as a priest highlights the collaboration between religious and political leaders in enacting reform. This event also serves as a reminder of the power of God's Word to convict and inspire change, a theme echoed in the New Testament (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah who initiated religious reforms to restore the worship of Yahweh and eliminate idolatry from the land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/mediums_and_spiritists.htm">Mediums and Spiritists</a></b><br>Individuals who practiced divination and sought to communicate with the dead, which was forbidden by the Law of Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/household_gods_and_idols.htm">Household Gods and Idols</a></b><br>Objects of worship that represented false deities, contrary to the worship of the one true God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah_and_jerusalem.htm">Judah and Jerusalem</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel and its capital, where Josiah implemented his reforms.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hilkiah_the_priest.htm">Hilkiah the Priest</a></b><br>The high priest who discovered the Book of the Law in the temple, prompting Josiah's reforms.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_god's_word.htm">Commitment to God's Word</a></b><br>Josiah's actions were driven by his desire to align with the Scriptures.

It signals that what follows is not an isolated act but part of a larger, wholehearted return to covenant faithfulness, echoing earlier revival movements such as those under Hezekiah (2 Chron 29:3-11).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Josiah removed the mediums and spiritists</b><p>&#8226; Scripture consistently condemns occult practices (<a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>).<p>&#8226; By driving out &#8220;the mediums and spiritists,&#8221; Josiah protects the nation from voices that compete with the revealed word of God.<p>&#8226; This move mirrors Saul&#8217;s earlier purge (<a href="/1_samuel/28-3.htm">1 Samuel 28:3</a>) but, unlike Saul, Josiah does not later turn back to the very practices he banned.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the household gods and idols</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Household gods&#8221; (teraphim) were small images kept for personal blessing or divination (<a href="/genesis/31-19.htm">Genesis 31:19</a>; <a href="/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Josiah&#8217;s destruction of private idols complements his earlier removal of public idols (<a href="/2_kings/23-6.htm">2 Kings 23:6</a>).<p>&#8226; His thoroughness affirms the first commandment: &#8220;You shall have no other gods before Me&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem</b><p>&#8226; The word &#8220;abominations&#8221; gathers every form of detestable worship: high-place altars, Asherah poles, male cult prostitutes (<a href="/2_kings/23-7.htm">2 Kings 23:7-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Removing them restores the land&#8217;s holiness, aligning with <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-4</a>, which commands Israel to &#8220;destroy completely all the high places.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The reforms cover both countryside (&#8220;the land of Judah&#8221;) and capital (&#8220;Jerusalem&#8221;), underscoring that sin&#8217;s reach had been comprehensive and so must be repentance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He did this to carry out the words of the law</b><p>&#8226; Josiah&#8217;s motive is obedience, not political advantage.

The superstition was, apparently, Babylonian (<a href="/ezekiel/21-21.htm">Ezekiel 21:21</a>), and brought from Ur of the Chaldees by the family of Abraham.
