Jehoshaphat, known for his piety and reforms, often sought to align with Israel despite its apostasy. This reflects the complex political landscape of the time, where alliances were crucial for survival against common enemies. The communication between the two kings underscores the importance of unity among the tribes of Israel, even when divided into two kingdoms.<p><b>The king of Moab has rebelled against me:</b><br>Moab, located east of the Dead Sea, was a frequent adversary of Israel. The rebellion likely involved Moab's refusal to pay tribute, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern politics. This rebellion can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/16.htm">Isaiah 16</a>, where Moab's downfall is foretold. Historically, Moab had been subjugated by Israel since the time of David, and this rebellion signifies a shift in power dynamics.<p><b>Will you go with me to fight against Moab?:</b><br>This request for military assistance indicates the seriousness of the Moabite rebellion. It also reflects the interdependence of the Israelite and Judean kingdoms despite their religious and political differences. The question posed by the king of Israel to Jehoshaphat is reminiscent of the alliances formed in earlier biblical narratives, such as the coalition of kings in <a href="/genesis/14.htm">Genesis 14</a>.<p><b>I will go,</b><br>Jehoshaphat's immediate agreement to assist Israel demonstrates his commitment to the alliance and his willingness to support his fellow Israelites. This response can be seen as an act of faith and solidarity, reflecting the biblical principle of unity among God's people. It also highlights Jehoshaphat's character as a king who seeks peace and cooperation.<p><b>I am as you are, my people are your people, and my horses are your horses:</b><br>This declaration of unity emphasizes the shared heritage and mutual support between the two kingdoms. It echoes the covenantal language found in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16</a>, where Ruth pledges loyalty to Naomi. The mention of horses, a symbol of military strength, underscores the commitment to a joint military effort. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate unity of God's people under the reign of Christ, who breaks down divisions and unites all believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1.

The verse reveals:<p>&#8226; the political fragility of Israel after Ahab,<p>&#8226; Moab&#8217;s opportunistic revolt,<p>&#8226; a repeated pattern of Jehoshaphat aligning with ungodly northern kings, and<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereign orchestration of events that will later display His power in the desert campaign.<p>The passage calls readers to weigh earthly alliances against unwavering loyalty to the LORD, who faithfully governs both kings and kingdoms.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Wilt thou go.</span>--So Ahab asks Jehoshaphat in <a href="/1_kings/22-4.htm" title="And he said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to battle to Ramothgilead?

He had joined Ahab in his attack on the Syrians at Ramoth-Gilead (<a href="/1_kings/22-4.htm">1 Kings 22:4-36</a>), and had thereby incurred the rebuke of Jehu the son of Hanani (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>). This, however, had net prevented him from continuing his friendship with the Israelite royal house; he "joined himself with Ahaziah" (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-35.htm">2 Chronicles 20:35</a>), Ahab's successor, and though their combined naval expedition met with disaster (<a href="/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>), yet he still maintained amicable relations with the Israelite court. Jehoram, therefore, confidently sought his active help when he made up his mind to engage in a war with Moab. <span class="cmt_word">The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle!

The words were probably a common formula expressive of willingness to enter into the closest possible alliance. Jehoshaphat, it appears from <a href="/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-35</a>, had, a little before this, been himself attacked by the united forces of Moab and Ammon, and brought into a peril from which he was only delivered by miracle.
