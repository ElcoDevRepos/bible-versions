Tirzah was an earlier capital of the northern kingdom of Israel before Samaria. This move indicates a strategic shift, as Samaria was the political and administrative center of the northern kingdom at this time. The act of "going up" suggests a deliberate and possibly aggressive move, as Samaria was located on a hill, making it a fortified city. This phrase highlights the political instability and frequent changes in leadership during this period, reflecting the broader theme of Israel's disobedience and the resulting chaos.<p><b>struck down and killed Shallum son of Jabesh</b><br>The assassination of Shallum by Menahem is a continuation of the violent power struggles that characterized the northern kingdom. Shallum had himself seized the throne by killing King Zechariah, indicating a cycle of violence and betrayal. This act of regicide was not uncommon in the history of Israel and Judah, where kings often came to power through conspiracy and murder. The instability of the monarchy during this time is a reflection of the spiritual decline of Israel, as the people and their leaders turned away from God's commandments.<p><b>and reigned in his place</b><br>Menahem's reign, which lasted ten years, is marked by brutality and oppression, as further detailed in the subsequent verses. His rule is a continuation of the pattern of kings who did evil in the sight of the Lord, failing to lead the people back to covenant faithfulness. This phrase underscores the temporary and often illegitimate nature of power when it is seized through violence and without divine sanction. Menahem's reign is a reminder of the consequences of Israel's departure from God's ways, leading to internal strife and eventual judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/menahem_son_of_gadi.htm">Menahem son of Gadi</a></b><br>Menahem is the central figure in this verse, who becomes king by force.
