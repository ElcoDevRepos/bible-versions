The anger of the LORD is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often resulting from Israel's failure to uphold the covenant established at Sinai (Exodus 19-24). The burning anger signifies not just displeasure but an active response to sin, reflecting God's holiness and justice. This divine anger is not arbitrary but a consequence of Israel's actions, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/29-24.htm">Deuteronomy 29:24-28</a>, where the covenant curses are outlined.<p><b>and He delivered them continually into the hands of Hazael king of Aram</b><br>The phrase "delivered them continually" suggests a prolonged period of subjugation and suffering. Hazael, king of Aram (modern-day Syria), was a formidable adversary of Israel. His rise to power was foretold by the prophet Elisha in <a href="/2_kings/8-12.htm">2 Kings 8:12-13</a>, indicating God's sovereignty over nations and leaders. The historical context shows that Hazael's campaigns against Israel were part of a broader geopolitical struggle in the region, with Aram frequently clashing with Israel over territory and influence. This delivery into Hazael's hands is a fulfillment of the covenant curses for disobedience (<a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>).<p><b>and his son Ben-hadad</b><br>Ben-hadad, the son of Hazael, continued his father's aggressive policies against Israel. The name Ben-hadad was a dynastic title used by several Aramean kings, similar to the use of "Pharaoh" in Egypt. This continuity of oppression under both Hazael and Ben-hadad underscores the severity of Israel's plight and the enduring consequences of their sin. The historical records, including the Assyrian inscriptions, corroborate the existence of these kings and their military campaigns, providing archaeological evidence of the biblical narrative. The ongoing conflict with Aram serves as a backdrop for God's eventual deliverance of Israel, highlighting His mercy and faithfulness despite their unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whose anger is kindled against His people due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, which is experiencing God's judgment because of their continued sin and rebellion.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hazael.htm">Hazael</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria), who becomes an instrument of God's judgment against Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hadad.htm">Ben-hadad</a></b><br>The son of Hazael, who continues his father's role in oppressing Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/aram.htm">Aram (Syria)</a></b><br>The nation used by God to discipline Israel, highlighting the geopolitical dynamics of the time.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_righteous_anger.htm">God's Righteous Anger</a></b><br>God's anger is not arbitrary but is a response to sin and rebellion.

It is perhaps against the former interpretation that Hazael appears to have outlived Jehoahaz (vers. 22-24); but Ben-hadad may have warred against him as his father's general (ver. 25) during his father's lifetime. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/13-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the anger</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1445;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ap&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_639.htm">Strong's 639: </a> </span><span class="str2">The nose, nostril, the face, a person, ire</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">burned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#183;&#7717;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
