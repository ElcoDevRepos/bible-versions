The "king of Assyria" refers to Shalmaneser V, who reigned from 727 to 722 BC. Assyria was a dominant empire, and its kings were known for their military prowess and expansionist policies. The term "discovered" implies espionage or intelligence gathering, common practices in ancient Near Eastern politics. Conspiracy against a suzerain was a serious offense, often leading to severe repercussions.<p><b>to send envoys to King So of Egypt</b><br>King So is likely a reference to Osorkon IV, a lesser-known pharaoh of Egypt's 22nd Dynasty. Egypt, though weakened, was still seen as a potential ally against Assyrian dominance. Sending envoys indicates a diplomatic effort to form an alliance, a common strategy for smaller states seeking to resist larger empires. This act of seeking Egyptian support reflects Israel's desperation and the geopolitical dynamics of the region, where Egypt and Assyria were often in opposition.<p><b>and that he had not paid tribute to the king of Assyria as in previous years</b><br>Tribute was a form of taxation imposed by a dominant power on a vassal state, symbolizing submission and ensuring protection. Hoshea's failure to pay tribute was a direct violation of his obligations, signaling rebellion. This act of defiance was not just political but also had religious implications, as it demonstrated a lack of trust in God's provision and protection, contrasting with the covenantal faithfulness expected of Israel.<p><b>Therefore the king of Assyria arrested Hoshea and put him in prison</b><br>The arrest and imprisonment of Hoshea marked the end of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. Assyrian kings were known for their harsh treatment of rebellious vassals, often using imprisonment as a means to assert control and deter further insubordination. This event led to the Assyrian conquest of Samaria and the subsequent exile of the Israelites, fulfilling prophecies of judgment due to Israel's persistent idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness. The fall of Israel serves as a somber reminder of the consequences of turning away from God, a theme echoed throughout the prophetic literature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hoshea.htm">Hoshea</a></b><br>The last king of Israel, who reigned during a tumultuous period marked by political instability and idolatry.

Sargon calls him "prince," or "ruler,; (<span class= "ital">shiltan</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> rather than "king" of Egypt; and it appears that at this time Lower Egypt was divided among a number of petty principalities, whose recognition of any central authority was very uncertain--a fact which rendered an Egyptian alliance of little value to Israel. (See Isaiah 19, 20) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the King of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So, King of Egypt.</span> We learn from the Prophet Hosea that the expediency of calling in Egypt as a counterpoise to Assyria had long been in the thoughts of those who directed the policy of the Israelite state (see <a href="/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>; <a href="/hosea/12-1.htm">Hosea 12:1</a>, etc.). Now at last the plunge was taken. An Ethiopian dynasty of some strength and vigor had possession of Egypt, and held its court during some part of the year at Memphis (<a href="/hosea/9-6.htm">Hosea 9:6</a>). The king who occupied the throne was called Shabak or Shebek - a name which the Greeks represented by Sabakos or Sevechus, and the Hebrews by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>. (The original vocalization of this word was probably <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5d5;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">Seveh</span>; but in later times this vocalization was lost, and the Masorites pointed the word as <span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5d0;</span>, <span class="accented">Soh</span> or So). The Assyrians knew the king as Sibakhi, and contended with him under Sargon. Hoshea now sent an embassy to this monarch's court, requesting his alliance and his support against the great Asiatic power by which the existence of all the petty states of Western Asia was threatened. Shalmaneser was at the time endeavoring to capture Tyro, and Hoshea might reasonably fear that, when Tyre was taken, his own turn would come. It is not clear how Shabak received Hoshea's overtures; but we may, perhaps, assume that it was with favor, since otherwise Hoshea would scarcely have ventured to withhold his tribute, as he seems to have done. It must have been in reliance on "the strength of Egypt" that he ventured to brave the anger of Assyria. <span class="cmt_word">And brought no present</span> - or, <span class="accented">sent no tribute - <span class="cmt_word"></span>to the King of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the King of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.</span> The ultimate result is mentioned at once, before the steps by which it was accomplished are related. Shalmaneser did not "summon Hoshea before his presence to listen to his explanations," and then, "as soon as he came, take him prisoner, put him in chains, and imprison him" (as Ewald thinks), but simply declared war, invaded Hoshea's country, besieged him in his capital, and ultimately, when he surrendered, consigned him to a prison, as Nebuchadnezzar afterwards did Jehoiachin (<a href="/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>; <a href="/2_kings/25-27.htm">2 Kings 25:27</a>). Otherwise Hoshea's reign would have come to an end in his sixth or seventh, and not in his ninth year. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/17-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1469;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Assyria</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1448;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#353;&#183;&#353;&#363;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_804.htm">Strong's 804: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ashshur</span><br /><br /><span class="word">discovered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1488;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yim&#183;&#7779;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
