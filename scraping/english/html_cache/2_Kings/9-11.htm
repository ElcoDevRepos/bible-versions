This event marks a significant turning point in Israel's history, as Jehu is chosen to execute judgment on the house of Ahab. The "servants of his master" refers to the other military officers serving under King Joram, the current king of Israel. This setting highlights the tension and secrecy surrounding Jehu's anointing, as it was a divine appointment that would lead to a dramatic shift in power.<p><b>they asked, &#8220;Is everything all right?</b><br>The question posed by the servants indicates their concern and curiosity about the unusual visit from the prophet. In the ancient Near Eastern context, unexpected visits from prophets often signaled important or troubling news. The phrase reflects the anxiety and anticipation among the officers, as they sense that something significant has occurred.<p><b>Why did this madman come to you?&#8221;</b><br>The term "madman" reflects the perception of prophets in that era. Prophets were often seen as eccentric or unpredictable due to their intense spiritual experiences and messages from God. This perception is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a>, where prophets are called "fools" and "madmen." The servants' question underscores their skepticism and possible disdain for the prophetic message, which was not uncommon in a culture that often resisted divine warnings.<p><b>&#8220;You know his kind and their babble,&#8221; he replied.</b><br>Jehu's response is dismissive, suggesting that he is downplaying the significance of the prophet's visit to avoid arousing suspicion or alarm among the officers. The term "babble" implies that prophetic messages were sometimes viewed as incoherent or irrelevant by those who did not understand or accept their divine origin. This response also serves to protect the secrecy of his anointing until the right moment to reveal his divine mission. Jehu's strategic handling of the situation reflects his cunning and leadership qualities, which would soon be demonstrated in his decisive actions against the house of Ahab.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>A commander in the army of Israel, anointed by a prophet to become king and tasked with eradicating the house of Ahab.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants_of_jehu's_master.htm">Servants of Jehu's Master</a></b><br>Fellow officers or soldiers under Jehu's command, questioning the unusual visit of the prophet.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_madman.htm">The Madman</a></b><br>Refers to the prophet sent by Elisha to anoint Jehu as king.
