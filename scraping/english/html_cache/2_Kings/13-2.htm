In the biblical narrative, "evil in the sight of the LORD" often refers to idolatry and disobedience to God's laws. This phrase is a recurring theme in the books of Kings, highlighting the spiritual decline of Israel and Judah. It serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience brings blessings and disobedience leads to judgment.<p><b>and followed the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit;</b><br>Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, established a pattern of idolatry by setting up golden calves in Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>). This act was a direct violation of the first two commandments and led Israel into sin. The phrase indicates that the king continued in this idolatrous tradition, perpetuating the spiritual corruption initiated by Jeroboam. This historical context underscores the long-lasting impact of leadership and the difficulty of breaking away from established sinful practices.<p><b>he did not turn away from them.</b><br>This phrase highlights the king's persistence in sin and refusal to repent. The lack of repentance is a significant theme in the prophetic literature, where prophets often called for a return to the LORD and His commandments. The king's failure to turn away from these sins suggests a hardened heart and a rejection of God's call to righteousness. This refusal to repent is contrasted with the biblical examples of kings like Josiah, who sought to reform and restore true worship (2 Kings 22-23). Theologically, this phrase serves as a warning about the consequences of unrepentant sin and the importance of aligning one's actions with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoahaz.htm">Jehoahaz</a></b><br>The king of Israel who reigned after Jehu.

His verdict is never guesswork.<p>&#8226; Evil here is moral rebellion against the covenant spelled out in <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>; blessing hinges on obedience, disaster on defiance. Jehoahaz lands squarely on the wrong side of that ledger.<p>&#8226; Consequences soon follow: verses 3&#8211;7 describe Syria&#8217;s oppression, echoing earlier cycles in Judges when &#8220;Israel did evil&#8230; so the LORD&#8217;s anger burned&#8221; (<a href="/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and followed the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit</b><p>&#8226; Jeroboam&#8217;s signature sin was institutionalized idolatry&#8212;golden calves at Bethel and Dan&#8212;designed to keep people from worshiping in Jerusalem (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>).<p>&#8226; That shortcut worship appealed to convenience and political control, but it violated <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>. Every king who walked that path perpetuated spiritual drift (<a href="/1_kings/15-34.htm">1 Kings 15:34</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-21.htm">2 Kings 17:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; By &#8220;following&#8221; these sins, Jehoahaz endorsed a counterfeit religion while pretending to honor the LORD. The mixture polluted the nation&#8217;s heart and invited divine discipline (<a href="/hosea/8-5.htm">Hosea 8:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The text reminds us that leaders set patterns; Jeroboam&#8217;s compromise, though generations old, still shaped national practice in Jehoahaz&#8217;s day&#8212;sin&#8217;s momentum is potent unless decisively broken.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he did not turn away from them</b><p>&#8226; Persistence makes sin more lethal than lapse. Earlier kings like Jehu &#8220;did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/10-31.htm">2 Kings 10:31</a>); Jehoahaz repeats the tragic refusal.<p>&#8226; To &#8220;turn away&#8221; would be repentance&#8212;changing course toward covenant faithfulness (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). Instead, Jehoahaz chooses spiritual inertia, showing that neutrality is impossible&#8212;one either forsakes sin or clings to it.<p>&#8226; The chronic refusal explains why God allowed Hazael and Ben-hadad to reduce Israel to &#8220;ten chariots, fifty horsemen, and ten thousand foot soldiers&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/13-7.htm">2 Kings 13:7</a>). Divine mercy later grants relief (vv. 4-5), but the king&#8217;s unrepentant heart limits lasting restoration.<p>&#8226; The pattern warns believers today: partial measures or tradition-bound religion cannot substitute for wholehearted return to God (<a href="/luke/13-3.htm">Luke 13:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/13-2.htm">2 Kings 13:2</a> serves as a concise indictment of Jehoahaz. God sees and judges evil, especially when leaders cling to entrenched sin. By echoing Jeroboam&#8217;s idolatry and refusing to repent, Jehoahaz drags Israel deeper into judgment. The verse challenges us to break with inherited compromise, repent fully, and walk in covenant faithfulness, knowing that the LORD still weighs every heart.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord.</span> There is no reason to believe that Jehoahaz re-introduced the Baal-worship, or sinned in any other flagrant way than by maintaining the calf-worship at Dan and Bethel. Jehu had done the same (<a href="/2_kings/10-29.htm">2 Kings 10:29</a>), as had all previous kings of Israel from the time of Jeroboam. The honor of God, however, required that idolatry of whatever kind should be punished, and the Samaritan kingdom could not otherwise be saved from destruction than by, "casting away <span class="accented">all</span> the works of darkness" and returning to the <span class="accented">pure</span> worship of Jehovah. Hence Jehu himself, notwithstanding the good service that he had done in crushing the Baal-worship, was chastised by God (<a href="/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32, 33</a>) on account of his continuance in the "sin of Jeroboam;" and now Jehoahaz was even more signally punished. As Keil remarks, "The longer and the more obstinately the sin was continued, the more severe did the punishment become." <span class="cmt_word">And followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat</span> (comp. <a href="/2_kings/10-29.htm">2 Kings 10:29</a>, where the exegetical clause is added, "To wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel and in Dan") <span class="cmt_word">which made Israel to sin</span> (comp. <a href="/1_kings/15-26.htm">1 Kings 15:26</a>; <a href="/1_kings/16-19.htm">1 Kings 16:19, 26</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-52.htm">1 Kings 22:52</a>, etc.); he departed not therefrom.
