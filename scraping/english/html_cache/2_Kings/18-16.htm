The historical context is crucial, as it was a period of intense pressure and fear for Judah, with the Assyrian Empire being a dominant force in the region.<p><b>Hezekiah stripped the gold</b><br>Hezekiah's actions reflect a desperate attempt to appease the Assyrian king. The stripping of gold signifies a significant sacrifice, as gold was a symbol of wealth and divine blessing. This act can be seen as a moment of crisis where Hezekiah prioritized political survival over religious integrity.<p><b>with which he had plated the doors and doorposts of the temple of the LORD</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem was the center of Jewish worship and a symbol of God's presence among His people. The gold plating of the temple's doors and doorposts was not only an aesthetic enhancement but also a representation of the temple's sanctity and the nation's devotion to God. Removing the gold from such a sacred place underscores the severity of the situation and the lengths to which Hezekiah was willing to go to protect his kingdom.<p><b>and he gave it to the king of Assyria</b><br>This act of giving the gold to the Assyrian king, Sennacherib, was a form of tribute or ransom. It highlights the political reality of the time, where smaller nations often paid tribute to more powerful empires to avoid destruction. This action can be compared to other instances in the Bible where leaders sought to buy peace, such as when Solomon paid Hiram of Tyre for materials and labor (<a href="/1_kings/5.htm">1 Kings 5:1-12</a>). It also reflects a moment of human weakness, where reliance on God was overshadowed by fear of earthly powers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and reforms to restore proper worship.

To make up the "thirty talents of gold" he was now obliged to undo his own work, and strip the doors and pillars bare. Sennacherib tells us that, besides the two large sums of gold and silver, Hezekiah sent him at this time "woven cloth, scarlet,' embroidered; precious stones of large size; couches of ivory; movable thrones of ivory; skins of buffaloes; horns of buffaloes; and two kinds of woods" ('Records of the Past,' vol. 1. p. 39, lines 34-37).
