His withdrawal marks a significant moment in biblical history, as it follows the miraculous defeat of his army by divine intervention (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>). This event underscores the sovereignty of God over the nations and His ability to protect His people. The Assyrian army's sudden retreat is a fulfillment of God's promise to defend Jerusalem, as prophesied by Isaiah (<a href="/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32-34</a>). Historically, Assyrian records, such as the Taylor Prism, corroborate Sennacherib's campaign against Judah, though they do not mention the defeat, highlighting the Bible's unique perspective on divine intervention.<p><b>He returned to Nineveh</b><br>Nineveh was the capital of the Assyrian Empire, located on the eastern bank of the Tigris River, in present-day Iraq. It was a major cultural and political center, known for its impressive architecture and extensive library. Sennacherib's return to Nineveh signifies a retreat to his stronghold, possibly to regroup and reassess after the unexpected loss. This city later becomes the focus of the prophetic book of Jonah, where God sends Jonah to call the city to repentance, illustrating God's concern for all nations. Nineveh's eventual fall, as prophesied by Nahum, serves as a reminder of the transient nature of earthly powers in contrast to God's eternal kingdom.<p><b>and stayed there.</b><br>Sennacherib's decision to remain in Nineveh suggests a period of inactivity or consolidation following his failed campaign. This phrase indicates a cessation of his immediate military ambitions against Judah, aligning with God's promise that Sennacherib would not return to besiege Jerusalem (<a href="/2_kings/19-33.htm">2 Kings 19:33</a>). The Assyrian king's stay in Nineveh also foreshadows his eventual assassination by his own sons (<a href="/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a>), fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy and demonstrating the ultimate justice and judgment of God. This event highlights the theme of divine retribution and the futility of opposing God's will, a recurring motif throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib.htm">Sennacherib</a></b><br>The king of Assyria, known for his military campaigns and attempts to conquer Jerusalem.

Sennacherib's palace and his ether buildings at Nineveh are described in his annals at some length (see 'Records of the Past,' vol. 1. pp. 50-52). The expression, "dwelt at Nineveh," does not mean that he never quitted it, but merely implies that he dwelt there for some considerable time after his return, as he appears to have done by his annals.
