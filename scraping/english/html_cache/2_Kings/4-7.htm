Prophets in ancient Israel served as intermediaries between God and the people, delivering divine messages and performing miracles. The widow's approach to Elisha demonstrates her faith and recognition of his authority as God's representative. This act of seeking divine intervention is consistent with the cultural and religious practices of the time, where prophets were sought for guidance and miraculous help (<a href="/1_samuel/9-6.htm">1 Samuel 9:6-10</a>).<p><b>and he said, &#8220;Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt.</b><br>Elisha's instruction to sell the oil highlights the miraculous provision of God, turning a small amount of oil into a resource sufficient to settle the widow's debts. This reflects God's care for the marginalized, such as widows, who were often vulnerable in ancient society. The act of selling the oil also emphasizes the importance of personal responsibility and stewardship, as the widow is directed to take action to resolve her financial crisis. This mirrors the principle found in <a href="/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7</a>, which warns against the bondage of debt.<p><b>Then you and your sons can live on the remainder.&#8221;</b><br>The provision of oil not only addresses the immediate crisis but also ensures the future well-being of the widow and her sons. This reflects God's abundant provision, as seen in other biblical accounts such as the feeding of the 5,000 (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>). The phrase underscores the theme of divine sufficiency, where God provides not just for immediate needs but also for ongoing sustenance. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides eternal life and spiritual sustenance (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). The widow's story is a testament to faith and obedience resulting in divine blessing and provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_widow.htm">The Widow</a></b><br>A woman whose husband, a member of the company of prophets, had died.
