The widow's obedience in gathering jars demonstrates faith, as she acted on Elisha's instructions without knowing the outcome. This event parallels the miracle of the feeding of the 5,000 in the New Testament, where Jesus multiplies loaves and fish, showing God's ability to provide abundantly. The filling of the jars signifies God's limitless resources and His care for those in need.<p><b>she said to her son, &#8220;Bring me another.&#8221;</b><br>The widow's request for another jar indicates her expectation of continued provision. Her faith is evident as she anticipates the miracle to persist. This reflects a principle seen throughout Scripture: God often requires human participation in His miracles, as seen in the gathering of manna in <a href="/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a>. The involvement of her son also emphasizes the importance of family unity and cooperation in faith.<p><b>But he replied, &#8220;There are no more jars.&#8221;</b><br>The son's response marks the completion of the miracle. The limitation was not in God's power but in the number of jars collected. This teaches a lesson about the measure of faith and preparation; the more jars gathered, the greater the blessing. It echoes the principle found in <a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>, where the measure given is the measure received. The finite number of jars contrasts with the infinite potential of God's provision.<p><b>Then the oil stopped flowing.</b><br>The cessation of the oil flow signifies the end of the miracle, directly tied to the number of jars. This illustrates that God's provision is sufficient for the need at hand, aligning with <a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>, which assures that God will supply all needs according to His riches. The oil, often symbolic of the Holy Spirit, also points to the anointing and presence of God, as seen in the anointing of kings and priests in the Old Testament. The stopping of the oil flow once the need is met underscores God's perfect timing and sufficiency.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_widow.htm">The Widow</a></b><br>A woman whose husband, a prophet, had died, leaving her in debt.

The narrative encourages believers to prepare room for God&#8217;s abundance, involve the next generation in witnessing His work, and remember that any shortage lies not in His hand but in our readiness to receive.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Her son.</span>--Probably the eldest.
