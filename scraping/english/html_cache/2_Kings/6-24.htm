It suggests a period of relative peace or normalcy before the new conflict arises. In the broader context of 2 Kings, this time lapse follows the miraculous events involving Elisha, such as the floating axe head and the blinding of the Aramean army. The phrase sets the stage for a new chapter in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Aram.<p><b>Ben-hadad king of Aram</b><br>Ben-hadad was a common name for Aramean kings, similar to the use of "Pharaoh" in Egypt. This particular Ben-hadad is likely the son of Hazael, who was anointed by Elijah to be king over Aram (<a href="/1_kings/19-15.htm">1 Kings 19:15</a>). The Arameans were a significant power in the region, often in conflict with Israel. Historically, the Arameans were known for their military prowess and strategic alliances, which they used to exert influence over neighboring territories.<p><b>assembled his entire army</b><br>The gathering of the entire army indicates a significant military campaign, suggesting that Ben-hadad was committed to a decisive action against Israel. This mobilization reflects the seriousness of the threat to Samaria and the resources that Aram was willing to invest in this siege. In ancient warfare, assembling an entire army was a demonstration of strength and intent to conquer.<p><b>and marched up to besiege Samaria</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, established by King Omri (<a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>). The city's strategic location on a hill made it a formidable fortress, but also a prime target for enemies. A siege was a common military tactic in ancient times, involving surrounding a city to cut off supplies and force surrender. This siege is part of the ongoing hostilities between Israel and Aram, highlighting the political and military tensions of the period. The siege of Samaria is reminiscent of other biblical sieges, such as the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem (2 Kings 18-19), and foreshadows the eventual fall of Samaria to the Assyrians in 722 BC (<a href="/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5-6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hadad.htm">Ben-hadad</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria) who led his army to besiege Samaria.

Now, as the Assyrians identified their god <span class= "ital">Ramm-nu</span> (Rimmon) with the Syrian deity, <span class= "ital">Adad, Addu</span>, or <span class= "ital">Dadi</span>, this title might be equivalent to <span class= "ital">Adad-idri</span>, or <span class= "ital">Addu-idri</span>.

The Syrian king's full name, therefore, would seem to have been Ben-hadad-idri, "The son of Hadad is my help" (Syriac adar, "to help"). (Comp. the name Hadad-ezer.)
