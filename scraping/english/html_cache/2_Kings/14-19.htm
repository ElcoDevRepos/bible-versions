The conspiracy against him likely stemmed from dissatisfaction with his leadership, particularly after his defeat by Israel (<a href="/2_kings/14-8.htm">2 Kings 14:8-14</a>). Jerusalem, the capital city, was the political and religious center of Judah, making it a strategic location for such plots. Conspiracies were not uncommon in the ancient Near East, as seen in other biblical accounts (e.g., <a href="/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a>). This reflects the political instability and the constant threat of internal rebellion that many kings faced.<p><b>and he fled to Lachish</b><br>Lachish was a fortified city in the Shephelah region of Judah, known for its strategic military importance. Archaeological excavations have uncovered significant fortifications, indicating its role as a defensive stronghold. Amaziah's flight to Lachish suggests he sought refuge in a place that could offer protection. This city was often a target in military campaigns, as seen in the Assyrian conquest under Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13-14</a>). The choice of Lachish highlights Amaziah's desperation and the seriousness of the threat against him.<p><b>But men were sent after him to Lachish</b><br>The sending of men to pursue Amaziah indicates the determination of the conspirators to eliminate him. This action underscores the extent of the conspiracy and the resolve to ensure that Amaziah could not reclaim his throne. The pursuit to Lachish also suggests that the conspirators had significant resources and influence, enabling them to act decisively even outside Jerusalem. This reflects the political dynamics of the time, where power struggles often led to violent outcomes.<p><b>and they killed him there</b><br>The assassination of Amaziah at Lachish marks the end of his reign and highlights the brutal nature of political power struggles in ancient Judah. This event is consistent with the biblical theme of divine retribution and the consequences of disobedience, as Amaziah had turned away from following the Lord fully (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-14.htm">2 Chronicles 25:14-16</a>). The killing of a king by conspirators is a recurring motif in the biblical narrative, illustrating the precariousness of monarchical rule (e.g., <a href="/2_kings/9-24.htm">2 Kings 9:24</a>). This also serves as a reminder of the need for righteous leadership and the dangers of turning away from God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned after his father Joash.

It is more likely to have sprung out of dissatisfaction with Amaziah's military inaction from and after his defeat by Joash. While Jeroboam H. was carrying all before him in the north, recovering his border, pushing it as far as Hamath, and even exercising a suzerainty over Damascus (vers. 25, 28), Amaziah remained passive, cowed by his one defeat, and took no advantage of the state of weakness to which he had reduced Edom, but sat with folded hands, doing nothing. The conspirators who removed Amaziah, and placed his son Azariah, or Uzziah, upon the throne, may be credited with the wish and intention to bring the period of inaction to an end, and to effect in the south what Jeroboam was effecting in the north. It is true that Azariah was but sixteen years of age (ver. 21; comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/26-1.htm">2 Chronicles 26:1</a>), but he may have given indications of his ambition and capacity. Sixteen, moreover, is the time of manhood in the East, and the conspirators had probably waited until Azariah was sixteen in order that his competency to reign should not be disputed. As soon as he was on the throne he initiated the warlike policy which they desired (see ver. 22). <span class="cmt_word">And he fled to Lachish.</span> Lachish, one of the south-western Judaean towns (<a href="/joshua/15-39.htm">Joshua 15:39</a>), was at all times a fortress of importance.

It was besieged and taken by Sennacherib (<a href="/2_kings/18-14.htm">2 Kings 18:14</a>; Layard, 'Nineveh and Babylon,' pp. 149-152).
