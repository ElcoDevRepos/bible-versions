Twilight can symbolize the end of one period and the beginning of another, reflecting the desperation and hope of the lepers. This timing is significant as it aligns with God's providential timing, often seen in biblical narratives where God acts at unexpected times.<p><b>and went to the camp of the Arameans.</b><br>The Arameans, also known as Syrians, were frequent adversaries of Israel. Their camp was besieging Samaria, causing severe famine within the city. The decision of the lepers to approach the enemy camp highlights their desperation but also their faith in seeking a solution outside the city walls. This act of moving towards the enemy can be seen as a step of faith, trusting in God's provision even in dire circumstances.<p><b>But when they came to the outskirts of the camp,</b><br>The outskirts of the camp represent the boundary between danger and potential salvation. The lepers' arrival at this point signifies a critical moment of discovery. In biblical narratives, the outskirts often serve as places of revelation or divine intervention, where God reveals His plans or provides deliverance.<p><b>there was not a man to be found.</b><br>The absence of the Arameans is a miraculous event orchestrated by God, as described earlier in the chapter where the Lord caused the Arameans to hear the sound of chariots and horses, leading them to flee. This empty camp symbolizes God's deliverance and provision, turning a place of potential threat into one of unexpected blessing. It echoes other biblical instances where God delivers His people by causing confusion among their enemies, such as in the story of Gideon (Judges 7). This event foreshadows the ultimate deliverance found in Jesus Christ, who provides salvation and victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lepers.htm">The Lepers</a></b><br>Four men suffering from leprosy who were outside the city gates of Samaria due to their condition.
