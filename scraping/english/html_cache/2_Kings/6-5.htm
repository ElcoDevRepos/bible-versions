The act of cutting down trees indicates a communal effort and a practical task, reflecting the simplicity and industriousness of the prophetic community. The sons of the prophets were a group of disciples or followers of prophets like Elisha, who were dedicated to learning and living out God's word. This setting emphasizes the importance of community and shared labor in the service of God.<p><b>the iron axe head fell into the water</b><br>Iron was a valuable and relatively rare material in ancient Israel, making the loss of an iron axe head significant. The Jordan River, where this incident occurred, was a central geographical feature in Israel, often associated with miraculous events (e.g., <a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14-17</a>, <a href="/2_kings/2-8.htm">2 Kings 2:8</a>). The loss of the axe head in the water symbolizes a sudden and unexpected problem, highlighting human limitations and the need for divine intervention. This event foreshadows the miraculous recovery that follows, demonstrating God's concern for even the small, practical needs of His people.<p><b>&#8220;Oh, my master,&#8221; he cried out</b><br>The cry to "my master" indicates the presence of Elisha, the leader and mentor of the prophetic community. This appeal to Elisha reflects the respect and dependence the sons of the prophets had on their leader, who was seen as a mediator of God's power and wisdom. The urgency and distress in the cry underscore the seriousness of the situation, as the loss of the axe head could halt their work and bring shame or financial burden due to its value.<p><b>&#8220;it was borrowed!&#8221;</b><br>The fact that the axe head was borrowed adds a layer of responsibility and urgency to the situation. In ancient Israel, borrowing items was common, and losing a borrowed item could damage one's reputation and relationships. This detail highlights the ethical and communal values of the time, where personal integrity and responsibility were paramount. The borrowed nature of the axe head also underscores the theme of stewardship and accountability, reminding believers of the importance of caring for what is entrusted to them. This incident can be seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where He restores what is lost and pays the debt we cannot pay ourselves.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_the_prophets.htm">The Sons of the Prophets</a></b><br>A group of prophetic disciples or students who were under the guidance of Elisha, the prophet.

They probably learnt to smelt and work iron in Egypt. <span class="cmt_word">Fell into the water.</span> The tree must have been one that grew close to the river's edge. As the man hewed away at the stem a little above the root, the axe-head flew from the haft, into which it was insecurely fitted, and fell into the water. The slipping of an axe-head was a very common occurrence (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-5.htm">Deuteronomy 19:5</a>), and ordinarily was of little consequence, since it was easily restored to its place. But now the head had disappeared. <span class="cmt_word">And he cried, and said, Alas, master!</span> - rather, <span class="accented">Alas</span>, <span class="accented">my master</span>! or, <span class="accented">Alas</span>, <span class="accented">my lord</span>! - <span class="cmt_word">for it was borrowed</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and it was a borrowed one</span>. The words are part of the man's address to Elisha. He means to say, "It is no common misfortune; it is not as if it had been my own axe. I had borrowed it, and now what shall I say to the owner?" There is no direct request for help, but the tone of the complaint constitutes a sort of silent appeal. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/6-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1464;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;e&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
