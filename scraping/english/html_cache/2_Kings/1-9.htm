His decision to send a captain with fifty men to Elijah reflects the seriousness with which he viewed Elijah's influence and the threat he posed to his authority. The number fifty is significant in the Bible, often symbolizing a period of waiting or a jubilee, but here it underscores the military might and intimidation tactics used by the king. This action also highlights the tension between the prophetic voice of Elijah and the royal authority of Ahaziah, a common theme in the narratives of the kings of Israel.<p><b>So the captain went up to Elijah, who was sitting on top of a hill,</b><br>Elijah's position on top of a hill is symbolic of his role as a prophet who is above earthly powers and closer to God. Hills and mountains in the Bible often represent places of divine encounter and revelation, such as Mount Sinai or the Mount of Transfiguration. Elijah's choice to sit on a hill may also indicate his readiness to receive a word from the Lord, as well as his separation from the corrupt practices of the king. This setting foreshadows the confrontation between divine authority and human power.<p><b>and said to him, &#8220;Man of God, the king declares, &#8216;Come down!&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The title "Man of God" acknowledges Elijah's status as a true prophet, one who speaks on behalf of the Lord. However, the command "Come down!" issued by the king through his captain, is an attempt to assert royal authority over the divine messenger. This phrase highlights the conflict between the word of God and the word of the king, a recurring theme in the prophetic books. The demand for Elijah to come down can be seen as a metaphor for the king's desire to bring the divine message under human control, a futile endeavor as demonstrated by the subsequent events in the narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahaziah.htm">King Ahaziah</a></b><br>The king of Israel, son of Ahab and Jezebel, who ruled after his father's death.

Though not expressly mentioned in the military organization of David, they probably formed a part of it, and so passed into the institutions of the kingdom of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">With his fifty.</span> Some recognition of Elijah's superhuman power would seem to have led Ahaziah to send so large a body. His doing so was a sort of challenge to the prophet to show whether Ahaziah or the God whom he represented was the stronger. The circumstances recall those of the "band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees" (<a href="/john/18-3.htm">John 18:3</a>), which was sent, "with swords and staves," to arrest another righteous Person. <span class="cmt_word">He sat on the top of a hill</span>; literally, on <span class="accented">the top of the hill</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, LXX.). The high ground where Elijah had met the messengers (ver. 3) seems to be intended. When they were gone, the prophet took his seat on the highest point, conspicuous on all sides, so avoiding any attempt at concealment, and awaiting the next step that the king would take, calmly and quietly. <span class="cmt_word">He spake unto him; Thou man of God.</span> The captain is thought by some to have spoken ironically; but there is no evidence of this. The address is respectful, submissive. The miraculous powers of Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17-22.htm">1 Kings 17:22</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-38.htm">1 Kings 18:38</a>) were probably known to the officer, who hoped by the tone of his address to escape the prophet's anger. In the same spirit he avoids issuing any command of his own, and prefers simply to deliver the king's command - <span class="cmt_word">The king hath said, Come down.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/1-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then King Ahaziah sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1445;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
