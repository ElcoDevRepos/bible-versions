It served as a military headquarters for the Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar. This location was significant because it was a central point for controlling the region and conducting military operations. Riblah's mention highlights the extent of Babylonian control and the fulfillment of God's judgment on Judah, as prophesied by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5-6</a>).<p><b>the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death</b><br>The king of Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar, executed the leaders of Judah, which was a common practice in ancient warfare to prevent rebellion and ensure control over conquered territories. This act fulfilled the prophecies of judgment against Judah for their disobedience and idolatry (<a href="/jeremiah/52-10.htm">Jeremiah 52:10-11</a>). The execution of the leaders symbolized the end of the Davidic monarchy's earthly power, though the promise of a future king from David's line remained (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>So Judah was taken into exile, away from its own land</b><br>The exile of Judah was a pivotal event in biblical history, marking the beginning of the Babylonian Captivity. This fulfilled the warnings given by prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah about the consequences of the nation's persistent sin (<a href="/isaiah/39-6.htm">Isaiah 39:6-7</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>). The exile served as a period of purification and reflection for the Jewish people, leading to a renewed focus on the Law and the hope of restoration. It also prefigures the ultimate deliverance and restoration through Jesus Christ, who offers spiritual freedom and a return to God's presence (Isaiah 53, <a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_babylon.htm">King of Babylon</a></b><br>This refers to Nebuchadnezzar II, the powerful ruler who led Babylon to conquer Jerusalem and Judah, fulfilling God's judgment against the nation for their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/riblah.htm">Riblah</a></b><br>A strategic location in the land of Hamath, used by Nebuchadnezzar as a military headquarters.

The Assyrian sculptures show us prisoners of war impaled on crosses, beheaded, beaten on the head with maces, and sometimes extended on the ground and flayed. The inscriptions speak of hundreds as thus executed, and mention others as burnt in furnaces, or thrown to wild beasts, or cruelly mutilated. Herodotus says (3. 159) that Darius Hystaspis crucified three thousand prisoners round about Babylon after one of its revolts. That monarch himself, in the Behistun inscription, speaks of many cases where, after capturing rebel chiefs in the field or behind walls, he executed them and their principal adherents (see <a href="/colossians/2.htm">Colossians 2</a>. Par. 13; <a href="/colossians/3.htm">Colossians 3</a>. Par. 8, 11). If Nebuchadnezzar contented himself with the execution of between seventy and eighty of the rebel inhabitants of Jerusa-lee, he cannot be charged with cruelty, or extreme severity, according to the notions of the time. <span class="cmt_word">So Judah was carried away out of their land.</span> Jeremiah adds an estimate of the number carried off. These were, he says (<a href="/jeremiah/52-28.htm">Jeremiah 52:28-30</a>), in the captivity of the seventh (query, seventeenth?) year, 3023; in the captivity of the eighteenth year, 832; and in that of the twenty-third, five years later, 745, making a total of 4600. If we suppose these persons to be men, and multiply by four for the women and children, the entire number will still be no more than 18,400. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/25-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">There at Riblah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;ri&#7687;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
