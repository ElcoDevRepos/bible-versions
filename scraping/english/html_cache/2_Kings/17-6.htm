His reign marked the end of the Northern Kingdom, which had been established after the division of the united monarchy following Solomon's reign. The ninth year of Hoshea's reign corresponds to the year 722 BC, a pivotal moment in Israel's history when the Assyrian Empire completed its conquest of the Northern Kingdom.<p><b>the king of Assyria captured Samaria</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. The Assyrian king at this time was Shalmaneser V, although it is often believed that his successor, Sargon II, completed the siege. The capture of Samaria was a significant event, as it marked the fall of the Northern Kingdom and the fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by prophets like Amos and Hosea about the consequences of Israel's idolatry and disobedience.<p><b>and carried away the Israelites to Assyria</b><br>The deportation of the Israelites was a common Assyrian practice designed to prevent rebellion by displacing conquered peoples. This event is known as the Assyrian Exile and resulted in the loss of the ten northern tribes, often referred to as the "Lost Tribes of Israel." This exile was a direct consequence of Israel's failure to adhere to the covenant with God, as repeatedly warned by the prophets.<p><b>where he settled them in Halah, in Gozan by the Habor River, and in the cities of the Medes</b><br>Halah, Gozan, and the Habor River are locations within the Assyrian Empire, situated in what is now modern-day northern Iraq and Syria. The cities of the Medes refer to areas controlled by the Medes, an ancient Iranian people. This dispersion fulfilled the warnings of dispersion found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>. The relocation to these regions was part of the Assyrian strategy to integrate and control conquered peoples by scattering them across the empire, thus diluting their national identity and reducing the likelihood of rebellion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hoshea.htm">Hoshea</a></b><br>The last king of Israel, whose reign ended with the Assyrian conquest.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_assyria.htm">King of Assyria</a></b><br>The ruler responsible for capturing Samaria and deporting the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, which fell to the Assyrians.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/halah,_gozan,_and_the_cities_of_the_medes.htm">Halah, Gozan, and the cities of the Medes</a></b><br>Locations in Assyria where the Israelites were exiled.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of the Northern Kingdom who were taken into captivity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The fall of Samaria serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.

The specificity of places&#8212;Halah, Gozan, Habor, Medes&#8212;underscores that this is real history, fulfilling the warnings of <a href="/bsb/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. At the same time, later prophets and the New Testament reveal that exile is not God&#8217;s last act; He will regather and redeem. The verse therefore stands as both a sobering reminder that God keeps His word of judgment and a foundation for trusting that He also keeps His word of restoration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">In the ninth year of Hosheathe king of Assyria took Samaria.</span>--Comp. <a href="/hosea/10-5.htm" title="The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.">Hosea 10:5</a> <span class= "ital">seq.;</span> <a href="/micah/1-6.htm" title="Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.">Micah 1:6</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/28-1.htm" title="Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!">Isaiah 28:1-4</a>.

It probably lay in Mesopotamia, like Rezeph and Gozan. (See Note on <a href="/1_chronicles/5-26.htm" title="And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, to this day.">1Chronicles 5:26</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">In Habor by the river of Gozan.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">on</span> <span class= "ital">Habor the river of Gozan.</span> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the ninth year of Hoshea the wing of Assyria took Samaria.</span> In <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>, the ninth year of Hoshea, there seems to have been a revolution at Nineveh. The reign of Shalmaneser came to an end, and Sargon seated himself upon the throne. There have been commentators on Kings (Keil, Bahr) who have supposed that Shalmaneser and Sargon were the same person, and have even claimed that the Assyrian inscriptions support their view. But the fact is otherwise. Nothing is more certain than that, according to them, Sargon succeeded Shalmaneser IV. in <span class="date">B.C. 722</span> by a revolution, and was the head of a new dynasty. He claims in his annals, among his earliest acts, the siege and capture of Samaria ('Eponym Canon,' p. 125). It is remarkable that Scripture, while in no way connecting him with the capture, never distinctly assigns it to Shalmaneser. Here we are only told that "the King of Assyria" took it. In <a href="/2_kings/18-9.htm">2 Kings 18:9, 10</a>, where we are distinctly told that Shalmaneser "came up against Samaria, and besieged it," the capture is expressed by the phrase, "they took it," not "he took <span class="accented">it</span>." Perhaps neither king was present in person at the siege, or, at any rate, at its termination. The city may have been taken by an Assyrian general, while Shalmaneser and Sargon were contending for the crown. In that case, the capture might be assigned to either. Sargon certainly claims it; Shalmaneser's annals have been so mutilated by his successors that we cannot tell whether he claimed it or not. The city fell in <span class="date">B.C. 722</span>; and the deportation of its inhabitants at once took place. <span class="cmt_word">And carried Israel away into Assyria.</span> The inscription of Sargon above referred to mentions only the deportation, from the city of Samaria itself, of 27,290 persons. No doubt a vast number of others were carried off from the smaller towns and from the country districts. Still, the country was not left uninhabited, and Sargon assessed its tribute at the old rate ('Eponym Canon,' <span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.). Nor was the cry of Samaria destroyed, since we hear of it subsequently more than once in the Assyrian annals. <span class="cmt_word">And placed them in Halah.</span> "Halah" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>) has been supposed by some to be the old Assyrian city (<a href="/genesis/10-11.htm">Genesis 10:11</a>) of Calah (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;</span>), which was, down to the' time of Tiglath-pileser, the main capital; but the difference of spelling is an objection, and the Assyrians do not seem to have ever transported subject-populations to their capitals. It is moreover reasonable to suppose that Halah, Habor, Gozan, and Hara (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-26.htm">1 Chronicles 5:26</a>) were in the same neighborhood. This last consideration points to the "Chalcitis" of Ptolemy (5. 18) as the true "Halah," since it was in the immediate vicinity of the Khabour, of Gauzanitis, and of Haran. <span class="cmt_word">And in Habor by the river of Gozan.</span> This is a mistranslation. The Hebrew runs, "And on Habor (Khabor), the river of Gozan" (so also in <a href="/2_kings/18-11.htm">2 Kings 18:11</a>). "Habor, the river of Gozan," is undoubtedly one of the Khabours. Those who find Halah in Calah, or in Calacine (Calachene), generally prefer the eastern river which runs into the Tigris from Kurdistan a little below Jezireh. But there is no evidence that rids river bore the name in antiquity. The Western Khabour, on the other hand, was well known to the Assyrians under that appellation, and is the Aborrhas of Strabo and Procopius, the Chaboras of Pliny and Ptolemy, the Aburas of Isadore of Charax, and the Abora of Zosimus. It adjoins a district called Chalcitis, and it drains the country of Gauzanitis or Mygdonia. The Western Khabour is a river of Upper Mesopotamia, and runs into the Euphrates from the northeast near the site of the ancient Circesion. The tract which it drains is called Mygdonia by Strabo, Gauzanitis by Ptolemy. <span class="cmt_word">And in the cities of the Medes.</span> Media had been repeatedly invaded and ravaged by the Assyrians from the time of Vulnirari IV. (about <span class="date">B.C. 810</span>); but the first king to conquer any portion of it, and people its cities with settlers from other parts of his dominions, was Sargon (Oppert, ' Inscriptions des Sargonides,' pp. 25, 37). We learn from the present passage that a certain number of these settlers were Israelites (comp. <a href="/2_kings/18-11.htm">2 Kings 18:11</a> and Tobit 1:14). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/17-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the ninth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1506;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(hat&#183;t&#601;&#183;&#353;&#238;&#183;&#8216;&#238;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
