It was a tumultuous era for Judah, marked by political instability and the decline of the Assyrian Empire, which had previously dominated the region. The phrase sets the stage for the events that follow, emphasizing the immediacy and urgency of the situation.<p><b>the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon</b><br>Nebuchadnezzar II was one of the most powerful monarchs of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, reigning from 605 to 562 BC. His "servants" likely refer to his military commanders and officials. This highlights the organized and strategic nature of Babylon's military campaigns. Nebuchadnezzar's rise to power was prophesied in earlier scriptures, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>, where God refers to him as "My servant," indicating that he was used as an instrument of divine judgment against Judah.<p><b>marched up to Jerusalem</b><br>The phrase "marched up" suggests a deliberate and forceful advance. Jerusalem, situated on a hill, was a significant city both politically and spiritually. The march to Jerusalem was not just a military maneuver but also a fulfillment of prophecies warning of Judah's impending judgment due to their disobedience and idolatry, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a>.<p><b>and the city came under siege</b><br>A siege was a common military tactic in ancient times, involving surrounding a city to cut off supplies and force surrender. This particular siege of Jerusalem was part of a series of invasions by Babylon, culminating in the eventual destruction of the city and the temple in 586 BC. The siege represents a pivotal moment in biblical history, leading to the Babylonian exile, which was a period of significant theological reflection and transformation for the Jewish people. The siege and subsequent exile were seen as a direct consequence of the nation's failure to uphold the covenant with God, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49-52</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar_of_babylon.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon</a></b><br>The powerful ruler of Babylon who played a significant role in the history of Israel by besieging Jerusalem and eventually leading to the Babylonian exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, significant in biblical history as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple.
