His youth may have contributed to his susceptibility to external influences and pressures, both politically and religiously. The age of twenty suggests a lack of experience, which could have impacted his decision-making and leadership style.<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years</b><br>Ahaz's reign in Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, lasted for sixteen years, from approximately 732 to 716 BC. This period was marked by significant political turmoil and threats from surrounding nations, including Assyria and Israel. Jerusalem, as the center of worship and governance, was crucial in maintaining the spiritual and political integrity of Judah. Ahaz's reign is noted for its departure from traditional worship practices, which had long-term consequences for the kingdom.<p><b>And unlike David his father</b><br>The reference to David highlights the ideal standard of kingship in Judah. David, known for his heart after God, set a benchmark for faithfulness and obedience to the LORD. The term "father" here is used in a broader ancestral sense, as Ahaz was a descendant of David. This comparison underscores Ahaz's failure to live up to the covenantal expectations established by David, which included loyalty to God and adherence to His commandments.<p><b>he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD his God</b><br>Ahaz's reign is characterized by actions that were contrary to the will of God. This phrase indicates a moral and spiritual failure, as he engaged in practices that were detestable to the LORD, such as idolatry and alliances with pagan nations. His actions are documented in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/2_chronicles/28.htm">2 Chronicles 28</a>, where his idolatrous practices and reliance on Assyria are detailed. This deviation from righteousness had significant implications for Judah, leading to spiritual decline and eventual judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>The king of Judah who began his reign at the age of twenty.

Length of reign cannot redeem a leader devoid of righteousness; contrast with the thief on the cross who, in mere hours, used his voice rightly (<a href="/luke/23-42.htm">Luke 23:42&#8211;43</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And unlike David his father, he did not do what was right in the eyes of the LORD his God</b><p>Scripture measures every king against David&#8217;s wholehearted devotion (<a href="/1_kings/15-5.htm">1 Kings 15:5</a>).
