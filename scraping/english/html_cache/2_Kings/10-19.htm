Baal was a Canaanite deity associated with fertility and storms, and his worship often involved rituals that were abhorrent to the God of Israel. The presence of prophets, servants, and priests indicates an organized religious system that had infiltrated Israelite society, contrary to the covenantal laws given to the Israelites. This gathering is reminiscent of Elijah's confrontation with the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18), where the power of the true God was demonstrated over false gods.<p><b>See that no one is missing, for I have a great sacrifice for Baal.</b><br>Jehu's insistence that no one be missing underscores the comprehensive nature of his plan. The mention of a "great sacrifice" would have been enticing to Baal's followers, as sacrifices were central to their worship practices. This phrase also foreshadows the impending judgment, as the "sacrifice" is not what it seems. The use of sacrificial language is ironic, as it is not Baal who will receive a sacrifice, but rather his followers who will face destruction. This reflects the biblical theme of divine justice and the futility of idolatry.<p><b>Whoever is missing will not live.&#8221;</b><br>This threat serves to ensure full attendance, highlighting Jehu's determination to eradicate Baal worship completely. It also reflects the seriousness with which religious apostasy was treated in ancient Israel. The death penalty for missing the gathering underscores the severity of idolatry and the lengths to which Jehu was willing to go to purify the nation. This echoes the Deuteronomic law, which prescribed severe consequences for leading Israel into idolatry (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6-11</a>).<p><b>But Jehu was acting deceptively in order to destroy the servants of Baal.</b><br>Jehu's deception is a strategic move to fulfill his mission of purging Baal worship from Israel. While deception is generally condemned in Scripture, Jehu's actions are portrayed as part of his divine mandate to eliminate idolatry, as he was anointed by God to destroy the house of Ahab and cleanse Israel (<a href="/2_kings/9-6.htm">2 Kings 9:6-10</a>). This act of deception can be compared to other instances in the Bible where God uses unconventional means to achieve His purposes, such as the story of Rahab in <a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>. Jehu's actions ultimately lead to the fulfillment of God's judgment against Baal worship, aligning with the prophetic word and demonstrating God's sovereignty over false religions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was anointed to destroy the house of Ahab and eradicate Baal worship from Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/baal.htm">Baal</a></b><br>A Canaanite deity whose worship was prevalent in Israel, often associated with idolatry and apostasy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets_of_baal.htm">Prophets of Baal</a></b><br>Religious leaders and followers of Baal who were targeted by Jehu for destruction.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants_and_priests_of_baal.htm">Servants and Priests of Baal</a></b><br>Individuals dedicated to the worship and service of Baal, gathered by Jehu under false pretenses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, where Jehu's actions against Baal worship took place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/z/zeal_for_the_lord's_honor.htm">Zeal for the Lord's Honor</a></b><br>Jehu's actions, though deceptive, were driven by a zeal to honor God by eradicating idolatry.

Including them ensures the eradication of Baal&#8217;s entire religious infrastructure.<p>&#8226; By targeting leaders and laity alike, Jehu mirrors God&#8217;s command to remove every trace of idolatry (<a href="/exodus/23-24.htm">Exodus 23:24</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>See that no one is missing</b><p>&#8226; Total attendance guarantees that none escape the coming judgment.<p>&#8226; Similar thoroughness appears in Israel&#8217;s conquest of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-21.htm">Joshua 6:21</a>) and in Moses&#8217; order against Midian (<a href="/numbers/31-7.htm">Numbers 31:7-8</a>).

Though he sounds like a zealous Baal-worshiper preparing a grand sacrifice, he is in fact setting a trap to eliminate the cult entirely. The verse showcases Jehu&#8217;s strategic deception, God&#8217;s unwavering opposition to idolatry, and the fulfillment of earlier prophetic warnings that Baal worship in Israel would be decisively judged.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Call unto me all the prophets of Baal.</span>--Comp. the similar convocation of the prophets of the Baal and Asherah by the prophet Elijah, <a href="/1_kings/18-19.htm" title="Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.">1Kings 18:19</a> <span class= "ital">seq</span>.<p><span class= "bld">His servants.</span>--The same word as "worshippers," <span class= "ital">infra</span>.<p><span class= "bld">To do.</span>--Omit.<p><span class= "bld">To Baal.</span>--<span class= "ital">For the Baal.</span><p><span class= "bld">But Jehu did it.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">Now Jehu had done it;</span> a parenthesis.<p><span class= "bld">In subtilty.</span>--Or,<span class= "ital"> in guile, treacherously</span>.

The Egyptians called the priest <span class="accented">ab</span>, the prophet <span class="accented">neter hen</span>, literally, "servant of <span class="accented">God</span>." They held the priest in the greater honor. In Phoenicia, on the contrary, judging from the scanty notices that we possess, prophets appear to have taken precedence of priests, and to have had the more important functions assigned to them (see <a href="/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19-40</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-6.htm">1 Kings 22:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let none be wanting</span> - literally, <span class="accented">let not a man fail - <span class="cmt_word"></span>for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal.</span> Like the other gods of the heathen, Baal and Ashtoreth were worshipped chiefly by sacrifice. The sacrifice was sometimes human, but more Commonly a sacrificial animal, such as a bull, a ram, or a he-goat. In the greater festivals several hundreds of victims were offered; and their flesh was served up at the banquets by which the festivals were accompanied. <span class="cmt_word">Whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live.</span> His absence would be regarded as an act of contumacy verging on rebellion, and so as deserving of capital punishment. <span class="cmt_word">But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.</span> "Subtilty" was characteristic of John, who always preferred to gain his ends by cunning rather than in a straightforward way. Idolaters were by the Law liable to death, and Jehu would have had a perfect right to crush the Baal-worship throughout the land, by sending his emissaries everywhere, with orders to slay all whom they found engaged in it. But to draw some thousands of his subjects by false pretences into a trap, and then to kill them in it for doing what he had himself invited them to do, was an act that was wholly unjustifiable, and that savored, not of the wisdom which is from above, but of that bastard wisdom which is "earthly, sensual, devilish" (<a href="/james/3-15.htm">James 3:15</a>). Jehu's religious reformation did not succeed, and it was conducted in such a way that it did not deserve to succeed. A little more honest boldness, and a little less frequent resort to subterfuge and craft, might have had a different result, and have been better both for himself and for his people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/10-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now, therefore,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
