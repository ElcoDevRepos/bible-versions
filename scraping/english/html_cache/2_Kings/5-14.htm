His journey to Israel reflects humility and obedience, as he initially resisted the prophet Elisha's instructions. This act of going down symbolizes a descent from pride to submission, a necessary step for spiritual and physical healing.<p><b>and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times</b><br>The Jordan River holds significant biblical importance, being the site where the Israelites crossed into the Promised Land and where Jesus was later baptized. The act of dipping seven times signifies completeness and perfection in biblical numerology. Naaman's obedience to this specific instruction demonstrates faith in God's power and the prophet's word, despite his initial skepticism.<p><b>according to the word of the man of God</b><br>Elisha, the prophet, represents God's voice and authority. Naaman's healing depended on his adherence to the divine instruction given through Elisha. This highlights the importance of faith and obedience to God's word, as mediated through His prophets.<p><b>and his flesh was restored</b><br>The restoration of Naaman's flesh signifies not only physical healing but also spiritual renewal. In biblical terms, leprosy often symbolizes sin and impurity. Naaman's healing is a testament to God's power to cleanse and restore, prefiguring the spiritual cleansing available through Christ.<p><b>and became like that of a little child</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the complete transformation and renewal Naaman experienced. In the Bible, children often symbolize purity and innocence. Naaman's skin becoming like that of a child signifies a new beginning and a return to a state of purity, akin to the spiritual rebirth Jesus speaks of in the New Testament.<p><b>and he was clean</b><br>The declaration of Naaman's cleanliness is significant both physically and spiritually. In the Levitical law, leprosy rendered a person ceremonially unclean, barring them from community and worship. Naaman's cleansing allowed him to be reintegrated into society and symbolizes the comprehensive cleansing from sin that God offers, foreshadowing the ultimate cleansing through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naaman.htm">Naaman</a></b><br>A commander of the army of the king of Aram, who suffered from leprosy.

The Lord responds by granting thorough healing, a fresh start, and full cleansing&#8212;signposts of the greater salvation offered to all who trust Him today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Then went he down.</span>--<span class= "ital">And he went down: scil</span>., from Samaria to the Jordan bed.

In the Assyrian monuments there is an almost exact parallel to the above method of seeking a cure. It occurs among the so-called exorcisms, and belongs to the age of Sargon of Agade (Accad), before 2200 B.C. Merodach is represented as asking his father Hea how to cure a sick man. Hea replies that the sick man must go and bathe in the sacred waters at the mouth of the Euphrates. It thus appears that in bidding Naaman bathe seven times in the Jordan, Elisha acted in accordance with ancient Semitic belief as to the healing virtue of running streams.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then went he down</span>; i.e. descended into the deep Jordan valley from the highland of Samaria - a descent of above a thousand feet.
