In the ancient Near East, kings often boasted of their conquests and power, attributing their success to their own might rather than acknowledging any divine authority. This arrogance is reminiscent of other biblical figures like Pharaoh in Exodus, who also defied God. The phrase "have reached My ears" indicates that God is fully aware of human actions and attitudes, emphasizing His omniscience and justice. It echoes the biblical theme that God hears the cries of the oppressed and the boasts of the proud, as seen in <a href="/psalms/94-9.htm">Psalm 94:9</a>.<p><b>I will put My hook in your nose</b><br>This imagery is drawn from the Assyrian practice of leading captives with hooks through their noses, a method used to humiliate and control prisoners. It signifies God's intention to humble Sennacherib and demonstrates His power over even the mightiest of earthly rulers. The use of such vivid imagery underscores the severity of divine judgment. This act of divine retribution is a reversal of roles, where the oppressor becomes the oppressed, highlighting God's justice and sovereignty.<p><b>and My bit in your mouth</b><br>The bit, like a hook, is a tool of control, used to direct animals. This metaphor suggests that God will guide Sennacherib's actions, despite the king's previous defiance. It reflects the biblical principle that God can direct the hearts of kings, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/21.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>. This phrase also serves as a reminder of God's ultimate authority over human affairs, reinforcing the idea that no one is beyond His control.<p><b>I will send you back the way you came</b><br>This prophecy foretells the retreat of the Assyrian army from Jerusalem, which is fulfilled later in the chapter. Historically, Sennacherib's campaign against Judah was halted, and he returned to Nineveh without capturing Jerusalem. This outcome demonstrates God's protection of His people and the fulfillment of His promises. The phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God delivering His people from their enemies, as seen in the Exodus story. It serves as a testament to God's faithfulness and His ability to thwart the plans of those who oppose Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah during the time of the Assyrian threat.

Keil's remark, however, is also to the purpose: "The metaphor is taken from wild animals, which are thus held in check--the ring in the nose of lions (<a href="/ezekiel/19-4.htm" title="The nations also heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with chains to the land of Egypt.">Ezekiel 19:4</a>), and other wild beasts (<a href="/ezekiel/29-4.htm" title="But I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will cause the fish of your rivers to stick to your scales, and I will bring you up out of the middle of your rivers, and all the fish of your rivers shall stick to your scales.">Ezekiel 29:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-28.htm" title="And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the middle of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.">Isaiah 30:28</a>), the bridle in the mouth of intractable horses" (<a href="/psalms/32-9.htm" title="Be you not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near to you.">Psalm 32:9</a>).

Captive kings were actually so treated by the Assyrians themselves. A hook or split-ring was thrust through the cartilage of the nose, or the fleshy part of the under lip, with a rope or thong attached to it, and in this guise they were led into the monarch's presence, to receive their final sentence at his hands. In the sculptures of Sargon at Khorsabad we see three prisoners brought before him in this fashion, one of whom he seems to be about to kill with a spear ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 1. p. 367). In another sculpture set up by a Babylonian king, his vizier brings before him two captives similarly treated, but with the ring, apparently, passed through the cartilage of their noses (ibid., vol. 3. p. 436) Manasseh seems to have received the same treatment at the hands of the "captains" (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-11.htm">2 Chronicles 33:11</a>) who brought him a prisoner to Esarhaddon at Babylon. Other allusions to the practice in Scripture will be found in <a href="/isaiah/30-28.htm">Isaiah 30:28</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/29-4.htm">Ezekiel 29:4</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4</a>. The threat in the present passage was, of course, not intended to be understood life-rally, but only as a declaration that God would bring down the pride of Sennacherib, humiliate him, and reduce him to a state of abject weakness and abasement. <span class="cmt_word">And I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest</span> (comp. ver. 33). The meaning is clear. Sennacherib would not be allowed to come near Jerusalem. He would hurry back by the low coast route (<a href="/2_kings/18-17.htm">2 Kings 18:17</a>), by which he had made his invasion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/19-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Because</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1434;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3282.htm">Strong's 3282: </a> </span><span class="str2">Heed, purpose, to indicate the reason, cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your rage</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1462;&#1494;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1443;</span> <span class="translit">(hi&#7791;&#183;rag&#183;gez&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Infinitive construct &#124;
