Jehonadab, son of Rechab, is a significant figure representing a group known for their strict adherence to Yahweh. Their entrance into the temple of Baal signifies a strategic move to eradicate Baal worship from Israel. The temple of Baal was a center for idolatrous worship, and its presence in Israel was a direct violation of the first commandment. This act is part of Jehu's broader campaign to purify Israel from idolatry, aligning with the prophetic mission given to him by Elisha.<p><b>and Jehu said to the servants of Baal</b><br>The servants of Baal were priests and worshippers dedicated to the Canaanite god Baal, whose worship included rituals that were abominable to the God of Israel. Jehu's address to them is a cunning tactic to ensure the complete destruction of Baal worship. This moment reflects the ongoing conflict between the worship of Yahweh and the pagan practices that had infiltrated Israel, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>&#8220;Look around to see that there are no servants of the LORD here among you&#8212;only servants of Baal.&#8221;</b><br>Jehu's command to ensure that no servants of the LORD are present is a calculated move to isolate the worshippers of Baal. This separation underscores the biblical principle of holiness, where God's people are called to be distinct from idolatrous practices. The phrase highlights the exclusivity of worship that God demands, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>, "You shall have no other gods before Me." This act of purging Baal worship can be seen as a type of Christ's cleansing of the temple in the New Testament, where Jesus drives out those who defile the holy place, emphasizing purity in worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was anointed to destroy the house of Ahab and eradicate Baal

captures a pivotal moment in Jehu&#8217;s God-authorized crusade against Baal worship. With Jehonadab beside him, Jehu enters the very stronghold of idolatry, asserts control, and calls for a clear divide between the LORD&#8217;s servants and Baal&#8217;s devotees. The verse models deliberate obedience, wise strategy, and the timeless requirement that God&#8217;s people remain distinct from false worship so that judgment falls only on the guilty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">And Jehu went . . . into the house</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, into the outer court before the temple, where all the worshippers were waiting.<p><span class= "bld">That there be here with you none of the servants of the Lord.</span>--This precaution of Jehu's suggests suspicion to a modern reader, but it would suggest the very contrary to the Baal-worshippers--viz., an extraordinary reverence for Baal; a dread lest some <span class= "ital">profane</span> person should be present in his sanctuary.<p><span class= "bld">Servants of the Lord.</span>--<span class= "ital">Worshippers of Jehovah.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal.</span> Keeping up the pretence that he was a devotee of Baal, anxious to "serve him much" (ver. 18), Jehu himself entered the sacred edifice, together with Jehonadab the son of Rechab, whom he wished to have as a witness to his "zeal for the Lord" (ver. 16). Having entered, he addressed the multitude, or the chief authorities among them, requiring that they should exercise extreme vigilance, and make it quite certain that none but true followers of Baal were present. <span class="cmt_word">And said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the Lord, but the worshippers of Baal only.</span> Jehu's real object was undoubtedly to save the lives of any "servants of Jehovah" who might incautiously have mixed themselves up with the Baal-wor-shippers, out of curiosity, or to have their share in the general holiday. That he should have thought such a thing possible or even probable indicates the general laxity of the time, and the want of any sharp line of demarcation between the adherents of the two religions. He cleverly masked his desire for the safety of his own religionists under a show of keen anxiety that the coming ceremonies should not be profaned by the presence of scoffers or indifferent persons.
