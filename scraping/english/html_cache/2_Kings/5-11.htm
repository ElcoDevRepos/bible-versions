His anger reflects his pride and expectations of how he should be treated, especially given his status. This reaction highlights the human tendency to rely on personal expectations rather than divine instructions. Naaman's anger can be compared to Jonah's anger in <a href="/jonah/4.htm">Jonah 4:1</a>, where personal expectations clash with God's plans.<p><b>saying, &#8220;I thought that he would surely come out</b><br>Naaman expected Elisha, the prophet, to personally attend to him, reflecting the cultural norms of honor and respect for high-ranking individuals. This expectation shows a misunderstanding of how God often works through humility and simplicity, rather than through grand gestures. It also underscores the theme of God's ways being higher than human ways, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>.<p><b>stand and call on the name of the LORD his God</b><br>Naaman anticipated a dramatic, ritualistic healing, which was common in pagan practices. This expectation reveals his lack of understanding of the God of Israel, who does not require elaborate rituals to act. The phrase "call on the name of the LORD" is significant throughout Scripture, indicating reliance on God's power and presence, as seen in <a href="/genesis/4-26.htm">Genesis 4:26</a> and <a href="/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>.<p><b>and wave his hand over the spot</b><br>This expectation of a physical gesture for healing reflects the influence of magical practices common in ancient Near Eastern cultures. Naaman's assumption shows his unfamiliarity with the prophetic tradition in Israel, where God's power is not dependent on human actions or rituals. This contrasts with Jesus' healing ministry, where physical touch or gestures were sometimes used, but always as a demonstration of divine authority (e.g., <a href="/mark/7-32.htm">Mark 7:32-35</a>).<p><b>to cure my leprosy</b><br>Leprosy in the Bible often symbolizes sin and impurity, requiring divine intervention for cleansing. Naaman's desire for healing is not just physical but also carries a deeper spiritual significance. The cleansing of leprosy is a type of the cleansing from sin that Jesus offers, as seen in the healing of lepers in the Gospels (e.g., <a href="/luke/5-12.htm">Luke 5:12-13</a>). Naaman's eventual healing foreshadows the inclusivity of God's grace, extending beyond Israel to the Gentiles, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naaman.htm">Naaman</a></b><br>A commander of the army of the king of Aram, Naaman was a valiant soldier but suffered from leprosy.

To be curtly told, "Go, wash in Jordan," by the prophet's servant, without the prophet himself condescending to make himself visible, would have been trying to any Oriental's temper, and to one of Naaman's rank and position might well seem an insult. The Syrian general had pictured to himself a very different scene. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the Name of the Lord his God, and strike his hand over the place, and recover the leper</span>; rather, take away <span class="accented">the leprosy</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, LXX.). Naaman had imagined a striking scene, whereof he was to be the central figure, the prophet descending, with perhaps a wand of office, the attendants drawn up on either side, the passers-by standing to gaze - a solemn invocation of the Deity, a waving to and fro of the wand in the prophet's hand, and a sudden manifest cure, wrought in the open street of the city, before the eyes of men, and at once noised abroad through the capital, so as to make him "the observed of all observers, the cynosure of all neighboring eyes." Instead of this, he is bidden to go as he came, to ride twenty miles to the stream of the Jordan, generally muddy, or at least discolored, and there to wash himself, with none to look on but his own attendants, with no <span class="accented">eclat</span>, no pomp or circumstance, no glory of surroundings. It is not surprising that he was disappointed and vexed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/5-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But Naaman</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1464;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(na&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;m&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5283.htm">Strong's 5283: </a> </span><span class="str2">Naaman -- a descendant of Benjamin, also an Aramean (Syrian) general</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went away</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1500;&#1463;&#1425;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;la&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
