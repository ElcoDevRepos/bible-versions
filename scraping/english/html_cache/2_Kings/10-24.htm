The context is Jehu's purge of Baal worship from Israel, a significant event in the religious history of the nation. Sacrifices and burnt offerings were central to both Yahwistic and pagan worship, but here they are part of a deceptive plan by Jehu to eliminate Baal worshipers. This reflects the ongoing struggle between the worship of Yahweh and the infiltration of Canaanite religious practices. The act of offering sacrifices was meant to appease or honor a deity, and in the context of Israel, it was supposed to be directed to Yahweh alone, as seen in the laws given in Leviticus.<p><b>Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside</b><br>Jehu's strategic placement of eighty men highlights his military acumen and determination to eradicate Baal worship. The number eighty may symbolize completeness or a significant force, ensuring that none of the Baal worshipers could escape. This action is part of Jehu's broader campaign to consolidate his power and purify the religious practices of Israel, aligning with the prophetic mandate given to him by Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/9-6.htm">2 Kings 9:6-10</a>). The use of stationed men also reflects the militaristic approach often necessary in the turbulent times of the divided kingdom.<p><b>and warned them, &#8220;If anyone allows one of the men I am delivering into your hands to escape,</b><br>Jehu's warning underscores the seriousness of his mission and the absolute nature of his command. The phrase "delivering into your hands" suggests divine sanction, as Jehu was anointed by a prophet to execute judgment on the house of Ahab and the worshipers of Baal. This reflects the biblical theme of divine justice and the use of human agents to fulfill God's purposes. The warning also indicates the high stakes involved, as allowing an escape would undermine Jehu's authority and the religious reform he was enacting.<p><b>he will forfeit his life for theirs.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase illustrates the principle of life for life, a form of justice seen in the law of retribution (lex talionis) found in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23-25</a>). It emphasizes the gravity of the task and the accountability expected of those carrying out Jehu's orders. The severe consequence reflects the importance of eradicating idolatry from Israel, a recurring theme in the Old Testament where the purity of worship is paramount. This also foreshadows the ultimate justice and accountability before God, a theme that runs throughout Scripture and is fulfilled in the New Testament through the person and work of Jesus Christ, who offers redemption and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was anointed to destroy the house of Ahab and eradicate Baal worship from Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/baal_worshipers.htm">Baal Worshipers</a></b><br>Followers of the Canaanite god Baal, who were gathered for a sacrificial ceremony.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/eighty_men.htm">Eighty Men</a></b><br>Soldiers stationed by Jehu to ensure that none of the Baal worshipers escaped.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_of_baal.htm">Temple of Baal</a></b><br>The location where the Baal worshipers gathered for sacrifices, which Jehu used as a trap.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrifices_and_burnt_offerings.htm">Sacrifices and Burnt Offerings</a></b><br>Religious rituals performed by the Baal worshipers, which Jehu used as an opportunity to execute judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/z/zeal_for_god's_honor.htm">Zeal for God's Honor</a></b><br>Jehu's actions demonstrate a fervent commitment to honoring God by eliminating idolatry.

The verse teaches that God&#8217;s servants must combine zeal with disciplined obedience, uphold personal accountability, and tolerate no compromise with idolatry, affirming the Lord&#8217;s unwavering standard of holiness and justice.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">When.</span>--Omit.<p><span class= "bld">They went in.</span>--The priests and prophets went into the inner court of the Baal temple, which probably resembled in general construction that of Jehovah at Jerusalem.<p><span class= "bld">Sacrifices and burnt offerings</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, peace offerings and burnt offerings, which could only be offered in an open court.<p><span class= "bld">Jehu appointed fourscore men without.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">now Jehu had set him on the outside</span> (of the building) <span class= "ital">fourscore men.</span><p><span class= "bld">If any of the men . . . life of him.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">The man that escapeth of the men whom I am bringing into your hands</span>--<span class= "ital">his life for his life!</span> This is a little incoherent, as is natural in energetic speech, but the sense is clear. Thenius, however, suggests that the verb "escapeth" should be pointed as a <span class= "ital">transitive</span> form (<span class= "ital">pihel</span> instead of <span class= "ital">niphal</span>). This gives: "The man that letteth escape any of the men," &c., an improvement that may be right, although the old versions agree with the present Hebrew pointing of the word.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they went in</span> - rather, <span class="accented">when they had gone in</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when the whole multitude of Baal-worshippers, priests and people, had entered within the precincts of the temple - <span class="cmt_word">to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings.</span> The priests officiate, but the offerings are regarded as conjointly made by priest and people. <span class="cmt_word">Jehu appointed four score men without.</span> Josephus says ('Ant.
