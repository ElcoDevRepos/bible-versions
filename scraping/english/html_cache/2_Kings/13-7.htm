His lack of a substantial army reflects the weakened state of Israel due to ongoing conflicts and divine judgment. This situation fulfills the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>, where disobedience to God would lead to military defeat.<p><b>except fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers</b><br>The remnants of Jehoahaz's army are strikingly small, especially compared to the military might of other nations at the time. Chariots and horsemen were crucial for warfare in the ancient Near East, and having only fifty horsemen and ten chariots indicates a severely diminished capacity for defense and offense. This small number highlights Israel's vulnerability and dependence on God for deliverance, as seen in other biblical accounts like Gideon's victory with a small force in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>.<p><b>because the king of Aram had destroyed them</b><br>The king of Aram, likely Hazael or his son Ben-Hadad, was a persistent adversary of Israel. The Arameans' success against Israel can be seen as a consequence of Israel's idolatry and failure to follow God's commandments. This reflects the cyclical pattern of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance found throughout the book of Judges.<p><b>and made them like the dust at threshing</b><br>This simile emphasizes the totality of the destruction. Threshing was a process of separating grain from chaff, and the imagery of dust suggests complete obliteration and humiliation. This phrase echoes the language of judgment found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a>, where the wicked are compared to chaff blown away by the wind.

The nation that once crossed the Jordan under Joshua with hundreds of thousands of warriors (<a href="/joshua/4-13.htm">Joshua 4:13</a>) now teeters on the edge of military extinction. What happened? Earlier in the chapter the text says, &#8220;Hazael king of Aram oppressed Israel throughout the reign of Jehoahaz&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/13-22.htm">2 Kings 13:22</a>). The verse we are studying is the statistical proof of that oppression.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Fifty horsemen&#8212;cavalry in tatters</b><p>&#8226; Horses gave speed and shock power (<a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>).

The crippled cavalry shows that warning fulfilled.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ten chariots&#8212;symbols of lost prestige</b><p>&#8226; Chariots were the ancient equivalent of armored vehicles (<a href="/exodus/14-6.htm">Exodus 14:6-7</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-35.htm">1 Kings 22:35</a>). Solomon once boasted 1,400 chariots (<a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>); Jehoahaz now counts ten.<p>&#8226; The drastic shrinkage underlines how far Israel has fallen since the united monarchy. Chariots often symbolized trust in human strength (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>); their absence exposes the futility of that misplaced confidence.<p>&#8226; Even with so few, God would later use the chariots and horses of Israel in victory through Joash (<a href="/2_kings/13-17.htm">2 Kings 13:17</a>), showing that He can save by &#8220;many or by few&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ten thousand foot soldiers&#8212;a fraction of former strength</b><p>&#8226; David once mustered 1.3 million foot soldiers (<a href="/2_samuel/24-9.htm">2 Samuel 24:9</a>). Jehoahaz now commands just ten thousand.<p>&#8226; This drastic downsizing fulfills the curse of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>, &#8220;You will come at them from one direction but flee from them in seven.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Though small, the number is significant: God often allows a remnant so His people cannot claim credit (<a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>; <a href="/romans/9-29.htm">Romans 9:29</a>). The remaining troops become a canvas for grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The king of Aram&#8212;the instrument of judgment</b><p>&#8226; Hazael (and later Ben-hadad) relentlessly hammered Israel (<a href="/2_kings/13-3.htm">2 Kings 13:3</a>). God repeatedly uses pagan nations as rods of discipline (<a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet Aram&#8217;s power is not ultimate. Verses 4-5 show the Lord raising a deliverer when Jehoahaz seeks His face&#8212;a reminder that chastening aims at repentance, not annihilation (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6-11</a>).<p>&#8226; The oppression also highlights God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness. He promised both blessing for obedience and discipline for rebellion (<a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>); Aram becomes the visible agent of that discipline.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Made like the dust at threshing&#8212;total humiliation</b><p>&#8226; Threshing floors separate grain from husk; what remains of the husk becomes worthless dust (<a href="/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15-16</a>). The picture is one of Israel&#8217;s troops pulverized beyond recognition.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/1-4.htm">Psalm 1:4</a> echoes the idea: &#8220;The wicked are like chaff that the wind drives away.&#8221; Israel, acting wickedly through idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/13-2.htm">2 Kings 13:2</a>), experiences that same scattering.<p>&#8226; Yet the metaphor also hints at hope. Threshing removes what is useless so the valuable grain can be gathered.

(Comp. <a href="/2_samuel/22-43.htm" title="Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.">2Samuel 22:43</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-6.htm" title="I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.">Isaiah 10:6</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen.</span> This verse seems to be an exegetical note on ver. 4, which perhaps it once followed immediately, the parenthetic section (vers. 5 and 6) having been added later, as an afterthought, either by the original writer, or perhaps by a later hand. The meaning seems to be that Hazael limited the standing army of Jehoahaz to fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen, not that he slew the entire military population except this small remnant. The policy of limiting the forces to be maintained by a subject-king was one known to the Romans, and has often been adopted in the East. It is still a part of our own policy in the government of India. The limitation left the country at the mercy of all its neighbors (see ver. 20). <span class="cmt_word">For the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.</span> Possibly this means no more than an utter destruction - a trampling in the dust, as we phrase it (see <a href="/jeremiah/51-33.htm">Jeremiah 51:33</a>; <a href="/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12, 13</a>; and perhaps <a href="/isaiah/21-10.htm">Isaiah 21:10</a>). But it may be an allusion to that destruction of prisoners by means of a threshing instrument, which was certainly sometimes practiced (<a href="/2_samuel/12-31.htm">2 Samuel 12:31</a>; <a href="/proverbs/20-26.htm">Proverbs 20:26</a>), and which is made a special charge against Damascus (<a href="/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>. See Pusey's 'Minor Prophets,' p. 158). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/13-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Jehoahaz</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1488;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1436;&#1494;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#238;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#257;z)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
