His reign is marked by extreme idolatry and violence. The phrase "innocent blood" refers to the unjust killing of those who were righteous or undeserving of death. This could include prophets, priests, and other faithful followers of Yahweh who opposed his idolatrous practices. The shedding of innocent blood is a grave sin in the biblical context, as seen in <a href="/genesis/4-10.htm">Genesis 4:10</a> with Abel's blood crying out to God and in <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-17</a>, where God lists hands that shed innocent blood as something He hates.<p><b>that he filled Jerusalem from end to end</b><br>This hyperbolic expression emphasizes the extent of Manasseh's atrocities. Jerusalem, the holy city, was meant to be a place of worship and justice, yet under Manasseh, it became a place of widespread violence and corruption. The phrase suggests that the entire city was affected by his actions, leaving no part untouched by his reign of terror. This widespread bloodshed would have contributed to the moral and spiritual decline of the nation, setting the stage for future judgment.<p><b>in addition to the sin that he had caused Judah to commit</b><br>Manasseh's influence led Judah into deep sin, primarily through the introduction and promotion of idolatry. He rebuilt high places, erected altars for Baal, and even placed an Asherah pole in the temple (<a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3-7</a>). His actions caused the people to stray from the covenant with Yahweh, violating the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This phrase highlights the king's responsibility for leading the nation into sin, a theme echoed in other parts of Scripture where leaders are held accountable for the spiritual state of their people (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/14-16.htm">1 Kings 14:16</a>).<p><b>doing evil in the sight of the LORD</b><br>This phrase is a common biblical expression used to describe actions that are contrary to God's will and commandments. It underscores the divine perspective on Manasseh's reign, contrasting human actions with God's holy standards. The evil done by Manasseh was not just political or social but was primarily spiritual, as it directly opposed the worship and laws of Yahweh. This phrase is a reminder of the ultimate accountability to God, as seen in other biblical narratives where kings are judged based on their faithfulness to God's commands (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/15-11.htm">1 Kings 15:11</a>, <a href="/2_kings/18-3.htm">2 Kings 18:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>King of Judah, known for his idolatry and leading the nation into sin.

The phrase &#8220;innocent blood&#8221; reminds us that God values life and holds people accountable when it is wrongfully taken (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-10.htm">Deuteronomy 19:10</a>; <a href="/proverbs/6-17.htm">Proverbs 6:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Manasseh&#8217;s violence was not collateral damage from war but deliberate murder&#8212;likely including prophets such as Isaiah, common citizens, and even his own children (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-6.htm">2 Chronicles 33:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/106-38.htm">Psalm 106:38</a>).<p>&#8226; God had warned that shedding innocent blood pollutes the land and invites judgment (<a href="/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>; <a href="/2_kings/24-4.htm">2 Kings 24:4</a>). Manasseh&#8217;s actions therefore placed Judah under a curse that would not be easily lifted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that he filled Jerusalem from end to end</b><p>&#8226; The wording paints a chilling picture: the city was saturated with blood &#8220;from one end to the other&#8221; (cf. <a href="/lamentations/4-13.htm">Lamentations 4:13</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/19-4.htm">Jeremiah 19:4</a>).<p>&#8226; This hyperbolic yet literal description stresses the scale of brutality&#8212;violence infiltrated every neighborhood.<p>&#8226; Such widespread injustice echoes earlier warnings that sin affects an entire community, not just isolated individuals (<a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1, 11</a>). Judah could not claim ignorance; evidence of cruelty was visible everywhere.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in addition to the sin that he had caused Judah to commit</b><p>&#8226; Manasseh&#8217;s guilt was twofold: personal atrocities and corporate corruption. He &#8220;led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray to do worse evil than the nations&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-9.htm">2 Chronicles 33:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Leadership carries weight. When a king promotes idolatry, the people follow (<a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3&#8211;5</a>). Jesus later warns, &#8220;Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him to have a great millstone hung around his neck&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently teaches that causing others to sin multiplies responsibility (<a href="/romans/14-13.htm">Romans 14:13</a>; <a href="/hosea/4-9.htm">Hosea 4:9</a>). Manasseh&#8217;s reign became a pivot point pushing Judah toward the Babylonian exile.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>doing evil in the sight of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The verse ends with God&#8217;s verdict. What matters is not public opinion but how actions appear &#8220;in the sight of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The familiar phrase in Kings&#8212;used of many rulers&#8212;underscores an unchanging moral standard. Idolatry, murder, and leading others into sin are &#8220;evil&#8221; regardless of cultural acceptance (<a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the Lord sees and judges righteously (<a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>), unchecked evil will not escape His notice. Manasseh&#8217;s later repentance (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-12.htm">2 Chronicles 33:12-13</a>) shows mercy is available, but the consequences of sin may still unfold (<a href="/2_kings/24-3.htm">2 Kings 24:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a> exposes the depth of Manasseh&#8217;s depravity: rampant bloodshed, city-wide violence, the seduction of an entire nation into sin, and a life lived in blatant defiance of God. The verse warns that innocent blood cries out, leadership influences multitudes, and all deeds are measured by the Lord&#8217;s unerring standard.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--The narrative is taken up again from <a href="/2_kings/21-9.htm" title="But they listened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel.">2Kings 21:9</a>. The "innocent blood" shed by Manasseh was that of the prophets of Jehovah and their followers. "As the nation fell back into the grooves of its old existence, ancient customs began to reassert their sway. The worship which the prophets condemned, and which Hezekiah had proscribed, was too deeply interwoven with all parts of life to be uprooted by royal decree, and the old prejudice of the country folk against the capital, so clearly apparent in (the pages of the prophet) Micah, must have co-operated with superstition to bring about the strong revulsion against the new reforms which took place under Hezekiah's son, Manasseh. A bloody struggle ensued between the conservative party and the followers of the prophets, and the new king was on the side of the reaction (<span class= "ital">Robertson Smith</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Talmudic tradition relates that Isaiah himself was sawn asunder in the trunk of a cedar tree in which he had taken refuge. (Comp. <a href="/hebrews/11-37.htm" title="They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;">Hebrews 11:37</a>. This is, perhaps, not impossible, but hardly probable. Ewald considers that <a href="/jeremiah/2-30.htm" title="In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.">Jeremiah 2:30</a>, <a href="/psalms/141-7.htm" title="Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cuts and splits wood on the earth.">Psalm 141:7</a>, and Isaiah 53, allude to the persecution of the prophets by Manasseh.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much.</span> We must not understand this of his own offerings to Moloch, for these have been already put on record against him (ver. 6), and this is something additional (note the strong expression, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>), nor even of the multitudinous sacrifices of the same kind which were the result of his influence on the people. Some culminating horror is required, something not touched upon before, and something specially attaching to the monarch himself. These conditions are answered by supposing a bloody persecution of the faithful to be intended. Josephus declares positively that Manasseh "cruelly put to death all the righteous among the Hebrews, and did not even spare the prophets" ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:3. &sect; 1). A tradition, very widely received, declared Isaiah to have been one of the victims ('Gemara Jebam.,' 4:13; 'Sanhedr.,' f. 103; Tertullian, 'De Patientia,' &sect; 14; Augustine, 'De Cir. Dei,' 18:24, etc.). Stanley says, "A reign of terror commenced against all who ventured to resist the reaction. Day by day a fresh batch of the prophetic order were ordered for execution. It seemed as if a devouring lion were let loose against them. From end to end of Jerusalem were to be seen traces of their blood.
