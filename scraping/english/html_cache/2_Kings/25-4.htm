The breaching of the city walls signifies the fall of Jerusalem, a pivotal event in Jewish history. This breach fulfilled the prophecies of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/21-4.htm">Jeremiah 21:4-7</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/24.htm">Ezekiel 24:1-2</a>), who warned of Jerusalem's destruction due to the people's disobedience and idolatry.<p><b>and though the Chaldeans had surrounded the city,</b><br>The Chaldeans, also known as Babylonians, were led by King Nebuchadnezzar. Their encirclement of Jerusalem was a common military tactic to cut off supplies and weaken the city's defenses. This siege is part of the larger Babylonian conquest, which was a tool of divine judgment against Judah for its persistent sin (<a href="/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2-4</a>).<p><b>all the men of war fled by night</b><br>The flight of the soldiers indicates a desperate and chaotic retreat. Despite their duty to defend the city, the overwhelming power of the Babylonian forces led to their escape attempt. This act of fleeing fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/jeremiah/39-4.htm">Jeremiah 39:4</a>, where it was foretold that the king and his soldiers would try to escape.<p><b>by way of the gate between the two walls near the king&#8217;s garden.</b><br>This specific location suggests a strategic escape route, possibly less guarded or known only to the city's leaders. The king's garden is believed to be located near the southeastern part of Jerusalem, close to the Kidron Valley. Archaeological findings suggest this area was part of the city's royal complex, indicating the escape was planned by those with intimate knowledge of the city's layout.<p><b>They headed toward the Arabah,</b><br>The Arabah refers to the region south of the Dead Sea, a desert area that provided a potential escape route towards the wilderness. This direction suggests an attempt to flee towards the safety of the Jordan Valley or beyond. The Arabah's harsh terrain would have made pursuit difficult, but it also highlights the desperation of the fleeing soldiers.

A breach was made in the wall with battering-rams, such as are depicted in the Assyrian sculptures. The Chaldaeans forced their entry on the north side of the city, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> they took the Lower City (<a href="/2_kings/22-14.htm" title="So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.">2Kings 22:14</a>). This is clear from <a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm" title="And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.">Jeremiah 39:3</a>, where it is said that, after effecting an entrance, their generals proceeded to assault "the middle gate," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the gate in the north wall of Zion, which separated the upper from the lower city. (See also <a href="/2_kings/14-13.htm" title="And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.">2Kings 14:13</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">All the men of war fled.</span>--The Hebrew here is defective, for it wants a verb, and mention of the king is implied by what follows. (See <a href="/jeremiah/39-4.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate between the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.">Jeremiah 39:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-7.htm" title="Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.">Jeremiah 52:7</a>.) A comparison of these parallels suggests the reading: "And Zedekiah king of Judah and all the men of war fled, and went out of the city by night," &c. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the city was broken up</span>; rather, <span class="accented">brown into</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a breach was made in the walls. Probably the breach was on the north side of the city, where the ground is nearly level (see <a href="/ezekiel/9-2.htm">Ezekiel 9:2</a>). According to Josephus ('Ant.

As the enemy broke in on the north, the king and garrison quitted the city on the south by a gate which opened into the Tyropoeon valley, between the two walls that guarded the town on either side of it. <span class="cmt_word">Which is by the king's garden.</span> The royal gardens were situated near the Pool of Siloam, at the mouth of the Tyrepoeon, and near the junction of the Hinnom with the Kidron valley (see Josephus, 'Ant.

(<span class="cmt_word">Now the Chaldees were against the city round about.</span>) The town, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, <span class="accented">was</span> guarded on all sides by Chaldean troops, so that Zedekiah and his soldiers must either have attacked the line of guard, and broken through it, or have slipped between two of the blockading pests under cover of the darkness.
