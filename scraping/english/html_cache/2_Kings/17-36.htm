In the context of <a href="/2_kings/17.htm">2 Kings 17</a>, the Israelites were condemned for their syncretism and idolatry. The call to worship the LORD alone is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament, seen in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and reiterated by prophets like Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>).<p><b>who brought you out of the land of Egypt</b><br>This reference to the Exodus is a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing God's deliverance and covenant relationship with His people. It serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and power. The Exodus is frequently cited in the Old Testament as a demonstration of God's ability to save and His rightful claim to Israel's worship (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-6.htm">Deuteronomy 5:6</a>).<p><b>with great power and an outstretched arm</b><br>This phrase highlights God's might and intervention in human history. The "outstretched arm" is a metaphor for God's active involvement and strength in delivering Israel from slavery. It is a common biblical expression of divine power (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/32-21.htm">Jeremiah 32:21</a>) and foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who is seen as the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>You are to bow down to Him</b><br>Bowing down signifies submission, reverence, and worship. In ancient Near Eastern culture, bowing was a physical act of acknowledging authority and divinity. This command underscores the proper posture of worship and allegiance to God alone, contrasting with the Israelites' previous practices of bowing to idols (<a href="/2_kings/17-16.htm">2 Kings 17:16</a>).<p><b>and offer sacrifices to Him</b><br>Sacrifices were central to Israelite worship, serving as expressions of devotion, thanksgiving, and atonement. The sacrificial system, detailed in Leviticus, pointed to the need for reconciliation with God. In the New Testament, Jesus is seen as the ultimate sacrifice, fulfilling the sacrificial system and providing a way for believers to approach God (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God of Israel, who delivered the Israelites from slavery in Egypt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were brought out of Egypt and commanded to worship Yahweh alone.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land from which the Israelites were delivered, symbolizing bondage and oppression.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_exodus.htm">The Exodus</a></b><br>The event of God delivering the Israelites from Egyptian slavery, demonstrating His power and faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_northern_kingdom_of_israel.htm">The Northern Kingdom of Israel</a></b><br>The context of <a href="/bsb/2_kings/17.htm">2 Kings 17</a>, where the Israelites were warned against idolatry and reminded of their covenant with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/exclusive_worship.htm">Exclusive Worship</a></b><br>God demands exclusive worship because of His unique role as Creator and Redeemer.
