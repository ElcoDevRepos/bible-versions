His role here highlights the importance of the message he is delivering. The king referred to is Josiah, who reigned in Judah from approximately 640 to 609 BC. Josiah was known for his reforms and dedication to the worship of Yahweh. This moment is pivotal in his reign, as it sets the stage for religious reform based on the rediscovery of the Law.<p><b>Hilkiah the priest has given me a book</b><br>Hilkiah was the high priest at the time, serving in the temple in Jerusalem. The "book" mentioned is widely understood to be a scroll of the Law, likely a portion of Deuteronomy or the entire Pentateuch. This discovery is significant because it suggests that the Law had been neglected or lost during previous reigns, particularly under the idolatrous practices of kings like Manasseh and Amon. The rediscovery of the Law is a catalyst for Josiah's reforms, emphasizing the importance of Scripture in guiding the nation.<p><b>And Shaphan read it in the presence of the king</b><br>The act of reading the book to the king underscores the oral tradition and the importance of hearing the Word of God. In ancient Israel, reading aloud was a common practice, especially for legal and religious texts. This public reading signifies the authority of the text and its role in shaping the king's response. Josiah's reaction to hearing the Law is one of repentance and action, leading to a national renewal of the covenant with God. This moment foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on the transformative power of Scripture, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>, where faith comes by hearing the Word of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/shaphan_the_scribe.htm">Shaphan the Scribe</a></b><br>A royal secretary or scribe who served King Josiah.
