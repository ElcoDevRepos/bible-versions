The Arameans, also known as the Syrians, were besieging Samaria, leading to a severe famine. God's miraculous action here is reminiscent of other instances in the Bible where He uses supernatural means to deliver His people, such as the confusion of the Egyptian army at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24-25</a>). The sound of chariots and horses, which were not physically present, demonstrates God's power to manipulate perception and reality to fulfill His purposes. This event underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and His ability to protect and deliver His people against overwhelming odds.<p><b>so that they said to one another,</b><br>The Arameans' reaction to the sound they heard shows their fear and confusion. This internal dialogue among the Arameans reflects a common biblical motif where God causes the enemies of His people to turn against themselves or flee in panic (<a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/20-22.htm">2 Chronicles 20:22-23</a>). It illustrates how God can instill fear and confusion in the hearts of those who oppose His will, leading to their downfall without the need for physical confrontation by His people.<p><b>&#8220;Look, the king of Israel must have hired the kings of the Hittites and Egyptians to attack us.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reveals the geopolitical context of the time. The Hittites and Egyptians were powerful nations known for their military strength. The Arameans' assumption that Israel had allied with these formidable forces indicates their fear of a coalition that could easily overpower them. Historically, the Hittites were a significant power in Anatolia, and Egypt was a dominant force in the region, often involved in the politics of Canaan and surrounding areas. This assumption also reflects the common practice of hiring mercenaries or forming alliances for military support, as seen in other parts of the Old Testament (<a href="/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18-20</a>). The mention of these nations highlights the perceived threat and the extent of the panic that God instilled in the Arameans, leading to their hasty retreat.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>The sovereign God who orchestrates events for His purposes, demonstrating His power and control over all nations.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_arameans.htm">The Arameans</a></b><br>A group of people who were enemies of Israel, besieging Samaria during this time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_israel.htm">The King of Israel</a></b><br>At this time, Jehoram (also known as Joram), who was ruling the northern kingdom of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hittites_and_egyptians.htm">The Hittites and Egyptians</a></b><br>Neighboring nations perceived by the Arameans as potential allies of Israel due to the sound they heard.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the northern kingdom of Israel, which was under siege by the Arameans.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_deliverance.htm">God's Sovereignty in Deliverance</a></b><br>God is in control of all circumstances and can deliver His people in unexpected ways.

The tract of north Syria between the Euphrates and the Orontes was the cradle of the Hittite race, and it was over this that these kings of the several tribes bore sway. In the thirteenth century (B.C. ) their power extended over great part of Asia Minor, as rock inscriptions prove. Carchemish, Kadesh, Hamath, and Helbon (<span class= "ital">Aleppo</span>) were their capitals. Rameses II. made a treaty of peace with <span class= "ital">Heta-sira</span>, the prince of the Hittites. In the time of Tiglath Pileser I. (B.C. 1120), the Hittites were still paramount from the Euphrates to the Lebanon. Shalmaneser II. mentions a Hittite prince, Sapalulme, king of the <span class= "ital">Patinaa</span>, a tribe on the Orontes. The Hittites from whom Solomon exacted forced labour were those who were left in the land of Israel (comp. Genesis 23, <a href="/genesis/26-34.htm" title="And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:">Genesis 26:34</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/31-6.htm" title="So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor bearer, and all his men, that same day together.">1Samuel 31:6</a>), <span class= "ital">not</span> the people of the great cities mentioned above, which remained independent, as we know from the Assyrian inscriptions. (Comp. <a href="/amos/6-2.htm" title="Pass you to Calneh, and see; and from there go you to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?">Amos 6:2</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/8-4.htm" title="And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store cities, which he built in Hamath.">2Chronicles 8:4</a> for <span class= "ital">Hamath.</span>) Tiglath Pileser II. conquered Hamath (B.C. 740). Twenty years later it revolted under Yahubihdi ("Jah is around me;" comp. <a href="/psalms/3-3.htm" title="But you, O LORD, are a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of my head.">Psalm 3:3</a>), but was again reduced, and made an Assyrian prefecture by Sargon, who afterwards stormed Carchemish (B.C. 717). (Comp. <a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm" title="And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelled in the cities thereof.">2Kings 17:24</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-30.htm" title="And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,">2Kings 17:30</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host.</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>, voice, is used for noises of any kind (see <a href="/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/42-7.htm">Psalm 42:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/93-4.htm">Psalm 93:4</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/47-3.htm">Jeremiah 47:3</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/1-24.htm">Ezekiel 1:24</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/3-13.htm">Ezekiel 3:13</a>; <a href="/joel/2-5.htm">Joel 2:5</a>; <a href="/nahum/3-2.htm">Nahum 3:2</a>), though generally for those in which the human voice preponderated. A noise like that of chariots and of horses and of a great host (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;&#x5b4;&#x20;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5dc;</span>) was borne in upon the ears of the Syrians about nightfall of the day on which Jehoram had determined to put Elisha to death; and, as they expected no reinforcements, they naturally concluded that succor had arrived to help their enemy. How the noise was produced it is impossible to say. Na-rural causes are insufficient; and the writer evidently regards the event as miraculous: "The <span class="accented">Lord had made</span> the host of the Syrians to hear a noise," etc. Nothing can be more weak and irrelevant than to remark, with Bahr," There are instances, even nowadays, that people in certain mountainous regions regard a rushing and roaring sound, such as is sometimes heard there, as a sign of coming war." The Syrians thought they heard the actual arrival of a vast army. <span class="cmt_word">And they said one to another, Lo, the King of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites.</span> This supposition has been thought "strange," almost inexplicable. "No such nation as the Hittites any longer existed," says Mr. Sumner ('The Books of the Kings,' vol. 2. p. 72, Eng. trans.). But the Assyrian records of the <span class="date">ninth and eighth centuries B.C.</span> make it evident, not only that the Hittites still existed at that date, but that they were among the most powerful enemies of the Ninevite kings, being located in Northern Syria, about Carchemish (Jerabus) and the adjacent country. It is also apparent that they did not form a centralized monarchy, but were governed by a number of chiefs, or "kings," twelve of whom are mentioned in one place (G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' p. 112). It was no very improbable supposition on the part of the Syrians that Jehoram had called in the aid of the Hittite confederacy, and that they had marched an army to his assistance. <span class="cmt_word">And the kings of the Egyptians.</span> "The plural, kings of the Egyptians," says Keil, "is not to be pressed. It is probably occasioned only by the parallel expression,' kings of the Hittites.'" But Egyptian history shows us that about this date Egypt was becoming disintegrated, and that two or three distinct dynasties were sometimes ruling at the same time, in different parts of the country - one at Bubastis another at Thebes, a third at Tanis, occasionally a fourth at Memphis (see "Ancient Egypt," in 'The Story of the Nations,' p. 311). The writer thus shows a knowledge of the internal condition of Egypt which we should not have expected. To come upon us; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to fall upon us from the north and from the south at the same time. In their panic, the Syrians did not stop to weigh probabilities, or to think how unlikely it was that such a simultaneous attack could have been arranged between powers so remote one from the other. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/7-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1438;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
