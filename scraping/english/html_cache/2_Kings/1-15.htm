This phrase indicates divine intervention and guidance, emphasizing God's direct involvement in the events. Elijah, a major prophet in Israel, often received direct communication from God, highlighting his role as a mediator between God and the people.<p><b>Go down with him</b><br>This command signifies a change in Elijah's previous stance, as he had initially resisted the king's messengers. The directive to "go down" implies submission to God's will and a readiness to confront the king. It also reflects the geographical movement from the highlands where Elijah was, down to the king's location, possibly in Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel.<p><b>Do not be afraid of him</b><br>This reassurance addresses the potential fear of King Ahaziah, who had sent soldiers to capture Elijah. The king's hostility towards Elijah was due to the prophet's pronouncements against his idolatry and sin. The command not to fear underscores God's protection over Elijah, a theme consistent throughout Scripture, where God often tells His servants not to fear when they are in His will (e.g., <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>).<p><b>So Elijah got up and went down with him to the king</b><br>Elijah's obedience to God's command demonstrates his faith and trust in God's protection. This act of obedience is significant, as it shows Elijah's willingness to confront the king despite the danger. It also prefigures Christ's obedience to the Father, even unto death. Elijah's journey to the king can be seen as a type of Christ's mission to confront sin and bring God's message to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger who communicates God's will to Elijah.
