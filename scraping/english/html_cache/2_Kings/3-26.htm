This battle was part of a larger conflict involving Israel, Judah, and Edom against Moab. The intensity of the battle reflects the fulfillment of the prophecy against Moab due to their rebellion against Israel (<a href="/2_kings/1.htm">2 Kings 1:1</a>). The Moabite Stone, an archaeological artifact, provides additional context, describing Mesha's revolt and victories, though it omits this defeat.<p><b>he took with him seven hundred swordsmen</b><br>The number seven hundred indicates a significant, though not overwhelming, force, suggesting a desperate attempt rather than a full-scale assault. Swordsmen were elite troops, emphasizing the king's determination to change the battle's outcome. This mirrors other biblical instances where small groups were used in critical moments, such as Gideon's 300 men (Judges 7).<p><b>to break through to the king of Edom</b><br>The king of Edom was part of the coalition against Moab. Moab's attempt to break through to Edom suggests a strategic move, possibly to capture or negotiate with the Edomite king, or to exploit perceived weaknesses. Edom's involvement highlights the complex political alliances of the time, as Edom was often in conflict with Israel and Judah (<a href="/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a>, <a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10</a>).<p><b>but they could not prevail</b><br>Despite their efforts, the Moabites failed to achieve their objective. This outcome underscores the futility of opposing God's will, as the coalition was divinely sanctioned (<a href="/2_kings/3-18.htm">2 Kings 3:18-19</a>). The inability to prevail also reflects the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over nations and battles, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_moab.htm">King of Moab</a></b><br>The ruler of Moab during this time, who is facing a coalition of Israel, Judah, and Edom.
