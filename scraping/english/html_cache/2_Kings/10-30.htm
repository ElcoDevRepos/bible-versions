Jehu was anointed by a prophet to become king (<a href="/2_kings/9.htm">2 Kings 9:1-3</a>), signifying God's direct involvement in his rise to power. This divine interaction underscores the biblical theme that God is sovereign over the affairs of nations and leaders.<p><b>Because you have done well in carrying out what is right in My sight</b><br>Jehu's actions were seen as fulfilling God's judgment against the house of Ahab, which had led Israel into idolatry and sin. This phrase emphasizes the biblical principle that obedience to God's commands is paramount. Jehu's zeal in eradicating Baal worship and executing Ahab's descendants (<a href="/2_kings/10-18.htm">2 Kings 10:18-28</a>) was considered righteous in the context of purging Israel of idolatry.<p><b>and have done to the house of Ahab all that was in My heart</b><br>This reflects God's judgment against Ahab's dynasty due to their idolatry and wickedness, as prophesied by Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-24</a>). Jehu's actions were a fulfillment of divine prophecy, demonstrating the biblical theme of God's justice and the certainty of His prophetic word. The destruction of Ahab's house was a necessary step in restoring Israel's covenant relationship with God.<p><b>four generations of your sons will sit on the throne of Israel</b><br>This promise to Jehu is a reward for his obedience, ensuring a dynastic succession for his descendants. Historically, this was fulfilled as Jehu's lineage continued through Jehoahaz, Jehoash, Jeroboam II, and Zechariah (2 Kings 13-15). This promise also highlights the biblical theme of God's faithfulness to His word, as well as the conditional nature of blessings based on obedience.

Earlier, the Lord had commissioned Elijah to anoint Jehu (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>), Elisha&#8217;s servant carried it out (<a href="/2_kings/9-6.htm">2 Kings 9:6-10</a>), and Jehu executed that charge with zeal (<a href="/2_kings/9-24.htm">2 Kings 9:24-37</a>). Now the same Lord evaluates Jehu&#8217;s performance. Such divine evaluations are seen with Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/3-10.htm">1 Kings 3:10-14</a>) and Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/18-5.htm">2 Kings 18:5-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because you have done well in carrying out what is right in My sight</b><p>God affirms Jehu&#8217;s obedience in destroying Baal worship and eliminating Ahab&#8217;s line (<a href="/2_kings/10-18.htm">2 Kings 10:18-28</a>). The emphasis is &#8220;in My sight,&#8221; underscoring that true righteousness is defined by God, not public opinion (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-25.htm">Deuteronomy 12:25</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-2.htm">Proverbs 21:2</a>). While Jehu&#8217;s motives may have been mixed, the specific actions met God&#8217;s righteous standard in this matter, contrasting with Saul&#8217;s partial obedience in <a href="/1_samuel/15-19.htm">1 Samuel 15:19-23</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and have done to the house of Ahab all that was in My heart</b><p>Jehu fulfilled prophecy spoken years earlier: Ahab&#8217;s house would be wiped out for idolatry and blood-guilt (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-24</a>). By executing Jezebel (<a href="/2_kings/9-30.htm">2 Kings 9:30-37</a>) and Ahab&#8217;s sons (<a href="/2_kings/10-1.htm">2 Kings 10:1-11</a>), Jehu carried out &#8220;all&#8221; that God intended. Comparable fulfillments include Joshua&#8217;s completion of judgment on Amalek (<a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-2.htm">1 Samuel 15:2</a>) and Josiah&#8217;s later purge of idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/23-16.htm">2 Kings 23:16-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>four generations of your sons will sit on the throne of Israel</b><p>God rewards Jehu with a dynastic promise: Jehoahaz, Jehoash, Jeroboam II, and Zechariah will reign (<a href="/2_kings/13-1.htm">2 Kings 13:1, 10</a>; 14:23; 15:8), exactly four generations, fulfilling <a href="/2_kings/15-12.htm">2 Kings 15:12</a>.

Yet it is limited; <a href="/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4</a> notes that the kingdom would end because Jehu&#8217;s line, like others, ultimately continued in sin. God&#8217;s faithfulness to His word&#8212;both promise and judgment&#8212;stands out (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30</a> shows God as the just Judge who acknowledges precise obedience even in imperfect servants. Jehu executed God&#8217;s prophesied judgment on Ahab, so the Lord granted his family four successive reigns. The verse reminds us that God keeps His word exactly, rewarding obedience and limiting blessing when hearts drift, underscoring both the certainty of His promises and the seriousness of wholehearted devotion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">And the Lord said.</span>--Perhaps through Elisha.<p><span class= "bld">And hast done.</span>--So the Syriac and Arabic versions.
