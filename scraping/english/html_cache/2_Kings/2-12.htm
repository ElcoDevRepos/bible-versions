His witnessing of Elijah's departure signifies the transfer of prophetic authority. This act of watching is reminiscent of the disciples witnessing Jesus' ascension, highlighting the importance of being a witness to divine acts.<p><b>he cried out, &#8220;My father, my father,</b><br>Elisha's cry reflects a deep personal and spiritual connection to Elijah, akin to a father-son relationship. This phrase indicates respect and acknowledgment of Elijah's role as a spiritual mentor. It parallels the relationship between Paul and Timothy in the New Testament, where spiritual mentorship is emphasized.<p><b>the chariots and horsemen of Israel!&#8221;</b><br>This phrase symbolizes the spiritual power and protection that Elijah represented for Israel. Chariots and horsemen were symbols of military strength, suggesting that Elijah's presence was a greater defense for Israel than any army. This imagery is echoed in <a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>, where Elisha's servant sees a heavenly army, indicating divine protection.<p><b>And he saw Elijah no more.</b><br>The physical departure of Elijah marks the end of an era and the beginning of Elisha's ministry. This moment is similar to the transition from Moses to Joshua, where leadership is passed on to continue God's work. Elijah's departure in a whirlwind is also a type of Christ's ascension, where the physical presence is removed, but the spiritual mission continues.<p><b>So taking hold of his own clothes,</b><br>The act of taking hold of his clothes signifies a moment of intense emotion and transition. In biblical times, clothing often represented one's status or role, and Elisha's action indicates a change in his own identity and responsibilities.<p><b>he tore them in two.</b><br>Tearing one's clothes is a traditional expression of grief and mourning in ancient Israelite culture, seen in <a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a> when Jacob mourns for Joseph. This act signifies Elisha's sorrow over Elijah's departure but also marks the end of his role as a disciple and the beginning of his own prophetic ministry. It reflects the tearing of the temple veil at Jesus' crucifixion, symbolizing a new covenant and access to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet and the successor of Elijah.

The Targum paraphrases, "My master, my master, who was better to Israel than chariots and horsemen by his prayers." The personal work and influence of a prophet like Elijah was the truest safeguard of Israel. The force of the expression will be seen, if it is remembered that chariots and horsemen constituted, in that age, the chief military arm, and were indispensable for the struggle against the Aramean states.
