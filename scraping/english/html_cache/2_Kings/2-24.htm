In the biblical context, turning around often signifies a moment of confrontation or decision. Elisha's turning around suggests he is addressing the situation directly and with authority. This action is reminiscent of other biblical figures who turn to address challenges or adversaries, such as Moses turning to face the Israelites' complaints.<p><b>looked at them</b><br>Elisha's gaze upon the boys is significant, as it implies a moment of judgment. In biblical narratives, the act of looking often precedes a divine or prophetic action. This mirrors instances where God or His prophets look upon a situation before intervening, such as God looking upon the earth before the flood in Genesis.<p><b>and called down a curse on them in the name of the LORD</b><br>Invoking the name of the LORD signifies the seriousness and authority of the curse. In ancient Israel, a curse was not merely a wish for harm but a pronouncement believed to have real power when spoken by a prophet. The use of God's name underscores that this is not a personal vendetta by Elisha but an act of divine justice. This reflects the biblical principle that God's name carries authority and power, as seen in the Ten Commandments' prohibition against taking the LORD's name in vain.<p><b>Suddenly two female bears came out of the woods</b><br>The sudden appearance of the bears indicates divine intervention. In the ancient Near East, bears were known to inhabit forested areas, and their emergence here is seen as a direct response to Elisha's curse. The specificity of "two female bears" may suggest a completeness or fullness of judgment. This event can be compared to other instances where God uses animals to fulfill His purposes, such as the lions in Daniel's den.<p><b>and mauled forty-two of the boys</b><br>The number forty-two is significant in biblical numerology, often associated with judgment and testing. The severity of the mauling serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of mocking God's appointed prophets. This incident highlights the seriousness with which God defends His messengers and the importance of respecting divine authority. It also serves as a type of Christ, as Jesus, too, faced mockery and rejection, yet His authority was ultimately vindicated.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God and the successor of Elijah.

Under the Law God's ministers were required to curse the disobedient (<a href="/deuteronomy/27-14.htm">Deuteronomy 27:14-26</a>). Elisha could not tell what would be the effect of his curse.
