Despite King Josiah's reforms and attempts to bring Judah back to covenant faithfulness, God's anger remained. This reflects the biblical principle that while human repentance can delay judgment, it does not always negate the consequences of past sins. The "fury of His burning anger" underscores God's holiness and justice, which demand accountability for sin. This is consistent with other instances in Scripture where God's wrath is described as a consuming fire (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>, <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>).<p><b>which was kindled against Judah</b><br>The term "kindled" suggests a fire that has been ignited and continues to burn. God's anger was not arbitrary but was a response to Judah's persistent idolatry and rebellion. Judah, the southern kingdom, had a history of fluctuating between faithfulness and apostasy. The kingdom's spiritual decline, especially under Manasseh, had reached a point where divine judgment was inevitable. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where blessings and curses were contingent upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28).<p><b>because of all that Manasseh had done</b><br>Manasseh, one of the most notorious kings of Judah, reigned for 55 years and led the nation into deep idolatry and sin (<a href="/2_kings/21.htm">2 Kings 21:1-18</a>). His actions included the erection of altars to Baal, the worship of celestial bodies, and even the sacrifice of his own son. Manasseh's reign is often seen as a turning point that sealed Judah's fate, as his sins were so egregious that they left a lasting impact on the nation. His reign is a stark reminder of the influence leaders have over their people and the long-term consequences of their actions.<p><b>to provoke Him to anger</b><br>The phrase "provoke Him to anger" indicates deliberate actions that incited God's wrath. This provocation was not merely a result of ignorance but a willful defiance of God's commandments. The idolatry and abominations committed under Manasseh were direct violations of the first and second commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). This provocation is echoed in other parts of Scripture where Israel's unfaithfulness is likened to spiritual adultery (<a href="/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6-10</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>). The severity of Judah's sins under Manasseh serves as a warning of the dangers of turning away from God and the inevitable judgment that follows.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is just and righteous, and whose wrath is kindled by sin and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which was under God's judgment due to its persistent idolatry and disobedience.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>A former king of Judah whose reign was marked by extreme idolatry and evil practices, leading to God's wrath.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah at the time of this verse, known for his reforms and attempts to bring the nation back to the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wrath_of_god.htm">Wrath of God</a></b><br>The divine response to sin and rebellion, emphasizing God's holiness and justice.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin has serious consequences, not only for individuals but for entire communities and nations.

Thirty years of irreligion and idolatry under Manasseh had sapped the national vigor, and made true repentance an impossibility. How weak and half-hearted must have been the return to God towards the close of Manasseh's reign, that it should have had no strength to resist Amon, a youth of twenty-two, but should have disappeared wholly on his accession! And how far from sincere must have been the present conformity to the wishes of Josiah, the professed renewal of the covenant (ver. 3), and revival of disused ceremonies (vers. 21-23)!
