His reign is noted for the partial restoration of Israel's territories. The lineage here is significant as it highlights the continuation of the Jehu dynasty, which was marked by a mix of faithfulness and idolatry. Jehoash's actions are seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to Jehu that his descendants would sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation (<a href="/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30</a>).<p><b>took back from Ben-hadad son of Hazael</b><br>Ben-hadad was the king of Aram (Syria), succeeding his father Hazael. The Arameans were long-time adversaries of Israel, often engaging in battles for territorial control. The mention of Ben-hadad and Hazael connects to the broader narrative of conflict between Israel and Aram, which is a recurring theme in the books of Kings. This conflict is also a backdrop for the prophetic ministries of Elijah and Elisha.<p><b>the cities that Hazael had taken in battle from his father Jehoahaz</b><br>Hazael, a powerful king of Aram, had previously captured several Israelite cities during the reign of Jehoahaz, Jehoash's father. This loss was a result of Israel's disobedience to God, as described in <a href="/2_kings/13-3.htm">2 Kings 13:3</a>, where the Lord allowed Hazael to oppress Israel. The recovery of these cities signifies a reversal of Israel's fortunes and a partial restoration of its former strength.<p><b>Jehoash defeated Ben-hadad three times</b><br>The three victories of Jehoash over Ben-hadad are significant as they fulfill the prophecy given by Elisha to Jehoash in <a href="/2_kings/13-18.htm">2 Kings 13:18-19</a>. Elisha instructed Jehoash to strike the ground with arrows, symbolizing the number of victories he would achieve. Jehoash's limited response resulted in only three victories, highlighting the importance of faith and obedience in receiving God's full blessing.<p><b>and so recovered the cities of Israel</b><br>The recovery of the cities marks a period of national restoration and is a testament to God's mercy and faithfulness to Israel despite their repeated disobedience. This restoration is a partial fulfillment of God's covenant promises to Israel, demonstrating His willingness to deliver and restore His people when they turn back to Him. The recovery also prefigures the ultimate restoration and redemption found in Jesus Christ, who restores what was lost through sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoash.htm">Jehoash (Joash)</a></b><br>The son of Jehoahaz and king of Israel who recaptured cities from the Arameans.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoahaz.htm">Jehoahaz</a></b><br>The father of Jehoash and former king of Israel, who lost cities to the Arameans.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hadad.htm">Ben-hadad</a></b><br>The son of Hazael and king of Aram, who was defeated by Jehoash.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hazael.htm">Hazael</a></b><br>The king of Aram who initially captured the cities from Jehoahaz.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, which experienced both loss and recovery of its cities during this period.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_restoration.htm">God's Faithfulness in Restoration</a></b><br>Despite Israel's unfaithfulness, God remained faithful to His covenant, allowing Jehoash to recover lost cities.

These were now recovered by Jehoash. They lay probably in the Cis-Jordanic territory. <span class="cmt_word">Three times did Joash beat him; and recovered the cities of Israel</span> (comp. ver. 19).
