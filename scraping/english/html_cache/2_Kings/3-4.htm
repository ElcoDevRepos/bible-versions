Moab was located east of the Dead Sea, in present-day Jordan. The Moabites were descendants of Lot, Abraham's nephew, and had a tumultuous relationship with Israel. Mesha is also known from the Mesha Stele, an archaeological artifact that provides a Moabite perspective on the events of this period, confirming some biblical accounts.<p><b>was a sheep breeder</b><br>Sheep breeding was a common occupation in the ancient Near East, and it was a significant part of the economy.

Moab was subject to Israel, likely as a result of military conquest or political agreement.

This payment was a significant economic burden, illustrating the power dynamics between Israel and Moab. The large numbers emphasize the scale of the tribute and the wealth of the region.

The historian goes back to the origin of the war. He had already, in <a href="/2_kings/1-1.htm">2 Kings 1:1</a>, mentioned the revolt of Moab at the death of Ahab; but he now recalls his readers' attention to the fact, and to some extent explains it and accounts for it. Moab had been treated oppressively - had been forced to pay an extraordinarily heavy tribute - and was in a certain sense driven into rebellion (vers. 4, 5). Jehoram, when he came to the kingdom, determined to make a great effort to put the rebellion down, and to re-establish the authority of Israel over the revolted people His relations with Jehoshaphat of Israel were so close that he had no difficulty in persuading him to join in the war. He was also able to obtain the alliance of the King of Edom. Thus strengthened, he made no doubt of being successful, and confidently invaded the country (vers. 6-9). The course of the war is then related (vers. 10-27). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/3-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Mesha</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1461;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1445;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#234;&#183;&#353;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
