The Shunammite woman is a significant figure in <a href="/2_kings/4.htm">2 Kings 4</a>, known for her hospitality and faith. Her dialogue with Elisha occurs after the death of her promised son, highlighting her distress and urgency. The setting is in the Northern Kingdom of Israel during the time of the divided monarchy, a period marked by political instability and spiritual decline.<p><b>&#8220;Did I ask you for a son, my lord?</b><br>The Shunammite woman reminds Elisha that she did not request a son. This reflects her initial contentment and perhaps a fear of disappointment. Her address to Elisha as "my lord" shows respect and acknowledges his prophetic authority. The cultural context of ancient Israel placed great importance on having children, particularly sons, for lineage and inheritance. Her statement underscores the depth of her current grief, as she had not sought this blessing, which now seems lost.<p><b>Didn&#8217;t I say, &#8216;Do not deceive me?&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This phrase recalls the earlier interaction between the woman and Elisha, where she expressed concern about being given false hope (<a href="/2_kings/4-16.htm">2 Kings 4:16</a>). Her use of "deceive" indicates a feeling of betrayal, as the joy of her son's birth has turned into sorrow. This moment parallels other biblical narratives where God's promises are tested, such as Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22). It also foreshadows the resurrection theme, as Elisha will later restore her son to life, prefiguring Christ's power over death. The woman's plea reflects a deep trust in God's promises, even amidst doubt and despair.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shunammite_woman.htm">The Shunammite Woman</a></b><br>A notable woman from Shunem who showed hospitality to Elisha and was blessed with a son as a result of Elisha's prophecy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God who succeeded Elijah and performed many miracles, including the promise of a son to the Shunammite woman.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son.htm">The Son</a></b><br>The child miraculously given to the Shunammite woman, whose sudden death prompts her plea to Elisha.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shunem.htm">Shunem</a></b><br>A town in the territory of Issachar, where the Shunammite woman lived and where Elisha often visited.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_carmel.htm">Mount Carmel</a></b><br>The place where the Shunammite woman sought Elisha after her son's death, demonstrating her faith and determination.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>The Shunammite woman's account teaches us to hold onto God's promises even when circumstances seem dire.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_persistent_prayer.htm">The Power of Persistent Prayer</a></b><br>Her determination to seek Elisha demonstrates the importance of persistent prayer and seeking God's intervention.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_compassion_and_understanding.htm">God's Compassion and Understanding</a></b><br>God understands our deepest fears and disappointments, as seen in the Shunammite woman's honest plea to Elisha.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_prophets_and_spiritual_leaders.htm">The Role of Prophets and Spiritual Leaders</a></b><br>Elisha's role highlights the importance of spiritual leaders who guide and intercede for God's people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trusting_god's_timing.htm">Trusting God's Timing</a></b><br>The account encourages believers to trust in God's timing and methods, even when they differ from our expectations.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_4_28_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 4:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_4_28_Honest_talk_with_God.htm">How does 2 Kings 4:28 demonstrate the importance of honest communication with God?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_faith_from_Shunammite_woman_3.htm">What can we learn about faith from the Shunammite woman's response in 2 Kings 4:28?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Shunammite_s_plea_persistent_prayer_links.htm">How does the Shunammite's plea connect to other biblical examples of persistent prayer?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_Shunammite_s_resolve_in_prayer.htm">In what ways can we apply the Shunammite's determination to our prayer life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Shunammite_s_trust_in_God_s_promises.htm">How does the Shunammite's approach in 2 Kings 4:28 inspire trust in God's promises?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_4_28_God_s_promises_vs_hopes.htm">What does 2 Kings 4:28 reveal about God's promises and human expectations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_4_28_Faith_in_trials.htm">How does 2 Kings 4:28 challenge our understanding of faith during trials?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_she_question_Elisha_in_4_28.htm">Why does the Shunammite woman question Elisha in 2 Kings 4:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_kings_4.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Kings 4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/do_2_chron._28_and_2_kings_16_conflict.htm">Does King Ahaz's portrayal in 2 Chronicles 28 conflict with the account in 2 Kings 16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/who_was_king_ahaz_in_biblical_history.htm">Who was King Ahaz in biblical history?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_does_david_justify_punishing_killers.htm">2 Samuel 4:8-11 -

She approaches God&#8217;s prophet, reminds him that the son was God&#8217;s unsolicited gift, and pleads that the promise not end in grief. Her words blend honest lament with steadfast trust, demonstrating that the Lord who grants life also has power to restore it. The verse teaches believers to bring every hurt to God, to hold Him to His unfailing Word, and to expect His saving action even when everything seems lost.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Then.</span>--<span class= "ital">And</span>; so in <a href="/2_kings/4-29.htm" title="Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go your way: if you meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute you, answer him not again: and lay my staff on the face of the child.">2Kings 4:29</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-35.htm" title="Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself on him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.">2Kings 4:35</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Did I desire</span> (<span class= "ital">ask</span>) <span class= "bld">a son of my lord?</span>--Only the conclusion of her appeal is given.

Or, perhaps, we should understand that grief does not allow her to specify the cause directly; she leaves the prophet to infer <span class= "ital">that</span> from her questions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?</span> The woman does not directly reveal her grief. Great sorrow is reticent, cannot endure to put itself into words. But she sufficiently indicates the nature of her trouble by the form of her reproach. "Did I ask for a son? Did I make complaint of my childlessness? Had I been importunate, and obtained my son of thee by much asking, I would not have complained. But I did not ask. I did not even snatch greedily at the offer. I demurred. I said, 'Do not deceive me.' But now thou hast done worse than deceive me. Thou hast kept the word of promise to the ear, and broken it to the hope. It is greater misery to have a child and lose him, than never to have had one at all." All this, and more, seems to be involved in the woman's words.
