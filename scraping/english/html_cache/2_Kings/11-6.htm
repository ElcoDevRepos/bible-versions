This gate is significant as it represents a strategic point of defense. The division of the guards into thirds indicates a well-organized plan to protect the young king Joash from any threats, particularly from Queen Athaliah, who had usurped the throne. The gate of Sur may have been a lesser-known entrance, emphasizing the need for vigilance at all access points. This strategic placement of guards reflects the importance of protecting the Davidic line, which is central to the biblical narrative and God's covenant with David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>and a third at the gate behind the guards</b><br>The "gate behind the guards" suggests an additional layer of security, possibly an inner gate leading to more private or sacred areas of the temple. This positioning highlights the thoroughness of Jehoiada's plan to safeguard Joash. The presence of guards at this gate underscores the seriousness of the threat posed by Athaliah and the need to ensure the safety of the rightful heir to the throne. This careful guarding can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate protector and king, ensuring the fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>You are to take turns guarding the temple&#8212;</b><br>The instruction to "take turns guarding the temple" indicates a continuous and vigilant watch over the temple and the young king. This rotation of guards ensures that there is no lapse in security, reflecting the dedication and commitment required to protect God's chosen leader. The temple, as the dwelling place of God, symbolizes His presence and covenant with Israel. The protection of the temple and the Davidic line is crucial for the unfolding of God's redemptive plan, which ultimately leads to the coming of Jesus Christ, the true King and High Priest. This vigilance can be paralleled with the call for believers to remain watchful and steadfast in their faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiada_the_priest.htm">Jehoiada the Priest</a></b><br>A key figure in this chapter, Jehoiada orchestrates the protection and eventual crowning of Joash as king.

The first detachment stations itself at the Sur Gate, a passageway on the southern or southwestern side of the complex.<p>&#8226; The literal placement matters. Athaliah&#8217;s palace lay nearby, so this gate had to be sealed off to prevent a surprise counter-attack. Similar strategic positioning of Levites appears in <a href="/2_chronicles/23-5.htm">2 Chronicles 23:5</a>, the parallel account.<p>&#8226; The idea of standing guard at specific gates echoes earlier temple organization (<a href="/1_chronicles/26-13.htm">1 Chronicles 26:13-19</a>) and Nehemiah&#8217;s later reforms (<a href="/nehemiah/12-39.htm">Nehemiah 12:39</a>). God&#8217;s house is protected by ordered, designated service&#8212;not haphazard zeal.<p>&#8226; By assigning a full third of the force here, Jehoiada shows that faithful obedience includes practical prudence. Spiritual warfare never ignores common-sense defense (compare <a href="/nehemiah/4-9.htm">Nehemiah 4:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A third at the gate behind the guards</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;And a third at the gate behind the guards&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/11-6.htm">2 Kings 11:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;guards&#8221; (the Carites and royal bodyguard; see <a href="/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4, 11</a>) already watched the king&#8217;s residence. Jehoiada posts another third directly behind them, forming a second line.<p>&#8226; This layered defense recalls David&#8217;s practice of surrounding himself with loyal warriors (<a href="/2_samuel/15-18.htm">2 Samuel 15:18</a>) and anticipates the escort that will accompany young Joash to the throne room (<a href="/2_kings/11-19.htm">2 Kings 11:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the picture is one of reinforcement. God often doubles the hedge around His anointed (<a href="/job/1-10.htm">Job 1:10</a>), and the church is urged to &#8220;strengthen what remains&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/3-2.htm">Revelation 3:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical lesson: guarding the heart or the fellowship means building more than one safeguard&#8212;accountability on top of vigilance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You are to take turns guarding the temple</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;You are to take turns guarding the temple&#8212;&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/11-6.htm">2 Kings 11:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Temple duty ran on a weekly rota (<a href="/1_chronicles/9-25.htm">1 Chronicles 9:25</a>). The men coming on duty replaced those going off duty at the Sabbath. Jehoiada keeps that God-given rhythm intact even while mounting a coup.<p>&#8226; Two principles surface:<p>&#8211; Regular worship does not pause for political crisis (<a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-25.htm">Hebrews 10:25</a>).<p>&#8211; Shared responsibility prevents burnout and ensures continuous coverage (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-4.htm">1 Corinthians 12:4-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Jehoiada marries faithfulness to God&#8217;s order with decisive action. The result is both security for the boy-king and uninterrupted praise in the sanctuary (<a href="/2_chronicles/23-6.htm">2 Chronicles 23:6-7</a>; <a href="/psalms/84-10.htm">Psalm 84:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/11-6.htm">2 Kings 11:6</a> portrays a deliberate, three-pronged guard plan: one third at the Sur Gate, one third at the inner gate behind the existing guards, and one third rotating at their appointed posts. Literally, this protects young Joash and the temple from Athaliah; devotionally, it models prudent vigilance, layered protection, and orderly service in God&#8217;s house&#8212;all carried out in trusting obedience to the Lord who preserves His chosen line.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur.</span>--Or, and the third (shall be on guard) <span class= "ital">at the gate of Sur</span>, Instead of <span class= "ital">S-r</span> ("turning aside") Chronicles has <span class= "ital">Jesod</span> ("foundation").

And he sat on the throne of the kings.">2Kings 11:19</a> "the gate of the Couriers" is mentioned, apparently as the principal entrance to the palace enclosure. That gate and this one are probably the same. It is here called "the gate <span class= "ital">behind</span> the Couriers" because a guard was usually stationed in front of it. Perhaps the word "behind" has originated in a mere echo of the word "gate" ('<span class= "ital">ahar, sha'ar</span>), and should be omitted as an error of transcription.<p><span class= "bld">So shall ye keep the watch of the house.</span>--Thus shall ye--the three divisions of the guards, entering on duty on the Sabbath--guard the entrances and exits of the royal palace.<p><span class= "bld">That it be not broken down.</span>--The Hebrew is only the one word <span class= "ital">mass?h,</span> which occurs nowhere else. It appears to mean "repulse," "warding off," and is probably a marginal gloss on "watch" (<span class= "ital">mishmereth</span>), explaining its nature--viz., that the guards were to keep back any one who tried to enter the palace buildings. Gesenius paraphrases, "ad depellendum populum" (<span class= "ital">zum Abwehren</span>). Thenius suggests the reading "and repel"! <span class= "ital">scil</span>., "all comers" (<span class= "ital">-nes?ah</span> for <span class= "ital">mass?h</span>).
