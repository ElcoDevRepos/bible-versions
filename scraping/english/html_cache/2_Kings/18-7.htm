Hezekiah, the king of Judah, is noted for his faithfulness to God, as seen in his efforts to restore proper worship in the temple and his removal of idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/18-3.htm">2 Kings 18:3-6</a>). The LORD's presence with Hezekiah echoes the covenantal promise given to the patriarchs and leaders like Moses and Joshua (<a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3</a>, <a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>), emphasizing that obedience to God results in His guidance and support.<p><b>and he prospered wherever he went</b><br>Hezekiah's prosperity is attributed to his reliance on God and his commitment to following God's commandments. This prosperity is not merely material but also includes military success and political stability. The prosperity Hezekiah experienced can be compared to the blessings outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> for those who obey God's laws. His reign is marked by significant achievements, including the construction of the Siloam Tunnel, which provided water to Jerusalem during the Assyrian siege, a feat confirmed by archaeological findings.<p><b>He rebelled against the king of Assyria</b><br>Hezekiah's rebellion against Assyria was a bold political and spiritual move. Assyria was the dominant power in the region, and many nations, including Judah, were vassals paying tribute. Hezekiah's refusal to continue this subjugation was an act of faith, trusting in God's protection rather than human alliances. This rebellion can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophetic encouragement found in Isaiah, who advised against reliance on foreign powers (<a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a>).<p><b>and refused to serve him</b><br>This refusal to serve the Assyrian king signifies a break from political oppression and a declaration of trust in God's sovereignty. It highlights Hezekiah's commitment to the LORD over political expediency. This act of defiance is reminiscent of the Israelites' earlier refusal to serve Pharaoh, symbolizing liberation and divine deliverance (<a href="/exodus/5.htm">Exodus 5:1</a>). Hezekiah's actions prefigure the ultimate deliverance found in Jesus Christ, who frees believers from the bondage of sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned during a time of significant political and spiritual reform.

It was the promise made to Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>), repeated to Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5, 7</a>), and by implication given in them to all those who would rule his people faithfully (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/15-2.htm">2 Chronicles 15:2</a>). And he prospered whithersoever he went forth; rather, <span class="accented">in all his goings - in cunctis ad quae procedebat</span> (Vulgate). Hezekiah's prosperity is enlarged upon by the writer of Chronicles, who says (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-27.htm">2 Chronicles 32:27-30</a>), "And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honor: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, add for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels; storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks. Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.... And Hezekiah prospered in all his works." Many brought presents to him to Jerusalem, and he was magnified in the sight of all the surrounding nations (see <a href="/2_chronicles/32-23.htm">2 Chronicles 32:23</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he rebelled against the King of Assyria, and served him not.</span> Hezekiah's "rebellion" probably took place at the very commencement of his reign, <span class="date">B.C. 727</span>, in the year that Shalmaneser ascended the throne. Most likely it consisted simply in his withholding his tribute, and neither going in person nor sending representatives to Nineveh, to congratulate the new monarch on his accession. This would be understood as an assertion of independence. That it was not at once resented must be ascribed to Shalmaneser's difficulties with Samaria and with Tyre, which were more pressing, as they lay nearer to Assyria. Before these were over, Sargon usurped the crown. There is reason to believe that he made at least one expedition against Hezekiah; but the date of it is uncertain. Rebellion met him on all sides, and had to be crushed near home before he could venture to deal with it on the remote outskirts of his empire. Meanwhile Hezekiah strengthened himself and built up a considerable power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/18-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
