His reign marked a significant return to the covenantal faithfulness that had been neglected by his predecessors. Josiah's acts included the repair of the Temple, the discovery of the Book of the Law, and the subsequent national repentance and renewal of the covenant. His efforts to rid Judah of idolatry and restore proper worship were pivotal in the history of the nation.<p><b>and all his accomplishments</b><br>Josiah's accomplishments were numerous and significant. He is credited with centralizing worship in Jerusalem, thus eliminating the high places where idolatrous practices had proliferated. His reforms extended beyond religious practices to include social and political changes that strengthened the kingdom. Josiah's leadership was marked by a commitment to justice and righteousness, aligning with the prophetic calls for such values found throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</b><br>This phrase indicates that a more detailed account of Josiah's reign can be found in another historical source, the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. This book is distinct from the biblical books of 1 and 2 Chronicles, which also recount the history of the kings of Judah and Israel. The reference suggests that Josiah's deeds were well-documented and recognized as significant in the annals of Judah's history.

Yet the phrase signals that what we&#8217;ve read is only a sampling. Scripture often summarizes a godly ruler this way (compare <a href="/1_kings/14-19.htm">1 Kings 14:19</a>; 15:7), reminding us that God&#8217;s record is fuller than the narrative before us. By pointing beyond the text, it invites us to remember other moments&#8212;such as Josiah&#8217;s early seeking of the LORD at age sixteen and his demolition of idolatry in Judah and Israel, recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/34-3.htm">2 Chronicles 34:3&#8211;7</a>&#8212;that showcase his lifelong devotion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all his accomplishments</b><p>Josiah&#8217;s &#8220;accomplishments&#8221; go beyond tearing down pagan altars.

For us, it teaches that faith is rooted in trustworthy testimony, paralleling Luke&#8217;s orderly account based on eyewitness sources (<a href="/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1&#8211;4</a>). Scripture is not myth; it appeals to documented fact.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</b><p>The now-lost annals of Judah preserved civil records, whereas the inspired Chronicles we possess (1&#8211;2 Chronicles) present a theological history.

The contrast also hints at the limits of human archives; only God&#8217;s Word endures forever (<a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>), and the ultimate ledger is His own (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/23-28.htm">2 Kings 23:28</a> reminds us that:<p>&#8226; Josiah&#8217;s life overflowed with godly action beyond the brief account before us.<p>&#8226; His accomplishments flowed from a heart fully given to the LORD, exemplifying covenant obedience.<p>&#8226; The historical record of his reign was both extensive and publicly accessible, underscoring the factual nature of biblical history.<p>&#8226; Human books fade, but God&#8217;s enduring Word preserves what truly matters, assuring believers that every faithful act is remembered by Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28-30) Josiah's end.

Politically, the time was a stirring one. The great invasion of Western Asia by the Scythic hordes (Herod., 1:103-106), which is alluded to by <a href="/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1-5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38, 39</a>, and perhaps by <a href="/zephaniah/2-6.htm">Zephaniah 2:6</a>, probably belongs to it; as also the attack of Psamatik I. upon Philistia (Herod., 2:105), the fall of the Assyrian empire (circ. <span class="date">B.C. 617</span>), and the destruction of Nineveh: the establishment of the independence of Babylon, and her rise to greatness; together with the transfer of power in the central part of Western Asia, from the Assyrians to the Medea. Amid the dangers which beset him, Josiah appears to have conducted himself prudently, gradually extending his power over Samaria and Galilee, without coming into hostile collision with any of the neighboring nations, until about the year <span class="date">B.C. 609</span> or 608, when his land was invaded by Pharaoh-Nechoh, the Neku of the Egyptian monuments. Josiah felt himself called upon to resist this invasion, and, in doing so, met his death (vers. 29, 30). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did.</span> Josiah was reckoned a good rather than a great king. No mention is made of his "might." The writer of Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-26.htm">2 Chronicles 35:26</a>) commemorates his "kindnesses" or "his good deeds." The son of Sirach speaks of his "upright" behavior (Ecclus. 49:2). Josephus ('Ant.
