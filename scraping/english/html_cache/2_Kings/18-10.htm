The siege began in the fourth year of King Hezekiah of Judah and lasted for three years. The Assyrians, known for their military prowess and brutal tactics, were expanding their empire under King Shalmaneser V and later Sargon II. The capture of Samaria marked the end of the Northern Kingdom, fulfilling the warnings of prophets like Hosea and Amos about the consequences of Israel's idolatry and disobedience to God. Archaeological evidence, such as Assyrian records, corroborates the biblical account of this conquest.<p><b>So Samaria was captured in the sixth year of Hezekiah,</b><br>Hezekiah was the king of Judah, the Southern Kingdom, known for his faithfulness to God and religious reforms. The capture of Samaria in his sixth year highlights the contrast between the two kingdoms. While Israel fell due to its unfaithfulness, Judah, under Hezekiah's leadership, experienced a period of spiritual renewal. This event serves as a warning and a lesson about the importance of covenant faithfulness. The fall of Samaria also set the stage for Hezekiah's own challenges with Assyria, as recorded later in 2 Kings.<p><b>which was the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel.</b><br>Hoshea was the last king of Israel, and his reign was marked by political instability and attempts to resist Assyrian dominance. His decision to seek an alliance with Egypt against Assyria ultimately led to the siege and fall of Samaria. This phrase underscores the fulfillment of God's judgment against Israel for its persistent idolatry and rebellion, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-23</a>.
