The "sight of the LORD" suggests that God is the ultimate judge of human actions, and His standards are absolute. This phrase is often used in the Old Testament to describe the actions of kings who led Israel or Judah away from the worship of Yahweh. The evil mentioned here typically involves idolatry, injustice, and the abandonment of the covenant with God. The phrase underscores the seriousness of sin and its consequences, as seen throughout the history of Israel and Judah.<p><b>as his father Manasseh had done</b><br>Manasseh was one of the most notorious kings of Judah, known for his extensive idolatry and leading the nation into sin. His reign is detailed in <a href="/2_kings/21.htm">2 Kings 21:1-18</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/33.htm">2 Chronicles 33:1-20</a>. Manasseh's actions included the worship of Baal, Asherah, and the host of heaven, as well as the practice of child sacrifice and witchcraft. This comparison highlights the generational impact of sin and the failure to learn from past mistakes. Manasseh's reign is often seen as a turning point that led to the eventual downfall of Judah. The reference to Manasseh serves as a warning about the influence of parental example and the importance of repentance and returning to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amon.htm">Amon</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned after his father Manasseh.
