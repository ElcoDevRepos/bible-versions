Megiddo is a significant site in biblical history, located in the Jezreel Valley. It was a strategic military location and the site of many battles. Josiah was killed in battle against Pharaoh Necho II of Egypt, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a>. The use of a chariot for transporting his body indicates the honor and urgency given to the king's remains. Chariots were symbols of power and prestige in ancient times.<p><b>brought him to Jerusalem</b><br>Jerusalem was the political and spiritual center of Judah, the location of the Temple, and the city of David. Bringing Josiah's body to Jerusalem signifies the importance of his burial in the capital city, aligning with the tradition of burying kings in the city of their reign. This act also reflects the respect and mourning of the nation for a king who had led significant religious reforms.<p><b>and buried him in his own tomb</b><br>Josiah was buried in his own tomb, which indicates a prepared and honored burial place, likely among the tombs of the kings of Judah. This reflects the practice of royal burials and the importance of family tombs in ancient Israelite culture. The burial in his own tomb signifies the respect and honor given to Josiah, despite his untimely death.<p><b>Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz son of Josiah</b><br>The phrase "people of the land" refers to the leading citizens or representatives of the nation, possibly including elders and military leaders. Jehoahaz, also known as Shallum, was chosen by the people, indicating a level of popular support or recognition of his right to rule. This choice may reflect the people's desire for continuity in leadership after Josiah's death.<p><b>anointed him</b><br>Anointing was a significant ritual in the Old Testament, symbolizing the consecration and divine approval of a king. It involved pouring oil on the head of the chosen individual, signifying the Holy Spirit's empowerment and setting apart for leadership. This act connects to the anointing of other kings in Israel's history, such as Saul and David, and foreshadows the ultimate anointed one, the Messiah, Jesus Christ.<p><b>and made him king in place of his father</b><br>Jehoahaz was made king as a successor to Josiah, continuing the Davidic line. His reign, however, was short-lived, lasting only three months before Pharaoh Necho deposed him. This transition highlights the political instability and external pressures facing Judah at the time. The phrase also underscores the biblical theme of dynastic succession and the fulfillment of God's promises to David regarding his descendants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The righteous king of Judah who initiated significant religious reforms and was killed in battle at Megiddo.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/megiddo.htm">Megiddo</a></b><br>A strategic city in ancient Israel where King Josiah was killed in battle against Pharaoh Necho of Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah where Josiah was buried in his own tomb.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoahaz.htm">Jehoahaz</a></b><br>The son of Josiah, chosen by the people to succeed his father as king of Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_the_land.htm">The People of the Land</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Judah who played a role in the succession of Jehoahaz as king.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Josiah's death at Megiddo serves as a reminder of the consequences of not heeding divine warnings, as he went into battle against Pharaoh Necho despite being warned.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_people_in_leadership.htm">The Role of the People in Leadership</a></b><br>The people's choice of Jehoahaz as king highlights the communal aspect of leadership selection and the importance of seeking God's guidance in such decisions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transience_of_earthly_power.htm">The Transience of Earthly Power</a></b><br>Jehoahaz's brief reign underscores the temporary nature of earthly authority and the need to focus on eternal values.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_a_godly_legacy.htm">The Importance of a Godly Legacy</a></b><br>Josiah's reforms and his burial in Jerusalem reflect the lasting impact of a godly life, encouraging believers to leave a legacy of faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Despite the political turmoil and leadership changes, God's sovereign plan continues to unfold, reminding believers to trust in His ultimate control over history.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_23_30_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 23:30?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_23_30_Godly_leadership_s_role.htm">How does 2 Kings 23:30 illustrate the importance of godly leadership in society?

We learn from Chronicles that a great lamentation was made for Josiah, the only King of Judah slain in battle, the last good king of David's line, the pious prince whose piety had not sufficed to avert the anger of Jehovah. Jeremiah "lamented for him" (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-25.htm">2 Chronicles 35:25</a>), perhaps in a set composition (Josephus, ' Ant. Jud.,' 10:5. &sect; 1); though that composition is certainly not either the Book of Lamentations or the fourth chapter of that book. He was further mourned by "all the singing men and the singing women" (2 Chronicles, <span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.), who "spake of him in their lamentations, and "made them an ordinance in Israel," and entered these "lamentations," apparently in a book, which was called 'The Book of Lamentations,' or 'of Dirges.' <span class="cmt_word">And the people of the laud took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah.</span> Jehoahaz was otherwise named "Shallum" (<a href="/1_chronicles/3-15.htm">1 Chronicles 3:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-11.htm">Jeremiah 22:11</a>). On what grounds the people preferred him to his elder brother, Eliakim, we do not know. Perhaps Eliakim had accompanied his father to Megiddo, and been made prisoner by Nechoh in the battle. <span class="cmt_word">And anointed him</span> (see the comment on 1 Kings 1:34, and supra, <a href="/2_kings/11-12.htm">2 Kings 11:12</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and made him king in his father's stead.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/23-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">From Megiddo</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1490;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#7713;id&#183;d&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
