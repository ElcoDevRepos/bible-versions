He became king at a young age after being hidden from Queen Athaliah's massacre. His reign is noted for the restoration of the temple, which had fallen into disrepair. The priests were the religious leaders responsible for temple worship and maintenance. Joash's directive to the priests indicates his commitment to restoring proper worship and temple upkeep, reflecting the king's early dedication to God under the influence of Jehoiada the priest.<p><b>Collect all the money brought as sacred gifts into the house of the LORD</b><br>The temple, referred to as the house of the LORD, was the central place of worship for the Israelites in Jerusalem. Sacred gifts were offerings given by the people for religious purposes. This collection was intended for the repair and maintenance of the temple, which had been neglected. The emphasis on sacred gifts highlights the importance of dedicating resources to God's service, a principle seen throughout scripture, such as in the building of the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25:1-9</a>).<p><b>the census money</b><br>Census money refers to the half-shekel tax required of every Israelite male over the age of twenty, as outlined in <a href="/exodus/30-11.htm">Exodus 30:11-16</a>. This tax was initially instituted for the maintenance of the tabernacle and later the temple. It served as a reminder of the Israelites' redemption and their obligation to support the worship of God. The collection of census money underscores the communal responsibility in sustaining religious institutions.<p><b>the money from vows</b><br>Vows were promises made to God, often accompanied by offerings, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/27.htm">Leviticus 27</a>. These could be made in gratitude, supplication, or dedication. The money from vows was a significant source of income for the temple, reflecting the personal commitments of the Israelites to God. This practice highlights the importance of fulfilling one's promises to God, a theme echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>.<p><b>and the money brought voluntarily into the house of the LORD</b><br>Voluntary offerings were given out of free will, beyond what was required by law. These gifts demonstrated the devotion and generosity of the people towards God and His temple. Such offerings are reminiscent of the freewill offerings for the tabernacle in <a href="/exodus/35-29.htm">Exodus 35:29</a>. The inclusion of voluntary contributions emphasizes the value of heartfelt giving in worship, a principle that is also seen in the New Testament (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoash.htm">Jehoash (Joash)</a></b><br>King of Judah who reigned after the death of his grandmother Athaliah.

It is rather surprising that the temple had not been thoroughly repaired by Jehoiada during the long minority of Joash, when he must practically have had the sole management of affairs. Probably he did repair the worst of the damage done by Athaliah's orders (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-7.htm">2 Chronicles 24:7</a>), which may have been very considerable, but neglected the restoration of such portions of the edifice as appeared to him of secondary importance, as the walls of the courts and the outbuildings. Joash, however, when his minority came to an end, and he succeeded to the administration of the state, took a different view. To him the completion of the repairs seemed a pressing business. Probably he thought the honor of God required the entire obliteration of Athaliah's wicked proceedings, and the renewal of the temple's old glories. His six years' residence within the temple precincts may have also inspired him with a love of the building as a building. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jehoash said to the priests.</span> The initiative of Joash is strongly marked, alike in Kings and Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-4.htm">2 Chronicles 24:4</a>). The general weakness of his character, and want of vigor and decision, make it the more surprising that he should in this particular matter have shown himself capable of taking his own line and adhering to it (ver. 7). He has scarcely received from historians the credit that is due to him for his persistent and successful efforts to accomplish an object which was for the honor of religion, and which was yet not pressed forward by the priesthood. Certainly he was no mere puppet of the priestly order. <span class="cmt_word">All the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the Lord</span>; rather, <span class="accented">all the money of the holy gifts that is brought into the house of the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all that ye receive from the people in the way of money. This money accrued from three sources, which the king proceeded to enumerate. First, even <span class="cmt_word">the money of every one that passeth</span> the account; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the census money - the aggregate of the half-shekels received from the males of above twenty years old, whenever a census was taken (<a href="/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12-16</a>).

Secondly, the <span class="cmt_word">money that every man is set at</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the redemption money, derived in part from the payments made for redeeming the firstborn (<a href="/numbers/18-15.htm">Numbers 18:15, 16</a>);
