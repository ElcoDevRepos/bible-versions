Throughout the Old Testament, listening to God's voice is synonymous with obedience and faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>). The Israelites' failure to heed God's commands led to their downfall, as seen in the Assyrian conquest of the Northern Kingdom. This highlights the importance of obedience to God's word, a theme echoed in the New Testament (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p><b>but violated His covenant</b><br>The covenant mentioned here is the Mosaic Covenant, established at Mount Sinai (Exodus 19-24). This covenant was conditional, requiring Israel's obedience in exchange for God's blessings. Violating the covenant meant breaking the laws and commandments given through Moses, which included worshiping other gods and neglecting justice and mercy. The breach of this covenant led to divine judgment, as prophesied in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>all that Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded</b><br>Moses is often referred to as the servant of the LORD, emphasizing his role as a mediator between God and Israel (<a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7-8</a>). The commandments given through Moses include the Ten Commandments and various laws governing religious, moral, and social life. These laws were intended to set Israel apart as a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The Israelites' failure to follow these commands resulted in their exile, fulfilling the warnings given by Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15-68</a>).<p><b>and would neither listen nor obey</b><br>This phrase underscores the persistent rebellion and stubbornness of the Israelites. Listening and obeying are often paired in Scripture to denote true faithfulness (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). The Israelites' refusal to do either led to their punishment and serves as a warning to future generations. This concept is mirrored in the New Testament, where Jesus calls for obedience to His teachings as a sign of true discipleship (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of the Northern Kingdom of Israel who were taken into exile by the Assyrians due to their disobedience to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel who had given them laws and commandments through Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The servant of the LORD who delivered God's laws and covenant to the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_covenant.htm">The Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between God and Israel, which included the laws and commandments given through Moses.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyrian_exile.htm">Assyrian Exile</a></b><br>The event where the Northern Kingdom of Israel was conquered and its people were taken into captivity by the Assyrians as a consequence of their disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Obedience to God's commands is crucial for maintaining a right relationship with Him.
