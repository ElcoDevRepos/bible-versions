Their sudden flight at twilight suggests a divine intervention, as twilight is a time of transition and uncertainty. This event fulfills Elisha's prophecy of deliverance for Samaria (<a href="/2_kings/7.htm">2 Kings 7:1-2</a>). The timing underscores God's sovereignty, as He orchestrates events beyond human understanding. Twilight, a time of both ending and beginning, symbolizes the transition from despair to hope for the besieged Israelites.<p><b>abandoning their tents and horses and donkeys</b><br>The abandonment of such valuable resources indicates a hasty and panicked retreat. In ancient warfare, leaving behind tents and animals would be unthinkable unless driven by overwhelming fear. This reflects the psychological warfare God waged against the Arameans, causing them to hear the sound of a great army (<a href="/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>). The mention of horses and donkeys highlights the completeness of their departure, as these animals were essential for mobility and transport, emphasizing the totality of their fear-induced flight.<p><b>The camp was intact</b><br>The intact camp signifies that the Arameans left in such haste that they did not have time to destroy or take their supplies. This detail underscores the miraculous nature of the event, as it provided the Israelites with much-needed resources during the famine. The preservation of the camp can be seen as a divine provision, reminiscent of God's provision for Israel in the wilderness (Exodus 16). It also serves as a testament to God's ability to turn the enemy's strength into a blessing for His people.<p><b>and they had run for their lives</b><br>The phrase "run for their lives" indicates the level of terror experienced by the Arameans. This fear was not due to any visible threat but was divinely instilled, as they believed they were under attack by a formidable alliance (<a href="/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>). This mirrors other biblical instances where God causes confusion among enemy forces (<a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>, <a href="/1_samuel/14-15.htm">1 Samuel 14:15-16</a>).

While those men thought they were risking their lives, God had already cleared the way.<p>&#8226; Nightfall often serves as the backdrop for divine interventions&#8212;note how the angel struck the Assyrian camp &#8220;that night&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>) and how Paul and Silas were freed at midnight (<a href="/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s deliverance does not depend on daylight or human strength; He works while His people can only watch (<a href="/psalms/121-3.htm">Psalm 121:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>abandoning their tents and horses and donkeys</b><p>&#8226; Panic was so complete that soldiers left every asset that could have aided a measured retreat.<p>&#8226; Tents, mounts, and beasts of burden represented wealth, mobility, and military capability. Their abandonment underscores total defeat (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-24.htm">2 Chronicles 20:24-25</a>, where Judah found the enemy camp full of goods).<p>&#8226; God not only removed the threat but transferred provision to His starving people, illustrating <a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>&#8212;&#8220;the wealth of the sinner is stored up for the righteous.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The camp was intact</b><p>&#8226; Nothing was burned, sabotaged, or spoiled.

God manufactured terror without a single Israelite sword being drawn.<p>&#8226; This scene fulfills <a href="/leviticus/26-36.htm">Leviticus 26:36</a>&#8212;&#8220;the sound of a driven leaf shall put them to flight.&#8221; It also illustrates <a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>: &#8220;The wicked flee when no one pursues.&#8221;<p>&#8226; For believers, the lesson is clear: the battle is the LORD&#8217;s (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>). When He decides to deliver, the strongest opposition collapses into self-preserving panic.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/7-7.htm">2 Kings 7:7</a> records the moment God turned a hopeless siege into immediate salvation. By a sovereign act He startled the Aramean army into a hasty nighttime escape, leaving every resource intact for His starving people.
