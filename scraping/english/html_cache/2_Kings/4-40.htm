The act of pouring out the stew suggests a setting of hospitality and provision, reflecting the cultural importance of sharing meals. In biblical times, meals were not only for sustenance but also for fellowship and community bonding. This setting is reminiscent of other biblical instances where food is shared among groups, such as the feeding of the 5,000 in the New Testament.<p><b>but when they tasted the stew they cried out</b><br>The immediate reaction upon tasting the stew highlights the urgency and seriousness of the situation. The cry indicates a recognition of danger, suggesting that the stew contained something harmful. This reflects the human instinct to avoid danger and the communal concern for the well-being of others. The reaction can be compared to the Israelites' cries for help in times of distress throughout the Old Testament, such as their cries for deliverance from Egypt.<p><b>&#8220;There is death in the pot, O man of God!&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "death in the pot" signifies the presence of something lethal or poisonous. In the ancient world, food safety was a significant concern, and the presence of harmful substances in food could lead to death. The term "man of God" refers to Elisha, a prophet known for his miracles and divine authority. This acknowledgment of Elisha's role underscores the belief in divine intervention and the power of God working through His prophets. The cry for help to a "man of God" reflects the reliance on divine assistance in times of crisis, similar to how people sought Jesus for healing and miracles.<p><b>And they could not eat it</b><br>The inability to eat the stew emphasizes the severity of the situation. It suggests that the stew was not only unpalatable but potentially deadly. This phrase underscores the theme of divine provision and protection, as the narrative continues with Elisha's intervention to purify the stew. The inability to consume the food parallels other biblical instances where God provides a solution to seemingly insurmountable problems, such as the provision of manna in the wilderness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God who succeeded Elijah.
