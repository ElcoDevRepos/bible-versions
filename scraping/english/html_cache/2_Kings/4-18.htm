This growth is both physical and symbolic, representing the fulfillment of God's promise through Elisha to the Shunammite woman (<a href="/2_kings/4-16.htm">2 Kings 4:16-17</a>). The growth of the child can be seen as a testament to God's faithfulness and the miraculous nature of his birth, similar to other significant births in the Bible, such as Isaac (<a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21:1-7</a>) and Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/1-19.htm">1 Samuel 1:19-20</a>).<p><b>and one day he went out to his father</b><br>The phrase "one day" suggests a specific, significant event in the narrative. The child going out to his father indicates a customary practice in agrarian societies where children would join their parents in daily activities, learning the family trade. This reflects the cultural context of ancient Israel, where family units worked together in agricultural settings. The father-son relationship is a recurring theme in Scripture, often symbolizing the transmission of faith and tradition (<a href="/proverbs/22-6.htm">Proverbs 22:6</a>).<p><b>who was with the harvesters</b><br>The mention of harvesters situates the event during the harvest season, a critical time in the agricultural calendar of ancient Israel. Harvesting was a communal activity, often involving the entire family and hired laborers. This setting underscores the importance of community and cooperation in sustaining life. Biblically, harvest time is frequently used as a metaphor for spiritual truths, such as the gathering of believers (<a href="/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37-38</a>) and the final judgment (<a href="/revelation/14-15.htm">Revelation 14:15</a>).
