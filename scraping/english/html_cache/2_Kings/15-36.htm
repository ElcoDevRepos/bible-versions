His reign is noted for his faithfulness to God, unlike many of the kings of Israel and Judah. The phrase suggests that there were additional deeds and events during Jotham's reign that are not detailed in this particular passage. His acts would have included his military campaigns, administrative decisions, and religious reforms. Jotham is credited with building projects, including the construction of the Upper Gate of the Temple of the LORD, which signifies his commitment to maintaining the religious integrity of Judah.<p><b>along with his accomplishments</b><br>Jotham's accomplishments were significant in maintaining the stability and prosperity of Judah during his reign. He is known for his successful military campaigns against the Ammonites, which resulted in tribute payments to Judah. His reign was marked by relative peace and prosperity, which can be attributed to his adherence to the ways of the LORD, as noted in other biblical accounts. His accomplishments also include fortifying cities and strengthening the defenses of Judah, which were crucial for the kingdom's security.<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</b><br>This phrase indicates that a more detailed account of Jotham's reign can be found in another historical source, the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. This book is distinct from the biblical books of 1 and 2 Chronicles and served as a royal archive or record of the kings' reigns. It suggests that the biblical narrative is selective and that additional historical records were available to the original audience.
