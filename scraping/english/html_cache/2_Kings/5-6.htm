This letter signifies a formal request and highlights the diplomatic relations between Aram (Syria) and Israel. The use of a letter indicates the seriousness of the request and the respect for protocol. Historically, such letters were often written on papyrus or clay tablets, and their delivery was a matter of great importance.<p><b>With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman,</b><br>Naaman was a commander of the army of the king of Aram, a position of high status and influence. His being referred to as a "servant" underscores the hierarchical nature of ancient societies, where even high-ranking officials were considered servants of the king. Naaman's journey to Israel reflects the desperation and hope for healing, as leprosy was a debilitating and socially isolating disease. This also shows the king's favor towards Naaman, willing to send him to a foreign land for healing.<p><b>so that you may cure him of his leprosy.</b><br>Leprosy in biblical times was a term used for various skin diseases, often leading to social exclusion. The expectation that the king of Israel could cure leprosy indicates a misunderstanding of the king's role and power, as healing was typically associated with prophets or divine intervention. This sets the stage for the involvement of the prophet Elisha, who ultimately points to God's power as the source of healing. The request foreshadows the miraculous healing that will occur, serving as a type of Christ's healing ministry, where physical healing often pointed to spiritual truths.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naaman.htm">Naaman</a></b><br>A commander of the army of the king of Aram, who was highly regarded but suffered from leprosy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_aram.htm">King of Aram</a></b><br>The ruler who sent Naaman to Israel to be healed, demonstrating the political and diplomatic interactions of the time.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_israel.htm">King of Israel</a></b><br>The recipient of the letter, who was initially distressed by the request, fearing it was a provocation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>The prophet in Israel who ultimately healed Naaman, demonstrating God's power and the role of faith.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/l/leprosy.htm">Leprosy</a></b><br>A serious skin disease that symbolized impurity and separation, both physically and spiritually.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_beyond_borders.htm">Faith Beyond Borders</a></b><br>Naaman's account illustrates that God's grace and healing are not limited by nationality or status.

Only the principal sentence of the letter is given. The message pre-supposes a not altogether hostile relation between the two kings; and the words of the next verse, "He seeketh a quarrel against me," point to the time of comparative lull which ensued after the luckless expedition to Ramoth-gilead (1. Kings 22), and the short reign of the invalid Ahaziah; <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, to the reign of Jehoram, <span class= "ital">not</span> to that of Jehoahaz, in which Israel was wholly crushed by Syria (<a href="/context/2_kings/13-3.htm" title="And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days.">2Kings 13:3-7</a>).

But, as Thenius remarks, he forgets that the relations between Jehu and Syria were throughout strained to the last degree, so that such a friendly passage between the two kings as is here described is not to be thought of.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he brought the letter to the King of Israel, saying.</span> The hostile relations between Syria and Israel would not interfere with the coming and going of a messenger from either king to the other, who would be invested with an ambassadorial character. <span class="cmt_word">Now when this letter is come unto thee.</span> We must not suppose that we have here the whole letter, which, no doubt, began with the customary Eastern formalities and elaborate compliments.

Ben-hadad assumed that, if the King of Israel had in his dominions a person able to cure leprosy, he would be fully cognizant of the fact, and would at once send for him, and call upon him for an exertion of his gift or art. He is not likely to have comprehended the relations in which Kings of Israel stood towards the Jehovistic prophets, but may probably have thought of Elisha "as a sort of chief magus, or as the Israelitish high priest" (Menken), whom the king would have at his beck and call, and whose services would be completely at his disposal. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/5-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the letter</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1505;&#1468;&#1461;&#1428;&#1508;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(has&#183;s&#234;&#183;p&#772;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
