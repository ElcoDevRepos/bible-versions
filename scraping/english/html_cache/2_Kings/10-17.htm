Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, established by King Omri, Ahab's father. This city was a center of political and religious power, often associated with the worship of Baal, which Jehu was determined to eliminate. Jehu's journey to Samaria signifies his commitment to fulfilling his divine mandate.<p><b>he struck down everyone belonging to Ahab who remained there</b><br>Jehu's actions were a continuation of his mission to obliterate Ahab's lineage, as prophesied by Elijah. This act of judgment was not only a political move but also a religious one, aimed at purging Israel of idolatry and returning the nation to the worship of Yahweh. The complete destruction of Ahab's descendants was necessary to prevent any resurgence of Baal worship and to fulfill the divine judgment pronounced against Ahab's house.<p><b>until he had destroyed them</b><br>The thoroughness of Jehu's actions underscores the seriousness of God's judgment against Ahab's family. This destruction was not merely punitive but served as a warning to Israel about the consequences of idolatry and disobedience to God. It reflects the biblical principle that God's justice is comprehensive and that sin has severe repercussions.<p><b>according to the word that the LORD had spoken to Elijah</b><br>This phrase highlights the fulfillment of prophecy, emphasizing the reliability and sovereignty of God's word. Elijah, a major prophet in Israel, had previously declared God's judgment against Ahab and his descendants (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-24</a>). Jehu's actions serve as a direct fulfillment of this prophecy, demonstrating that God's promises and warnings are certain. This also points to the broader biblical theme of God's faithfulness in executing His plans and purposes, often using human agents to accomplish His divine will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>Anointed king of Israel, tasked with executing God's judgment on the house of Ahab.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, where Jehu carried out his mission.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab's_family.htm">Ahab&#8217;s Family</a></b><br>The royal family of the Northern Kingdom, known for their idolatry and wickedness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who had decreed judgment against Ahab's house.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>The prophet who originally prophesied the destruction of Ahab&#8217;s lineage due to their sins.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>God's word is always fulfilled, as seen in the prophecy against Ahab's house.
