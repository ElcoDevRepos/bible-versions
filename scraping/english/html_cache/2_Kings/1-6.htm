In the biblical narrative, prophets often served as messengers of God, delivering His words directly to the people or leaders of Israel. Elijah's sudden appearance and authoritative message underscore his role as a true prophet of God, contrasting with the false prophets of Baal.<p><b>&#8216;Go back to the king who sent you and tell him that this is what the LORD says:</b><br>The instruction to return to the king emphasizes the authority of the message. The phrase "this is what the LORD says" is a common prophetic formula, asserting that the message is not of human origin but divinely inspired. This underscores the sovereignty of God over the affairs of Israel, and the importance of heeding His word.<p><b>Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending these men to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights the spiritual apostasy of King Ahaziah, who sought guidance from a foreign deity rather than the God of Israel. Baal-zebub, meaning "lord of the flies," was a Philistine god worshiped in Ekron, a city in the Philistine pentapolis. This act of seeking a pagan god reflects a lack of faith and trust in Yahweh, the covenant God of Israel, and is a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p><b>Therefore you will not get up from the bed on which you are lying.</b><br>The pronouncement of judgment is direct and unequivocal. The bed symbolizes Ahaziah's current state of helplessness and impending death. This serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and idolatry, consistent with the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.<p><b>You will surely die.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The certainty of Ahaziah's death is a fulfillment of divine judgment. This phrase echoes the language of <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>, where God warns Adam of the consequences of disobedience. It serves as a sobering reminder of the seriousness of sin and the ultimate authority of God over life and death.

Just as Elijah first appeared suddenly before Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>) and is later identified by his hairy cloak (<a href="/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>), God once more places His prophet exactly where He wants him.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-10</a> shows the Lord&#8217;s inescapable presence.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a> reminds us that every earthly ruler is ultimately directed by God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said</b><p>The prophet speaks, but the voice is the Lord&#8217;s. <a href="/jeremiah/1-9.htm">Jeremiah 1:9</a> records, &#8220;Then the LORD stretched out His hand, touched my mouth, and said to me, &#8216;I have put My words in your mouth&#8217; &#8221;. Peter echoes the same truth: &#8220;men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>). This verse teaches that when God sends a message, the messenger&#8217;s authority comes solely from the God who inspires it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go back to the king who sent you</b><p>Heaven orders a complete about-face. Repentance always involves turning (<a href="/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15</a>). Like Naaman who &#8220;returned to the man of God&#8221; after being healed (<a href="/2_kings/5-15.htm">2 Kings 5:15</a>), the messengers must return at once. Their journey to a pagan oracle ends before it begins, underlining that no believer can delegate spiritual decisions to others without accountability (<a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and tell him that this is what the LORD says</b><p>&#8220;Thus says the LORD&#8221; is the prophet&#8217;s signature line (<a href="/1_kings/21-19.htm">1 Kings 21:19</a>). The phrase establishes who owns the coming words. <a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a> teaches that &#8220;man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD&#8221;. When the Lord speaks, His word outweighs royal decrees, cultural trends, or personal feelings.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending these men to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?</b><p>The question slices straight to the king&#8217;s heart: unbelief. Israel&#8217;s covenant God has proven Himself from the Red Sea (<a href="/bsb/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>) to Mount Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21, 38</a>). Yet Ahaziah prefers a Philistine idol whose name (&#8220;lord of flies&#8221;) mocks its own impotence (<a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a>). The Lord&#8217;s jealousy is righteous: &#8220;I am the LORD; that is My name! I will not give My glory to another&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>). To ignore the true God is to deny His existence in practice, even if one knows His name.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Therefore you will not get up from the bed on which you are lying</b><p>The sickbed becomes the judgment seat. Isaiah delivered a similar verdict to Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/20-1.htm">2 Kings 20:1</a>); that king cried out to the Lord and was granted fifteen more years. Ahaziah never cries out. <a href="/numbers/14-35.htm">Numbers 14:35</a> shows that when God decrees a sentence, only true repentance can change the outcome. Here, no plea is offered&#8212;only silence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You will surely die.</b><p>The Hebrew construction doubles the verb for absolute certainty; its English echo is <a href="/genesis/2-17.htm">Genesis 2:17</a>&#8212;&#8220;you will surely die.&#8221; Scripture repeats this principle: &#8220;it is appointed for men to die once, and after this comes judgment&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>). God is not mocked; &#8220;whatever a man sows, that he will also reap&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). Ahaziah sowed idolatry and reaped death.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/1-6.htm">2 Kings 1:6</a> shows God halting a sinful mission, confronting unbelief, and pronouncing sure judgment. Elijah&#8217;s sudden appearance reveals God&#8217;s pursuing grace; his words unveil the folly of seeking answers outside the Lord; the verdict demonstrates that rejecting God brings unavoidable consequences. The passage calls every reader to trust the one true God, heed His Word, and turn from all substitutes, because only the Lord holds life&#8212;and death&#8212;in His hands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">Thou sendest.</span>--<span class= "ital">Art sending</span>.
