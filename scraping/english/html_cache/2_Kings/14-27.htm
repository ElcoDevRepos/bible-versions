It reflects the biblical theme that God's word is unchanging and reliable. In the context of Israel's history, God's promises and warnings through the prophets were central to the nation's understanding of their relationship with Him. This phrase also underscores the importance of divine prophecy, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word is described as accomplishing what He desires.<p><b>that He would not blot out the name of Israel from under heaven</b><br>Here, the phrase highlights God's covenant faithfulness to Israel despite their repeated disobedience. The concept of "blotting out" a name is significant in biblical terms, often associated with judgment or removal from God's favor (<a href="/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32-33</a>). However, God's commitment to preserving Israel's identity and existence is rooted in His promises to the patriarchs, such as in <a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2-3</a> with Abraham. This assurance of preservation is a testament to God's grace and long-term plan for His people.<p><b>He saved them by the hand of Jeroboam son of Jehoash</b><br>This part of the verse refers to Jeroboam II, a king of Israel who reigned during a time of relative prosperity and military success. Despite the moral and spiritual decline of the nation, God used Jeroboam II to deliver Israel from its enemies, particularly the Arameans. This reflects a recurring biblical theme where God uses imperfect leaders to fulfill His purposes, similar to how He used Cyrus of Persia (<a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>). Jeroboam's reign is detailed in <a href="/2_kings/14-23.htm">2 Kings 14:23-29</a>, where his military achievements are noted, yet his failure to lead spiritual reform is also highlighted.
