The "commanders of hundreds" were military leaders responsible for a hundred soldiers each, indicating a structured and organized military force. This action signifies a strategic preparation for a coup to protect the rightful heir to the throne, Joash, from Queen Athaliah's usurpation. The involvement of the priest highlights the intertwining of religious and political leadership in Israel.<p><b>the spears and shields of King David</b><br>These weapons symbolize the continuity of the Davidic dynasty and the divine covenant with David. By using King David's weapons, Jehoiada invokes the legacy and authority of David, reminding the people of God's promises to David's lineage. This act also serves as a rallying point for those loyal to the Davidic line, emphasizing the legitimacy of Joash's claim to the throne. The reference to David connects this event to the broader biblical narrative of God's faithfulness to His covenant.<p><b>from the house of the LORD</b><br>The house of the LORD refers to the temple in Jerusalem, which was not only a place of worship but also a repository for sacred and historical artifacts. The presence of King David's weapons in the temple underscores their sacred status and the temple's role as a symbol of God's presence and covenant with Israel. This setting highlights the religious significance of the actions taken by Jehoiada, as they are not merely political but deeply rooted in the spiritual heritage of Israel.

The arms which David had laid up in the Temple as spoils of war were now to be used, appropriately enough, for the restoration of David's heir to the throne. Possibly, as Bahr suggests, the guards who came off duty at the palace had left their weapons there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give King David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the Lord.</span> We hear of David carrying with him to Jerusalem the "shields of gold," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shields ornamented with gold, which he took from the servants of Hadadezer (<a href="/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>); but otherwise we are not told of his establishing an armory. Solomon made six hundred shields of solid gold, and laid them up in the house of the forest of Lebanon (<a href="/1_kings/10-17.htm">1 Kings 10:17</a>); but these were carried off by Sheshonk, when he invaded Judaea in the reign of Rehoboam (<a href="/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>). Rehoboam, in their place, made three hundred brazen shields (<a href="/1_kings/14-27.htm">1 Kings 14:27</a>), which, however, were deposited in the guard-chamber of the royal palace. Of spears collected by David, and laid up in the temple, we know nothing beyond the present passage. There can be little doubt that the weapons were brought forth from their receptacle with the view (as Ewald says) of "consecrating the work of the restoration of the Davidic house with the sacred arms of the great founder himself" (see 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 136) - not, however, with arms that he had worn, but with some which he had collected and laid up. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/11-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the priest</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1436;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
