Jehoash, also known as Joash, was the king of Israel, the northern kingdom, during this time. His reign is noted in <a href="/2_kings/13-10.htm">2 Kings 13:10-25</a>, where he is described as doing evil in the sight of the Lord, continuing the sins of Jeroboam. The synchronization of reigns between Israel and Judah is a common method in the biblical narrative to provide a timeline. This period is marked by political instability and frequent conflicts between the two kingdoms. Jehoash's reign is significant for his military campaigns and his interactions with the prophet Elisha, who prophesied victories for Israel.<p><b>Amaziah son of Joash became king of Judah</b><br>Amaziah's ascension to the throne of Judah, the southern kingdom, marks a continuation of the Davidic line, which is significant in biblical prophecy and typology. His father, Joash, had been a reformer king who repaired the temple but later fell into idolatry, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/12.htm">2 Kings 12</a>. Amaziah's reign is detailed in <a href="/2_kings/14.htm">2 Kings 14:1-20</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/25.htm">2 Chronicles 25</a>, where he is described as doing what was right in the eyes of the Lord, but not wholeheartedly. His reign is characterized by military campaigns, including a notable victory over Edom, and a subsequent ill-fated challenge against Jehoash of Israel. Amaziah's life and reign serve as a reminder of the importance of wholehearted devotion to God, a theme echoed throughout the scriptures. His eventual downfall due to pride and idolatry serves as a cautionary tale and a typological warning against turning away from God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>The son of Joash, who became king of Judah.

Amaziah would later heed and then ignore prophetic counsel (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-7.htm">2 Chronicles 25:7-10, 15</a>-16).<p>&#8226; The verse quietly affirms divine sovereignty: God &#8220;removes kings and establishes them&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).

Mentioning Jehoash spotlights the spiritual contrast between the two kingdoms. Naming Amaziah&#8217;s lineage ties Judah to David&#8217;s enduring covenant.
