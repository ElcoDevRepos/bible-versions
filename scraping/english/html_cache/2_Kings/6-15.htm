The "servant of the man of God" refers to Elisha's attendant, who is unnamed in this passage. The early morning timing suggests a routine start to the day, yet it quickly turns into a moment of crisis. In biblical times, early morning was often a time for prayer and preparation, indicating the servant's diligence. This moment parallels other biblical instances where God reveals His plans or protection in the morning, such as the provision of manna for the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/16-21.htm">Exodus 16:21</a>).<p><b>behold, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city</b><br>The presence of an army with horses and chariots indicates a formidable military force, typical of ancient Near Eastern warfare. Horses and chariots were symbols of power and might, often used by nations like Egypt and Assyria. The city referred to is Dothan, a location mentioned earlier in <a href="/2_kings/6-13.htm">2 Kings 6:13</a>. Dothan was strategically significant, situated on a trade route, making it a target for military action. This scenario reflects the ongoing conflict between Israel and Aram (Syria), highlighting the political and military tensions of the time.<p><b>So he asked Elisha, &#8220;Oh, my master, what are we to do?&#8221;</b><br>The servant's question to Elisha reveals his fear and uncertainty in the face of overwhelming odds. Addressing Elisha as "my master" shows respect and recognition of Elisha's authority and spiritual insight. This moment of crisis prompts a reliance on divine guidance, a common theme in Scripture where human limitations are met with God's intervention. The servant's reaction is reminiscent of other biblical figures who faced daunting challenges, such as Moses at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-10.htm">Exodus 14:10-12</a>) or the disciples during the storm (<a href="/mark/4-38.htm">Mark 4:38</a>).

Proximity to spiritual leadership is a privilege, yet it does not automatically banish fear; relationship with God must become personal.<p>&#8226; Early hours often become moments when God reveals both danger and deliverance&#8212;<a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24</a> notes the Lord looking down on Egypt&#8217;s army &#8220;in the morning watch,&#8221; and <a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a> shows Jesus seeking the Father before sunrise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>behold, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city</b><p>&#8226; The Aramean king&#8217;s troops encircle Dothan (<a href="/2_kings/6-13.htm">2 Kings 6:13&#8211;14</a>). Their horses and chariots symbolize the peak of military technology, echoing Pharaoh&#8217;s pursuit in <a href="/exodus/14-9.htm">Exodus 14:9</a> and the Assyrian threat in <a href="/isaiah/36-8.htm">Isaiah 36:8</a>.<p>&#8226; Being &#8220;surrounded&#8221; intensifies helplessness&#8212;<a href="/psalms/3-6.htm">Psalm 3:6</a>: &#8220;I will not fear ten thousands who have set themselves against me.&#8221; From a strictly earthly view, escape is impossible.<p>&#8226; Scripture contrasts human might with divine sovereignty: &#8220;Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>). The same God who once sent &#8220;chariots of fire&#8221; for Elijah (<a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>) will shortly display them again, proving that His resources dwarf the enemy&#8217;s.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So he asked Elisha, &#8220;Oh, my master, what are we to do?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The servant voices raw panic, much like the disciples&#8217; cry, &#8220;Lord, save us! We are perishing!&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/8-25.htm">Matthew 8:25</a>). Fear is not sin in itself; clinging to it instead of turning to God is.<p>&#8226; His first instinct is to consult God&#8217;s representative. That impulse is healthy: when overwhelmed, believers should take anxieties &#8220;by prayer and petition&#8221; to the Lord (<a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>) and seek wise counsel from mature saints (<a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The question sets the stage for God&#8217;s answer in vv. 16&#8211;17: &#8220;Do not be afraid&#8230; those who are with us are more.&#8221; Faith sees what eyes cannot&#8212;<a href="/hebrews/11-1.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/6-15.htm">2 Kings 6:15</a> captures the clash between visible danger and invisible protection. At dawn, an unsuspecting servant confronts overwhelming force, yet his cry opens the door for God to unveil heavenly armies. The verse reminds believers that fear meets its match when brought to the Lord; no earthly power can outflank the sovereign God who surrounds His people with might far greater than anything opposed to them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">The servant of the man of God.</span>--<span class= "ital">One waiting on</span> (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, a minister of) <span class= "ital">the man of God</span>.
