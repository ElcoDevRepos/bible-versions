His actions are described as evil, indicating a direct violation of God's commandments. The "sight of the LORD" emphasizes that God's perspective is the ultimate measure of righteousness, not human standards. This phrase is a recurring theme in the books of Kings, highlighting the moral and spiritual failures of Israel's leaders. Manasseh's reign is marked by idolatry and apostasy, contrasting with the reforms of his father, Hezekiah.<p><b>by following the abominations of the nations</b><br>The "abominations" refer to detestable practices, often associated with idolatry and pagan worship, which were common among the Canaanite nations. These practices included child sacrifice, divination, and temple prostitution. Manasseh's actions are seen as a return to these pagan customs, which were explicitly condemned in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-12</a>). This phrase underscores the influence of surrounding cultures on Israel and Judah, leading them away from their covenant relationship with God.<p><b>that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites</b><br>This refers to the conquest of Canaan, where God commanded the Israelites to dispossess the Canaanite nations due to their wickedness (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4-5</a>). The driving out of these nations was both a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham and a judgment against the Canaanites' sinful practices. Manasseh's actions are seen as a reversal of this divine judgment, as he reintroduces the very practices that led to the Canaanites' expulsion. This highlights the cyclical nature of sin and the need for continual faithfulness to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned for 55 years and is noted for his evil practices, including idolatry and leading Judah astray.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Jerusalem is located, and where Manasseh ruled.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who had given the Israelites the land and commanded them to follow His laws.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the pagan nations that previously inhabited the land of Canaan, known for their idolatrous practices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_abominations.htm">The Abominations</a></b><br>The detestable practices of the pagan nations, which included idol worship and other acts contrary to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_idolatry.htm">The Consequences of Idolatry</a></b><br>Manasseh's actions remind us of the severe consequences of turning away from God to follow idols.
