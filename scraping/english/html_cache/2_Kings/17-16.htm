The commandments referred to are those given by God through Moses, including the Ten Commandments and other laws found in the Torah. This abandonment signifies a total rejection of the covenant relationship with God, which was central to Israel's identity. Historically, this period was marked by political instability and spiritual decline, as the Northern Kingdom of Israel turned away from the worship of Yahweh. This act of abandoning God's commandments is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often leading to divine judgment, as seen in the Babylonian exile.<p><b>and made for themselves two cast idols of calves</b><br>The making of calf idols directly recalls the sin of the golden calf in <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>, where the Israelites created an idol while Moses was on Mount Sinai. In <a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>, Jeroboam, the first king of the Northern Kingdom, set up golden calves in Bethel and Dan to prevent his people from worshiping in Jerusalem. This act was a direct violation of the commandment against idolatry and represented a significant turning point in Israel's spiritual decline. Archaeological findings in these regions have uncovered evidence of idol worship, supporting the biblical narrative.<p><b>and an Asherah pole</b><br>Asherah was a Canaanite goddess associated with fertility and was often worshiped alongside Baal. The Asherah pole was a wooden symbol of this goddess, and its presence indicates the syncretism that plagued Israel, blending the worship of Yahweh with pagan practices. This was strictly forbidden in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-21.htm">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>, where God commanded the Israelites not to set up any Asherah poles beside His altar. The presence of Asherah worship in Israel reflects the cultural influence of surrounding nations and the failure of the Israelites to remain distinct as God's chosen people.<p><b>They bowed down to all the host of heaven</b><br>This phrase refers to the worship of celestial bodies such as the sun, moon, and stars, which was common among ancient Near Eastern cultures. This practice is condemned in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>, where God warns the Israelites not to be enticed into worshiping the heavenly bodies. The worship of the host of heaven represents a further departure from monotheism and the unique worship of Yahweh. It illustrates the extent of Israel's spiritual adultery and the influence of foreign religions.<p><b>and served Baal</b><br>Baal was a major deity in the Canaanite pantheon, often associated with storms and fertility. The worship of Baal was characterized by rituals that were abhorrent to Yahweh, including child sacrifice and temple prostitution. The Israelites' service to Baal is a recurring issue in the Old Testament, leading to numerous prophetic rebukes and judgments. The prophets Elijah and Elisha, in particular, confronted Baal worship directly, as seen in the dramatic contest on Mount Carmel in <a href="/1_kings/18.htm">1 Kings 18</a>. This service to Baal symbolizes the ultimate betrayal of the covenant and the spiritual infidelity of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of the Northern Kingdom of Israel who turned away from God's commandments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God whom the Israelites abandoned.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/calves.htm">Calves</a></b><br>Idols made by the Israelites, reminiscent of the golden calf in Exodus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/asherah_pole.htm">Asherah Pole</a></b><br>A wooden symbol associated with the Canaanite goddess Asherah, representing idolatry.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/baal.htm">Baal</a></b><br>A Canaanite deity whom the Israelites served, representing their departure from worshiping Yahweh.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but anything that takes the place of God in our lives.

The verse stands as a sober reminder that abandoning even one command can spiral into total apostasy, but clinging to God&#8217;s Word guards hearts and nations from such ruin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Molten images.</span>--<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm" title="Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.">1Kings 12:28</a>.

Schlottmann writes: "That Ashera was only another name for the same supreme goddess (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Ashtoreth) is at once shown by the parallelism of 'Baal and Ashtaroth' (<a href="/judges/2-13.htm" title="And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.">Judges 2:13</a>) with 'Baal and Asherim' (the plural of Ashera) in <a href="/judges/3-7.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.">Judges 3:7</a>.

He then refers to <a href="/1_kings/14-23.htm" title="For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree.">1Kings 14:23</a> and <a href="/isaiah/17-8.htm" title="And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither shall respect that which his fingers have made, either the groves, or the images.">Isaiah 17:8</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-9.htm" title="By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he makes all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.">Isaiah 27:9</a>, and continues: "according to these and many other passages, <span class= "ital">Ashera</span> was used as the designation of the commonest material representation of the goddess. It consisted of a block of wood, of considerable size (<a href="/judges/6-26.htm" title="And build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which you shall cut down.">Judges 6:26</a>), and resembling a tree, as is shown by the expressions used in connection with it, such as <span class= "ital">'</span>setting up,' 'planting,' and 'cutting down' (<a href="/2_kings/17-10.htm" title="And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree:">2Kings 17:10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-21.htm" title="You shall not plant you a grove of any trees near to the altar of the LORD your God, which you shall make you.">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>; <a href="/judges/6-28.htm" title="And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered on the altar that was built.">Judges 6:28</a>; <a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm" title="He removed the high places, and broke the images, and cut down the groves, and broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made: for to those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.">2Kings 18:4</a>, &c). In <a href="/isaiah/27-9.htm" title="By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he makes all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.">Isaiah 27:9</a> the LXX. actually renders tree; 'and so the Peshito in Deut. vi 21, <a href="/micah/5-13.htm" title="Your graven images also will I cut off, and your standing images out of the middle of you; and you shall no more worship the work of your hands.">Micah 5:13</a>. Hence, we must not think of pillars like the Greek Hermae, but of a <span class= "ital">real trunk planted in the ground, rootless, but not branchless;</span> for which purpose pines and evergreens were preferred. The <span class= "ital">tree</span> signifies, according to an ancient and widespread conception, <span class= "ital">nature,</span> or <span class= "ital">the world,</span> which in this case stands as goddess at the side of the Baal----<span class= "ital">the lord</span> of the world. (Comp. the Norse tree, Yggdrasil, and the Assyrian sacred tree.) Hence, the Ashera was set up by the altar of Baal (<a href="/judges/6-28.htm" title="And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered on the altar that was built.">Judges 6:28</a>). (Comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/16-21.htm" title="You shall not plant you a grove of any trees near to the altar of the LORD your God, which you shall make you.">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>.)" Schlottmann adds that Movers is wrong in making Astarte and Ashera two different goddesses, the former being "the stern, cruel virgin," the latter, "the goddess who excites to pleasure;" and he justly observes that, as in the case of Baal, the same deity may be conceived under contrary aspects (Riehm's <span class= "ital">Handworterbuch Bibl. Alterthums,</span> pp. Ill--114). For the Hebrew conception of Astarte see <a href="/jeremiah/7-18.htm" title="The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.">Jeremiah 7:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/44-17.htm" title="But we will certainly do whatever thing goes forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.">Jeremiah 44:17</a> <span class= "ital">seq.</span> Kuenen, <span class= "ital">Rel. of Isr. i.</span> 88 <span class= "ital">seq.,</span> agrees with Movers, but hardly proves his case. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - The main sins of Israel are now specified, that they themselves may stand self-convicted, and that others may be warned against doing the like.

Such knowledge as we have of the Western Asiatic religions seems to indicate that <span class="accented">astral</span> worship, strictly so called, was a peculiarity of the Assyro-Babylonian and Arabian systems only, and did not belong to the Syrian, or the Phoenician, or the Canaanite. It may be suspected that the present passage is somewhat rhetorical, and assigns to the Israelites the "worship of the host of heaven," simply because an astral character attached to Baal and Ashtoreth, who were associated in the religion of the Phoenicians with the sun and moon. On the ether hand, it is just possible that the Assyro-Babylonian star-worship had been introduced into Israel under Menahem, Pekah, or Hoshea. <span class="cmt_word">And served Baal.</span> The Baal-worship, introduced by Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31</a>), was not finally abolished by Jehu (<a href="/2_kings/10-28.htm">2 Kings 10:28</a>).
