The woman's words, which are detailed earlier in the chapter, reveal the desperate conditions, including cannibalism. This reflects the fulfillment of the curses for disobedience found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53-57</a>, where such dire circumstances are predicted as a consequence of turning away from God.<p><b>he tore his clothes</b><br>Tearing one's clothes is a traditional expression of grief, distress, or repentance in ancient Israelite culture. This act signifies the king's deep anguish and helplessness in the face of the dire situation. It is a public display of mourning, similar to other biblical instances such as <a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a> and <a href="/2_samuel/13-19.htm">2 Samuel 13:19</a>.<p><b>And as he passed by on the wall</b><br>The wall of Samaria was a place of defense and oversight, where the king could survey the city and its dire conditions.

The wall also symbolizes the city's isolation and vulnerability during the siege.<p><b>the people saw the sackcloth under his clothes next to his skin</b><br>Sackcloth is a coarse material traditionally worn as a sign of mourning or repentance. The fact that the king wore sackcloth under his royal garments indicates a personal acknowledgment of the need for repentance, though it is hidden from public view. This act can be seen as a superficial gesture, as his heart may not have been truly repentant, reflecting the broader spiritual state of Israel. Sackcloth is often associated with humility and seeking God's mercy, as seen in <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-6</a> and <a href="/isaiah/58-5.htm">Isaiah 58:5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_israel.htm">The King of Israel</a></b><br>Likely King Jehoram, son of Ahab, who was ruling during the time of the Aramean siege of Samaria.

We are scarcely entitled to deny him any true penitential feeling, though no doubt he was far from possessing a chastened or humble spirit.
