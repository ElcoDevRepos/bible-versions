This interaction occurs during a time when Israel is under threat from the Arameans. Elisha's role as a prophet is to convey God's will and guidance to the king, emphasizing the importance of divine intervention in Israel's military affairs. Prophets often served as God's mouthpiece, providing counsel to kings and leaders.<p><b>&#8220;Put your hand on the bow.&#8221;</b><br>The bow symbolizes warfare and military strength. By instructing the king to take the bow, Elisha is preparing him for an act of symbolic warfare. This action signifies readiness and willingness to engage in battle, underlining the importance of obedience to prophetic instruction as a means of securing victory. The bow is also a common weapon in ancient Near Eastern warfare, highlighting the historical context of military conflict during this period.<p><b>So the king put his hand on the bow,</b><br>The king's compliance with Elisha's command demonstrates his recognition of the prophet's authority and the need for divine guidance in military matters. This act of obedience is crucial, as it sets the stage for the subsequent prophetic action and blessing. It reflects the biblical theme of leaders seeking God's direction through His prophets.<p><b>and Elisha put his hands on the king&#8217;s hands.</b><br>Elisha placing his hands on the king's hands symbolizes the transfer of divine power and blessing. This gesture indicates that the forthcoming victory is not by the king's might alone but through God's intervention. It also represents the unity between divine will and human action, a recurring theme in Scripture where God's power works through human agents. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, where Jesus empowers and guides believers in their spiritual battles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet in Israel, successor of Elijah, known for his miracles and guidance to the kings of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_israel.htm">King of Israel</a></b><br>At this time, Jehoash (also known as Joash), who sought Elisha's counsel in battle against Aram.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bow_and_arrow.htm">Bow and Arrow</a></b><br>Symbolic tools used in this passage to represent God's deliverance and victory over Aram.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aram.htm">Aram</a></b><br>A neighboring nation often at war with Israel, representing opposition and challenges faced by God's people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_action.htm">Prophetic Action</a></b><br>Elisha's act of placing his hands on the king's hands symbolizes divine empowerment and guidance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_empowerment.htm">Divine Empowerment</a></b><br>Just as Elisha placed his hands on the king's hands, we must seek God's empowerment in our battles, recognizing that true strength comes from Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolic_actions.htm">Symbolic Actions</a></b><br>The use of the bow and arrow as symbols teaches us that God often uses tangible means to convey spiritual truths and promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_guidance.htm">Prophetic Guidance</a></b><br>Elisha's role highlights the importance of seeking godly counsel and wisdom in our decisions and challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The king's obedience to Elisha's instructions demonstrates the necessity of faith and action working together in our spiritual journey.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/victory_through_god.htm">Victory through God</a></b><br>The passage assures us that victory over our adversaries is possible when we align ourselves with God's will and power.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_13_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 13:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_13_16_Obedience_s_importance.htm">How does 2 Kings 13:16 demonstrate the importance of obedience to God's commands?

Elisha&#8217;s command calls Joash to active participation rather than passive hope.<p>&#8226; Scripture often joins divine promise with human action: God &#8220;trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-34.htm">Psalm 18:34</a>), yet David still picked up the sling (<a href="/1_samuel/17-49.htm">1 Samuel 17:49</a>).<p>&#8226; By grasping the bow, Joash shows immediate, visible obedience, similar to Gideon dividing his men and taking trumpets in faith (<a href="/judges/7-16.htm">Judges 7:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the king put his hand on the bow</b><p>&#8220;So the king put his hand on the bow&#8221;<p>&#8226; Joash complies without hesitation, illustrating that faith and obedience go hand in hand (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Unlike later moments when Joash&#8217;s obedience falters (vv. 18&#8211;19), his prompt response here aligns with earlier examples of simple, trusting submission&#8212;Naaman dipping seven times in the Jordan (<a href="/2_kings/5-14.htm">2 Kings 5:14</a>) or Israel declaring, &#8220;All that the LORD has spoken we will do&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-8.htm">Exodus 19:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s action is tangible evidence that God&#8217;s people are called to step into the tasks He sets before them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Elisha put his hands on the king&#8217;s hands</b><p>&#8220;Elisha put his hands on the king&#8217;s hands.&#8221;<p>&#8226; A prophetic overlay: Elisha&#8217;s touch signifies the Lord&#8217;s power guiding Joash&#8217;s own strength, much like Moses&#8217; upheld hands ensured Israel&#8217;s victory over Amalek (<a href="/exodus/17-11.htm">Exodus 17:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Laying on of hands often marks divine commissioning or empowerment&#8212;Moses with Joshua (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-9.htm">Deuteronomy 34:9</a>) and the Antioch church sending out missionaries (<a href="/acts/13-3.htm">Acts 13:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Though Elisha&#8217;s body is weakening, God&#8217;s might flows through him; the gesture pictures the reality that &#8220;the LORD is with you when you are with Him&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/15-2.htm">2 Chronicles 15:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Joash can now proceed confident that the forthcoming victory (v. 17) is not merely his own, but the LORD&#8217;s.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every phrase of <a href="/2_kings/13-16.htm">2 Kings 13:16</a> highlights a cooperative partnership: God speaks through His prophet, expects responsive obedience from His king, and then places His enabling power upon that obedience. Joash&#8217;s hand on the bow shows readiness; Elisha&#8217;s hands over his confirm that victory will be by the LORD&#8217;s strength, not human prowess. The verse invites modern believers to listen for God&#8217;s direction, act promptly on it, and rely wholly on His empowering presence for every battle ahead.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Put thine hand upon the bow.</span>--Rather, as margin.

The intention was, no doubt, as Keil says, "to show that the power which was to be given to the bow-shot" was not the king's own power, but "came from the Lord through the mediation of his prophet." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/13-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Elisha said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;
