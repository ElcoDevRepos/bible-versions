The speaker, King Hezekiah, is addressing God directly, recognizing His sovereignty and omniscience. This reflects a deep faith and reliance on God, a common theme throughout the Old Testament. The use of "O LORD" signifies a personal relationship with Yahweh, the covenant name of God, emphasizing His eternal and unchanging nature.<p><b>the kings of Assyria</b><br>The Assyrian Empire was a dominant force in the ancient Near East during the time of Hezekiah. Known for their military prowess and brutal conquests, the Assyrians were feared by many nations. The reference to "kings" indicates the succession of Assyrian rulers who expanded the empire's territory. This historical context highlights the threat faced by Judah and the significance of Hezekiah's plea for divine intervention.<p><b>have laid waste</b><br>This phrase describes the destructive actions of the Assyrians, who were notorious for their scorched-earth tactics. They would often destroy cities, deport populations, and leave lands desolate. This devastation serves as a backdrop for understanding the dire situation Judah faced and the miraculous nature of God's deliverance, as later recounted in the narrative.<p><b>these nations and their lands</b><br>The Assyrian conquests affected numerous nations, including Israel, Syria, and parts of Mesopotamia. The mention of "nations and their lands" underscores the widespread impact of Assyrian aggression. It also highlights the geopolitical reality of the time, where smaller states were often at the mercy of larger empires. This context sets the stage for understanding the miraculous preservation of Jerusalem, which stands in contrast to the fate of other nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah during the time of the Assyrian threat.
