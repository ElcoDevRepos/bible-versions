The mention of "seventy sons" likely includes both direct sons and grandsons, indicating a large royal family. Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, was a significant city both politically and religiously. The number seventy often symbolizes completeness or totality in the Bible, suggesting the full extent of Ahab's lineage and influence.<p><b>So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria</b><br>Jehu, anointed king of Israel, was tasked with eradicating the house of Ahab as part of God's judgment. Writing letters was a common means of communication for official and military matters in the ancient Near East. This action demonstrates Jehu's strategic approach to consolidating power and fulfilling his divine mandate. Samaria, as the center of Ahab's power, was a critical target for Jehu's campaign.<p><b>to the officials of Jezreel,</b><br>Jezreel was a significant city in the Northern Kingdom, associated with Ahab's dynasty. The officials here were likely those who managed the affairs of the royal family and the city. Jezreel was also the site of Naboth's vineyard, where Ahab and Jezebel committed grave injustice, further highlighting the city's connection to Ahab's sins.<p><b>to the elders,</b><br>Elders in ancient Israelite society were respected leaders and decision-makers within the community. Their inclusion in the letter indicates Jehu's intent to involve all levels of leadership in his plan. The elders' role was crucial in maintaining order and implementing decisions, making their support vital for Jehu's success.<p><b>and to the guardians of the sons of Ahab,</b><br>Guardians were responsible for the care and education of royal children, ensuring their safety and preparation for future roles. By addressing them, Jehu acknowledges their influence over Ahab's descendants. This move also underscores the thoroughness of Jehu's plan to eliminate any potential claimants to the throne from Ahab's line.<p><b>saying:</b><br>The content of Jehu's message would reveal his intentions and strategy. This introduction sets the stage for a decisive moment in Israel's history, where Jehu's actions would fulfill the prophecy against Ahab's house, as foretold by Elijah.

Through a simple set of letters, Jehu places every stratum of leadership on notice: officials, elders, and guardians alike must acknowledge the LORD&#8217;s decree against the house of Ahab. The verse showcases God&#8217;s faithfulness to His word of judgment, the futility of human security apart from Him, and the wisdom of swift obedience to divine command.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>X.<p>JEHU MASSACRES THE FAMILY OF AHAB, THE KINSMEN OF AHAZIAH, AND BAAL-WORSHIPPERS.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Ahab had seventy sons.</span>--His posterity in general are meant. Ahab had been dead about fourteen years (<a href="/2_kings/3-1.htm" title="Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.">2Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-51.htm" title="Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.">1Kings 22:51</a>), and had had two successors on the throne. The name <span class= "ital">Ahab</span> seems to be used here as equivalent to <span class= "ital">the house of Ahab</span>. Many of the number might be strictly sons of Ahab, as he no doubt had a considerable harem.<p><span class= "bld">Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria.</span>--Jehu was crafty as well as fierce. He could not venture to the capital without first sounding the inclinations of the nobles of the city.<p><span class= "bld">Unto the rulers of Jezreel.</span>--"Jezreel" is an ancient error. The LXX. has "unto the rulers of Samaria." So Josephus. Thenius accordingly suggests that the original reading was, "and sent from Jezreel to the princes of Samaria." The Vulg. gives "ad optimates civitatis," which seems preferable. Before "the elders" we must restore "and unto" with some MSS., the LXX., Syriac, and Vulg. The original text would then run: "and sent to the princes of the city and unto the elders," &c. Reuss, on the other hand, reads "Israel" for "Jezreel."<p><span class= "bld">Them that brought up Ahab's children.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">them who brought up Ahab </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the house of Ahab). The word occurs in <a href="/numbers/11-12.htm" title="Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that you should say to me, Carry them in your bosom, as a nursing father bears the sucking child, to the land which you swore to their fathers?">Numbers 11:12</a>; <a href="/isaiah/49-23.htm" title="And kings shall be your nursing fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers: they shall bow down to you with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of your feet; and you shall know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.">Isaiah 49:23</a> ("nursing father"). The nobles entrusted with this charge would be responsible for the good behaviour of their wards. Ahab may have dreaded the evils of an education in the harem, and possible disputes about the succession. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">destruction of the seventy seas of Ahab</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria.</span> By " sons" we must understand "male descendants. Most of the seventy wore probably his grandsons (see ver. 3); some may have been great-grandsons. They lived in Samaria; since Samaria was the principal residence of the court, Jezreel being simply a country palace - the "Versailles," as it has been called, or "Windsor" of the Israelite kings. <span class="cmt_word">And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel.</span> "Jezreel" is almost certainly a corrupt reading. The "rulers of Jezreel" would be at Jezreel; and, if Jehu wished to communicate with them, he would not need to "write." Had any chance taken them to Samaria - a very improbable circumstance - they would have had no authority there, and to address them would have been useless. John's letters were, no doubt, addressed <span class="accented">to the rulers of Samaria</span>; and so the LXX. expressly state (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); but the reading "Jezreel" can scarcely have arisen out of "Samaria" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5e2;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span> out of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5de;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>), since the difference of the two words is so great. Most probably the original word was "Israel" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5e8;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>), which is easily corrupted into "Jezreel" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5d6;&#x5e8;&#x5e2;&#x5d0;&#x5dc;</span>).
