The exile was a fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah and Isaiah, who had cautioned that disobedience to God would lead to such consequences. Jerusalem, the center of Jewish religious life and the location of the Temple, was devastated, marking a significant moment in Israel's history.<p><b>all the commanders and mighty men of valor</b><br>The deportation included military leaders and warriors, which was a strategic move by Nebuchadnezzar to weaken any potential rebellion. By removing the military elite, Babylon ensured that Judah would be less capable of organizing resistance. This reflects a common practice in ancient conquests to destabilize the conquered region.<p><b>all the craftsmen and metalsmiths</b><br>Craftsmen and metalsmiths were essential for the economy and the production of weapons and tools. Their exile would have crippled the local economy and further prevented any military resurgence. This also highlights the value placed on skilled labor in ancient societies, as these individuals were taken to contribute to Babylon's own prosperity.<p><b>ten thousand captives in all</b><br>The number "ten thousand" signifies a large portion of the population, though it may not be a precise figure. This mass deportation was part of a larger strategy to assimilate the people of Judah into Babylonian culture, as seen in the stories of Daniel and his companions, who were also taken to Babylon.<p><b>Only the poorest people of the land remained</b><br>Leaving behind the poorest people ensured that the land would not be completely desolate, allowing for some agricultural production to continue. These individuals were likely seen as less of a threat and less valuable to Babylon. This remnant would later play a role in the eventual return and rebuilding of Jerusalem, as prophesied in books like Ezekiel and fulfilled in Ezra and Nehemiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nebuchadnezzar.htm">Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The king of Babylon who led the conquest of Jerusalem and initiated the exile.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, which was besieged and its inhabitants taken into exile.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/commanders_and_mighty_men_of_valor.htm">Commanders and Mighty Men of Valor</a></b><br>The military leaders and skilled warriors of Judah who were taken captive.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/craftsmen_and_smiths.htm">Craftsmen and Smiths</a></b><br>Skilled laborers essential for the economy and defense, also taken into exile.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_poorest_people.htm">The Poorest People</a></b><br>Those left behind in the land, likely because they posed no threat and had little to offer Babylon.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The exile was a direct result of Judah's persistent disobedience to God.

It is obvious that by deporting "the craftsmen and smiths" the king of Babylon made further outbreaks impossible (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/13-19.htm" title="Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them swords or spears:">1Samuel 13:19</a>.) Kimchi's explanation of "smiths" is a curiosity of exegesis. He makes of them "learned persons, who <span class= "ital">shut other people's mouths,</span> and propose riddles which nobody else can guess." Hitzig and Thenius derive the word (<span class= "ital">masg?r</span>) from <span class= "ital">mas, </span>"levy," and <span class= "ital">g?r, </span>"alien," so that it would originally mean "statute labourers," "Canaanites compelled to work for the king;" and afterwards, as here, "manual labourers" in general. But such a compound term in Hebrew would be very surprising. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he carried away all Jerusalem.</span> The expression has to be limited by what follows. "All Jerusalem" means all that was important in the population of Jerusalem all the upper classes, the "princes" and "nobles," all the men trained to the use of arms, and all the skilled craftsmen and artisans of the city. The poor and weak and unskilled were left. The number deported, according to our author, was either ten or eleven thousand. The whole population of the ancient city has been calculated from its area at fifteen thousand. The largest estimate of the population of the modern city is seventeen thousand. <span class="cmt_word">And all the princes.</span> The <span class="accented">sarim</span>, or "princes," are not males of the blood royal, but the nobles, or upper classes of Jerusalem (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/25-18.htm">Jeremiah 25:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-10.htm">Jeremiah 26:10-16</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">And all the mighty men of valor</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "all the trained troops" (Ewald); not "all the men of wealth," as Bahr renders - <span class="cmt_word">even ten thousand captives.</span> As the soldiers are reckoned below (ver. 16) at seven thousand, and the craftsmen at one thousand, the upper-class captives would seem to have been two thousand; unless, indeed, the "craftsmen" are additional to the ten thousand, in which Case the upper-class captives would have numbered three thousand, and the prisoners have amounted altogether to eleven thousand. <span class="cmt_word">And all the craftsmen and smiths.</span> Ewald understands "the <span class="accented">military</span> workmen and siege engineers" to be intended ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 263, note 9); but the term <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>in Hebrew includes all workers in stone, metal, or wood (<a href="/genesis/4-22.htm">Genesis 4:22</a>; <a href="/isaiah/44-12.htm">Isaiah 44:12</a>; <a href="/1_kings/7-14.htm">1 Kings 7:14</a>), and there is nothing to limit it here to <span class="accented">military</span> craftsmen. It was an Oriental practice to weaken a state by the deportation of all the stronger elements of its population. <span class="cmt_word">None remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land.</span> These words must be taken with some latitude. There are still "princes" in Jerusalem under Zedekiah (<a href="/jeremiah/38-4.htm">Jeremiah 38:4, 25, 27</a>), and courtiers of rank (<a href="/jeremiah/38-7.htm">Jeremiah 38:7</a>), and "captains of forces" (<a href="/jeremiah/40-7.htm">Jeremiah 40:7</a>), and "men of war" (<a href="/jeremiah/52-7.htm">Jeremiah 52:7</a>). But the bulk of the inhabitants now left behind in Jerusalem were poor and of small account. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/24-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He carried into exile</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1490;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hi&#7713;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
