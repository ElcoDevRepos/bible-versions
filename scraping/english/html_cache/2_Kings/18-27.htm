His role was to deliver messages and negotiate on behalf of the king. This encounter occurs during the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem under King Hezekiah of Judah. The Rabshakeh's reply is part of a psychological warfare tactic, aiming to demoralize the people of Jerusalem.<p><b>Has my master sent me to speak these words only to you and your master</b><br>The "master" refers to King Sennacherib, and "you and your master" refers to the officials of King Hezekiah. The Rabshakeh's question implies that his message is not just for the leaders but for all the people, emphasizing the public nature of his threat. This tactic is meant to undermine the confidence of the leaders and create fear among the populace.<p><b>and not to the men sitting on the wall</b><br>The men on the wall are the soldiers and citizens of Jerusalem who are directly involved in the city's defense. The wall represents the last line of defense against the Assyrian army. By addressing them, the Rabshakeh seeks to sow doubt and fear among those who are actively defending the city, potentially weakening their resolve.<p><b>who are destined with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine</b><br>This graphic imagery is a reference to the dire conditions of a siege, where food and water become scarce. The Rabshakeh is predicting that the siege will lead to such desperation that the people will resort to consuming waste to survive. This statement is designed to instill hopelessness and encourage surrender. The use of such vivid language highlights the severity of the situation and the Assyrian confidence in their ability to conquer Jerusalem.<br><br>In the broader biblical context, this passage illustrates the theme of trust in God versus reliance on human power. Despite the Rabshakeh's threats, King Hezekiah's response is to seek the Lord's guidance, demonstrating faith in divine deliverance. This event foreshadows the miraculous deliverance of Jerusalem, as recorded later in the chapter, where God intervenes to protect the city.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rabshakeh.htm">Rabshakeh</a></b><br>The Assyrian field commander who delivered a message from King Sennacherib of Assyria to King Hezekiah of Judah, attempting to demoralize the people of Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to reform the religious practices of his people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, under siege by the Assyrian army during this event.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyrian_siege.htm">Assyrian Siege</a></b><br>The military campaign led by King Sennacherib of Assyria against Judah, aiming to conquer Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_men_on_the_wall.htm">The Men on the Wall</a></b><br>The defenders and inhabitants of Jerusalem who were directly addressed by Rabshakeh's taunting message.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words.htm">The Power of Words</a></b><br>Rabshakeh's speech was designed to instill fear and doubt.

The verse exposes the limits of human power and the cruelty of godless threats, setting the stage for God&#8217;s dramatic rescue. Judah must decide whether to heed the taunts of men or trust the faithful LORD who alone controls their destiny.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">Hath my master . . .</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">Is it to thy lord and to thee that my lord hath sent me to speak these words?</span><p><span class= "bld">The men which sit on the wall</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the soldiers on guard.<p><span class= "bld">That they may eat</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--These coarse words are meant to express the <span class= "ital">consequence</span> of their resistance: it will bring them to such dire straits that they will be fain to appease the cravings of hunger and thirst with the vilest garbage.

Ambassadors are accredited by governments to governments, and the safe conduct granted to them is on the understanding that they will conduct themselves according to established usage. In no state of society can it have been allowable for envoys to intervene between the governors and the governed, and endeavor to stir up discontent among the latter. Yet this is what Rabshakeh did, and boasted of doing. Well might Isaiah say of such an arrogant and lawless aggressor, "He hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man" (see <a href="/isaiah/33-8.htm">Isaiah 33:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with you?</span> Rabshakeh means to say that the effect of the men "sitting on the wall," and continuing the defense of the town, will be to bring them to the last extremity of hunger and thirst, when they will be forced even to consume their own excrement (comp. <a href="/2_kings/6-25.htm">2 Kings 6:25-29</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/18-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But the Rab-shakeh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1511;&#1461;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;q&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7262.htm">Strong's 7262: </a> </span><span class="str2">Rabshakeh -- perhaps 'chief of the officers', an Assyrian military leader</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
