In the biblical context, God often uses spiritual means to accomplish His purposes, as seen in other instances like <a href="/1_samuel/16-14.htm">1 Samuel 16:14</a>, where an evil spirit from the Lord tormented Saul. This demonstrates God's sovereignty over human affairs and His ability to direct the course of history according to His will.<p><b>so that he will hear a rumor</b><br>The use of rumors as a tool for divine intervention is significant. In ancient times, rumors could cause panic or lead to strategic decisions. This reflects the psychological warfare that God employs against the Assyrian king, Sennacherib. The rumor serves as a catalyst for Sennacherib's actions, showing how God can use even seemingly insignificant events to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>and return to his own land</b><br>This phrase highlights the reversal of Sennacherib's campaign against Judah. Historically, Assyrian kings were known for their military conquests and expansion. The return to his own land signifies a retreat, which would have been seen as a failure or a sign of weakness. This fulfills God's promise to protect Jerusalem and demonstrates His power over the mightiest empires.<p><b>where I will cause him to fall by the sword</b><br>This prophecy foretells the demise of Sennacherib, which is later fulfilled in <a href="/2_kings/19-37.htm">2 Kings 19:37</a> when he is assassinated by his own sons. The phrase underscores the theme of divine justice and retribution. It also connects to the broader biblical narrative where God defends His people and brings judgment upon their enemies, as seen in the stories of Pharaoh in Exodus and Haman in Esther.

It draws the eye to something certain, not speculative.

When Scripture says, &#8220;Behold,&#8221; it invites confidence that whatever follows is as sure as God&#8217;s own character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will put a spirit in him</b><p>God claims the right to shape even the inner thoughts of earth&#8217;s mightiest rulers.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a> affirms, &#8220;The king&#8217;s heart is a waterway in the hand of the LORD; He directs it wherever He pleases.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_samuel/16-14.htm">1 Samuel 16:14</a> and <a href="/judges/9-23.htm">Judges 9:23</a> show other moments when the Lord sent a spirit that altered behavior.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a> echoes the principle in the New Testament.<p>Here the Lord will impress Sennacherib with a compelling impulse.

Historically, Sennacherib heard about movements by Tirhakah of Cush/Egypt (<a href="/2_kings/19-9.htm">2 Kings 19:9</a>), but the point is that God orchestrated exactly what reached the Assyrian king&#8217;s ears. The Lord&#8217;s sovereignty extends to what news headlines reach whom and when.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and return to his own land</b><p>God promises that Sennacherib will break off the siege and go home. That is precisely what happened: &#8220;So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew.

In fact, it may be doubted whether Hebrew thought was conscious of any distinction between them. The prophets believed that all acts and events--even the ruthless barbarities of Assyrian conquerors--were "Jehovah's work." The lowly wisdom of the peasant, as well as the art of good government, was a Divine inspiration (<a href="/isaiah/28-26.htm" title="For his God does instruct him to discretion, and does teach him.">Isaiah 28:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/28-29.htm" title="This also comes forth from the LORD of hosts, which is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.">Isaiah 28:29</a>; <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm" title="And the spirit of the LORD shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;">Isaiah 11:2</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I will send a blast upon him.</span> The meaning is doubtful. Most modern critics translate, with the LXX., "I will put a spirit within him," and understand "a spirit of cowardice," or "a despondent mood" (Thenius), or "an extraordinary impulse of Divine inspiration, which is to hurry him blindly on" (Drechsler). But the idea of our translators, that the blast (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d4;</span>) is external, and sent <span class="accented">upon</span> him, not put in him - that, in fact, the destruction of his army is referred to, seems defensible by such passages as <a href="/exodus/15-8.htm">Exodus 15:8</a> and <a href="/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>.
