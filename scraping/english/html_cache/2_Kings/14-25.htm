This period marked a time of political stability and territorial expansion for Israel. Jeroboam II's reign is often seen as a time of prosperity, although it was also marked by spiritual decline. The restoration of Israel's boundaries signifies a temporary reversal of the losses suffered by previous kings due to invasions and internal strife.<p><b>from Lebo-hamath to the Sea of the Arabah</b><br>Lebo-hamath refers to the northernmost point of Israel's territory, near modern-day Syria. The Sea of the Arabah is another name for the Dead Sea, marking the southern boundary. This description of the territory indicates a significant expansion, encompassing the full extent of the land promised to the tribes of Israel. This geographical restoration is reminiscent of the boundaries during the reigns of David and Solomon, suggesting a return to former glory.<p><b>according to the word that the LORD, the God of Israel, had spoken</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the fulfillment of divine prophecy. The expansion of Israel's borders was not merely a political achievement but was seen as the realization of God's promise. It underscores the belief that God is actively involved in the affairs of nations and that His word is sovereign and unchanging.<p><b>through His servant Jonah son of Amittai</b><br>Jonah, known primarily for his mission to Nineveh, is here identified as a prophet who also delivered messages concerning Israel's national affairs. This reference provides historical context for Jonah's ministry, showing that his prophetic work extended beyond the narrative found in the Book of Jonah. It highlights the role of prophets as messengers of God's will, not only for individual repentance but also for national destiny.<p><b>the prophet from Gath-hepher</b><br>Gath-hepher was a town in the territory of Zebulun, located in the northern kingdom of Israel. This detail roots Jonah in a specific historical and geographical context, affirming the authenticity of his prophetic ministry. It also connects Jonah to the northern kingdom, providing insight into his perspective and the audience of his prophecies. This connection to a specific location underscores the historical reality of the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeroboam_ii.htm">Jeroboam II</a></b><br>The king of Israel during whose reign the borders were restored.

Hamath itself was between eighty and ninety miles further to the north, on the middle Orontes, about N. lat. 35&deg; 22'. The "entering in of Hamath" was always reckoned the northern boundary of the Holy Land (see <a href="/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>; <a href="/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>).

The territory recovered no doubt included all the trans-Jordanic region as far south as the river Aruon; but the recovery of dominion over Moab, and even over Ammon, which some have seen in this passage (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 124), is scarcely con-rained in it. <span class="cmt_word">According to the word of the Lord God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai</span> (comp. <a href="/jonah/1-1.htm">Jonah 1:1</a>).
