Elisha succeeded Elijah and performed many miracles, demonstrating God's power and presence among His people. The question "Where did it fall?" indicates Elisha's concern and readiness to address the problem. This reflects the personal nature of God's care, as He is attentive to the needs of His people, even in seemingly small matters. The context here is a group of prophets expanding their living quarters, and the loss of the borrowed axe head would have been a significant problem due to the value of iron at the time.<p><b>And when he showed him the place,</b><br>The act of showing the exact location where the axe head fell into the water signifies the importance of acknowledging our problems and bringing them before God. This mirrors the biblical principle of confession and seeking divine intervention. The prophets' community was likely near the Jordan River, a significant geographical and spiritual site in Israel's history, symbolizing transition and divine acts, such as the crossing by Joshua and the baptism of Jesus.<p><b>the man of God cut a stick,</b><br>Elisha's action of cutting a stick may seem simple, but it is a symbolic gesture. In biblical narratives, wood often represents humanity and the cross. This act can be seen as a precursor to the miraculous, where God uses ordinary means to achieve extraordinary results. The use of a stick also connects to other biblical events where God used simple objects to perform miracles, such as Moses' staff.<p><b>threw it there,</b><br>The act of throwing the stick into the water is an act of faith and obedience. It demonstrates the principle that God often requires a step of faith before He acts. This mirrors other biblical instances where faith precedes the miracle, such as Naaman washing in the Jordan or the Israelites marching around Jericho.<p><b>and made the iron float.</b><br>The miracle of the iron axe head floating defies natural laws, showcasing God's sovereignty over creation. Iron, being heavy, naturally sinks, but here it rises, symbolizing resurrection and restoration. This event prefigures the power of Christ, who defies death and brings life. It also serves as a reminder of God's ability to recover what is lost, paralleling the parables of the lost sheep and coin in the New Testament. This miracle reinforces the theme of divine provision and care, emphasizing that nothing is too difficult for God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet in Israel, successor to Elijah, known for performing miracles and guiding the nation spiritually.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_the_prophets.htm">The Sons of the Prophets</a></b><br>A group of prophetic disciples or students who were under the mentorship of Elisha.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>A significant river in Israel where many biblical events occurred, including this miracle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_axe_head.htm">The Axe Head</a></b><br>An iron tool that fell into the river, symbolizing a lost resource that was miraculously recovered.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miracle.htm">The Miracle</a></b><br>Elisha's act of making the iron axe head float, demonstrating God's power and care for even small concerns.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_concern_for_our_needs.htm">God's Concern for Our Needs</a></b><br>God cares about the details of our lives, even those that seem insignificant, like a lost axe head.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_obedience.htm">Faith and Obedience</a></b><br>Elisha's faith in God's power led to a miraculous outcome.

The iron ax-head did not swim, but simply rose to the surface. It had fallen in near the bank. Elisha's throwing in the stick was a symbolical act, intended to help the witnesses to realise that the coming up of the iron was not a natural, but a supernatural, event, brought about through the instrumentality of the prophet. As in the case of the salt thrown into the spring at Jericho, the symbol was appropriate to the occasion. It indicated that iron could be made to float <span class= "ital">like wood</span> by the sovereign power of Jehovah. The properties of material substances depend on His will for their fixity, and may be suspended or modified at His pleasure. The moral of this little story is that God helps in small personal troubles as well as in great ones of larger scope. His providence cares for the individual as well as the race.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the man of God said, Where fell it?

But both explanations do violence to the text; and we may be sure that, had either been true, the occurrence would not have been recorded. The sacred writers are not concerned to put on record mere acts of manual dexterity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/6-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Where</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1443;&#1504;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_575.htm">Strong's 575: </a> </span><span class="str2">Where?, whither?, when?, hither and thither</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did it fall?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1508;&#1464;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5307.htm">Strong's 5307: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall, lie</span><br /><br /><span class="word">asked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
