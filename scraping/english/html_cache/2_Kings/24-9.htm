The "evil" refers to actions contrary to God's commandments, often involving idolatry and injustice. In the context of 2 Kings, this evil is typically associated with the worship of foreign gods and neglect of the covenant with Yahweh. The phrase "in the sight of the LORD" underscores God's omniscience and the accountability of leaders to divine standards. This evaluation is a recurring theme in the books of Kings, highlighting the spiritual decline of Judah and Israel.<p><b>just as his father had done</b><br>This phrase connects the actions of the current king, Jehoiachin, to those of his predecessor, Jehoiakim. It suggests a pattern of sin and disobedience passed down through generations, reflecting the influence of familial and cultural legacies. Jehoiakim's reign was marked by idolatry and rebellion against God, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/23-37.htm">2 Kings 23:37</a>. This continuity of evil behavior underscores the failure of the Davidic kings to lead the people in faithfulness to God, contributing to the eventual downfall of Judah. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the importance of righteous leadership and the consequences of failing to break cycles of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiachin.htm">Jehoiachin</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned for three months.

Hitzig refers the passage to Zedekiah; and so Thenius. Josephus calls Jehoiachin "naturally good and just;" probably misunderstanding the words of <a href="/jeremiah/22-24.htm" title="As I live, said the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet on my right hand, yet would I pluck you there;">Jeremiah 22:24</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-28.htm" title="Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?">Jeremiah 22:28</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he did that which was evil the sight of the Lord, according to all that his father had done</span> (see <a href="/2_kings/23-37.htm">2 Kings 23:37</a>; and comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/36-9.htm">2 Chronicles 36:9</a>).

The present passage probably does not mean more than that he made no attempt at a religious reformation, but allowed the idolatries and superstitions which had prevailed under Jehoahaz and Jehoiakim to continue. It is in his favor that he did not actively persecute Jeremiah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/24-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And he did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
