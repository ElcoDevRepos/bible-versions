The altars on the roof suggest a syncretistic practice, where elements of pagan worship were incorporated into the worship of Yahweh. The "upper chamber of Ahaz" refers to a part of the palace or temple complex associated with King Ahaz, who was known for his unfaithfulness to God (<a href="/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10-16</a>). The rooftop altars may have been used for astral worship, a practice condemned in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>. Josiah's actions fulfill the Deuteronomic law, which commands the destruction of idolatrous sites (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-3</a>).<p><b>and the altars that Manasseh had set up in the two courtyards of the house of the LORD</b><br>King Manasseh, Josiah's grandfather, was notorious for his idolatry and desecration of the temple (<a href="/2_kings/21-4.htm">2 Kings 21:4-5</a>). The "two courtyards" refer to the inner and outer courts of the temple, which were meant for the worship of Yahweh alone. Manasseh's altars represented a direct violation of the sanctity of the temple, as he introduced foreign gods and practices. Josiah's removal of these altars signifies a return to monotheistic worship and a cleansing of the temple, reminiscent of Hezekiah's reforms (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-3.htm">2 Chronicles 29:3-5</a>).<p><b>The king pulverized them there</b><br>Josiah's act of pulverizing the altars symbolizes total destruction and the impossibility of their restoration. This action is in line with the biblical mandate to utterly destroy objects of idolatry (<a href="/exodus/23-24.htm">Exodus 23:24</a>). Pulverizing the altars also serves as a public demonstration of Josiah's commitment to covenantal faithfulness and his rejection of his predecessors' apostasy.<p><b>and threw their dust into the Kidron Valley</b><br>The Kidron Valley, located east of Jerusalem, often served as a dumping ground for impurities and idolatrous remnants (<a href="/2_chronicles/29-16.htm">2 Chronicles 29:16</a>). By casting the dust of the altars into the Kidron Valley, Josiah not only physically removes the idolatrous elements from the temple precincts but also symbolically purifies the land. This act echoes the cleansing of the temple by Hezekiah and foreshadows the ultimate purification brought by Jesus Christ, who cleanses the temple in <a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13-17</a>. The Kidron Valley's association with judgment and cleansing is further seen in its mention in eschatological contexts (<a href="/joel/3-12.htm">Joel 3:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms to restore the worship of Yahweh and eliminate idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings_of_judah.htm">Kings of Judah</a></b><br>Previous rulers who had set up altars for idol worship, contributing to the spiritual decline of the nation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>A former king of Judah known for his idolatrous practices, including setting up altars on the roof.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>Another king of Judah notorious for his extensive idolatry, including altars in the temple courtyards.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/k/kidron_valley.htm">Kidron Valley</a></b><br>A location outside Jerusalem where Josiah disposed of the remnants of the destroyed altars, symbolizing the removal of sin and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_purity.htm">Commitment to Purity</a></b><br>Josiah's actions demonstrate a commitment to spiritual purity and obedience to God's commands.
