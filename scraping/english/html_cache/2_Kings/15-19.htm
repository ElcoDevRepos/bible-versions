His invasion marks a significant moment in Israel's history, as Assyria was a dominant power in the ancient Near East. This invasion reflects the geopolitical tensions of the time, with Assyria expanding its influence over the region. The land referred to is the northern kingdom of Israel, which was often caught between larger empires. This event is part of the broader narrative of Israel's decline due to its disobedience to God, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/28-49.htm">Deuteronomy 28:49-52</a>.<p><b>and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver</b><br>Menahem, the king of Israel, sought to appease Pul by offering a substantial tribute. A thousand talents of silver is an enormous sum, indicating the severity of the threat and the desperation of Menahem's situation. This act of tribute is consistent with the practices of vassal states in the ancient Near East, where weaker nations paid stronger ones for protection or to avoid destruction. The payment highlights Israel's weakened state and reliance on foreign powers rather than on God, contrasting with earlier periods of divine deliverance, such as in the time of King David.<p><b>in order to gain his support</b><br>Menahem's payment was intended to secure Assyrian support, likely to stabilize his reign and fend off internal and external threats. This political maneuvering reflects the complex alliances and power dynamics of the time. It also underscores the lack of faith in divine protection, as Israel's kings increasingly turned to human alliances. This reliance on foreign powers is criticized by prophets like Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/31.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>), who warned against trusting in alliances rather than in God.<p><b>and strengthen his own grip on the kingdom</b><br>Menahem's primary concern was consolidating his power, as his rule was marked by violence and instability (<a href="/2_kings/15-16.htm">2 Kings 15:16</a>). By securing Assyrian backing, he aimed to legitimize and stabilize his reign. This focus on political power over spiritual fidelity is a recurring theme in the history of Israel's kings, leading to the nation's eventual downfall. The narrative serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of prioritizing political expediency over faithfulness to God, a lesson echoed throughout the biblical text.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pul.htm">Pul</a></b><br>Also known as Tiglath-Pileser III, he was the king of Assyria who invaded Israel.

Test,</span> pp. 227-240 (2nd edit., 1883). Prof. Schrader gives the following as the result of his elaborate and most interesting discussion: (1) Menahem of Israel and Azariah of Judah were contemporaries, according to the Bible as well as the Inscriptions. (2) According to the Bible, both these rulers were contemporary with an Assyrian king Pul; according to the Inscriptions, with Tiglath Pileser. (3) Berosus calls Pul a Chaldean; Tiglath Pileser calls himself king of Chaldea. (4) Pul-Porus became in 731 B.C. king of Babylon; Tiglath Pileser in 731 B.C. received the homage of the Babylonian king Merodach-Baladan, as he also reduced other Babylonian princes in this year, amongst them Chinz?ros of Amukkan. (5) Poros appears in the canon of Ptolemy as king of Babylon; Tiglath Pileser names himself "king of Babylon." (6) Chinz?ros became king of Babylon in 731 B.C. according to the canon, and, in fact, along with (or, under) a king of the name of P?ros; the hypothesis that the vanquished king of Amukkan of the same name was entrusted by Tiglath Pileser with the vassal-kingship of Babylon is suggested at once by the coincidence of the chronological data. (7) In the year 727-726 B.C. a change of government took place in Assyria in consequence of the death of Tiglath Pileser, and in Babylonia in consequence of the death of Porus. (8) No king appears in the Assyrian lists by a name like Pul, which is anomalous as a royal designation; we can only identify Pul with some other name in the lists, and, on historical grounds, with Tiglath Pileser only. (9) Pul and P?ros are forms of the same name (comp. <span class= "ital">Babiru</span> for Babilu in Persian inscriptions). (10) From all this, the conclusion is inevitable that Pul and Porus Pul and Tiglath Pileser, are one and the same person.<p><span class= "bld">Came against the land.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">came upon the land</span> (<a href="/isaiah/10-28.htm" title="He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he has laid up his carriages:">Isaiah 10:28</a>; <a href="/judges/18-27.htm" title="And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came to Laish, to a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.">Judges 18:27</a>).

Ver. 19 will then read thus: "In his days Pul the King of Assyria came against the laud" - and no connective will be wanted. The greatest doubt has been entertained with regard to the identity of Pul, whose name does not appear in the Assyrian Eponym Canon, or in any other purely Assyrian document. But recently discovered Babylonian documents seem to prove that Pul (Pulu) was the Babylonian name for Tiglath-pileser, who reigned under that name in Babylon during his last two years, and appears in the Canon of Ptolemy as "Porus." Tiglath-pileser, the great founder of the later Assyrian empire, made himself king in <span class="date">B.C. 745</span>, and proceeded to consolidate the Assyrian power on every side, after a period of great weakness and disorganization. He made several expeditions against Babylonia, and several into Syria and Palestine. The expedition in which he came into contact with Menahem is thought to have been that of his eighth year, <span class="date">B.C. 738</span> (see G. Smith, 'Eponym Canon,' pp. 117-120; and, for the identity of Tiglath-pileser with Pul, see the 'Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology' for 1884, p. 198). <span class="cmt_word">And Menahem gave Pal a thousand talents of silver.</span> A vast sum certainly, equal to above a quarter of a million of our money, perhaps to some extent a punishment for the siege and sack of Tiphsah. But not a sum that it would have been impossible to pay. A King of Damascus, about fifty years previously, had bought off an Assyrian attack by the payment of two thousand three hundred talents of silver and twenty talents of gold (see 'Eponym Canon,' p. 115). <span class="cmt_word">That his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand</span>;
