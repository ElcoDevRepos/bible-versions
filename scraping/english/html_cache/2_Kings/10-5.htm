The palace administrator and overseer of the city were likely high-ranking officials responsible for the management of the king's affairs and the city's governance. The elders were respected leaders within the community, often involved in decision-making and maintaining order. The guardians could refer to those responsible for the security of the city or the royal family. This collective response indicates a unified decision from the city's leadership, reflecting the gravity of the situation as Jehu, anointed by a prophet to be king, was executing God's judgment on the house of Ahab (<a href="/2_kings/9-6.htm">2 Kings 9:6-10</a>). Their message to Jehu signifies a shift in allegiance, acknowledging his authority and the fulfillment of divine prophecy.<p><b>&#8220;We are your servants, and we will do whatever you say.</b><br>This declaration of servitude and obedience to Jehu underscores the leaders' recognition of his divinely appointed kingship. In the ancient Near Eastern context, such a statement was a formal submission to a new ruler, often necessary to ensure peace and avoid conflict. This aligns with the biblical theme of submission to God's chosen leaders, as seen in other instances where individuals or groups acknowledge God's anointed, such as David's acceptance by the tribes of Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/5.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-3</a>). The leaders' willingness to follow Jehu's commands reflects their understanding of the political and spiritual shift occurring in Israel.<p><b>We will not make anyone king.</b><br>This phrase indicates the leaders' decision not to support any of Ahab's remaining descendants or other potential claimants to the throne. It reflects their recognition of Jehu's legitimacy as king, as well as their desire to avoid further bloodshed or conflict. This decision aligns with the prophetic word given to Jehu, as God had decreed the end of Ahab's dynasty (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-22</a>). By refusing to make anyone else king, the leaders are aligning themselves with God's judgment and the new order established through Jehu.<p><b>Do whatever is good in your sight.&#8221;</b><br>The leaders' statement of trust in Jehu's judgment suggests their hope for stability and righteous governance under his rule. This phrase echoes the biblical principle of leaders doing what is right in the eyes of the Lord, a recurring theme in the books of Kings. Jehu's initial actions, though violent, were seen as fulfilling God's command to eradicate the idolatry and corruption associated with Ahab's house. The leaders' submission to Jehu's authority reflects their desire for a return to covenant faithfulness and the restoration of proper worship in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>The newly anointed king of Israel, tasked with eradicating the house of Ahab and purging Baal worship from Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/palace_administrator.htm">Palace Administrator</a></b><br>A high-ranking official responsible for managing the affairs of the royal household.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_governor.htm">City Governor</a></b><br>The official in charge of the city's administration and governance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders.htm">Elders</a></b><br>Respected leaders and decision-makers within the community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/guardians.htm">Guardians</a></b><br>Those responsible for the care and protection of the royal princes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/submission_to_authority.htm">Submission to Authority</a></b><br>The officials' response to Jehu highlights the importance of recognizing and submitting to God-ordained authority.

The verse illustrates God&#8217;s swift fulfillment of prophecy against Ahab&#8217;s house and underscores the principle that all earthly authority must ultimately bow to the Lord&#8217;s anointed purpose.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">He that was over the house.</span>--The prefect of the palace, or <span class= "ital">major-domo</span>.

But, taken aback by Jehu's directness and plainness of speech, it did not occur to them to be diplomatic; they felt driven into a corner, and compelled to make their choice at once. Either they must resist Jehu in arms or they must submit to him. If they submitted, they had best (they thought) do it with a good grace. Accordingly, his letter produced a reply, more favorable than he can possibly have expected - "They were his servants," or "his slaves," ready to do all his pleasure; they would not set up a king, or in any way dispute his succession; they submitted themselves wholly to his will. <span class="cmt_word">Do thou</span> [they said] that which is <span class="cmt_word">good in thine eyes</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "take what steps thou pleasest to confirm thyself in the kingdom." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/10-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the palace</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(hab&#183;ba&#183;yi&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
