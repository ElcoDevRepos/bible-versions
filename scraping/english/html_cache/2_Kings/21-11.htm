His reign is noted for its extreme idolatry and departure from the worship of Yahweh. The "abominations" refer to practices that were detestable in the sight of God, including idol worship, child sacrifice, and the use of witchcraft and divination. These actions were in direct violation of the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-12</a>) and represented a significant spiritual decline from his father's reforms.<p><b>acting more wickedly than the Amorites who preceded him</b><br>The Amorites were one of the Canaanite nations that inhabited the Promised Land before the Israelites. They were known for their idolatrous practices and moral corruption, which led to their judgment by God (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>). By comparing Manasseh's actions to those of the Amorites, the text emphasizes the severity of his sins. This comparison highlights the depth of Judah's apostasy under Manasseh, as they surpassed even the notorious wickedness of the Amorites.<p><b>and with his idols has caused Judah to sin</b><br>Manasseh's introduction of idol worship led the people of Judah into sin, violating the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>). The king's influence was significant, as he not only practiced idolatry himself but also encouraged it among his people, leading them away from the covenant relationship with God. This phrase underscores the responsibility of leaders to guide their people in righteousness and the consequences when they lead them astray. The idolatry of Judah under Manasseh set the stage for the eventual Babylonian exile, as prophesied by prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>King of Judah, known for his idolatry and leading the nation into sin.
