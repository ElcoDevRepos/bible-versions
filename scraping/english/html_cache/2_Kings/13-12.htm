His reign is documented in the biblical narrative, highlighting his political and military activities. The phrase suggests that there were additional deeds and events associated with Jehoash that were significant but not detailed in this particular passage. This reflects the common biblical practice of summarizing a king's reign while pointing to other sources for a fuller account.<p><b>along with all his accomplishments and his might</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Jehoash's achievements and strength as a ruler. His accomplishments likely included military victories, administrative reforms, and possibly construction projects. The mention of his might underscores his capability as a leader, which was crucial for maintaining stability and power in the Northern Kingdom of Israel during a time of frequent conflicts and threats from surrounding nations.<p><b>including his war against Amaziah king of Judah</b><br>The conflict between Jehoash and Amaziah, king of Judah, is a significant historical event. This war is detailed in <a href="/2_kings/14.htm">2 Kings 14</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/25.htm">2 Chronicles 25</a>, where Amaziah challenges Jehoash, leading to a battle at Beth Shemesh. Jehoash's victory over Amaziah resulted in the capture of Jerusalem and the plundering of the temple and royal palace. This conflict illustrates the ongoing strife between the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah, highlighting the political and military tensions of the era.<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</b><br>This rhetorical question points to an external source, the "Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel," which is not part of the biblical canon but was likely a historical record of the reigns of Israel's kings. This reference suggests that the biblical account is selective and that additional details about Jehoash's reign could be found in this now-lost document.

God&#8217;s Word is reminding us that Jehoash&#8217;s reign, though briefly summarized here, was part of His larger redemptive storyline. Jehoash (also called Joash) reigned over Israel during a spiritually turbulent era marked by idolatry, yet the Lord still governed history, just as He does today (cf. <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His accomplishments and might</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;&#8230;along with all his accomplishments and his might&#8230;.&#8221; Jehoash achieved military recovery for Israel after the oppression of Aram (<a href="/2_kings/13-17.htm">2 Kings 13:17-25</a>).

Though Jehoash&#8217;s personal faith was limited, God honored His covenant with Abraham and preserved Israel (<a href="/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>; <a href="/2_kings/13-23.htm">2 Kings 13:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His war against Amaziah</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;including his war against Amaziah king of Judah&#8230;.&#8221; This later conflict is detailed in <a href="/2_kings/14-8.htm">2 Kings 14:8-14</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/25-17.htm">2 Chronicles 25:17-24</a>. Amaziah provoked Jehoash with a challenge; Jehoash warned him, yet battle ensued. Israel prevailed, breaching Jerusalem&#8217;s wall and seizing treasure.
