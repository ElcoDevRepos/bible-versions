His reign is detailed in the biblical narrative, highlighting his military campaigns and political maneuvers. The phrase suggests that there were additional deeds and events in Jehoash's life not fully captured in the biblical text, indicating the existence of other historical records.<p><b>along with his accomplishments</b><br>Jehoash's accomplishments included military victories and efforts to restore the kingdom's stability. His reign saw the recovery of cities from Aramean control, which was significant for Israel's territorial integrity. These accomplishments reflect his strategic and leadership abilities, which were crucial for the survival of the northern kingdom during this era.<p><b>his might</b><br>The term "might" refers to Jehoash's strength and prowess as a leader and warrior. This might be seen in his successful campaigns and ability to maintain power in a period of frequent conflict. His military strength was a key factor in his ability to challenge Judah and defend Israel's interests.<p><b>and how he waged war against Amaziah king of Judah</b><br>Jehoash's conflict with Amaziah, king of Judah, is a notable event in his reign. This war is detailed in the biblical narrative, where Jehoash defeats Amaziah at Beth Shemesh, leading to the capture of Jerusalem and the plundering of the temple and royal palace. This conflict underscores the ongoing strife between the northern and southern kingdoms and highlights the political and military tensions of the time.<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</b><br>This phrase points to an external source, the "Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel," which is not part of the biblical canon but was likely a historical record of the kings' reigns.

It reminds us that Jehoash&#8217;s life, with all its victories and failures, unfolded under God&#8217;s sovereign gaze. His military accomplishments could not erase his spiritual compromise, and the chronicling of his deeds serves chiefly to show the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness to Israel despite unfaithful leaders.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15, 16) <span class= "bld">Now the rest . . .</span>--Comp. <a href="/context/2_kings/13-12.htm" title="And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?">2Kings 13:12-13</a>, where the reign of Jehoash is already summed up, though not altogether in the same phraseology.

Curiously, on both occasions they are out of place. It is scarcely worth while to consider how they came into the text at this point, since no explanation could be more than a conjecture.
