This reflects the hierarchical structure common in ancient Israel, where prophets had attendants. Gehazi's role is significant, as he acts as a mediator between Elisha and others, similar to how priests and prophets often mediated between God and the people. This phrase also highlights Elisha's authority and the respect he commanded.<p><b>&#8220;Call the Shunammite woman.&#8221;</b><br>The Shunammite woman is a notable figure in <a href="/2_kings/4.htm">2 Kings 4</a>, known for her hospitality and faith. Shunem was a town in the territory of Issachar, located in the Jezreel Valley, a fertile region. Her story is a testament to the importance of faith and hospitality in the Hebrew tradition. The call to the Shunammite woman signifies a moment of divine intervention and fulfillment of God's promise through Elisha.<p><b>So he called her and she came.</b><br>This immediate response indicates the woman's respect and trust in Elisha. Her obedience is a reflection of her faith, which is a recurring theme in the Bible. The narrative demonstrates the importance of responding to God's call, as seen in other biblical figures like Abraham and Moses, who also responded promptly to divine instructions.<p><b>Then Elisha said, &#8220;Pick up your son.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase marks the culmination of a miraculous event. Earlier in the chapter, the Shunammite woman's son had died, and Elisha, through God's power, raised him back to life. This act prefigures the resurrection power of Jesus Christ, who also raised the dead, such as Lazarus. The command to "pick up your son" signifies restoration and the fulfillment of God's promises, echoing themes of resurrection and new life found throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons /

life (<a href="/2_kings/4-34.htm">2 Kings 4:34-35</a>), gives his first order to Gehazi, his servant and faithful aide (cf. <a href="/2_kings/4-12.htm">2 Kings 4:12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/8-4.htm">2 Kings 8:4</a>).<p>- The act of summoning shows the clear chain of command in prophetic ministry&#8212;God speaks to Elisha, Elisha directs Gehazi. Similar prophetic delegation appears with Elijah and Elisha in <a href="/1_kings/19-19.htm">1 Kings 19:19-21</a>.<p>- By involving Gehazi again&#8212;after the servant&#8217;s earlier failure to revive the child with Elisha&#8217;s staff (<a href="/2_kings/4-31.htm">2 Kings 4:31</a>)&#8212;the prophet underscores that ultimate power rests with God, not method or messenger (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"Call the Shunammite woman."</b><p>- Elisha&#8217;s concern shifts immediately to the mother who had trusted God enough to seek him out (<a href="/2_kings/4-22.htm">2 Kings 4:22-23</a>).<p>- Repeating the command to &#8220;call&#8221; mirrors an earlier moment when he summoned her to promise the birth of this very son (<a href="/2_kings/4-15.htm">2 Kings 4:15-16</a>). God, who initiated life then, now restores it.<p>- The title &#8220;Shunammite woman&#8221; keeps her identity rooted in her faith story rather than social status, much as the &#8220;widow of Zarephath&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/17-9.htm">1 Kings 17:9</a>) or the &#8220;woman at the well&#8221; (<a href="/john/4-7.htm">John 4:7</a>) are remembered primarily for their encounters with the living God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So he called her and she came</b><p>- Gehazi&#8217;s prompt obedience highlights his restored usefulness; the woman&#8217;s immediate response shows humble trust. Compare the swift obedience of Abraham rising early to obey God (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>) and Mary&#8217;s &#8220;May it be to me according to your word&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-38.htm">Luke 1:38</a>).<p>- Coming without delay suggests she expects God&#8217;s goodness even before she sees the outcome (cf. <a href="/psalms/27-13.htm">Psalm 27:13-14</a>). Earlier she had declared, &#8220;All is well&#8221; while her son lay lifeless (<a href="/2_kings/4-26.htm">2 Kings 4:26</a>), expressing unwavering faith.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then Elisha said, "Pick up your son."</b><p>- The simple directive packs the full weight of the miracle. As in Elijah&#8217;s words to the widow of Zarephath&#8212;&#8220;See, your son is alive!&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/17-23.htm">1 Kings 17:23</a>)&#8212;the prophet steps back so the mother can experience God&#8217;s power firsthand.<p>- &#8220;Pick up&#8221; invites physical contact, sealing the reality of resurrection. Compare Jesus&#8217; raising of the widow of Nain&#8217;s son: &#8220;And He gave him back to his mother&#8221; (<a href="/luke/7-15.htm">Luke 7:15</a>).<p>- The scene fulfills <a href="/hebrews/11-35.htm">Hebrews 11:35</a>, &#8220;Women received back their dead, raised to life again,&#8221; affirming God&#8217;s authority over death and His tender regard for families who trust Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The verse captures the closing chords of a resurrection symphony: God&#8217;s prophet commands, the servant obeys, the mother responds, and the child lives.
