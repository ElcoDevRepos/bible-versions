The time referred to is during the reign of King Ahaz of Judah, a period marked by political instability and threats from surrounding nations. This era is characterized by the Syro-Ephraimite War, where the northern kingdom of Israel (Ephraim) and Aram (Syria) formed an alliance against Judah.<p><b>Rezin king of Aram</b><br>Rezin was the last king of Aram-Damascus, a significant power in the region. His reign is noted for his alliance with Pekah, king of Israel, against Judah. This alliance is mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7</a>, where the prophet Isaiah advises King Ahaz not to fear Rezin and Pekah. Rezin's actions are part of the larger geopolitical struggles of the time, as Aram sought to expand its influence.<p><b>recovered Elath for Aram</b><br>Elath, also known as Eloth, was a strategic port city on the Red Sea, important for trade and military purposes. It had previously been under the control of Judah, as mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>, when Solomon built a fleet there. Rezin's recovery of Elath signifies a shift in power and control over this vital region, impacting Judah's economic and military capabilities.<p><b>drove out the men of Judah</b><br>This indicates a military action where Rezin expelled the Judean forces or settlers from Elath. The loss of Elath would have been a significant blow to Judah, both economically and strategically. It reflects the weakening position of Judah during Ahaz's reign, as they faced pressure from multiple fronts.<p><b>and sent the Edomites into Elath</b><br>The Edomites, descendants of Esau, were traditional enemies of Israel and Judah. By sending the Edomites into Elath, Rezin not only secured the city for Aram but also ensured that Judah would face continued hostility from the Edomites. This move would have further isolated Judah and complicated their political situation.<p><b>where they live to this day</b><br>This phrase suggests that the Edomites maintained control over Elath for an extended period. It underscores the lasting impact of Rezin's actions and the enduring consequences for Judah. The phrase "to this day" is a common biblical expression indicating the situation at the time of the text's writing, emphasizing the historical reality of the events described.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/rezin.htm">Rezin</a></b><br>King of Aram (Syria) who was an adversary of Judah.

Judah&#8217;s King Ahaz is under pressure, and the Lord is allowing neighboring powers to chip away at Judah&#8217;s borders, fulfilling earlier warnings about covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Rezin king of Aram recovered Elath for Aram</b><p>&#8226; Elath (also spelled Eloth) sat at the northern tip of the Red Sea&#8217;s Gulf of Aqaba&#8212;Judah&#8217;s only seaport, first secured by Amaziah and fortified by Uzziah (<a href="/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-2.htm">2 Chronicles 26:2</a>).<p>&#8226; By &#8220;recovered,&#8221; the text shows that the port had once belonged to Aram or under its influence before Judah&#8217;s expansion. Now Rezin retakes it, cutting Judah off from maritime trade and tribute.<p>&#8226; This military success against Judah fits the pattern of God using foreign kings as instruments of discipline (<a href="/2_kings/24-2.htm">2 Kings 24:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Drove out the men of Judah</b><p>&#8226; The phrase stresses total displacement; Judahite settlers, soldiers, and merchants are expelled.<p>&#8226; Cross references underline the loss: in <a href="/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17-18</a> Edomites and Philistines simultaneously raid Judahite towns, showing Judah&#8217;s borders collapsing on multiple fronts.<p>&#8226; The literal expulsion fulfills the warning that enemies would &#8220;occupy your land and settle in it&#8221; when Judah rebelled (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-43.htm">Deuteronomy 28:43-44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Sent the Edomites into Elath</b><p>&#8226; Instead of keeping the port for himself, Rezin installs Edomites&#8212;long-standing rivals of Judah (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>; <a href="/bsb/obadiah/1.htm">Obadiah 10</a>).<p>&#8226; Edom had already thrown off Judahite control in the days of Jehoram (<a href="/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20-22</a>); placing them in Elath cements their resurgence and blocks Judah&#8217;s access to the sea.<p>&#8226; The move creates an anti-Judah alliance of Aram, Israel, and Edom (compare <a href="/psalms/83-5.htm">Psalm 83:5-8</a>), intensifying Ahaz&#8217;s desperation that will soon drive him to appeal to Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Where they live to this day</b><p>&#8226; This editorial note assures readers that the displacement had lasting effects; even at the time of the chronicler the Edomites still occupied Elath.

The verse demonstrates God&#8217;s faithfulness to His covenant warnings: when Judah abandoned Him, He allowed hostile nations to erode her borders and prosperity. The enduring Edomite presence at Elath stands as a tangible reminder that obedience brings blessing, while rebellion yields lasting loss.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">At that time.</span>--Bahr regards this verse as a parenthesis, so that <a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm" title="So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I am your servant and your son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me.">2Kings 16:7</a> is the strict continuation of <a href="/2_kings/16-5.htm" title="Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.">2Kings 16:5</a>, and "At that time" simply assigns this war as the epoch when Judah lost its only harbour and chief emporium--a grave blow to the national prosperity. It is perhaps impossible to weave the various data of Isaiah, Kings, and Chronicles into a single narrative which shall be free from all objection. But it seems probable that, after the successes recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/28-5.htm" title="Why the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus.

The allies soon despaired of a siege, and Pekah fell to ravaging the country, while Rezin pushed on to Elath, determined not to return home without having achieved some permanent success. The approach of Tiglath Pileser compelled the two kings to give up their enterprise, and hasten to defend their own frontiers.<p><span class= "bld">Recovered Elath to Syria . . . the Syrians.</span>--The words for <span class= "ital">Syria</span> and <span class= "ital">Edom, Syrians</span> and <span class= "ital">Edomties,</span> are very much alike in Hebrew writing, and the Hebrew margin, many MSS., the LXX. and Vulg. read <span class= "ital">Edomites</span> for <span class= "ital">Syrians</span> here.

Bahr, however, prefers the readings of the ordinary text, and supposes that Rezin simply expelled the Jews from Elath, and established there a commercial colony of Syrians.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At that time Rezin, King of Syria recovered Elath to Syria.</span> The Syrians had certainly never previously been masters of Elath, which had always hitherto been either Jewish or Edomite (see <a href="/1_kings/9-26.htm">1 Kings 9:26</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-48.htm">1 Kings 22:48</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>). Hence it seems to be necessary that we should either translate the Hebrew verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d1;</span> by "gained," "conquered," instead of "recovered;" or else change <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span>, "Syria," into <span class="hebrew">&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5d3;&#x5b9;&#x5dd;</span> "Edom." The Syrians could "recover" Elath for Edom; they could only "gain" it for themselves. <span class="cmt_word">And drave the Jews from Elath</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> expelled the Jewish garrison which had been maintained in Elath from the time of its conquest by Uzziah (<a href="/2_kings/14-22.htm">2 Kings 14:22</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">and the Syrians came to Elath</span>; rather, <span class="accented">the Edomites -</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5d8;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b2;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>. Rezin could not have thought of holding a place so remote from Damascus as Elath; and, had he done so, the danger of his kingdom in the next year would have necessitated the relinquishment of so distant a possession. <span class="cmt_word">And dwelt there unto this day.</span> It is quite certain that Elath belonged to Edom, and not to Syria, at the time when the Books of Kings were written. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/16-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
