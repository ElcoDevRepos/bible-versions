It suggests a return to the original intent and fervor of the Passover as instituted in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>. Josiah's reforms were comprehensive, aiming to restore true worship and adherence to the Law of Moses. This Passover was unique in its adherence to the scriptural mandates, possibly indicating a level of national repentance and renewal not seen in previous generations.<p><b>from the days of the judges who had governed Israel</b><br>The period of the judges was marked by cycles of apostasy, oppression, and deliverance. During this time, Israel often strayed from the covenant, and the observance of religious festivals like Passover was likely inconsistent. The mention of the judges underscores the long-standing neglect of proper worship practices, highlighting the significance of Josiah's reforms in restoring what had been lost for centuries.<p><b>through all the days of the kings of Israel and Judah</b><br>This phrase encompasses the entire monarchical period, from Saul through the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah. The kings often led the people into idolatry, with few exceptions like Hezekiah and Josiah who sought to bring the nation back to God. The reference to both Israel and Judah indicates that even during the reigns of the more righteous kings, such a Passover had not been observed, emphasizing the depth of Josiah's commitment to the covenant and the Law.<br><br>The historical context here is crucial, as it reflects a time when the Northern Kingdom of Israel had already fallen to Assyria, and Judah was under threat from Babylon.

Scripture insists on the literal fact that nothing of this scale or purity had happened before, underscoring how seriously God takes wholehearted obedience (<a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-1.htm">Deuteronomy 16:1&#8211;8</a>). The writer is signaling: &#8220;Pay attention&#8212;this is historic.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Josiah followed the exact written commands &#8220;as it is written in this Book of the Covenant&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/23-3.htm">2 Kings 23:3, 21</a>), contrasting sharply with earlier half-hearted attempts such as Hezekiah&#8217;s good yet imperfect Passover (<a href="/2_chronicles/30-17.htm">2 Chronicles 30:17&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; The meticulous detail in <a href="/2_chronicles/35-1.htm">2 Chronicles 35:1-19</a> echoes <a href="/bsb/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>, pointing out that Josiah kept every stipulation, including the right day, the right place, and the full participation of priests, Levites, and people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the days of the judges</b><p>The benchmark for comparison reaches back more than three centuries to the era after Joshua but before the monarchy (<a href="/judges/2-16.htm">Judges 2:16-19</a>). In that turbulent period, &#8220;everyone did what was right in his own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>), so formal national worship often lapsed. By saying the last comparable Passover was in the judges&#8217; era, the text implies that even early leaders like Gideon or Samuel never mustered a nationwide, law-conforming celebration on this level.<p>&#8226; The Passover at Gilgal under Joshua (<a href="/joshua/5-10.htm">Joshua 5:10-12</a>) stands as the last clearly recorded national observance before the monarchy, yet even that lacked the temple-centered worship now required in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-2.htm">Deuteronomy 16:2</a>.<p>&#8226; The statement exposes a long history of neglect; Israel&#8217;s collective memory of redemption had dimmed, making Josiah&#8217;s revival all the more remarkable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who had governed Israel</b><p>The phrase reminds us that judges were divinely appointed deliverers (<a href="/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18</a>). They &#8220;governed,&#8221; but ultimately God ruled&#8212;an arrangement designed to keep the nation theocratic. By highlighting these leaders, the verse stresses that no human ruler, however courageous, had succeeded in restoring full covenant obedience until Josiah.<p>&#8226; Even Samuel, the last judge and a prophet, rebuked Israel for not keeping the Law (<a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The comparison shows that true reform requires both heart and structure: Josiah had the temple cleansed (<a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4-7</a>) and the people covenantally bound (23:3), achieving what previous judges could not sustain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>through all the days of the kings of Israel and Judah</b><p>From Saul to Zedekiah, no monarch matched this Passover&#8217;s faithfulness (<a href="/bsb/1_samuel/13.htm">1 Samuel 13-</a><a href="/bsb/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>). Many kings&#8212;Jeroboam&#8217;s golden calves (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-33</a>), Ahab&#8217;s Baal worship (<a href="/1_kings/16-30.htm">1 Kings 16:30-33</a>), even reformers like Asa and Jehoshaphat&#8212;fell short of restoring worship to full biblical standards. Josiah stands alone:<p>&#8226; He destroyed every trace of idolatry, even defiling Topheth and Bethel&#8217;s altar (<a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10, 15</a>).<p>&#8226; He unified both northern remnants and Judah in one celebration, hinting at Isaiah&#8217;s promise of a reunited people (<a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Second Chronicles adds that &#8220;all Judah and Israel who were present&#8221; kept the feast (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-17.htm">2 Chronicles 35:17-18</a>), showing broad national participation unmatched since Solomon&#8217;s day (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-8.htm">2 Chronicles 7:8-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/23-22.htm">2 Kings 23:22</a> spotlights Josiah&#8217;s Passover as a watershed moment. Literally, no previous generation&#8212;from the decentralized days of the judges through the entire monarchy&#8212;had experienced a Passover that so fully embraced God&#8217;s written commands. The verse magnifies both the depth of Israel&#8217;s long neglect and the height of Josiah&#8217;s obedience, encouraging believers today to treasure and practice God&#8217;s Word with the same wholehearted devotion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Surely there was not holden . . .</span>--<span class= "ital">For there was not holden</span> (<span class= "ital">a passover</span>) <span class= "ital">like this passover.</span> This and the next verse constitute a parenthetic remark, in which the historian emphasises the phrase, "As it is written in this book of the covenant." No passover, from the time of the Judges onward had been celebrated in such strict conformity to the prescriptions of the Law. The LXX. omits the particle of comparison: <span class= "greekheb">??? ??? ??????? ?? ????? ?????</span>. On the ground of this difference, and the one mentioned in the Note on <a href="/2_kings/23-21.htm" title="And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover to the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant.">2Kings 23:21</a>, Thenius thinks it not improbable that the text of Kings has been altered to bring into harmony with the account in Chronicles about the restoration of the feast of the passover by <span class= "ital">Hezekiah</span>--a weighty inference from such slight data. The chronicler repeats this very verse at the close of his narrative of Josiah's passover (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-18.htm" title="And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests, and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 35:18</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely there was not holden such a Passover from the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah. </span> <span class="accented">Such</span> a Passover, one so numerously attended (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-18.htm">2 Chronicles 35:18</a>). and so exactly kept according to every ordinance of the Law of Moses (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-6.htm">2 Chronicles 35:6</a>), had not been celebrated during all the period of the judges, from Joshua to Samuel, nor under the kings of all Israel, Saul, David, and Solomon, nor under those of the separated kingdom of Judah, from Rehoboam to this year (the eighteenth) of Josiah. It is an extraordinary perversity which concludes (as do De Wette and Thenius), from this comparison of the present with former Passovers under the judges and the kings, that there had been no such former Passovers at all! Two, at any rate, are recorded (<a href="/joshua/5-10.htm">Joshua 5:10, 11</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/30-13.htm">2 Chronicles 30:13-26</a>). Ewald has the good sense to express his dissent from this view, and to declare the meaning of the writer to be simply that "since the time of the judges there had never been such a celebration of the Passover, in such strict accordance, that is, with the prescriptions of a sacred book as that which now took place" (see his 'History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 239, Eng. trans.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/23-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">No</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">such</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1462;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
