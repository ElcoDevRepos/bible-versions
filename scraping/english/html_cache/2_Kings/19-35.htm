The context is the siege of Jerusalem by the Assyrian army under King Sennacherib. The timing underscores God's swift response to King Hezekiah's prayer and the prophet Isaiah's prophecy (<a href="/2_kings/19-20.htm">2 Kings 19:20-34</a>). It highlights the immediacy of God's power and His ability to act decisively in the affairs of nations.<p><b>the angel of the LORD went out</b><br>The "angel of the LORD" is often seen as a divine messenger or agent of God's will, sometimes interpreted as a theophany or a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ. This phrase emphasizes the supernatural nature of the event, as it was not by human hands that the Assyrian army was defeated. The angel of the LORD appears in other significant biblical events, such as in <a href="/exodus/12-23.htm">Exodus 12:23</a> during the Passover, indicating divine judgment and deliverance.<p><b>and struck down 185,000 men</b><br>The number 185,000 signifies a massive and miraculous defeat of the Assyrian forces. This event demonstrates God's sovereignty over the nations and His ability to protect His people against overwhelming odds. Historically, the Assyrian army was known for its might and brutality, making this divine intervention even more significant. The destruction of such a large force without human intervention serves as a testament to God's power.<p><b>in the camp of the Assyrians</b><br>The Assyrian camp was likely located near Jerusalem, as they were besieging the city. This phrase indicates that the destruction was localized and specific to the enemy forces, sparing the city and its inhabitants. The Assyrians were a dominant empire during this period, and their defeat would have had significant geopolitical implications, demonstrating God's control over the rise and fall of empires.<p><b>When the people got up the next morning</b><br>This phrase suggests that the event occurred overnight, and the people of Jerusalem were unaware of the divine intervention until morning. It highlights the element of surprise and the totality of God's deliverance, as the threat was removed without the need for battle. The morning discovery aligns with biblical themes of light overcoming darkness and the dawning of God's salvation.<p><b>there were all the dead bodies!</b><br>The sight of the dead bodies would have been a powerful and sobering confirmation of God's intervention. It serves as a visual testament to God's judgment against the Assyrians and His protection of Jerusalem. This outcome fulfills the prophecy given by Isaiah and reinforces the theme of divine justice. The phrase also echoes other biblical instances where God delivers His people by defeating their enemies, such as the drowning of the Egyptian army in the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-28.htm">Exodus 14:28-30</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger sent by God, often seen as a powerful agent of His will.

SENNACHERIB'S RETREAT, AND HIS "VIOLENT END.</span><p>(35) <span class= "bld">And it came to pass </span>(in)<span class= "bld"> that night.</span>--This definition of time is wanting in the parallel text; but it is implied by the phrase in the morning (<a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm" title="Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.">Isaiah 37:36</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm" title="And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.">2Kings 19:35</a>). The night intended can hardly be the one which followed the day when the prophecy was spoken (see <a href="/2_kings/19-29.htm" title="And this shall be a sign to you, You shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that which springs of the same; and in the third year sow you, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.">2Kings 19:29</a>). The expression "in that night," may perhaps be compared with the prophetic "in that day," and understood to. mean simply "in that memorable night which was the occasion of this catastrophe." (Theuius sees in this clause an indication that the present section was derived from another source, probably from the one used by the chronicler in <a href="/context/2_chronicles/32-20.htm" title="And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.">2Chronicles 32:20-23</a>. Reuss thinks this confirmed by the fact that neither the prediction in <a href="/2_kings/19-7.htm" title="Behold, I will send a blast on him, and he shall hear a rumor, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.">2Kings 19:7</a>, nor that of <a href="/context/2_kings/19-21.htm" title="This is the word that the LORD has spoken concerning him; The virgin the daughter of Zion has despised you, and laughed you to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.">2Kings 19:21-34</a>, speaks of so great and so immediate an overthrow.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 35-37.</span> - DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB'S HOST, AND HIS OWN VIOLENT DEATH AT NINEVEH. The sequel is told in a few words. That night destruction came down on the host of Sennacherib, as it lay en-camped at some distance from Jerusalem, silently and swiftly. Without noise, without disturbance, the sleeping men slept the sleep of death, and in the morning, when the survivors awoke, it was found that a hundred and eighty-five thousand were slain. Upon this, with the remnant of his army, Sennacherib hastily returned to Nineveh. There, some time after - about seventeen years according to our reckoning - a conspiracy was formed against him by two of his sons, who murdered him as he was worshipping in a temple, and fled into Armenia. Another son, Esarhaddon, succeeded. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass that night.</span> The important expression, "that night," is omitted from the narrative of <a href="/isaiah/37-36.htm">Isaiah 37:36</a>, but is undoubtedly an original portion of the present history. It can have no other meaning - as Keil and Bahr have seen - than "the night following the day on which Isaiah had foretold to Hezekiah the deliverance of Jerusalem." God's word "runneth very swiftly." No sooner was the premise given than the destroying angel received his orders, and "that night" the terrible stroke fell. <span class="cmt_word">That the angel of the Lord went out</span>; or, <span class="accented">an angel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, LXX.). We cannot say, with Bahr, that it was "the same one who smote the firstborn in Egypt, and inflicted the pestilence after the census under David." Revelation does not tell us that there is definitely one destroying angel. "The angel of death" is a rabbinical invention. It accords rather with the analogy of God's dealings that he should use at one time the services of one minister, at another time those of another. <span class="cmt_word">And smote.</span> Imagination has been over-busy in conjecturing the exact manner of the smiting. Some critics have suggested pestilence, or more definitely "the plague" (Gesenius, Dathe, Maurer, Ewald, Winer, Thenins, Keil, etc.); others a terrible storm (Vitringa, Stanley); others the simoom (Prideaux, Milman); others a nocturnal attack by Tirhakah (Ussher, Preiss, Michaelis). Some of these the text altogether precludes, as the attack of Tirhakah, which must have aroused the whole host, and not left the disaster to be discovered by those who "awoke early in the morning." Others are improbable, as the simoom, or a terrible storm with thunder and lightning, which have never been known to accomplish such a destruction. Pestilence is no doubt possible, but a pestilence of a strange and miraculous character, to which men succumbed without awaking or disturbing others. But the narrative rather points to sudden and silent death during sleep, such as often happens to men in the course of nature singly, and here on this occasion was made to happen in one night to a hundred and eighty-five thousand men by the Divine omnipotence acting abnormally. <span class="cmt_word">In the camp of the Assyrians.</span> The destruction was not only at one time, but in one place. "The camp of the Assyrians" cannot mean half a dozen camps situated in half a dozen different places, as Keil supposes. Sennacherib was somewhere with his main army, encamped for the night, and there, wherever it was, the blow fell. But the exact locality is uncertain. All that the narrative makes clear is that it was not in the immediate vicinity of Jerusalem. Herodotus places the catastrophe at Pelusium (2. 141). Bahr thinks it was probably before Libnah. I should incline to place it between Libnah and the Egyptian frontier, Sennacherib, when he heard that Tirhakah was coming against him (ver. 9), having naturally marched forward to meet and engage his army. <span class="cmt_word">A hundred four score and five thousand.</span> These figures do not pretend to exactness, and can scarcely have been more than a rough estimate. They are probably the Assyrians' own estimate of their loss, which the Jews would learn from such of the fugitives as fell into their hands. <span class="cmt_word">And when they</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the survivors - <span class="cmt_word">arose early in the morning, they</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the hundred and eighty-five thousand - <span class="cmt_word">were all dead corpses</span> - absolutely dead, that is; not merely sick or dying. The fact makes against the theory of a pestilence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/19-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
