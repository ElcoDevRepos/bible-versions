Jehu was known for his zealous eradication of Baal worship, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/10.htm">2 Kings 10</a>. His reign marked a significant shift in Israel's religious landscape, aligning more closely with the worship of Yahweh, though not entirely eliminating idolatry. The seventh year of Jehu's reign would be around 835 BC, providing a chronological anchor for Joash's ascension.<p><b>Joash became king</b><br>Joash, also known as Jehoash, was the son of Ahaziah and the only surviving heir of the Davidic line after Athaliah's massacre of the royal family. His survival and eventual kingship were orchestrated by Jehoiada the priest, who hid him in the temple for six years (<a href="/2_kings/11-2.htm">2 Kings 11:2-3</a>). Joash's rise to the throne represents the preservation of the Davidic covenant, which promised an everlasting dynasty (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>).<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years</b><br>Joash's reign in Jerusalem, the political and spiritual center of Judah, lasted four decades, from approximately 835 to 796 BC. This long reign allowed for significant religious reforms, particularly the restoration of the temple, which had fallen into disrepair. The number forty often symbolizes a period of testing or trial in the Bible, as seen in the forty years of Israel's wilderness wanderings (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>).<p><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Zibiah</b><br>Zibiah, Joash's mother, is mentioned here, highlighting the importance of maternal lineage in the biblical narrative. While little is known about her, her inclusion underscores the role of women in the preservation of the Davidic line. The mention of mothers in the accounts of kings often provides insight into the king's upbringing and potential influences.<p><b>she was from Beersheba</b><br>Beersheba, located in the southern part of Judah, was a significant city in biblical history, often associated with the patriarchs Abraham and Isaac (<a href="/genesis/21-31.htm">Genesis 21:31-33, 26</a>:23-33). It served as a cultural and religious landmark, representing the southern boundary of Israel ("from Dan to Beersheba"). Zibiah's origin from Beersheba may indicate a connection to the broader heritage of the patriarchs, emphasizing the continuity of God's promises through the generations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Joash became king of Judah and reigned for forty years.

God&#8217;s Word ties Judah&#8217;s timeline to the activity in Israel, confirming that He oversees both kingdoms&#8217; histories.<p>&#8226; Jehu, the northern king who purged Ahab&#8217;s line (<a href="/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30-36</a>), had ruled seven years by the time Joash took Judah&#8217;s throne. This synchronism underlines Scripture&#8217;s reliability (cf. <a href="/2_kings/11-21.htm">2 Kings 11:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail reminds us that even when leadership in Israel was turbulent, the Lord still preserved a Davidic successor in Judah (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Joash became king</b><p>&#8226; Joash&#8217;s ascent fulfills the covenant promise that David would always have a lamp in Jerusalem (<a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>).<p>&#8226; His survival was nothing short of miraculous: Athaliah tried to wipe out the royal line, yet the Lord hid Joash in the temple for six years (<a href="/2_kings/11-1.htm">2 Kings 11:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment testifies to God&#8217;s faithfulness&#8212;He guards His purposes even when they seem one sword-stroke from extinction (<a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He reigned in Jerusalem forty years</b><p>&#8226; Forty years signals a full, significant span (cf.
