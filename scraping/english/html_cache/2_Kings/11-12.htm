This act occurs during a time of political turmoil when Athaliah, the queen mother, had usurped the throne. Joash had been hidden in the temple for six years, symbolizing God's providential care over the Davidic covenant. This event underscores the importance of divine intervention in maintaining the lineage that would eventually lead to Jesus Christ, the ultimate King.<p><b>put the crown on him</b><br>The crowning of Joash signifies the restoration of the rightful monarchy in Judah. The crown is a symbol of authority and legitimacy, marking Joash as the legitimate heir to David's throne. This act fulfills the promise that the line of David would continue, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>, where God promises David that his house and kingdom will endure forever.<p><b>presented him with the Testimony</b><br>The Testimony likely refers to a copy of the Law, which the king was required to have and read according to <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>. This emphasizes the king's duty to rule in accordance with God's law, highlighting the theocratic nature of Israel's monarchy. It serves as a reminder that the king is subject to God's authority and must lead the people in righteousness.<p><b>and proclaimed him king</b><br>The public proclamation of Joash as king is a formal declaration of his rightful position. This act is significant in re-establishing the Davidic line and restoring order to the kingdom. It also reflects the biblical principle that leadership is established by God, as seen in <a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>, which states that all authority is instituted by God.<p><b>They anointed him</b><br>Anointing with oil is a significant ritual in the Old Testament, symbolizing the consecration and empowerment of a person for a specific role or task. In the case of Joash, it signifies his divine appointment as king. This act foreshadows the anointing of Jesus Christ, the Messiah, whose title means "Anointed One."<p><b>and the people clapped their hands and declared, &#8220;Long live the king!&#8221;</b><br>The people's response indicates their acceptance and support of Joash as their king. Clapping hands is an expression of joy and approval, while the acclamation "Long live the king!" is a traditional expression of loyalty and hope for a prosperous reign. This moment reflects the communal aspect of kingship in Israel, where the king's legitimacy is affirmed by the people's recognition and support.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoiada.htm">Jehoiada</a></b><br>A high priest who played a crucial role in preserving the Davidic line by protecting Joash and orchestrating his coronation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>The young king who was hidden in the temple for six years to protect him from Queen Athaliah's murderous intentions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/athaliah.htm">Athaliah</a></b><br>The queen mother who usurped the throne of Judah and sought to destroy the royal family.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The sacred place where Joash was hidden and later crowned, symbolizing God's protection and presence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_anointing_and_coronation.htm">The Anointing and Coronation</a></b><br>The event where Joash was anointed as king, signifying God's chosen leadership and the restoration of rightful rule.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection_and_providence.htm">Divine Protection and Providence</a></b><br>God's hand is evident in preserving the Davidic line through Joash, reminding us of His sovereignty and faithfulness to His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_godly_leadership.htm">The Role of Godly Leadership</a></b><br>Jehoiada's courage and faithfulness demonstrate the impact of godly leadership in guiding and protecting God's people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_anointing.htm">The Importance of Anointing</a></b><br>The anointing of Joash signifies God's choice and empowerment, encouraging us to seek God's anointing in our own lives for His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_renewal.htm">Restoration and Renewal</a></b><br>Joash's coronation marks a renewal of rightful leadership, inspiring us to seek restoration in areas of our lives where God's order needs to be reestablished.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/celebration_of_god's_faithfulness.htm">Celebration of God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>The people's rejoicing at Joash's coronation reflects the joy of witnessing God's promises fulfilled, prompting us to celebrate God's work in our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_11_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 11:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_11_12_God_s_covenant_kept.htm">How does 2 Kings 11:12 demonstrate God's faithfulness to His covenant promises?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Jehoiada_s_role_in_God_s_plan_in_2_Kings_11.htm">What role does Jehoiada play in fulfilling God's plan in 2 Kings 11:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Joash_s_crowning_David_s_lineage_link.htm">How does the crowning of Joash connect to God's promise to David's lineage?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_s_timing_in_2_Kings_11_12.htm">How can we trust God's timing in our lives, as seen in 2 Kings 11:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Joash_s_anointing_God_s_role_in_leaders.htm">What does the anointing of Joash teach about God's sovereignty in leadership appointments?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_11_12_God_s_sovereign_leadership.htm">How does 2 Kings 11:12 reflect God's sovereignty in establishing rightful leadership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Crown_testimony_s_role_in_2_Kings_11_12.htm">What is the significance of the crown and testimony in 2 Kings 11:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_11_12_God_s_Davidic_protection.htm">How does 2 Kings 11:12 demonstrate God's protection over the Davidic line?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_kings_11.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Kings 11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_was_king_joash_in_the_bible.htm">Who was King Joash in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_joash's_sudden_coronation_credible.htm">2 Kings 11:12: How credible is the sudden public coronation of Joash without Athaliah&#8217;s prior knowledge?

And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the king.">2Chronicles 23:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Anointed him.</span>--The chronicler says it was "Jehoiada and his sons" who did it. It is difficult to see what objection can fairly be taken to this explanatory addition, unless we are to suppose that, although the high priest was present, the soldiers of the guard poured the sacred oil on the king's head. Yet Thenius adduces it as an instance of the "petty spirit of the chronist," accusing him of inserting the words "for fear anybody should think of an anointing by unconsecrated hands." Surely such criticism as this is itself both "petty" and "wilful." The words probably stood in the chronicler's principal source.<p><span class= "bld">God save the king.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Vivat rex</span>. (<a href="/1_kings/1-25.htm" title="For he is gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.">1Kings 1:25</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Jehoiada - <span class="cmt_word">brought forth the king's son</span> - produced him, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, from the chamber or chambers where he had been concealed hitherto. (On the temple chambers, see <a href="/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4-9</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">And put the crown upon him.</span> That the Israelite kings actually wore crowns appears from <a href="/2_samuel/1-10.htm">2 Samuel 1:10</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/20-2.htm">1 Chronicles 20:2</a>. The crown was probably a band of gold, either plain or set with jewels (<a href="/zechariah/9-16.htm">Zechariah 9:16</a>), fastened behind with a riband. It receives here the same name that is given to the high priest's diadem in <a href="/exodus/29-6.htm">Exodus 29:6</a> and Exodus 39:30. <span class="cmt_word">And gave him the testimony.</span> The words "gave him" are not in the original, and are superfluous. What is meant plainly is that the high priest laid on the young king's head a copy of the Law, or of some essential portion of it, perhaps the Decalogue, which is often called "the testimony" (<a href="/exodus/16-34.htm">Exodus 16:34</a>; <a href="/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16, 21</a>, etc.). The object apparently was to show that the king was to rule by law, not arbitrarily - that he was to be, as Dean Stanley says, "not above, but beneath, the law of his country" ('Jewish Church,' vol. 2. p. 397). The ceremony seems to have been a new one, and is indicative of the gradual curtailment of the regal power under the later monarchy. <span class="cmt_word">And they made him king, and anointed him.</span> A change is made from the singular to the plural, because, as we learn from <a href="/2_chronicles/23-11.htm">2 Chronicles 23:11</a>, "Jehoiada <span class="accented">and his</span> sons anointed him." We have had no mention of the anointing of a new monarch in Judah since the time of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/1-39.htm">1 Kings 1:39</a>).
