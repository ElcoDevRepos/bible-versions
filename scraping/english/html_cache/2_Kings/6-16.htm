It reflects a divine command to trust in God's sovereignty and protection. In the context of <a href="/2_kings/6.htm">2 Kings 6</a>, Elisha speaks these words to his servant, who is terrified by the sight of the Aramean army surrounding them. This echoes similar assurances given to figures like Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>) and Mary (<a href="/luke/1-30.htm">Luke 1:30</a>), emphasizing faith over fear.<p><b>Elisha answered,</b><br>Elisha, the prophet and successor of Elijah, is a central figure in the narrative of 2 Kings. Known for his miracles and deep relationship with God, Elisha's response is rooted in his spiritual insight and confidence in God's power. His role as a prophet is to convey God's messages and demonstrate His power, often through miraculous acts. Elisha's life and ministry are a testament to God's ongoing work through His chosen servants.<p><b>&#8220;for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reveals a spiritual reality unseen by the physical eye. Elisha refers to the heavenly host, God's angelic army, which outnumbers the physical forces of the Arameans. This concept is supported by other biblical passages, such as <a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>, which speaks of the angel of the Lord encamping around those who fear Him. Theologically, this underscores the theme of divine protection and the presence of God's unseen forces in spiritual warfare. It also prefigures the New Testament assurance found in <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>, "If God is for us, who can be against us?" This phrase encourages believers to trust in God's omnipotence and the reality of His spiritual support, even when circumstances seem dire.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God, successor to Elijah, known for his miracles and guidance to the kings of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/servant_of_elisha.htm">Servant of Elisha</a></b><br>The unnamed servant who was fearful upon seeing the enemy army surrounding them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/arameans.htm">Arameans (Syrians)</a></b><br>The enemy army that surrounded the city where Elisha and his servant were staying.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/dothan.htm">Dothan</a></b><br>The city where Elisha and his servant were located when the Aramean army surrounded them.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_army.htm">Heavenly Army</a></b><br>The spiritual forces of God, unseen by the servant until Elisha prayed for his eyes to be opened.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_protection.htm">Trust in God's Protection</a></b><br>Believers are called to trust in God's unseen protection, even when circumstances seem overwhelming.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_awareness.htm">Spiritual Awareness</a></b><br>We should pray for spiritual insight to recognize God's presence and power in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_not.htm">Fear Not</a></b><br>Fear is a natural response, but faith in God's sovereignty should be our guiding principle.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>God's power and resources are infinitely greater than any earthly threat or challenge.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intercessory_prayer.htm">Intercessory Prayer</a></b><br>Like Elisha, we can pray for others to have their spiritual eyes opened to God's truth and presence.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_6_16_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 6:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_in_overwhelming_times_2.htm">How can we trust God when facing overwhelming challenges like Elisha in 2 Kings 6:16?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_God_protect_those_with_us.htm">What does "those who are with us" reveal about God's protection?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_6_16_Romans_8_31_link.htm">How does 2 Kings 6:16 connect with Romans 8:31 about God's support?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Elisha_s_faith_daily_3.htm">How can we apply Elisha's confidence in God's presence to our daily lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_boost_faith_in_God_s_care.htm">What steps can strengthen our faith in God's unseen protection and provision?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_6_16_Hope_in_tough_times.htm">How does 2 Kings 6:16 encourage believers facing overwhelming odds?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Context_of_2_Kings_6_16_events.htm">What historical context surrounds the events in 2 Kings 6:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_6_16_God_s_protection_shown.htm">How does 2 Kings 6:16 illustrate God's protection over His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_kings_6.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Kings 6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_to_biblically_respect_others.htm">What are examples of miracles in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_couldn't_judah_defeat_iron_chariots.htm">In Judges 1:19, if God was with Judah, why couldn&#8217;t they overcome iron chariots, suggesting a limitation of divine power? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_are_heavenly_hosts.htm">What are heavenly hosts?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/do_angels_and_demons_engage_in_combat.htm">Do angels and demons engage in combat?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does 2 Kings 6:16 Mean</div><b>Do not be afraid</b><p>Elisha&#8217;s very first words go straight to the most common human response: fear. Scripture repeats this command because fear blinds us to God&#8217;s presence.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a> says, &#8220;Do not fear, for I am with you; do not be afraid, for I am your God&#8221;, grounding courage in God&#8217;s nearness.<p>&#8226; Joshua heard the same charge in <a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>, reminding him that the LORD would be with him wherever he went.<p>&#8226; Paul assures believers in <a href="/2_timothy/1-7.htm">2 Timothy 1:7</a> that &#8220;God has not given us a spirit of fear.&#8221;<p>When we feel surrounded&#8212;as Elisha&#8217;s servant literally was in <a href="/2_kings/6-15.htm">2 Kings 6:15</a>&#8212;God&#8217;s repeated &#8220;Do not be afraid&#8221; calls us to shift our gaze from visible threats to the invisible yet greater reality of His protection.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Elisha answered</b><p>The prophet doesn&#8217;t panic or even pause. His calm reply flows from a life trained to see beyond the obvious.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11&#8211;15</a> Elisha watched Elijah taken up and immediately grasped the fallen mantle; he had seen God&#8217;s power up close before.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/15-23.htm">Proverbs 15:23</a> observes, &#8220;How good is a timely word!&#8221; and Elisha&#8217;s word is perfectly timed to steady a trembling heart.<p>&#8226; Like Moses in <a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a> who told Israel, &#8220;Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the LORD will bring,&#8221; Elisha speaks faith before any change in circumstance is visible.<p>God often chooses a steady voice to break the spell of fear and call His people back to trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for those who are with us</b><p>The prophet points to unseen allies.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a> declares, &#8220;The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him, and he delivers them&#8221;.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a> promises, &#8220;He will command His angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus reminded Peter in <a href="/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a> that more than twelve legions of angels stood ready.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a> describes angels as &#8220;ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation.&#8221;<p>Elisha knew that God&#8217;s presence, His angelic host, and His covenant commitment were already on the scene. What the servant thought was just two men was actually a company backed by heaven.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>are more than those who are with them</b><p>The issue is not who is louder or more visible but who outnumbers whom in the realm that matters most.<p>&#8226; Hezekiah used almost identical words centuries later: &#8220;With him is only an arm of flesh, but with us is the LORD our God to help us&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-7.htm">2 Chronicles 32:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a> asks, &#8220;If God is for us, who can be against us?&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_john/4-4.htm">1 John 4:4</a> reassures, &#8220;He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.&#8221;<p>&#8226; John&#8217;s vision in <a href="/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11</a> counts &#8220;ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands&#8221; of angels around God&#8217;s throne.<p>The math is always in the believer&#8217;s favor.
