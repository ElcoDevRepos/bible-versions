Like the healed demoniac sent back to proclaim (<a href="/mark/5-19.htm">Mark 5:19</a>), these men are about to realize, &#8220;We are not doing right&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/7-9.htm">2 Kings 7:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene prepares us to see stewardship over hoarding; what God gives is meant to be shared (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-8.htm">2 Corinthians 9:8-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/7-8.htm">2 Kings 7:8</a> portrays the moment God&#8217;s miraculous deliverance becomes visible: four marginalized lepers discover an empty enemy camp, feast on abandoned provisions, and begin gathering treasure. Each action&#8212;arriving, eating, collecting, hiding&#8212;reveals layers of divine care, human instinct, and impending responsibility. The verse assures us that when God speaks, He fulfills His word precisely, often through unexpected people, meeting both physical and future needs in abundance meant to be shared.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And when . . . tent.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">And</span> (so) <span class= "ital">those lepers came to the edge of the camp, and they went into one tent</span>, taking up the thread of the narrative again at <a href="/2_kings/7-5.htm" title="And they rose up in the twilight, to go to the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.">2Kings 7:5</a>, where it was broken by the parenthesis about the panic flight of the Syrians.<p><span class= "bld">Went and hid it.</span>--A common practice of Orientals, with whom holes in the ground or in the house wall supply the place of banks.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp.</span> The narrative, begun in ver. 3, is here taken up from the point where it was broken off in ver. 5, and the phrase there used is repeated, to mark the connection. <span class="cmt_word">They went into one tent, and did eat and drink.</span> The first necessity was to satisfy the cravings of their appetite, as they were well-nigh starving. Then their covetousness was excited by the riches exposed to view in the tent. <span class="cmt_word">And carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment.</span> Oriental armies carried with them vast quantities of the precious metals, in the shape of gold and silver vases, goblets, dishes, as well as in collars, chains, furniture, and trappings. Herodotus says (9:80) that, when the camp of Mardonius at Plataea fell into the hands of the Greeks, there were found in it "many tents richly adorned with furniture of gold and silver, many couches covered with plates of the same, and many golden bowls, goblets, and other drinking-vessels. On the carriages were bags containing gold and silver kettles; and the bodies of the slain furnished bracelets and chains, and scimitars with golden ornaments - not to mention era-broidered apparel, of which no one made any account." The camp of the Syrians would scarcely have been so richly provided; but still it contained, no doubt, a large amount of very valuable plunder. <span class="cmt_word">And went and hid it.</span> The lepers had no right to the pick of the spoil. It belonged to the nation, and it was probably the king's right to apportion it. The lepers had to conceal what they appropriated, lest it should he taken from them. <span class="cmt_word">And came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.</span> Plundering thus probably, not two tents only, but several. At last, either covetousness was satiated or conscience awoke. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/7-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1436;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
