Elisha, now the primary prophet in Israel, had instructed them not to search, but they insisted. This reflects a common theme in Scripture where God's word through His prophets is often doubted or questioned. The return to Elisha signifies the acknowledgment of his authority and the fulfillment of his prophetic word.<p><b>who was staying in Jericho</b><br>Jericho, known as the "City of Palms," is significant in biblical history as the first city conquered by the Israelites under Joshua. It symbolizes new beginnings and divine intervention. Elisha's presence in Jericho may indicate a continuation of God's work and blessing in the land. Jericho's location near the Jordan River also connects to the earlier miraculous crossing by Elijah and Elisha, emphasizing the continuity of God's power and presence.<p><b>he said to them</b><br>Elisha's role as a prophet is underscored here. His words carry the authority of God, and his communication with the sons of the prophets is a teaching moment. Prophets in the Old Testament often served as God's mouthpiece, providing guidance, correction, and revelation to the people.<p><b>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you not to go?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights Elisha's earlier warning and the futility of the search for Elijah. It serves as a reminder of the importance of faith and obedience to God's word. The phrase also reflects a common biblical theme where human understanding is limited, and trust in God's revelation is paramount. This moment can be seen as a test of faith for the sons of the prophets, illustrating the need to rely on divine wisdom rather than human effort.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>The prophet of God who succeeded Elijah.

Their arrival back in Jericho underscores the futility of relying on sight when God has already spoken.<p>&#8226; The scene mirrors the women who searched for Jesus&#8217; body only to hear, &#8220;Why do you seek the living among the dead?&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-5.htm">Luke 24:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Like Abraham&#8217;s servants waiting at the foot of Mount Moriah (<a href="/genesis/22-5.htm">Genesis 22:5</a>), these men miss the greater reality because they cannot yet imagine it.<p>&#8226; Their empty-handed return verifies the truth of Elisha&#8217;s earlier word, reinforcing that God&#8217;s word never fails (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To Elisha, who was staying in Jericho</b><p>Jericho, once cursed (<a href="/joshua/6-26.htm">Joshua 6:26</a>) yet now hosting God&#8217;s prophet, becomes a fitting backdrop for a lesson on believing revelation over human reasoning.<p>&#8226; Elisha&#8217;s presence redeems a place formerly associated with judgment, hinting at God&#8217;s power to reverse curses (<a href="/2_kings/2-19.htm">2 Kings 2:19-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Just as Jesus chose despised places like Nazareth and Samaria to unveil divine truth (<a href="/john/4-4.htm">John 4:4-26</a>), God plants His spokesman in Jericho to declare that His plans override human expectation.<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;staying in Jericho&#8221; shows Elisha is stationary, resting in God&#8217;s word, while the search party exhausted themselves&#8212;echoing Mary sitting at Jesus&#8217; feet while Martha was &#8220;worried and upset about many things&#8221; (<a href="/luke/10-38.htm">Luke 10:38-42</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He said to them</b><p>Elisha speaks with calm, measured authority.

Elisha now interprets the fruitlessness of the search.<p>&#8226; Paul later urges, &#8220;Do not despise prophecies, but test all things&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-20.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:20-21</a>). These men had tested Elisha&#8217;s prophecy the hard way; experience confirmed it.<p>&#8226; The prophet&#8217;s first words after their return are corrective rather than punitive&#8212;like Jesus with the Emmaus disciples: &#8220;How foolish you are, and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-25.htm">Luke 24:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you not to go?&#8221;</b><p>Elisha&#8217;s gentle rebuke crystallizes the lesson: obedience is better than exploration when God has already spoken.<p>&#8226; His question recalls Samuel confronting Saul, &#8220;Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obedience to the voice of the LORD?&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The spirit of the age says, &#8220;See for yourself.&#8221; Faith says, &#8220;Speak, LORD, for Your servant is listening&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-10.htm">1 Samuel 3:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Elijah&#8217;s translation foreshadows the resurrection and ascension of Christ (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-11</a>). Searching for a body dishonored the heavenly reality God had just unveiled.<p>&#8226; Elisha&#8217;s successively performed miracles (<a href="/2_kings/2-14.htm">2 Kings 2:14, 21, 24</a>) prove that the mantle&#8212;both physical and spiritual&#8212;truly rests on him.

The empty-handed prophets stand as living testimonies that when the Lord speaks, no further investigation is required; obedience and trust are the rightful response.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">For he tarried.</span>--<span class= "ital">Now he</span> (emphatic) <span class= "ital">was abiding in Jericho</span> (while they were searching).<p><span class= "bld">Did I not say.</span>--Or, command.

But when he withdrew from the world, that Providence which guided the destinies of Israel did not, therefore, forsake His people. A portion of Elijah's spirit passed to his disciples; and they are forbidden to seek their departed master in the desert: they must find among themselves the means of carrying on his work" (<span class= "ital">Reuss</span>).<p>Thenius considers the entire section (<a href="/2_kings/1-2.htm" title="And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.">2Kings 1:2</a> to <a href="/2_kings/2-18.htm" title="And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?">2Kings 2:18</a>) to be a distinct fragment of a lost history of Elijah.
