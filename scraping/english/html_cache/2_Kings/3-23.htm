This reflects the ancient Near Eastern context where omens and signs were often interpreted as divine messages. The reddish appearance of the water was due to the reflection of the sun, a natural phenomenon that God used to fulfill His purpose. This moment echoes other biblical instances where God uses natural events to achieve His plans, such as the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>).<p><b>they exclaimed.</b><br>The Moabites' reaction was immediate and unanimous, indicating a lack of discernment and haste in judgment. This reflects a broader biblical theme where human perception is often flawed without divine insight. Their exclamation shows their eagerness and desperation, as Moab was under significant pressure from Israel, Judah, and Edom.<p><b>The kings have clashed swords and slaughtered one another.</b><br>This assumption by the Moabites reveals their expectation of discord among the allied forces of Israel, Judah, and Edom. Historically, alliances in the ancient Near East were often fragile, and internal conflict was not uncommon. This misjudgment highlights the Moabites' underestimation of the unity and divine backing of the Israelite coalition, reminiscent of other biblical narratives where God confounds the enemies of His people (e.g., Gideon's victory in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>).<p><b>Now to the plunder, Moab!</b><br>The Moabites' call to plunder reflects their opportunistic nature and the common practice of looting after a perceived victory. This phrase underscores their confidence in an easy victory, which ultimately leads to their downfall. The call to plunder is a recurring theme in biblical warfare narratives, where the spoils of war are seen as a reward for victory. However, in this instance, it becomes a trap, illustrating the biblical principle that pride and presumption often precede a fall (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moabites.htm">Moabites</a></b><br>The Moabites were descendants of Lot and often in conflict with Israel.

LXX., <span class= "greekheb">??????????</span>. The supposition was not improbable. Confederates of different races not seldom had been known to fall out among themselves (comp. <a href="/judges/7-22.htm" title="And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, to Tabbath.">Judges 7:22</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/20-23.htm" title="For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, every one helped to destroy another.">2Chronicles 20:23</a>, and Note), and in this case the old enmity of Edom towards Israel, and the suppressed jealousies between Israel and Judah, made such a result very likely. The Moabites would know also that the wady had been waterless, so that their mistake was natural. When once their instinct for plunder was aroused they did not stop to think, but with a wild cry of "Moab, to the spoil !" they rushed in disorder upon the Israelite camp.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And they said, This is blood.</span> Even Ewald recognizes here "a historical background for the narrative." The idea of such a mistake could scarcely have occurred to a romancer. <span class="cmt_word">The kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another.</span> There were rivalries and jealousies subsisting between Judah, Israel, and Edom, which made it quite possible that at any time open quarrel might break out among them. Edom especially was, it is probable, a reluctant member of the confederacy, forced to take her part in it by her suzerain, Jehoshaphat. The Moabites, moreover, had recently had personal experience how easily the swords of confederates might be turned against each other, since their last expedition against Judah (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-1.htm">2 Chronicles 20:1-25</a>) had completely failed through such a sudden disagreement and contention. <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</span> If their supposition were correct, and the kings had come to blows, and the hosts destroyed each other, Moab would have nothing to do but to fly upon the spoil, to strip the slain, and plunder the camp of the confederates. A disorderly rush took place for this purpose (see Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 9:3. &sect; 2). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/3-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1462;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2088.htm">Strong's 2088: </a> </span><span class="str2">This, that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is blood!&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1818.htm">Strong's 1818: </a> </span><span class="str2">Blood, of man, an animal, the juice of the grape, bloodshed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they exclaimed.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
