Leprosy, a severe skin disease, was often seen as a sign of God's displeasure (<a href="/numbers/12-10.htm">Numbers 12:10</a>, <a href="/2_chronicles/26-19.htm">2 Chronicles 26:19-21</a>). The affliction of the king with leprosy serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience to God's commands. In the ancient Near East, leprosy was not only a physical ailment but also a social and religious stigma, leading to isolation from the community.<p><b>until the day he died</b><br>The duration of the king's affliction underscores the permanence of God's judgment in this instance. It suggests that the king's condition was irreversible, serving as a lifelong reminder of his transgressions. This phrase also highlights the seriousness of sin and the enduring nature of its consequences when not repented.<p><b>so that he lived in a separate house</b><br>Levitical law required those with leprosy to live outside the camp or community (<a href="/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a>). This separation was both a health measure and a symbolic act of purification, emphasizing the need for holiness among God's people. The king's isolation reflects the broader biblical theme of separation from God due to sin, and it foreshadows the ultimate separation from God that sin causes without redemption.<p><b>while his son Jotham had charge of the palace</b><br>Jotham's role as regent during his father's illness illustrates the continuity of leadership despite the king's incapacitation. This arrangement ensured stability in governance and is a testament to the importance of dynastic succession in the Davidic line. Jotham's governance during this period is noted for its relative faithfulness to God, contrasting with his father's failures (<a href="/2_kings/15-34.htm">2 Kings 15:34</a>).<p><b>and governed the people of the land</b><br>Jotham's governance is significant in maintaining the kingdom's operations and upholding justice and order. This phrase highlights the importance of righteous leadership in the biblical narrative, as seen in the examples of other godly leaders like David and Solomon. It also points to the need for leaders who align with God's will, serving as a type of Christ, the ultimate righteous ruler who governs with justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who exercises judgment and mercy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King (Azariah/Uzziah)</a></b><br>The king of Judah who was afflicted with leprosy as a divine judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/leprosy.htm">Leprosy</a></b><br>A severe skin disease that rendered individuals ceremonially unclean and isolated.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jotham.htm">Jotham</a></b><br>The son of King Azariah, who took over the responsibilities of governing due to his father's condition.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/separate_house.htm">Separate House</a></b><br>The place where the king lived in isolation due to his leprosy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_judgment_and_mercy.htm">Divine Judgment and Mercy</a></b><br>God's affliction of the king with leprosy serves as a reminder of His holiness and the consequences of pride and disobedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_responsibility.htm">Leadership and Responsibility</a></b><br>Jotham's role in governing highlights the importance of responsible leadership, especially when stepping in during times of crisis.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/isolation_and_community.htm">Isolation and Community</a></b><br>The king's isolation due to leprosy underscores the impact of sin and uncleanness on community and relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_and_repentance.htm">Humility and Repentance</a></b><br>The account encourages believers to maintain humility and seek repentance to avoid the pitfalls of pride.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_15_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 15:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_15_5_God_s_response_to_sin.htm">How does 2 Kings 15:5 illustrate God's response to disobedience and sin?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Azariah_s_leprosy.htm">What lessons can we learn from King Azariah's leprosy in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Azariah_s_isolation_sin_s_consequences.htm">How does Azariah's isolation relate to the consequences of sin in Scripture?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_seek_God_s_mercy_for_sin.htm">In what ways can we seek God's mercy when facing consequences of sin?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Aid_leaders_facing_self-made_trials.htm">How can we support leaders who face trials due to their own actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_God_give_Azariah_leprosy.htm">Why did the LORD strike King Azariah with leprosy in 2 Kings 15:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_15_5_God_s_justice_and_mercy.htm">What does 2 Kings 15:5 reveal about God's justice and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/King_Azariah_s_punishment_in_2_Kings.htm">How does King Azariah's punishment align with the overall message of 2 Kings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_kings_15.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Kings 15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_was_king_jotham_of_judah.htm">Who was King Jotham of Judah?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_omit_azariah's_leprosy_cause_here.htm">2 Kings 15:5 states God struck Azariah with leprosy with little explanation&#8212;why is the cause, detailed in 2 Chronicles 26, absent here?

We have to go to Chronicles for an explanation. By Chronicles it appears that, in the earlier portion of his reign, Azariah was a good and pious prince, and that God blessed him in all his undertakings. Not only did he recover Eloth (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-2.htm">2 Chronicles 26:2</a>), but he carried on a successful war with the Philistines - took Garb, Jabneh (Jamnia), and Ashdod, and dismantled them (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>), defeated the Arabians of Gur-Baal, and the Mehuuim or Maonites (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-7.htm">2 Chronicles 26:7</a>), forced the Ammonites to pay him a tribute, and caused his power to be known and feared far and wide (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-8.htm">2 Chronicles 26:8</a>). The standing army which he maintained numbered 307,500 men, under 2600 officers, well armed and equipped with shields, spears, helmets, breast-plates, bows, and slings (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-12.htm">2 Chronicles 26:12-14</a>). "His name spread far abroad, for he was wonderfully helped" (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-15.htm">2 Chronicles 26:15</a>). This marvelous prosperity developed in him a pride equal to that of his father, but one which vented itself differently, Azariab, deeming himself superior to all other men, and exempt from ordinary rules, boldly invaded the priestly office, took a censer, and entered into the temple, and proceeded to burn incense upon the golden altar that was before the veil (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-18</a>). It was then that "the Lord smote the king." As, in defiance of the high priest and his attendant train, who sought to prevent the lawless act, Azariah persisted in his endeavors, God struck him with leprosy, his forehead grew white with the unmistakable scaly scab, and in a moment his indomitable pride was quelled. The priests closed in upon him and began to thrust him out, but no violence was necessary. Aware of what had happened, "he himself also hasted to go out, because the Lord had smitten him" (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-20.htm">2 Chronicles 26:20</a>). It is not very clear why the writer of Kings passes over these facts; but certainly they are not discredited by his silence. At any rate, those who accept the entire series of conquests, whereof the writer of Kings says nothing, on the sole authority of Chronicles, are logically precluded from rejecting the circumstances accompanying the leprosy, which is acknowledged by the writer of Kings, and viewed as a judgment from God. <span class="cmt_word">So that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house</span> (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/26-21.htm">2 Chronicles 26:21</a>). Lepers had to be separated from the congregation - to "dwell alone" - "without the camp" (<a href="/leviticus/13-46.htm">Leviticus 13:46</a>). Ahaziah's "several house" is regarded by some as an "infirmary," or "hospital for lepers" (Ewald, Gesenius, Winer); but there is no reason to believe that hospitals of any kind existed among the Israelites. The lepers mentioned in <a href="/2_kings/7-3.htm">2 Kings 7:3</a> are houseless. <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;</span> is best translated "house of separation" and understood of a house standing by itself in the open country, separate from others. "Probably the house in which the leprous king lived was," as Bahr says, "especially built for him." <span class="cmt_word">And Jotham the Mug's son was over the house</span> - not over the "several house," but over the royal palace - <span class="cmt_word">judging the people of the land</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> executing the royal functions, whereof "judging" was one of the highest.
