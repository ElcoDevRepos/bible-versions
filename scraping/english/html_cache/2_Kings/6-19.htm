Known for his miracles and guidance to the kings of Israel, Elisha's role here demonstrates his authority and divine insight. His actions are often seen as prefiguring the works of Christ, who also led people spiritually and physically.<p><b>&#8220;This is not the way, and this is not the city.</b><br>Elisha speaks to the Aramean soldiers who have been struck with blindness. His statement is both literal and metaphorical, as he redirects them from their intended path. This can be seen as a reflection of spiritual blindness and the need for divine guidance, similar to how Jesus redirects those who are spiritually lost.<p><b>Follow me,</b><br>Elisha's invitation to follow him is reminiscent of Jesus' call to His disciples. It signifies trust and obedience, themes prevalent throughout the Bible. The act of following a prophet or leader is a recurring motif, symbolizing faith and the journey towards truth.<p><b>and I will take you to the man you are seeking.&#8221;</b><br>Elisha promises to lead them to the man they seek, which is himself, though they do not realize it. This mirrors the biblical theme of seeking and finding, as seen in <a href="/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7</a>. It also highlights the irony and divine humor often present in biblical narratives.<p><b>And he led them to Samaria.</b><br>Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, is significant both politically and spiritually. By leading the Arameans there, Elisha brings them into the heart of Israel, demonstrating God's power and protection over His people.

Thenius and Bahr accept this. Keil says, "Elisha's words contain a falsehood, and are to be judged of in the same way as every ruse by which an enemy is deceived." Thenius declares that "there is no untruth in the words of Elisha, strictly taken; for his <span class= "ital">home</span> was not in Dothan (where he had only stayed for a time), but in Samaria; and the phrase 'to the man might well mean 'to his house.' " Surely it is easier to suppose that the "dazing" had caused the Syrians to go wandering about in the valley at the foot of the hill, vainly seeking to find the right way up to the city gate. (Comp. Gen. <span class= "ital">50100</span>, "They wearied themselves to find the door.")
