The servant's question reflects a common human reaction of doubt when faced with seemingly insufficient resources. This moment sets the stage for a demonstration of divine provision, a recurring theme in the Bible.<p><b>&#8220;How am I to set twenty loaves before a hundred men?&#8221;</b><br>The servant's question highlights the apparent inadequacy of the resources available. Twenty loaves for a hundred men would seem insufficient, especially considering the loaves were likely small barley loaves, common in ancient Israel. This scenario parallels the feeding of the 5,000 in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>), where Jesus multiplies loaves and fish, showcasing a typology of Christ as the provider.<p><b>&#8220;Give it to the people to eat,&#8221; said Elisha,</b><br>Elisha's command reflects his faith in God's provision. As a prophet, Elisha acts as God's mouthpiece, demonstrating trust in God's word over visible circumstances. This mirrors the faith of other biblical figures, such as Moses, who trusted God to provide manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16).<p><b>&#8220;for this is what the LORD says:</b><br>Elisha's statement underscores the authority of God's word. The phrase "this is what the LORD says" is a prophetic declaration, emphasizing that the miracle is not by Elisha's power but by God's will. This aligns with the biblical theme that God's word is powerful and accomplishes what it intends (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><b>&#8216;They will eat and have some left over.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This promise of abundance is a hallmark of God's provision, echoing the miracle of the manna and the feeding of the multitudes by Jesus. The concept of having "some left over" signifies God's generosity and the superabundance of His blessings. It also foreshadows the New Testament miracles where Jesus provides more than enough for the people, reinforcing the idea of Christ as the ultimate provider.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet in Israel, successor to Elijah, known for performing miracles and being a mouthpiece for God's word.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>An unnamed servant of Elisha who questions the feasibility of feeding a hundred men with limited resources.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hundred_men.htm">The Hundred Men</a></b><br>A group of prophets or followers of Elisha who are present and in need of food.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miracle_of_multiplication.htm">The Miracle of Multiplication</a></b><br>The event where Elisha, through God's promise, provides enough food for a hundred men with leftovers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilgal.htm">Gilgal</a></b><br>The location where this event takes place, often associated with prophetic activity and divine encounters.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>Elisha's confidence in God's word teaches us to trust in God's promises, even when circumstances seem impossible.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_abundance.htm">God's Abundance</a></b><br>The miracle illustrates that God not only meets needs but often provides in abundance, encouraging us to rely on His generosity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_over_doubt.htm">Faith Over Doubt</a></b><br>The servant's initial doubt contrasts with Elisha's faith, reminding us to choose faith over skepticism in God's power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_word.htm">Obedience to God's Word</a></b><br>Elisha's instruction to "give it to the people to eat" highlights the importance of obedience to God's commands, even when they defy logic.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_sharing.htm">Community and Sharing</a></b><br>The communal aspect of the miracle encourages believers to share resources and trust in God's ability to multiply what we offer.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_4_43_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 4:43?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_4_43_Elisha_s_faith_God_s_provision.htm">How does 2 Kings 4:43 demonstrate God's provision through Elisha's faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Trusting_God_with_limited_resources.htm">What can we learn about trusting God when resources seem insufficient?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_to_Jesus_feeding_crowds.htm">How does this miracle connect to Jesus feeding the multitudes in the Gospels?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Elisha_s_faith_daily.htm">How can we apply Elisha's faith in our daily challenges and needs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_God_multiply_our_offerings.htm">What does this passage teach about God's ability to multiply our offerings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_4_43_God_s_provision_in_scarcity.htm">How does 2 Kings 4:43 demonstrate God's provision in times of scarcity?
