The prophecy indicates that Sennacherib would retreat without conquering the city. Historically, this aligns with the Assyrian military campaigns where they often returned the same route due to logistical needs. This prophecy was fulfilled when Sennacherib's army was struck by a divine intervention, as described later in the chapter. Theologically, this demonstrates God's sovereignty and protection over Jerusalem, emphasizing His control over the nations and their leaders.<p><b>and he will not enter this city</b><br>Jerusalem was under threat from the powerful Assyrian empire, known for its military might and brutal conquests. The assurance that Sennacherib would not enter the city highlights God's promise to protect His people. This is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where God defends Israel against overwhelming odds. The city of Jerusalem holds significant religious and cultural importance as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple. This protection can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate protector and deliverer of His people.<p><b>declares the LORD</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority and certainty of the prophecy. When the LORD declares something, it is an absolute assurance of its fulfillment. The use of "declares the LORD" is a common prophetic formula that emphasizes divine authority. It connects to other scriptures where God's word is shown to be powerful and effective, such as <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, which states that God's word will not return void. This declaration also serves to remind the audience of God's faithfulness to His covenant promises, reinforcing the trustworthiness of His word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah during the time of the Assyrian threat.
