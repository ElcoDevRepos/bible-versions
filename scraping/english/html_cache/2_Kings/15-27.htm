His reign is recorded in <a href="/2_kings/15.htm">2 Kings 15:1-7</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/26.htm">2 Chronicles 26</a>. Azariah's long reign provided stability in Judah, contrasting with the frequent changes of leadership in Israel. His reign is marked by military success and building projects, but also by his pride, which led to his downfall and leprosy (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-21</a>). This timeframe situates the events in the Northern Kingdom of Israel within the broader context of Judah's history.<p><b>Pekah son of Remaliah became king of Israel</b><br>Pekah was a military officer who assassinated King Pekahiah to seize the throne (<a href="/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a>). His rise to power reflects the political instability and frequent coups in the Northern Kingdom during this period. Pekah's reign is characterized by alliances and conflicts with surrounding nations, including Aram and Assyria. His name, meaning "open-eyed," may suggest a perception of vigilance or insight, though his actions led Israel further into idolatry and conflict.<p><b>and he reigned in Samaria twenty years</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, established by Omri (<a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>). It was a center of political and religious activity, often associated with idolatry and syncretism. Pekah's twenty-year reign was marked by significant challenges, including the Syro-Ephraimite War, where he allied with Rezin of Aram against Judah (<a href="/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7:1-9</a>). This period saw increasing Assyrian pressure, leading to the eventual fall of Samaria in 722 BC.

In the latter he seems to have had the assistance of Hoshea, who, with his sanction, slew Pekah, and became king. The scanty notices of our author must be supplemented from <a href="/2_chronicles/28.htm">2 Chronicles 28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/7-1.htm">Isaiah 7:1-9</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-1.htm">Isaiah 8:1-8</a>; and the Assyrian inscriptions. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah King of Judah</span>; rather, <span class="accented">in the thirty-ninth or thirty-eighth year</span> (see the comment on ver. 23). Pekahiah's "two years" may not have been complete. <span class="cmt_word">Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years.</span> The Assyrian records make this number impossible. Tiglath-pileser's entire reign lasted only eighteen years, yet it more than covered the entire reign of Pekah. When he first invaded the kingdom of Samaria, Menahem was upon the throne ('Eponym Canon,' p. 120, line 29); when he last attacked it, probably in <span class="date">B.C. 730</span> - two years before his death in <span class="date">B.C. 728</span> - he set up Hoshea, or, at any rate, sanctioned his usurpation (ibid., pp. 123, 124, lines 15-18). Pekah's entire reign must have come in the interval, which is certainly not more than one of fifteen, probably not more than one of ten years. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/15-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In the fifty-second</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;mi&#353;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2572.htm">Strong's 2572: </a> </span><span class="str2">Fifty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">year</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1463;&#1448;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(bi&#353;&#183;na&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
