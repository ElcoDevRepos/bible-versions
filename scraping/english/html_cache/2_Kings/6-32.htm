This setting indicates a time of counsel or deliberation, possibly due to the dire circumstances in Samaria, which was under siege by the Arameans. The presence of the elders suggests that Elisha was not only a spiritual leader but also a key advisor in political and social matters. This reflects the role of prophets in Israel as both spiritual and civic leaders. The house setting may symbolize a place of refuge and divine insight amidst the chaos outside.<p><b>The king sent a messenger ahead, but before he arrived, Elisha said to the elders,</b><br>The king of Israel, likely Jehoram, sends a messenger, indicating a sense of urgency or desperation. The fact that Elisha knows of the messenger's approach before his arrival demonstrates his prophetic insight, a gift from God. This foreknowledge underscores Elisha's role as a true prophet, in contrast to false prophets who lacked such divine revelation. It also highlights the tension between the king and Elisha, as the king often vacillated between seeking God's counsel and relying on his own understanding.<p><b>&#8220;Do you see how this murderer has sent someone to cut off my head?</b><br>Elisha refers to the king as "this murderer," which may allude to the king's responsibility for the dire situation in Samaria, possibly due to his failure to follow God's commands or his involvement in idolatry. The threat to Elisha's life indicates the king's frustration and misplaced blame for the siege and famine. This accusation reflects the broader biblical theme of the persecution of God's prophets by those in power, as seen in the lives of other prophets like Jeremiah and John the Baptist.<p><b>Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door to keep him out.</b><br>Elisha instructs the elders to shut the door, a practical measure to protect himself from the king's wrath. This action symbolizes the rejection of the king's authority in favor of divine protection and guidance. The closed door can also be seen as a metaphor for the separation between God's will and human attempts to thwart it. This echoes other biblical instances where God provides protection for His servants, such as Noah's ark or the Passover in Egypt.<p><b>Is not the sound of his master&#8217;s footsteps behind him?&#8221;</b><br>Elisha discerns that the king himself is following the messenger, indicating the king's personal involvement and urgency in the matter. This phrase suggests that the king is not only sending a message but is also actively pursuing his own agenda, possibly to confront or capture Elisha. The footsteps imply impending judgment or confrontation, reminiscent of other biblical narratives where footsteps signify approaching danger or divine intervention, such as God's presence in the Garden of Eden.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God, known for his miracles and guidance to the kings of Israel.

Elisha had a house in Samaria, where he ordinarily resided, and from which he made his circuits. He happened to be sitting there, and the elders of the city to be sitting with him, when Jehoram sent "a man from before him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one of the court officials, to put him to death. The "elders" had probably assembled at Elisha's house to consult with him on the critical situation of affairs, and (if possible) obtain from him some miraculous assistance. <span class="cmt_word">But ere the messenger came to him; he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head</span>; Elisha was supernaturally warned of what was about to take place - that an executioner was coming almost immediately to take away his life, and that the king himself would arrive shortly after. He calls the king "this son of a murderer," or rather "this son of <span class="accented">the</span> murderer," with reference to Ahab, the great murderer of the time, who had sanctioned all Jezebel's cruelties-the general massacre of the prophets of Jehovah (<a href="/1_kings/18-13.htm">1 Kings 18:13</a>), the judicial murder of Naboth (<a href="/1_kings/21-9.htm">1 Kings 21:9-13</a>), the attempt to kill Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-2.htm">1 Kings 19:2</a>) - and had, by a fierce and long continued persecution, reduced the worshippers of Jehovah in Israel to the scanty number of seven thousand (<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>). Jehoram had now shown that he inherited the bloodthirsty disposition of his father, and had justly earned the epithet which Elisha bestowed on him. <span class="cmt_word">Look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door.</span> Keil renders the last clause, "force him back at the door;" the LXX.

He could not in a general way have expected them to resist the king's will as declared by his representative; but he might reasonably ask a short respite, if the king was just about to arrive at the house, to confirm the order that he had given, or to revoke it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/6-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Elisha</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1462;&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1506;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(we&#183;&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#238;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
