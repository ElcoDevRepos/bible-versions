The phrase indicates a level of trust in the workers, suggesting that they were known for their honesty and reliability. This reflects the biblical principle of stewardship and integrity, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>, which emphasizes faithfulness in managing resources. The trust placed in these workers highlights the importance of character and reputation in biblical times.<p><b>put into their hands</b><br>The phrase refers to the funds allocated for the temple repairs. In ancient Israel, the temple was the center of worship and community life, making its maintenance a priority. The money was collected from the people, as described earlier in the chapter, and entrusted to skilled workers. This reflects the communal responsibility and collective effort in maintaining the house of God, similar to the communal giving seen in the early church in <a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32-35</a>.<p><b>since they work with integrity.</b><br>Integrity is a key biblical value, and the workers' integrity is emphasized here. This mirrors the character of God, who is described as faithful and true throughout scripture (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>). The workers' integrity ensured that the funds were used appropriately, serving as a model for Christian conduct. This also foreshadows the integrity of Christ, who perfectly fulfilled His mission on earth, as seen in <a href="/john/17-4.htm">John 17:4</a>.

In a culture where careful reckoning was standard (compare <a href="/ezra/8-33.htm">Ezra 8:33&#8211;34</a>), here the king exempts these workers from giving receipts.<p>&#8226; This exemption is not rooted in laxity but in trust&#8212;a foreshadowing of Jesus&#8217; later words, &#8220;Whoever is faithful with very little will also be faithful with much&#8221; (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p>&#8226; It underlines that genuine godliness can simplify systems: when people walk uprightly, burdensome controls become unnecessary (<a href="/proverbs/28-20.htm">Proverbs 28:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the money</b><p>&#8226; The funds in view are the sacred offerings brought into the temple (<a href="/2_kings/22-4.htm">2 Kings 22:4&#8211;6</a>). These were not common taxes but gifts set apart for God&#8217;s house, echoing <a href="/exodus/30-12.htm">Exodus 30:12-16</a>, where each Israelite contributed to the sanctuary.<p>&#8226; Money dedicated to the Lord carries a higher stewardship standard (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-2.htm">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>). Misuse would be sacrilege (<a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1-4</a>), so the decision to relax oversight highlights how trustworthy these men had proven themselves.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>put into their hands</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Put&#8221; shows deliberate entrusting; the king and priest hand resources directly to the craftsmen.

By placing funds &#8220;into their hands,&#8221; leadership affirms both competence and calling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>since they work with integrity</b><p>&#8226; Integrity (literally &#8220;faithfulness&#8221; in parallel passage <a href="/2_kings/12-15.htm">2 Kings 12:15</a>) is the sole reason no ledger is required. Character, not credentials, earns confidence (<a href="/proverbs/10-9.htm">Proverbs 10:9</a>; <a href="/titus/2-7.htm">Titus 2:7-10</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse contrasts with later periods when priests were corrupt (<a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6-8</a>). Here, in Josiah&#8217;s revival, honesty flourishes, illustrating how righteousness affects even administrative details.<p>&#8226; God values integrity in labour; He promises &#8220;a good name&#8221; to those who walk uprightly (<a href="/ecclesiastes/7-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 7:1</a>) and counts their service as worship (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/22-7.htm">2 Kings 22:7</a> teaches that in seasons of true reform, trustworthy workers make elaborate controls unnecessary.
