This phrase indicates his willingness to engage directly with the situation, reflecting the role of a prophet as an intermediary between God and people. Elisha's entry into the room signifies his readiness to perform a miracle, similar to how Jesus often entered into situations to bring healing and restoration (e.g., <a href="/mark/5-40.htm">Mark 5:40</a>).<p><b>closed the door</b><br>Closing the door symbolizes privacy and intimacy in prayer, emphasizing the need for focus and undistracted communion with God. This act is reminiscent of Jesus' instruction in <a href="/matthew/6-6.htm">Matthew 6:6</a> to pray in secret, highlighting the importance of personal and sincere communication with God. It also signifies a separation from the unbelief of others, creating a sacred space for divine intervention.<p><b>behind the two of them</b><br>The "two of them" refers to the child and Elisha, indicating that the miracle was to be a private matter between the prophet and the deceased child. This mirrors other biblical instances where miracles occur in the presence of a select few, such as Jesus raising Jairus' daughter (<a href="/mark/5-37.htm">Mark 5:37-40</a>), emphasizing the personal nature of God's work.<p><b>and prayed to the LORD</b><br>Prayer is central to Elisha's ministry, demonstrating reliance on God's power rather than his own. This act of prayer underscores the belief that miracles are acts of God, not man. It connects to <a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>, which speaks of the effective prayer of a righteous person. Elisha's prayer is a model of faith and dependence on God, foreshadowing Christ's own prayerful life and His reliance on the Father (<a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God, successor to Elijah, known for performing miracles and guiding the people of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shunammite_woman.htm">The Shunammite Woman</a></b><br>A hospitable woman who provided for Elisha and was blessed with a son through his prophecy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shunammite's_son.htm">The Shunammite's Son</a></b><br>The child miraculously given to the Shunammite woman, who later fell ill and died, prompting Elisha's intervention.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>A private space in the Shunammite woman's house where Elisha often stayed, and where the miracle of raising the boy took place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prayer.htm">Prayer</a></b><br>The act of communication with God, which Elisha engaged in before performing the miracle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_private_prayer.htm">The Power of Private Prayer</a></b><br>Elisha's decision to close the door and pray privately underscores the importance of intimate, focused communication with God.
