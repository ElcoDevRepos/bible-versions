The Assyrians would relocate populations to lands with similar agricultural and climatic conditions to ease the transition and maintain productivity. This tactic was part of their imperial strategy to control vast territories. The promise of a land "like your own" was meant to pacify the people and make the forced relocation seem less threatening.<p><b>a land of grain and new wine</b><br>Grain and new wine symbolize agricultural abundance and prosperity. In the ancient Near East, these were staples of the diet and indicators of a fertile land. The Assyrian envoy is attempting to persuade the people of Judah by promising them a land that will provide for their needs, echoing the descriptions of the Promised Land in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-8</a>.<p><b>a land of bread and vineyards</b><br>Bread and vineyards further emphasize the promise of sustenance and wealth. Vineyards were a sign of settled life and prosperity, as they required time and investment to cultivate. This promise is reminiscent of the blessings described in the covenant with Israel, where obedience would lead to a land flowing with milk and honey (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>).<p><b>a land of olive trees and honey</b><br>Olive trees were valuable for their oil, used in cooking, lighting, and religious rituals. Honey, often a symbol of sweetness and abundance, complements the image of a bountiful land. The Assyrian offer mimics the divine promises given to Israel, attempting to lure the people away from their trust in God.<p><b>so that you may live and not die</b><br>This phrase appeals to the basic human instinct for survival. The Assyrian envoy presents the offer as a choice between life and death, suggesting that surrender and relocation are the only means to avoid destruction. This echoes the covenantal blessings and curses found in <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>, where life and prosperity are set against death and adversity.<p><b>But do not listen to Hezekiah</b><br>The Assyrian envoy seeks to undermine King Hezekiah's leadership and faith in God. Hezekiah is portrayed as misleading the people, contrasting the Assyrian promise of life with the supposed folly of trusting in divine deliverance. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the struggle between faith in God and reliance on human power.<p><b>for he misleads you when he says, &#8216;The LORD will deliver us.&#8217;</b><br>This statement challenges the core of Judah's faith, questioning God's ability or willingness to save them. It is a direct attack on the covenant relationship between God and His people. The Assyrian envoy's words are reminiscent of the serpent's deception in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>, casting doubt on God's promises. In contrast, Hezekiah's faith and prayer in <a href="/2_kings/19-15.htm">2 Kings 19:15-19</a> demonstrate a reliance on God's power to deliver, ultimately leading to divine intervention and the Assyrian army's defeat.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to reform the religious practices of his people by removing idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/rabshakeh.htm">Rabshakeh</a></b><br>The Assyrian field commander who delivered a message from King Sennacherib of Assyria, attempting to persuade the people of Judah to surrender.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>A powerful empire during this time, known for its military strength and conquests, including the siege of Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, under threat from the Assyrian army during Hezekiah's reign.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib.htm">Sennacherib</a></b><br>The King of Assyria, who sought to expand his empire by conquering Judah and other territories.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_deliverance.htm">Trust in God's Deliverance</a></b><br>Hezekiah's faith in God serves as a model for trusting in divine deliverance rather than succumbing to fear or intimidation from worldly powers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_against_deception.htm">Discernment Against Deception</a></b><br>The Assyrian commander's message was designed to deceive and demoralize.

Probably he felt that, if he did, he would not be believed. The transplantations had been too numerous and too recent, the examples of Samaria, Damascus, Hamath, Ashdod, etc., were too notorious, for it to be worth his while to pretend that Judaea would have any other fate. He therefore set himself the task of persuading the Jews that transplantation had nothing about it displeasing or even disagreeable - that, in fact, they were to be envied rather than pitied for being about to experience it. The King of Assyria, in the goodness of his paternal breast, would select for them a land as nearly as possible "like their own land" - a land teeming with corn and wine and oil, full of rich arable tracts, of vineyards and of olive-grounds, which would yield them those fruits of the earth to which they were accustomed, in abundance. What security they had that these promises would be fulfilled, he did not attempt to show them; much less did he explain to them why, if they were to gain rather than lose, it was worth while transplanting them at all; how that transplanted nations lost all spirit and patriotism, sank into apathy, and gave no trouble to their masters. <span class="cmt_word">A land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey</span> (comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8, 9</a>, which has, no doubt, affected the language of the reporter, who gives the general tenor of Rabshakeh's speech, but could not have taken down or have remembered his exact words) <span class="cmt_word">that ye may live, and not die</span> - as you win if you follow Hezekiah's advice - <span class="cmt_word">and [therefore] hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, seeketh to persuade - <span class="cmt_word">you, saying, The Lord will deliver us</span> (see the comment on ver. 30). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/18-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">until</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5704.htm">Strong's 5704: </a> </span><span class="str2">As far as, even to, up to, until, while</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I come</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive construct &#124;
