The setting of a house indicates a private and intimate moment, contrasting with public anointings like that of Saul and David. This privacy underscores the urgency and secrecy of the mission, as Jehu was to overthrow the current king, Joram. The house may symbolize a place of divine encounter, similar to other biblical instances where God meets individuals in secluded settings.<p><b>where the young prophet poured the oil on his head</b><br>The act of pouring oil signifies anointing, a ritual used to consecrate someone for a specific divine purpose. Oil, often associated with the Holy Spirit, symbolizes empowerment and sanctification. The young prophet, possibly a student of Elisha, represents the continuation of prophetic authority. This anointing echoes the anointing of other kings, such as David, and signifies God's choice and blessing. The use of a young prophet highlights God's use of unexpected vessels to fulfill His plans.<p><b>and declared, &#8220;This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:</b><br>The declaration emphasizes the prophetic authority and divine origin of the message. The phrase "the LORD, the God of Israel" reaffirms God's covenant relationship with Israel and His sovereignty over the nation's affairs. This introduction is typical in prophetic announcements, ensuring that the message is not of human origin but from God Himself. It connects to the broader biblical narrative of God speaking through prophets to guide and correct His people.<p><b>&#8216;I anoint you king over the LORD&#8217;s people Israel.</b><br>The anointing of Jehu as king marks a significant turning point in Israel's history. It fulfills the prophecy given to Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>, where God commands Elijah to anoint Jehu as king. This act signifies divine intervention in the leadership of Israel, often seen when the current leadership has strayed from God's ways. The phrase "the LORD&#8217;s people" underscores the theocratic nature of Israel, where God is the ultimate ruler, and the king serves as His representative. This anointing prefigures the ultimate anointed one, Jesus Christ, who is the King of Kings and fulfills the role of the perfect leader over God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /

immediate response displays obedience. He neither questions the messenger nor delays. Throughout Scripture, those God chooses often respond promptly&#8212;think of Abraham in <a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a> or Isaiah in <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>. Quick obedience signals a heart ready for God&#8217;s direction and sets the stage for Jehu&#8217;s future zeal in carrying out divine judgment (<a href="/2_kings/10-16.htm">2 Kings 10:16</a>).<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; Prompt action validates the call.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s plans advance through willing servants (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and went into the house</b><p>Moving into a private setting underscores the sacredness of the moment. Elisha had instructed the young prophet to seek privacy (<a href="/2_kings/9-2.htm">2 Kings 9:2&#8211;3</a>), echoing earlier anointings done away from public glare, such as Samuel and David in <a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11&#8211;13</a>. God often works in hidden places before revealing His purposes publicly.<p>Reflection points:<p>&#8226; Divine appointments may begin in quiet corners before affecting nations.<p>&#8226; Obscurity can precede authority (<a href="/luke/1-80.htm">Luke 1:80</a> concerning John the Baptist).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where the young prophet poured the oil on his head</b><p>Oil represents the Holy Spirit&#8217;s empowerment (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-20.htm">Psalm 89:20</a>). By literally pouring oil, the prophet enacts a covenant sign: God Himself equips Jehu for the task ahead. This physical act assures Jehu&#8212;and all Israel&#8212;that his authority is not self-made but Spirit-enabled (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p>Notice:<p>&#8226; The prophet is unnamed, stressing that the power lies in God&#8217;s word, not in the messenger (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Abundant oil signifies abundant grace for a difficult mission&#8212;overthrowing the house of Ahab (<a href="/2_kings/9-7.htm">2 Kings 9:7&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and declared, &#8220;This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says&#8230;&#8221;</b><p>The declaration anchors Jehu&#8217;s commissioning in God&#8217;s unchanging covenant name, YHWH, the One who brought Israel out of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>). By repeating &#8220;the LORD, the God of Israel,&#8221; the prophet reminds Jehu that he will answer to the covenant-keeping God, not to popular opinion or political alliances (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18&#8211;20</a>).<p>Highlights:<p>&#8226; Authentic authority flows from God&#8217;s spoken word (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase guarantees that Jehu&#8217;s reign will be measured by faithfulness to Israel&#8217;s God, not by military success alone (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;I anoint you king over the LORD&#8217;s people Israel.&#8217;</b><p>The &#8220;I&#8221; is emphatic&#8212;God Himself is the true Anointer (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a> had promised this moment).

Jehu&#8217;s swift obedience, the private yet solemn setting, the symbolic oil, the authoritative declaration, and the clear commissioning all highlight God&#8217;s sovereign hand guiding Israel&#8217;s history. The verse reminds us that leaders rise by God&#8217;s appointment, receive His empowerment, and remain accountable to shepherd His people in righteousness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And he arose</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, Jehu arose.<p><span class= "bld">Into the house.</span>--The council of war was sitting in the court.<p><span class= "bld">I have anointed thee.</span>--The commission to Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm" title="And Jehu the son of Nimshi shall you anoint to be king over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shall you anoint to be prophet in your room.">1Kings 19:16</a>) was thus fulfilled by his successor.<p><span class= "bld">Over the people of the Lord.</span>--Israel being Jehovah's people, Jehovah was Israel's true king, and therefore it was within His sovereign right to appoint whom He would as His earthly representative. Reuss asserts that this account of the anointing of Jehu, like that of the anointing of Hazael (<a href="/2_kings/8-13.htm" title="And Hazael said, But what, is your servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD has showed me that you shall be king over Syria.">2Kings 8:13</a>), is substituted in the present narration for what another document related of <span class= "ital">Elijah</span>. This is pure conjecture. It is easier to suppose that Elijah had instructed his successor to carry out the commission intrusted to himself, although the narrative nowhere says so. He goes on to remark that there is no need to try to clear Elisha of the charge of being a revolutionary and a regicide, for that the new dynasty would make use of his name by way of legitimising itself, exactly as the houses of Kish and of Jesse made use of that of the prophet Samuel. This is being considerably wiser than our only authorities.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he (Jehu) arose, and went into the house.</span> Jehu left his seat, rose up, and led the way, from the court, where he had probably been sitting with the other generals, into the house which adjoined the court. The messenger followed; and the two were together, alone. <span class="cmt_word">And he</span> <span class="accented">- i.e.</span> the messenger - <span class="cmt_word">poured the oil on his head</span> - as directed (ver. 3) - <span class="cmt_word">and said unto him, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel</span>; literally, Thus <span class="accented">saith Jehovah</span>, <span class="accented">God of Israel</span>. Jehovah's name is emphatically put forward, in contrast with the name of Baal, as that of the true God of Israel; and appeal is made to Jehu, as to one whose God is Jehovah, and who will accept as authoritative a message emanating from him. I have anointed thee king over the people of the Lord, even over Israel; literally, <span class="accented">over the people of Jehovah</span>, <span class="accented">over Israel</span>. Practically, the people is, in the main, "the people of Baal" (<a href="/2_kings/10-19.htm">2 Kings 10:19-21</a>), but theoretically and by covenant it is "the people of Jehovah" - his "peculiar people" (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>), chosen by him out of all the nations of the earth to be his own. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/9-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Jehu got up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1433;&#1511;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;q&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
