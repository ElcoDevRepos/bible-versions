He was anointed by a prophet sent by Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/9.htm">2 Kings 9:1-3</a>) and is known for his zealous actions in eradicating the house of Ahab and the worship of Baal from Israel (<a href="/2_kings/10-18.htm">2 Kings 10:18-28</a>). Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom, served as the political and religious center during his reign. Jehu's actions fulfilled the prophecy given to Elijah concerning the destruction of Ahab's lineage (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-22</a>). His reign is a reminder of God's judgment against idolatry and unfaithfulness.<p><b>was twenty-eight years.</b><br>Jehu's reign lasted from approximately 841 to 814 BC. This duration is significant as it represents a period of relative stability following the tumultuous times of Ahab and his successors. Despite Jehu's initial zeal for the Lord, his reign is also marked by failure to fully turn Israel back to God, as he continued the worship of the golden calves set up by Jeroboam (<a href="/2_kings/10-29.htm">2 Kings 10:29-31</a>). This highlights the persistent struggle of Israel with idolatry and incomplete obedience to God's commands.

short by clinging to Jeroboam&#8217;s calf worship (<a href="/2_kings/10-29.htm">2 Kings 10:29&#8211;31</a>).<p>&#8226; His reign reminds us that a strong start must be matched by steady obedience (<a
