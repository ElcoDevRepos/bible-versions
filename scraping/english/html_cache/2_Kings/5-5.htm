This reflects the political dynamics between Aram (modern-day Syria) and Israel, often marked by conflict and uneasy alliances. The king's directive underscores the high regard in which Naaman is held, as well as the desperation to find a cure for his leprosy.<p><b>&#8220;and I will send you with a letter to the king of Israel.&#8221;</b><br>The letter signifies a formal diplomatic request, indicating the seriousness of Naaman's condition and the respect for the prophet Elisha's reputation in Israel. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of kings communicating through letters for political and personal matters. The king of Israel at this time is likely Jehoram, who would have been wary of Aram due to their history of hostilities.<p><b>So Naaman departed,</b><br>Naaman's departure marks the beginning of his journey of faith and healing. His willingness to seek help from a foreign prophet highlights his desperation and the limitations of his own resources and gods. This journey can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual seeking and humility.<p><b>taking with him ten talents of silver,</b><br>A talent was a large unit of weight, approximately 75 pounds or 34 kilograms. Ten talents of silver represent a significant amount of wealth, indicating the value placed on Naaman's healing. This wealth also reflects the common practice of offering gifts to prophets or healers, as seen in other biblical accounts.<p><b>six thousand shekels of gold,</b><br>A shekel was a unit of weight, roughly 11 grams or 0.4 ounces. Six thousand shekels of gold further emphasize the immense wealth Naaman carried, underscoring the seriousness of his condition and the high stakes involved. This wealth is a testament to Naaman's status and the resources of the Aramean kingdom.<p><b>and ten sets of clothing.</b><br>Clothing in the ancient Near East was a valuable commodity, often used as a form of currency or gift. The ten sets of clothing symbolize honor and respect, as well as the intention to secure favor.

Written communications seem to have led to the outbreak of the war by which the foreign dynasty of the Hyksos was driven out of Egypt, and the native supremacy reestablished ('History of Ancient Egypt,' vol. it. pp. 199, 200). Written engagements were certainly entered into between the Egyptian kings and the Hittites at a date earlier than the Exodus (ibid., pp. 291, 310).

Such sums are quite within the probable means of a rich Syrian nobleman of the time, a favorite at court, and the generalissimo of the Syrian army.
