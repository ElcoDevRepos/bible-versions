This letter was a continuation of the psychological warfare intended to intimidate and demoralize the people of Judah. Historically, Assyria was a dominant military power, and their threats were not to be taken lightly. The letter likely contained demands for surrender and reminders of Assyria's previous conquests, emphasizing the futility of resistance. This moment highlights the political and military pressures faced by Judah during this period.<p><b>read it</b><br>Hezekiah's act of reading the letter signifies his direct engagement with the crisis. Unlike some kings who might have relied solely on advisors, Hezekiah personally confronted the threat. This action reflects his responsibility as a leader and his willingness to face the reality of the situation. It also sets the stage for his subsequent actions, demonstrating his proactive approach to leadership and faith.<p><b>and went up to the house of the LORD</b><br>The house of the LORD refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites. Hezekiah's decision to go to the temple underscores his reliance on God in times of distress. The temple was not only a religious center but also a symbol of God's presence among His people. By going there, Hezekiah was seeking divine intervention and guidance, acknowledging that the battle was beyond human capability.<p><b>and spread it out before the LORD</b><br>Hezekiah's act of spreading the letter before the LORD is a powerful gesture of faith and submission. It symbolizes laying the problem directly at God's feet, trusting in His power and sovereignty. This act can be seen as a form of prayer, where Hezekiah presents his concerns openly to God. It reflects a deep trust in God's ability to handle the situation, reminiscent of other biblical figures who sought God's help in times of trouble. This action also prefigures the New Testament teaching of casting all anxieties on God, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to restore proper worship in the temple.

Faith is never blind; it engages mind and heart.<p>&#8226; Scripture commends leaders who attend to written matters (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-19</a>). Hezekiah models that diligence here.<p>&#8226; Reading the threat prepared him to pray specifically, the same way Nehemiah later responded after &#8220;hearing&#8221; of Jerusalem&#8217;s ruin (<a href="/nehemiah/1-3.htm">Nehemiah 1:3-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and went up to the house of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; He headed immediately to God&#8217;s appointed place of worship, echoing his earlier instinct when he &#8220;tore his clothes&#8221; and sought the LORD (<a href="/2_kings/19-1.htm">2 Kings 19:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The temple represented God&#8217;s covenant presence (<a href="/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>). By going there, Hezekiah acted on truth: &#8220;The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Turning to the house of the LORD rather than to Egypt or another ally fulfilled the prophetic call to rely on God alone (<a href="/isaiah/30-15.htm">Isaiah 30:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and spread it out before the LORD</b><p>&#8226; He literally unrolled the parchment, laying Sennacherib&#8217;s words where God&#8217;s glory dwelt.<p>&#8226; This gesture pictured casting the whole burden on the LORD (<a href="/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>).<p>&#8226; It also invited God&#8217;s verdict on the blasphemy, much as David once said, &#8220;Give ear to my words, O LORD&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/5-1.htm">Psalm 5:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The parallel account underscores the action: &#8220;Hezekiah spread it out before the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/37-14.htm">Isaiah 37:14</a>). Scripture treats the moment as a decisive act of faith, immediately followed by one of the greatest deliverances in Israel&#8217;s history (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35-37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Hezekiah handled crisis by taking every step toward God: receiving the threat honestly, reading it carefully, entering God&#8217;s presence deliberately, and laying the whole matter before the LORD.

Ewald rightly compares what Judas Maccabaeus did with the disfigured copies of the Law at Maspha (1 Macc. 3:48), but incorrectly calls it ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 183, note 1, Eng. trans.) "a laying down of the object <span class="accented">in the sanctuary</span>."
