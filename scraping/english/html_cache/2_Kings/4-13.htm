This reflects the common practice of prophets having attendants or disciples. Gehazi's role is significant as he acts as an intermediary, highlighting the hierarchical structure in prophetic ministry. This mirrors the relationship between Moses and Joshua or Paul and Timothy, where mentorship and delegation are key.<p><b>Now tell her</b><br>Elisha instructs Gehazi to communicate with the Shunammite woman, showing respect and gratitude for her hospitality. This reflects the cultural norms of the time, where direct communication between men and women, especially of different social standings, was often mediated. It also underscores the importance of gratitude and acknowledgment in relationships, a theme echoed in the New Testament with Jesus' interactions with those who served Him.<p><b>&#8216;Look, you have gone to all this trouble for us.</b><br>The Shunammite woman had provided a room and sustenance for Elisha, demonstrating the biblical principle of hospitality. This act of kindness is reminiscent of the hospitality shown to angels in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a> by Abraham and Sarah. It highlights the virtue of serving God's messengers, which is rewarded by God, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>.<p><b>What can we do for you?</b><br>Elisha's question reflects the biblical principle of reciprocity and blessing those who bless God's servants. This is akin to the promise given to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where those who bless God's people are blessed in return. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of giving and receiving, as seen in <a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a>.<p><b>Can we speak on your behalf to the king or the commander of the army?&#8217;</b><br>Elisha offers to use his influence to benefit the woman, indicating his respected position in Israel. This reflects the interconnectedness of spiritual and political spheres in ancient Israel, where prophets often advised kings, as seen with Nathan and David. It also shows the prophet's role as an intercessor, a type of Christ who intercedes on behalf of humanity.<p><b>&#8220;I have a home among my own people,&#8221; she replied.</b><br>The Shunammite woman's response indicates contentment and a sense of belonging within her community. This reflects the biblical value of contentment and the importance of community, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-12</a>.
