The messengers returning to Jehu indicate the fulfillment of a divine mission. Jehu's role as an instrument of God's judgment is emphasized, as he was chosen to eradicate the house of Ahab and bring justice for the bloodshed caused by Jezebel and Ahab.<p><b>who replied, &#8220;This is the word of the LORD</b><br>Jehu's response underscores the fulfillment of divine prophecy. The phrase highlights the authority and certainty of God's word, which is a recurring theme throughout the Bible. It reflects the belief that God's pronouncements are inevitable and will come to pass, reinforcing the idea of divine sovereignty and justice.<p><b>which He spoke through His servant Elijah the Tishbite</b><br>Elijah, a major prophet in Israel, was known for his confrontations with Ahab and Jezebel. This reference connects the current events to Elijah's earlier prophecy, demonstrating the continuity of God's plan. Elijah's role as a prophet who delivered God's messages to a rebellious Israel is central to understanding the unfolding of these events.<p><b>&#8216;On the plot of ground at Jezreel</b><br>Jezreel was a significant location in Israel's history, serving as a royal city and a site of many pivotal events. It was here that Naboth's vineyard was unjustly taken by Ahab and Jezebel, leading to Elijah's prophecy of judgment. The mention of Jezreel ties the prophecy to a specific place, emphasizing the historical and moral context of Jezebel's actions.<p><b>the dogs will devour the flesh of Jezebel.</b><br>This gruesome prophecy symbolizes the complete and utter disgrace that would befall Jezebel, a queen notorious for her idolatry and persecution of God's prophets. The imagery of dogs devouring her flesh signifies divine retribution and the ultimate humiliation of a once-powerful figure. It serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of defying God and highlights the theme of divine justice prevailing over human wickedness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>- The king of Israel who was anointed to execute judgment on the house of Ahab, fulfilling God's prophecy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jezebel.htm">Jezebel</a></b><br>- The wife of King Ahab, known for her idolatry and persecution of the prophets of Yahweh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah_the_tishbite.htm">Elijah the Tishbite</a></b><br>- A prophet of God who pronounced judgment on Jezebel and Ahab's house.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jezreel.htm">Jezreel</a></b><br>- The location where Jezebel met her demise, fulfilling Elijah's prophecy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/dogs.htm">Dogs</a></b><br>- Symbolic of divine judgment, as they consumed Jezebel's body, leaving no burial.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_god's_word.htm">The Certainty of God's Word</a></b><br>God's prophecies, as spoken through His prophets, are certain and will come to pass.

The detail reminds us that God&#8217;s word never fails, no matter how much time passes (cf. <a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and told Jehu</b><p>Jehu&#8212;newly anointed king (<a href="/2_kings/9-1.htm">2 Kings 9:1&#8211;7</a>)&#8212;hears the report. Throughout chapters 9&#8211;10 he acts as God&#8217;s instrument to cut off Ahab&#8217;s line (<a href="/2_kings/10-10.htm">2 Kings 10:10</a>). By promptly receiving the messengers, he demonstrates submission to the Lord&#8217;s revealed will rather than personal vengeance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who replied</b><p>Jehu&#8217;s immediate response shows spiritual discernment. Instead of shock or boasting, he interprets events through the lens of Scripture. A leader&#8217;s first words reveal the heart (<a href="/luke/6-45.htm">Luke 6:45</a>). Jehu&#8217;s heart is fixed on bringing God&#8217;s prophecy to completion (<a href="/2_kings/10-16.htm">2 Kings 10:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is the word of the LORD</b><p>Jehu anchors the explanation in divine authority. God&#8217;s pronouncements are certain (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). The phrase underscores the literal reliability of every syllable God utters (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). What just happened is not coincidence but covenant justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which He spoke through His servant Elijah the Tishbite</b><p>More than twenty years earlier Elijah confronted Ahab over Naboth&#8217;s stolen vineyard and declared this very judgment (<a href="/1_kings/21-17.htm">1 Kings 21:17&#8211;24</a>). Calling Elijah &#8220;His servant&#8221; highlights prophetic faithfulness and God&#8217;s prerogative to communicate through chosen messengers (<a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On the plot of ground at Jezreel</b><p>The location matters. Jezreel was where Ahab murdered Naboth (<a href="/1_kings/21-1.htm">1 Kings 21:1&#8211;16</a>) and where Jezebel adorned herself to mock Jehu (<a href="/2_kings/9-30.htm">2 Kings 9:30</a>). Divine justice strikes on the same soil where blood was shed, proving that geography cannot bury sin (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the dogs will devour the flesh of Jezebel</b><p>In ancient Israel, being eaten by dogs signified ultimate disgrace and covenant curse (<a href="/jeremiah/15-3.htm">Jeremiah 15:3</a>). God&#8217;s sentence strips Jezebel of royal burial, honor, and legacy; only fragments remain (<a href="/2_kings/9-35.htm">2 Kings 9:35</a>). The literal fulfillment confirms the severity of mocking God and persecuting His people (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/9-36.htm">2 Kings 9:36</a> shows that every detail of God&#8217;s word&#8212;speaker, site, and sentence&#8212;stands unbreakable. Jezebel&#8217;s fate validates Elijah&#8217;s prophecy, vindicates Naboth&#8217;s blood, and warns that no power can outrun divine judgment. The passage invites confidence in Scripture&#8217;s accuracy and calls believers to align with the Lord whose promises and warnings alike come to pass.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">This is the word of the Lord<span class= "ital">.</span></span>--See <a href="/1_kings/21-23.htm" title="And of Jezebel also spoke the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.">1Kings 21:23</a>, where this oracle of Elijah is given.<p><span class= "bld">Portion</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, domain, territory (<span class= "ital">h?leq</span>).
