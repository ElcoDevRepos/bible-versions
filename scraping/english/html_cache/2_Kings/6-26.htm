The king mentioned here is likely King Jehoram (also known as Joram), son of Ahab. The city was under siege by the Arameans, leading to severe famine. The wall signifies the city's defense, and the king's presence there indicates his concern for the city's security and morale. Historically, city walls were crucial for protection, and leaders often inspected them during sieges. This reflects the dire situation and the king's active involvement in the crisis.<p><b>a woman cried out to him</b><br>The woman's cry highlights the desperation and suffering of the people during the siege. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, women were often the most vulnerable during times of war and famine. Her cry is a poignant reminder of the human cost of conflict and the king's responsibility to his people. This moment echoes other biblical instances where individuals cry out to leaders or God in times of distress, such as the Israelites in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/2-23.htm">Exodus 2:23</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Help me, my lord the king!&#8221;</b><br>The plea for help underscores the king's role as a judge and protector of his people. In theocratic Israel, the king was seen as God's representative, responsible for justice and welfare. The woman's address, "my lord the king," shows respect and acknowledges his authority. This plea can be compared to other biblical cries for deliverance, such as the psalmist's appeals to God for help (<a href="/psalms/121.htm">Psalm 121:1-2</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance found in Jesus Christ, who is often called upon for help and salvation in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/matthew/15-25.htm">Matthew 15:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_israel.htm">The King of Israel</a></b><br>At this time, the king is likely Jehoram (also known as Joram), the son of Ahab.
