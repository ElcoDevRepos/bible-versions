This act of assembly is significant in ancient Israelite culture, where leaders often addressed the nation publicly to communicate important messages or decrees. The gathering likely took place in Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom, which was a central location for political and religious activities. This assembly sets the stage for Jehu's strategic plan to eliminate Baal worship from Israel, a continuation of his divinely appointed mission to eradicate the house of Ahab and cleanse the nation from idolatry.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Ahab served Baal a little,</b><br>Jehu references Ahab, the former king notorious for his promotion of Baal worship, largely influenced by his wife Jezebel. Ahab's reign marked a significant departure from the worship of Yahweh, as he established Baal as a central figure in Israel's religious life. The phrase "served Baal a little" is an ironic understatement, as Ahab's actions led to widespread idolatry and apostasy. This comparison sets the stage for Jehu's cunning plan, as he contrasts his own intentions with those of Ahab, suggesting a greater commitment to Baal worship to deceive the followers of Baal.<p><b>but Jehu will serve him a lot.&#8221;</b><br>Jehu's statement is a strategic deception. By claiming he will serve Baal more than Ahab, Jehu aims to gather all the prophets, priests, and worshippers of Baal in one place. This ruse is part of his plan to completely eradicate Baal worship from Israel, fulfilling the prophecy given to Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-17.htm">1 Kings 19:17</a>) and aligning with the commands in <a href="/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6-11</a> to purge idolatry from the land. Jehu's actions can be seen as a type of Christ in the sense that he acts as an agent of divine judgment, though his methods are violent and politically motivated. This phrase highlights the tension between Jehu's outward proclamation and his true intentions, reflecting the complex interplay of politics and religion in ancient Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was anointed by God to destroy the house of Ahab and eradicate Baal worship from Israel.

Jehu&#8217;s ruse sets the stage to fulfill that command in one decisive blow.<p>&#8226; The contrast between &#8220;little&#8221; and &#8220;much&#8221; magnifies the coming judgment: every worshiper of Baal will gather willingly, making the purge complete (<a href="/2_kings/10-25.htm">2 Kings 10:25-28</a>).<p>&#8226; Jehu&#8217;s use of deception is descriptive, not prescriptive; Scripture elsewhere warns against falsehood (<a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>). Yet in this historical moment, God allows his chosen instrument to outwit entrenched evil for a greater deliverance (<a href="/psalms/18-25.htm">Psalm 18:25-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jehu&#8217;s statement in <a href="/2_kings/10-18.htm">2 Kings 10:18</a> is a masterstroke of strategy. By publicly claiming greater devotion to Baal than Ahab ever showed, he lures every committed idolater into one place, enabling their swift and total destruction in obedience to God&#8217;s command. The verse highlights how decisive, courageous leadership can confront national sin, how God may turn human tactics toward His righteous ends, and how idolatry tolerated &#8220;a little&#8221; inevitably invites judgment &#8220;much.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.</span>--Ahab had, as the people well knew, served Baal more than a little; but the antithesis was not too strong for Jehu's hidden meaning.

Probably, as yet, no suspicion had touched the public mind that Jehu would be a less zealous worshipper of Baal than his predecessor. The outburst against Jezebel's "whoredoms" and "witchcrafts" (<a href="/2_kings/9-22.htm">2 Kings 9:22</a>) would be known to few, and might not have been understood as a condemnation of the entire Baalistic system. The "zeal for Jehovah" whispered in the ear of Jehonadab (ver. 16) had been hitherto kept secret. Thus there was nothing to prevent the multitude from giving implicit credence to the proclamation now made, and looking to see the new reign inaugurated by a magnificent and prolonged festival in honor of the two great Phoenician deities, Baal the sun-god, and Ashtoreth or Astarte the famous "Dea Syra" Such festivals were frequently held in Phoenicia and the rest of Syria, often lasting over many days, and constituting a time of excitement, feasting, and profligate enjoyment, which possessed immense attraction for the great mass of Asiatics. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/10-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Jehu</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1461;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3058.htm">Strong's 3058: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jehu -- 'the LORD is He', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">brought all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
