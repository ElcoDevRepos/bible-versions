In the context of ancient warfare, captured enemies were often killed or enslaved. The prophet Elisha's directive to spare the Aramean soldiers highlights a principle of compassion and forgiveness. This mirrors God's mercy towards humanity, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>, where Jesus instructs to love enemies and pray for persecutors.<p><b>&#8220;Would you kill those you have captured with your own sword or bow?&#8221;</b><br>Elisha challenges the king of Israel to consider the ethics of killing prisoners of war. This rhetorical question underscores the idea that these captives were not taken by the king's might but by divine intervention. It emphasizes reliance on God's power rather than human strength, similar to David's reliance on God against Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p><b>Set food and water before them,</b><br>Providing sustenance to enemies is an act of grace and hospitality, countercultural to the norms of retribution. This act prefigures the teachings of Jesus, who fed multitudes and taught about the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). It also reflects the biblical principle of overcoming evil with good (<a href="/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20-21</a>).<p><b>that they may eat and drink</b><br>The act of eating and drinking together in the ancient Near East was a sign of peace and covenant. By allowing the Arameans to eat and drink, Elisha initiates a gesture of reconciliation. This can be seen as a type of the Lord's Supper, where believers partake in communion as a sign of peace with God and each other (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-23.htm">1 Corinthians 11:23-26</a>).<p><b>and then return to their master.&#8221;</b><br>Releasing the captives to return to their master demonstrates trust in God's sovereignty and justice. It reflects the biblical theme of returning good for evil and trusting God to handle the outcomes. This act of sending them back unharmed could have served as a testimony to the Arameans of the power and mercy of Israel's God, similar to how God used Israel to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet in Israel, successor to Elijah, known for his miracles and guidance to the kings of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_israel.htm">The King of Israel</a></b><br>The unnamed king during Elisha's time, who sought Elisha's counsel regarding the captured Aramean soldiers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/aramean_soldiers.htm">Aramean Soldiers</a></b><br>The enemy troops who were supernaturally blinded and led into Samaria by Elisha.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, where the Aramean soldiers were brought.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_aramean_king.htm">The Aramean King</a></b><br>The ruler of Aram, who was at war with Israel and whose soldiers were captured.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/m/mercy_over_vengeance.htm">Mercy Over Vengeance</a></b><br>Elisha's response to the king of Israel emphasizes the importance of showing mercy rather than seeking revenge.

Killing them would break even the common wartime practice of sparing prisoners surrendered without resistance (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10-15</a>).<p>&#8226; The question exposes pride: if soldiers would hesitate to execute their own captives, how much more should they hesitate when the captives are clearly God&#8217;s? (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>; <a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law upholds justice yet warns against vengeance (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>). Elisha steers the king away from vengeance masked as justice.<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/28-9.htm">2 Chronicles 28:9-15</a> records another scene where captives are clothed, fed, and escorted home&#8212;demonstrating that God values compassion even in conflict.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Set food and water before them</b><p>&#8220;Set food and water before them&#8221;<p>&#8226; Instead of swords, Elisha prescribes a banquet. Kindness disarms more powerfully than violence (<a href="/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21-22</a>).<p>&#8226; Hospitality is not optional; it is a tangible expression of covenant faithfulness (<a href="/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1-8</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Meeting physical needs acknowledges that every person, even an enemy, bears God&#8217;s image (<a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus echoes this pattern: &#8220;I was hungry and you gave Me food, I was thirsty and you gave Me drink&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That they may eat and drink and then return to their master</b><p>&#8220;That they may eat and drink and then return to their master.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The goal is restoration, not annihilation. By sending the Arameans home alive and well, Israel testifies to God&#8217;s supremacy and mercy (<a href="/psalms/67-1.htm">Psalm 67:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20-21</a> draws on this very principle: overcome evil with good, trusting God to handle justice.<p>&#8226; The narrative&#8217;s next verse shows the result: &#8220;the Aramean raiders did not come again into the land of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/6-23.htm">2 Kings 6:23</a>). Mercy became a deterrent.<p>&#8226; When enemies experience unexpected grace, they glimpse the gospel pattern&#8212;God feeding and forgiving those who once opposed Him (<a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/6-22.htm">2 Kings 6:22</a> reveals God&#8217;s heart in wartime: restraint instead of revenge, kindness instead of killing. Elisha forbids execution, not out of weakness, but out of confidence that the LORD owns the victory and the captives. By feeding and freeing their foes, Israel mirrors divine mercy, overturns expected norms, and turns enemies into witnesses. The passage calls believers today to trust God&#8217;s sovereignty, reject vindictiveness, and practice radical goodness that points unmistakably to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Thou shalt not</span>.--Or, <span class= "ital">thou must not</span>.<p><span class= "bld">Wouldest thou smite . . . thy bow?</span>--The Hebrew order is, "An quos ceperis gladio et arcu percussuruses?" (Comp. <a href="/genesis/48-22.htm" title="Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.">Genesis 48:22</a>.) Elisha says, "These men are virtually prisoners of war, and therefore are not to be slain in cold blood."<p>The LXX., Targum, Syriac, and Vulg., ignore the interrogative particle. The Targum and Syriac render, "Lo those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword, &c., thou dost (or mayst) kill." (Comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/20-13.htm" title="And when the LORD your God has delivered it into your hands, you shall smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword:">Deuteronomy 20:13</a>.) The Vulg., "neque enim cepisti eos, ut percutias," and the Arabic, "Didst thou take them captive with thy sword, &c., that thou shouldest slay them?" come to the same thing. These renderings are interesting, as they make Elisha deny the king's right of disposal of these prisoners of Jehovah. The purpose of the miracle would have been frustrated by killing the Syrians. That purpose was to force their king and them to acknowledge the might of the true God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them.</span> The prophet has no doubt.
