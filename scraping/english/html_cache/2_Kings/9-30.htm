Jehu's arrival marks a pivotal moment in the fulfillment of God's judgment against the house of Ahab, as prophesied by Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-24</a>). Jehu, anointed as king by a prophet sent by Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/9.htm">2 Kings 9:1-13</a>), was tasked with eradicating the idolatrous influence of Ahab's lineage. Jezreel, being a royal city, was a strategic location for Jehu to assert his authority and begin his divinely appointed mission.<p><b>Jezebel heard of it</b><br>Jezebel, the wife of Ahab, was notorious for her promotion of Baal worship and persecution of the prophets of Yahweh (<a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4, 19</a>:1-2). Her hearing of Jehu's arrival signifies the impending confrontation between the forces of Yahweh and the remnants of Baal worship. Jezebel's awareness of Jehu's approach suggests her continued influence and control within the palace, despite the decline of her power.<p><b>So she painted her eyes, adorned her head</b><br>Jezebel's actions reflect the cultural practices of ancient Near Eastern royalty, where makeup and adornment were used to convey status and authority. Her painting of the eyes, likely with kohl, and adorning her head could be seen as an attempt to maintain her regal dignity and possibly seduce or intimidate Jehu. This act may also symbolize her defiance and unwillingness to submit to the judgment pronounced against her.<p><b>and looked down from a window</b><br>The window serves as a symbolic vantage point, representing Jezebel's elevated status and her attempt to maintain control over the situation.

Jezebel's position at the window foreshadows her downfall, as it becomes the place of her demise (<a href="/2_kings/9-33.htm">2 Kings 9:33</a>). Her looking down can also be interpreted as an act of pride and arrogance, traits that ultimately lead to her destruction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>Anointed by God through the prophet Elisha to become king of Israel, Jehu is tasked with eradicating the house of Ahab and the worship of Baal.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jezebel.htm">Jezebel</a></b><br>The wife of King Ahab, known for her idolatry and persecution of the prophets of Yahweh.

But it is certainly more natural to understand (with Keil and Josephus) that Jehu himself pursued. The pursuit to Ibleam, where Ahaziah was mortally wounded, and the return to Jezreel, need not have occupied more than about three hours. <span class="cmt_word">Jezebel heard of it.</span> She would naturally be the first to hear. On the death of her son, which must have been plainly seen from the walls of Jezreel, she become practically the chief authority in the place, and indeed in the kingdom. Jehoram's sons were probably minors. <span class="cmt_word">And she painted her face</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and she put her eyes in antimony</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> she adorned her eyes with the dark dye which has always been fashionable in the East, and which is still used at the present day. The dye is spread both on the upper and the lower eyelids. It at once increases the apparent size of the eye, and gives it unnatural brilliancy. The Oriental nations, Babylonians, Assyrians, Medes, Persians, were acquainted with the practice from very early times; and it is not surprising that it was known to Jezebel. What was her exact object in applying it is more doubtful. The older commentators, who are followed by Ewald, suppose that she intended to "summon up all her seductive fascinations in order to tempt and conquer Jehu;" but more recent writers (Bahr, Keil, and others) argue that her probable age renders this incredible, since she had already a grandson who was twenty-three years of age (<a href="/2_kings/8-26.htm">2 Kings 8:26</a>), and must therefore have been herself at least fifty. But, if we remember that Cleopatra was forty when She held Antony as her slave and hoped to captivate Augustus, it would seem to be not altogether beyond the bounds of possibility that a Phoouician princess of fifty may have thought that, by the use of art, she might reader herself a captivating personage. There is, at any rate no evidence that "putting the eyes in antimony" was an ordinary or a fitting preparation for meeting death in a way worthy of a queen. Ewald's view has, therefore much to commend it to our acceptance. Jezebel, trusting in the charms and the fascination which had been so potent over Ahab, may have imagined that she had still enough beauty left to capture Jehu, provided she increased her natural attractions by a careful use of all the resources of art. <span class="cmt_word">And tired her head.</span> Phoenician statues of goddesses have their hair arranged in long pendent curls, and bear on their heads a small conical cap with a ribbon wreathed round the base. The artists probably had queens and princesses as their models. There is no evidence that false hair was worn in Phoenicia, either by men or women. <span class="cmt_word">And looked out at a window.</span> Windows, sometimes open, sometimes latticed, were common in Oriental houses from the earliest times.
