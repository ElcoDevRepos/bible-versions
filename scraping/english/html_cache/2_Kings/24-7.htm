Historically, Egypt had been a dominant force, often exerting influence over the smaller kingdoms of the region, including Judah. The reference to the king of Egypt not marching out again suggests a cessation of Egyptian military campaigns, likely due to the rise of Babylonian power. This aligns with historical records of Pharaoh Necho II, who was defeated by Nebuchadnezzar at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC, leading to a decline in Egyptian influence.<p><b>because the king of Babylon had taken all his territory</b><br>The king of Babylon here refers to Nebuchadnezzar II, who was expanding the Babylonian Empire. His military campaigns were successful in capturing territories that were previously under Egyptian control. This expansion is a fulfillment of the prophetic warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah, who foretold the rise of Babylon as a dominant power (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>). The loss of territory by Egypt to Babylon marks a pivotal moment in the geopolitical landscape of the time.<p><b>from the Brook of Egypt to the Euphrates River</b><br>The "Brook of Egypt" is traditionally identified with the Wadi el-Arish, which served as a border between Egypt and Canaan. The Euphrates River, on the other hand, was a major boundary in the north. This phrase delineates the extent of Babylonian control, stretching from the southern border of Canaan to the northern reaches of Mesopotamia. This vast area of control underscores the might of the Babylonian Empire and fulfills the prophecies of territorial shifts as seen in <a href="/isaiah/39-6.htm">Isaiah 39:6-7</a>. The mention of these geographical markers highlights the comprehensive nature of Babylon's dominance, which would have significant implications for the nations within this region, including Judah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_egypt.htm">King of Egypt</a></b><br>Likely Pharaoh Necho II, who had previously been a significant power in the region but was now restricted due to Babylonian dominance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_babylon.htm">King of Babylon</a></b><br>Refers to Nebuchadnezzar II, who was expanding his empire and had taken control of territories previously under Egyptian influence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/brook_of_egypt.htm">Brook of Egypt</a></b><br>A geographical boundary often identified with the Wadi El-Arish, marking the southern border of Canaan.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/euphrates_river.htm">Euphrates River</a></b><br>A major river in the Middle East, representing the northern extent of the Babylonian Empire's influence at this time.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/territorial_conquest.htm">Territorial Conquest</a></b><br>The event of Babylon's expansion, which led to the diminishing influence of Egypt in the region.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>The shifting powers between Egypt and Babylon demonstrate God's control over world events.

Jeremiah warned that reliance on Egypt would prove futile (<a href="/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5-7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/20-5.htm">Isaiah 20:5-6</a>), and this verse records the moment that warning became historical fact.<p>&#8226; For Judah, the silence of Egyptian chariots meant no rescue from Babylonian pressure&#8212;precisely the judgment God had announced (<a href="/jeremiah/25-8.htm">Jeremiah 25:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because the king of Babylon had taken all his territory</b><p>&#8226; Nebuchadnezzar&#8217;s crushing victory at Carchemish (<a href="/jeremiah/46-2.htm">Jeremiah 46:2</a>) stripped Egypt of its Asiatic holdings.

What appears to be Babylonian ambition is, at a deeper level, God&#8217;s righteous judgment on nations&#8212;including Judah&#8212;for persistent sin.<p>&#8226; With Egypt neutralized, Judah loses a political ally, a source of hope, and an excuse for half-hearted repentance (<a href="/ezekiel/29-19.htm">Ezekiel 29:19-20</a> shows even Egypt itself later falling to Babylon).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the Brook of Egypt to the Euphrates River</b><p>&#8226; These borders trace the full length of the &#8220;International Coastal Highway,&#8221; the lifeline of commerce and conquest.
