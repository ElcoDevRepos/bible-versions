In biblical times, a cloak was often a significant garment, representing one's identity and role.

It signifies God's power over creation and His ability to make a way where there seems to be none. This miracle underscores the divine approval of Elijah's ministry.<p><b>so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground</b><br>Crossing on dry ground is a sign of divine intervention and protection. It recalls the Israelites' crossing of the Red Sea and the Jordan River, symbolizing deliverance and the fulfillment of God's promises.

It was intended that Israel should regard Elijah and Elisha as a second Moses and Joshua, and should therefore yield them a ready obedience. If miracles are impossible, <span class="accented">cadit quaestio</span>; exegesis of Scripture, and even reading of Scripture, may as well be put aside. But if they are possible, and have a place in the Divine economy, here was a worthy occasion for them. The powers of the world were arrayed against the cause of true religion and so against God; the cause was about to lose its great champion and assertor, Elijah; a weaker successor was about to take his place; - without some manifest display of supernatural might the cause of religion would evidently have lost ground, perhaps have been ruined altogether. It pleased God, therefore, just at this time, to grant that signs and wonders of an extraordinary character should be done by the hands of his servants Elijah and Elisha, that a halo of mystic glory should encircle them, for the better sustentation of his own cause against his adversaries, for the exaltation and glorification of his faithful ones, and for the confusion and dismay of those who were opposed to them.
