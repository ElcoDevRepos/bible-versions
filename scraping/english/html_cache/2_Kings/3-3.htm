Jeroboam's sins primarily involved the establishment of golden calves at Bethel and Dan (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>), which were intended to prevent the Israelites from worshiping in Jerusalem. This act of idolatry was a direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>) and set a precedent for future kings. The phrase "clung to the sins" indicates a stubborn adherence to these practices, despite the clear condemnation from prophets like Elijah and Elisha. This persistence in sin highlights the spiritual decline of Israel and serves as a warning against the dangers of idolatry and disobedience to God's commands.<p><b>he did not turn away from them.</b><br>Jehoram's failure to turn away from these sins demonstrates a lack of repentance and spiritual renewal. In the biblical narrative, turning away from sin is often associated with repentance and a return to covenant faithfulness (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>). The phrase underscores the importance of genuine repentance in the life of a believer, as seen in the calls to repentance throughout the prophetic books (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/55-7.htm">Isaiah 55:7</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30</a>). Jehoram's refusal to abandon the idolatrous practices of Jeroboam contrasts with the reforms of kings like Hezekiah and Josiah, who actively sought to restore true worship in Judah (<a href="/2_kings/18-3.htm">2 Kings 18:3-6</a>, <a href="/2_kings/23-25.htm">2 Kings 23:25</a>).

The maintenance of the calf-worship was, no doubt, viewed as a political necessity. If the two sanctuaries at Dan and Bethel had been shut up, the images broken, and the calf-worship brought to an end, there would, as a matter of course, have been a general flocking of the more religious among the people to the great sanctuary of Jehovah at Jerusalem; and this adoption of Jerusalem as a spiritual center would naturally have led on to its acceptance as the general political center of the whole Israelite people. Israel, as a separate kingdom, a distinct political entity, would have disappeared. Hence every Israelite monarch, even the Jehovistic Jehu, felt himself bound, by the political exigencies of his position, to keep up the calf-worship, and maintain the religious system of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/3-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Nevertheless,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1440;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(raq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7535.htm">Strong's 7535: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, even, except, howbeit howsoever, at the least, nevertheless</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he clung</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1425;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#234;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1692.htm">Strong's 1692: </a> </span><span class="str2">To impinge, cling, adhere, to catch by pursuit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the sins</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1496;&#1468;&#1465;&#1438;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;&#7717;a&#7789;&#183;&#7789;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
