The palace, a symbol of royal authority and wealth, represents the heart of Hezekiah's kingdom. Isaiah's inquiry suggests a probing into Hezekiah's actions and intentions. The palace, located in Jerusalem, was a center of political and spiritual significance. Isaiah's role as a prophet is to guide and correct, often serving as God's mouthpiece to the kings of Judah. This question implies a deeper concern about Hezekiah's openness to foreign powers, which could lead to political and spiritual compromise.<p><b>&#8220;They have seen everything in my palace,&#8221; answered Hezekiah.</b><br>Hezekiah's response indicates a lack of discernment in revealing the kingdom's wealth and resources. This openness to the Babylonians, a rising power, foreshadows future political entanglements and eventual exile. The phrase "everything in my palace" suggests a complete disclosure, which can be seen as a breach of wisdom and security. Historically, this act of showing treasures was often a diplomatic gesture, but it also exposed the kingdom's vulnerabilities. Hezekiah's pride and desire to impress the envoys may have clouded his judgment, reflecting a moment of human weakness.<p><b>&#8220;There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them.&#8221;</b><br>This statement underscores the totality of Hezekiah's disclosure. The "treasures" refer to the wealth accumulated in the kingdom, including gold, silver, and other valuable items. Biblically, treasures often symbolize God's blessings but also serve as a test of stewardship and faithfulness. Hezekiah's admission reveals a failure to protect what God had entrusted to him. This act of transparency to a foreign nation is a pivotal moment that sets the stage for future consequences, as prophesied by Isaiah. The treasures, while material, also represent the spiritual wealth and heritage of Judah, which should have been guarded with greater care.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God but also for his human weaknesses.

Although Isaiah knows the answer, he presses the king to examine his motives.<p>&#8226; God often brings a probing question to expose the heart, as He did with Adam (&#8220;Where are you?&#8221; &#8211; <a href="/genesis/3-9.htm">Genesis 3:9</a>) and Elijah (&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; &#8211; <a href="/1_kings/19-9.htm">1 Kings 19:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The palace represents not only Hezekiah&#8217;s residence but the center of Judah&#8217;s security and identity. Isaiah prompts the king to consider what outsiders now know of that security (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/32-31.htm">2 Chronicles 32:31</a>).<p>&#8226; What we reveal of our &#8220;palace&#8221; matters because &#8220;nothing in all creation is hidden from God&#8217;s sight&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>) and our actions will be weighed (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;They have seen everything in my palace,&#8221;</b><p>Hezekiah answers without hesitation, almost proudly (<a href="/2_kings/20-13.htm">2 Kings 20:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s transparency might appear hospitable, yet it signals misplaced confidence in earthly alliances (cf. <a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; His catalog of wealth mirrors the temptation to boast in human strength rather than the Lord (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>; <a href="/proverbs/29-23.htm">Proverbs 29:23</a>).<p>&#8226; By admitting the envoys saw &#8220;everything,&#8221; Hezekiah unwittingly testifies that Judah&#8217;s defenses and blessings are now cataloged by a future enemy (<a href="/isaiah/39-2.htm">Isaiah 39:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;There is nothing among my treasures that I did not show them.&#8221;</b><p>Hezekiah&#8217;s final statement underscores the total exposure of Judah&#8217;s riches.<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;treasures&#8221; recalls earlier divine provision (<a href="/2_chronicles/31-5.htm">2 Chronicles 31:5&#8211;12</a>). Instead of attributing them to God, Hezekiah flaunts them before pagans, echoing the folly of storing up earthly wealth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah will soon declare that these same treasures will be carried off to Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/20-16.htm">2 Kings 20:16-18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/39-6.htm">Isaiah 39:6</a>), a direct consequence of the king&#8217;s pride (<a href="/2_chronicles/32-25.htm">2 Chronicles 32:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly warns that revealing sacred trust to the world invites loss (<a href="/judges/16-17.htm">Judges 16:17-21</a>; <a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Isaiah&#8217;s question uncovered Hezekiah&#8217;s prideful display of God-given wealth. By showing &#8220;everything,&#8221; the king placed confidence in his possessions and potential allies rather than in the Lord. The incident reminds believers that what we reveal of our resources and hearts must honor God, for unsanctified pride invites discipline and loss.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said, What have they seen in thine house?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> What hast thou shewed them?
