It was the site of Elijah's famous confrontation with the prophets of Baal (<a href="/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19-40</a>), where God demonstrated His power through fire from heaven. Elisha, as Elijah's successor, visiting Mount Carmel symbolizes the continuation of Elijah's prophetic ministry. This location is often associated with divine encounters and spiritual victories, reinforcing Elisha's role as a prophet of God. The journey to Mount Carmel also signifies a transition in Elisha's ministry, as he steps into the role previously held by Elijah.<p><b>and from there he returned to Samaria</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, established by King Omri (<a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>). It served as a political and religious center, often associated with idolatry and apostasy due to the influence of kings like Ahab and Jezebel. Elisha's return to Samaria indicates his commitment to ministering in the heart of Israel's political power, despite its spiritual corruption. This move highlights Elisha's role as a prophet who confronts and challenges the prevailing idolatry, much like his predecessor Elijah. His presence in Samaria underscores the prophetic mission to call the people back to faithfulness to Yahweh, serving as a type of Christ who also ministered amidst opposition and called for repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God who succeeded Elijah.

The journey is literal, covering roughly 25 miles northwest from Jericho.<p>&#8226; Mount Carmel is the very ridge where Elijah confronted Baal&#8217;s prophets (<a href="/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19&#8211;40</a>); by going there, Elisha honors the heritage he has just inherited (<a href="/2_kings/2-9.htm">2 Kings 2:9&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; Carmel&#8217;s height offers a commanding view of the northern kingdom, making it an ideal place for a prophet to intercede and receive direction (cf. <a href="/amos/9-3.htm">Amos 9:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Later, Elisha will meet the Shunammite woman on this same mountain (<a href="/2_kings/4-25.htm">2 Kings 4:25</a>), so this visit likely establishes Carmel as a recurring base for ministry.<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the move signals that the LORD&#8217;s covenant presence, once associated mainly with Jerusalem, is still actively pursuing Israel even in its rebellious north (<a href="/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and from there he returned to Samaria</b><p>&#8226; Samaria is the political capital of the northern kingdom (<a href="/1_kings/16-24.htm">1 Kings 16:24</a>), about 15 miles southeast of Carmel. Elisha&#8217;s return shows his commitment to bring God&#8217;s word directly to the throne (<a href="/2_kings/3-13.htm">2 Kings 3:13&#8211;14</a>; 6:32).<p>&#8226; By alternating between secluded Carmel and bustling Samaria, the prophet models a healthy rhythm: seeking God privately, then engaging culture publicly (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35, 38</a>).<p>&#8226; His presence in Samaria fulfills Elijah&#8217;s earlier mandate to anoint and guide Kings (<a href="/1_kings/19-15.htm">1 Kings 19:15&#8211;16</a>), demonstrating the LORD&#8217;s ongoing patience with wayward leaders (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical results soon follow: miraculous provision during famine (<a href="/2_kings/6-24.htm">2 Kings 6:24&#8211;7</a>:20) and counsel that spares Israel from Aramean traps (<a href="/2_kings/6-8.htm">2 Kings 6:8&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/2-25.htm">2 Kings 2:25</a> records a simple itinerary that carries rich meaning. Elisha&#8217;s stop at Mount Carmel ties him to Elijah&#8217;s legacy and underscores a life anchored in worship and revelation. His return to Samaria places that revelation at the heart of national life, offering grace and truth to leaders and people alike. The verse invites us to follow the same pattern&#8212;retreat with God, then advance in faithful service&#8212;confident that the LORD still moves through those who heed His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">To mount Carmel.</span>--To cultivate the memory of his master in solitude. Elijah had often lived there (comp. 1 Kings 18), as its caves were well fitted for solitude and concealment. Elisha may have retired thither to prepare himself for his public ministry by prayer and fasting. (Comp. <a href="/matthew/4-1.htm" title="Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.">Matthew 4:1</a>, <span class= "ital">seq</span>.)<p><span class= "bld">To Samaria.</span>--Where he had his permanent abode. (Comp. <a href="/2_kings/6-32.htm" title="But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See you how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?">2Kings 6:32</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he went from thence to Mount Carmel.</span> Ewald thinks that Carmel was, on the whole, the main residence of Elijah, and "through him became a special prophetic locality" ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 68). If so, we may account for Elisha's visiting it on this occasion by his desire to communicate the facts of Elijah's removal from earth to those who had been his intimates in that quarter. <span class="cmt_word">And from thence he returned to Samaria.</span> Elisha does not imitate the wild, half-savage life and almost constant seclusion of his master. He "prefers from the first the companionship of men," fixes his home in the capital of his country, Samaria (<a href="/2_kings/5-9.htm">2 Kings 5:9</a>; <a href="/2_kings/6-32.htm">2 Kings 6:32</a>); is a friendly counselor of the king (<a href="/2_kings/6-9.htm">2 Kings 6:9</a>), and highly honored by him (<a href="/2_kings/8-4.htm">2 Kings 8:4</a>); his whole life, indeed, is, compared with that of Elijah, one of ease and tranquility. But, though living "in the world," he is not "of the world." As Ewald says, "In spite of all the seductions to which he was abundantly exposed through the great consideration in which he was held, he retained at every period of his life the true prophetic simplicity and purity, and contempt for worldly wealth and advantages" ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 83). He is thus, far more than Elijah, a pattern for Christian ministers, especially for such as are highly placed, who will do well to follow his example. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/2-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Elisha went</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1445;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
