The siege was a fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/21-4.htm">Jeremiah 21:4-7</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/24.htm">Ezekiel 24:1-2</a>). The Babylonians, led by King Nebuchadnezzar, surrounded Jerusalem, cutting off supplies and weakening the city's defenses. This tactic was common in ancient warfare, intended to force a surrender through starvation and deprivation. Archaeological evidence, such as the Babylonian Chronicles, corroborates the historical accuracy of this event.<p><b>until King Zedekiah&#8217;s eleventh year.</b><br>The siege lasted approximately two and a half years, ending in the eleventh year of Zedekiah's reign. Zedekiah was the last king of Judah, and his reign marked the end of the Davidic line of kings until the coming of Jesus Christ, who is seen as the fulfillment of the Davidic covenant (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). The eleventh year signifies the culmination of Judah's disobedience and the beginning of the Babylonian exile, a pivotal moment in Jewish history. This period of exile was prophesied by Jeremiah to last seventy years (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>), emphasizing God's sovereignty and faithfulness to His word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_zedekiah.htm">King Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned from 597 to 586 BC.

Its walls, temples, and streets were meant to testify to the Lord&#8217;s presence (<a href="/psalms/48-1.htm">Psalm 48:1-2</a>). Yet the very mention of &#8220;the city&#8221; here carries a tragic undertone: the people had spurned repeated prophetic warnings (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a>). The lament of <a href="/lamentations/1-1.htm">Lamentations 1:1</a>, &#8220;How lonely lies the city, once full of people!&#8221;, echoes what was unfolding. By highlighting &#8220;the city,&#8221; the writer reminds us that no place, however holy, is immune to judgment when covenant faithfulness is abandoned.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>was kept under siege</b><p>The Babylonian army encircled Jerusalem, cutting off food, water, and hope. <a href="/jeremiah/39-1.htm">Jeremiah 39:1</a> recounts the same moment: &#8220;In the ninth year of Zedekiah&#8230; Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and laid siege to it&#8221;.

God had already told Zedekiah through Jeremiah, &#8220;You will not escape&#8230; you will surely be captured&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3</a>). Instead of repenting, the king resisted, sealing both his fate and the city&#8217;s. Ezekiel was shown this very date in exile (<a href="/ezekiel/24-1.htm">Ezekiel 24:1-2</a>), reminding the exiles&#8212;and us&#8212;that God&#8217;s word never fails.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/25-2.htm">2 Kings 25:2</a> captures more than a military standoff; it spotlights the severe but just consequence of covenant rebellion.

The verse calls every reader to honor God&#8217;s Word, trust His warnings, and recognize that He alone holds authority over cities, kings, and time itself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Unto the eleventh year.</span>--The siege lasted altogether one year, five months, and twenty-seven days (<a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about.">2Kings 25:1</a> compared with <a href="/2_kings/25-8.htm" title="And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem:">2Kings 25:8</a>).

The writer omits all the details of the siege, and hastens to the final catastrophe. From Jeremiah and Ezekiel we learn that, after the siege had continued a certain time, the Egyptian monarch, Hophra or Apries, made an effort to carry out the terms of his agreement with Zedekiah, and marched an army into Southern Judaea, with the view of raising the siege (<a href="/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a>). Nebuchadnezzar hastened to meet him. With the whole or the greater part of his host he marched southward and offered battle to the Egyptians. Whether an engagement took place or not is uncertain. Josephus affirms it, and says that Apries was "defeated and driven out of Syria" ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:7. &sect; 3). The silence of Jeremiah is thought to throw doubt on his assertion. At any rate, the Egyptians retired (<a href="/jeremiah/37-7.htm">Jeremiah 37:7</a>) and took no further part in the struggle. The Babylonians returned, and the siege recommenced. A complete blockade was established, and the defenders of the city soon began to suffer from famine (<a href="/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7, 9</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-12.htm">Lamentations 2:12, 20</a>). Ere long, as so often happens in sieges, famine was followed by pestilence (<a href="/jeremiah/21-6.htm">Jeremiah 21:6, 7</a>; Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' <span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.), and after a time the place was reduced to the last extremity (<a href="/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3-9</a>). Bread was no longer to be had, and mothers devoured their children (<a href="/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a>). At length a breach was effected in the defenses; the enemy poured in; and the city fell (see the comment on ver. 4). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/25-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the city</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#238;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
