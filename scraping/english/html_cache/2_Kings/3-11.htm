This inquiry highlights the importance of prophetic counsel in ancient Israel, where prophets served as intermediaries between God and the people. Jehoshaphat's question underscores his reliance on God's direction, contrasting with the often idolatrous practices of the northern kingdom of Israel. This moment also reflects the biblical principle of seeking God's will in times of uncertainty, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_kings/22-5.htm">1 Kings 22:5</a>.<p><b>Let us inquire of the LORD through him.&#8221;</b><br>Jehoshaphat's desire to inquire of the LORD indicates a recognition of the need for divine wisdom and guidance. This practice of seeking God's counsel through a prophet was common in Israel's history, as prophets were seen as God's mouthpieces. The phrase suggests a formal process of consultation, emphasizing the role of prophets in conveying God's will. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative where leaders like David and Hezekiah sought prophetic insight (<a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>, <a href="/2_kings/19.htm">2 Kings 19:1-7</a>).<p><b>And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered,</b><br>The mention of a servant of the king of Israel highlights the presence of Elisha in the region, despite the spiritual decline in the northern kingdom. This servant's knowledge of Elisha suggests that the prophet's reputation was well-known, even among those serving a king who often strayed from the LORD. This reflects the enduring influence of God's prophets, regardless of the prevailing political or spiritual climate.<p><b>&#8220;Elisha son of Shaphat is here.</b><br>Elisha, the successor of Elijah, is introduced as the son of Shaphat, grounding him in a specific lineage and community. His presence signifies continuity in the prophetic ministry, as Elisha carried on Elijah's work. Elisha's ministry is marked by numerous miracles and acts of guidance, paralleling the works of Jesus Christ in the New Testament. His role as a prophet during a tumultuous period in Israel's history underscores God's ongoing involvement with His people.<p><b>He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates Elisha's previous role as a servant to Elijah, symbolizing his humility and preparation for prophetic ministry. Pouring water on Elijah's hands was a menial task, yet it signifies Elisha's dedication and readiness to serve. This act of service is reminiscent of Jesus' teaching on servanthood in <a href="/matthew/20-26.htm">Matthew 20:26-28</a>, where greatness is equated with serving others. Elisha's faithful service to Elijah prepared him for his own prophetic mission, illustrating the biblical principle that faithfulness in small tasks leads to greater responsibilities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoshaphat.htm">Jehoshaphat</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his desire to seek divine guidance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of the LORD, successor to Elijah, known for his powerful ministry and miracles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>A major prophet in Israel, known for his confrontation with the prophets of Baal and his mentorship of Elisha.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_israel.htm">The King of Israel</a></b><br>At this time, Jehoram, son of Ahab, who was not fully devoted to the LORD.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_officer.htm">The Officer</a></b><br>A servant or official in the king of Israel's court who recognizes Elisha's presence and his connection to Elijah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/seeking_godly_counsel.htm">Seeking Godly Counsel</a></b><br>Jehoshaphat's inquiry for a prophet emphasizes the importance of seeking divine guidance in decision-making.

His instinct reveals:<p>&#8226; A settled habit of seeking divine counsel (<a href="/2_chronicles/17-3.htm">2 Chronicles 17:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; A conviction that victory and wisdom rest on God&#8217;s revealed word (<a href="/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; A contrast with Israel&#8217;s king, Joram, who tolerated idolatry (<a href="/2_kings/3-2.htm">2 Kings 3:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let us inquire of the LORD through him.</b><p>Jehoshaphat&#8217;s solution is specific: find a living spokesman of the Lord rather than rely on human strategy. Throughout Scripture, God&#8217;s people look to a prophet for direction (<a href="/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/42-2.htm">Jeremiah 42:2-3</a>). The request underscores:<p>&#8226; Submission to God&#8217;s authority&#8212;the king places himself under the word.<p>&#8226; Confidence that God still speaks with clarity (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Expectation of practical guidance, not mere ritual (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered,</b><p>Unexpectedly, guidance comes via a nameless servant. God often works through overlooked voices (<a href="/2_kings/5-2.htm">2 Kings 5:2-3</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>). This moment highlights:<p>&#8226; No rank is too low for God&#8217;s purposes.<p>&#8226; Humble attentiveness can pivot nations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Elisha son of Shaphat is here.&#8221;</b><p>The servant identifies the proven successor of Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>; <a href="/2_kings/2-15.htm">2 Kings 2:15</a>). Mentioning his name signals:<p>&#8226; Continuity of prophetic authority&#8212;Elisha carries Elijah&#8217;s mantle and Spirit (<a href="/2_kings/2-9.htm">2 Kings 2:9-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Accessibility&#8212;God has already positioned His messenger near the coalition army.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah.</b><p>This phrase recalls Elisha&#8217;s former task of washing Elijah&#8217;s hands after meals&#8212;a modest servant role (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>). It testifies that:<p>&#8226; Faithfulness in small tasks precedes greater responsibility (<a href="/mark/10-43.htm">Mark 10:43-44</a>).<p>&#8226; Servanthearted leadership mirrors Christ, who washed His disciples&#8217; feet (<a href="/john/13-3.htm">John 13:3-17</a>).<p>&#8226; True authority is validated by proven humility and apprenticeship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/3-11.htm">2 Kings 3:11</a> portrays a decisive turn from human schemes to God&#8217;s sure word. Jehoshaphat&#8217;s request, the servant&#8217;s alert witness, and Elisha&#8217;s humble credentials together show that God provides guidance through trusted, tested servants. Submitting to that guidance brings wisdom, unity, and the assurance that the Lord Himself directs the course of events.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">But</span> (<span class= "ital">and</span>) <span class= "bld">Jehoshaphat . . . by him?</span>--The same question is asked by Jehoshaphat in <a href="/1_kings/22-7.htm" title="And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might inquire of him?">1Kings 22:7</a>.<p><span class= "bld">By him.</span>--Heb., <span class= "ital">from with him</span> (<span class= "ital">m?'otho for m?'itto</span>, both here and in the parallel place--a mark of the same hand).
