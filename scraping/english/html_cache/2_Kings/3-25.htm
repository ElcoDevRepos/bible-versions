In the context of <a href="/2_kings/3.htm">2 Kings 3</a>, the coalition of Israel, Judah, and Edom was waging war against Moab. The destruction signifies a comprehensive victory over the Moabite cities, fulfilling the prophecy of Elisha that the Lord would deliver Moab into their hands (<a href="/2_kings/3-18.htm">2 Kings 3:18</a>).<p><b>and each man threw stones on every good field until it was covered</b><br>This act of covering fields with stones was a deliberate strategy to render the land unusable for agriculture, effectively crippling the Moabite economy. This tactic is reminiscent of the curse of barrenness found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23</a>, where disobedience to God would result in the land being unproductive. It also reflects the thoroughness of the Israelites' campaign against Moab.<p><b>They stopped up every spring</b><br>Blocking springs would deprive the Moabites of essential water sources, further debilitating their ability to sustain life and agriculture. Water was a precious resource in the arid regions of the Near East, and controlling it was a significant advantage in warfare. This action underscores the severity of the judgment against Moab.<p><b>and cut down every good tree</b><br>Cutting down trees was another method of ensuring long-term devastation, as trees were vital for food, shade, and building materials. This act can be seen as a fulfillment of the curse against the land, similar to the destruction of the fig tree by Jesus in <a href="/mark/11-12.htm">Mark 11:12-14</a>, symbolizing judgment and the removal of blessings.<p><b>Only Kir-haraseth was left with stones in place</b><br>Kir-haraseth, also known as Kir-hareseth or Kir of Moab, was a fortified city and the capital of Moab. Its mention here indicates its strategic importance and the difficulty in capturing it. The city is referenced in <a href="/isaiah/16-7.htm">Isaiah 16:7</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/48-31.htm">Jeremiah 48:31, 36</a>, highlighting its significance in Moabite history and prophecy.<p><b>but men with slings surrounded it and attacked it as well</b><br>The use of slings in ancient warfare was common, as they were effective weapons for both offense and defense. The surrounding of Kir-haraseth by slingers indicates a siege, a typical military strategy to cut off supplies and force surrender.

There he was obliged to leave the stones untouched. Kir-haraseth, which is not mentioned among the early Moabite towns, nor even upon the Moabite Stone, and which is therefore thought to have been a newly constructed fortress (Ewald), was, in the later times, one of the most important of the strongholds of Moab (see <a href="/isaiah/15-1.htm">Isaiah 15:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/16-7.htm">Isaiah 16:7, 11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/48-36.htm">Jeremiah 48:36</a>). It was sometimes called Kir-Moab, "the fortress of Moab." At what time it got the name of Kerak is uncertain; but we find it spoken of as Kerak-Moab by Ptolemy (about A.D. ), and by Stephen of Byzantium (about A.D. ). It was a place of much importance in the time of the Crusades. The situation is one of great strength. The fortress is built upon the top of a steep hill, surrounded on all sides by a deep arid narrow valley, which again is completely enclosed by mountains, rising higher than the fort itself. It is undoubtedly one of the strongest positions within the territory anciently possessed by the Moabites. <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it.</span> Ewald thinks that by "<span class="accented">slingers"</span> are meant, not mere ordinary slingers, but persons who worked more elaborate engines, as catapults and the like ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 89, note, Eng. trans.). He is undoubtedly correct in saying that "all sorts of elaborate modes of attacking fortifications were very early known in Asia;" but it is very questionable whether the Hebrew word used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) can mean anything but "slingers" in the usual sense.

The situation is one which would allow of "slingers," in the ordinary sense, sending their missiles into the place, and grievously harassing it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/3-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They destroyed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1512;&#1465;&#1441;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;ha&#774;&#183;r&#333;&#183;s&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2040.htm">Strong's 2040: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pull down, in pieces, break, & destroy</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the cities,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1462;&#1506;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;he&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
