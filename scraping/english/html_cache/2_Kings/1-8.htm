It may also refer to a garment made of hair, such as camel's hair, which was typical of prophets (cf. <a href="/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4</a>). This attire symbolized a life of austerity and separation from worldly comforts, aligning with the prophetic call to live a life dedicated to God. Elijah's appearance is reminiscent of John the Baptist, who also wore camel's hair and lived in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>), drawing a parallel between the two as forerunners of God's message.<p><b>they answered,</b><br>The response comes from the messengers sent by King Ahaziah. Their recognition of Elijah based on his distinctive appearance suggests that Elijah was a well-known figure in Israel. His reputation as a prophet of Yahweh and his previous confrontations with the monarchy, particularly with King Ahab and Queen Jezebel, would have made him a prominent and recognizable figure.<p><b>with a leather belt around his waist.</b><br>The leather belt is another distinctive feature of Elijah's attire. In ancient times, a leather belt was practical for securing garments and carrying tools or weapons. It signifies readiness and preparedness, qualities essential for a prophet who must be ready to deliver God's message at any moment. This detail also connects Elijah to John the Baptist, who wore a similar belt, emphasizing their roles as prophets calling for repentance and heralding significant divine intervention (<a href="/mark/1-6.htm">Mark 1:6</a>).<p><b>It was Elijah the Tishbite,</b><br>Elijah is identified as "the Tishbite," indicating his origin from Tishbe in Gilead. This region was known for its rugged terrain and isolation, which may have contributed to Elijah's austere lifestyle and prophetic ministry. Elijah's identity as a Tishbite underscores his outsider status, as he often stood in opposition to the Israelite monarchy and the prevailing idolatry. His role as a prophet was to call Israel back to covenant faithfulness, often through dramatic and miraculous acts (1 Kings 17-19).<p><b>said the king.</b><br>The king in question is Ahaziah, son of Ahab and Jezebel, who continued his parents' legacy of idolatry and opposition to Yahweh. Ahaziah's recognition of Elijah indicates the prophet's significant influence and the fear he instilled in the royal house due to his previous confrontations and the power of his prophetic word. Elijah's presence and message were a direct challenge to the king's authority and the nation's apostasy, highlighting the ongoing conflict between the worship of Yahweh and the Baal worship promoted by the royal family.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah_the_tishbite.htm">Elijah the Tishbite</a></b><br>A prophet of God known for his boldness and miraculous acts.

(<a href="/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>), echoed this look: &#8220;John himself wore a garment of camel&#8217;s hair&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>).<p>&#8226; A life that refused luxury matched Elijah&#8217;s call for single-hearted devotion to God (cf. <a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they answered</b><p>&#8226; The messengers had just met Elijah on the road (<a href="/2_kings/1-3.htm">2 Kings 1:3&#8211;4</a>) and faithfully reported what they saw.<p>&#8226; Their simple reply underscores how unmistakable Elijah&#8217;s appearance was&#8212;no confusion, no debate, just the facts.<p>&#8226; Honest testimony remains God&#8217;s pattern: &#8220;A truthful witness saves lives&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/14-25.htm">Proverbs 14:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with a leather belt around his waist</b><p>&#8226; A leather belt was practical, keeping a loose outer garment cinched for travel or rapid movement (<a href="/exodus/12-11.htm">Exodus 12:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The belt highlighted poverty over pageantry; prophets preached repentance best when unentangled with comforts (<a href="/jeremiah/13-1.htm">Jeremiah 13:1-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Again John the Baptist mirrored it: &#8220;with a leather belt around his waist&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>), which prepared hearts for Christ just as Elijah prepared Israel for covenant faithfulness (<a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; In <a href="/ephesians/6-14.htm">Ephesians 6:14</a> the &#8220;belt of truth&#8221;

The name &#8220;Tishbite&#8221; ties him to a real town (Tishbe in Gilead), grounding the account in geography, not legend.<p>&#8226; God often lets a prophet&#8217;s reputation precede him, so the message can cut straight to the heart (cf. <a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a> when Peter preached).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>said the king</b><p>&#8226; Recognition did not lead Ahaziah to repentance (<a href="/2_kings/1-9.htm">2 Kings 1:9-17</a>) but to hostility&#8212;he sent soldiers to seize Elijah.<p>&#8226; This response mirrors his father Ahab&#8217;s: &#8220;Is that you, O troubler of Israel?&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/18-17.htm">1 Kings 18:17</a>).

Ahaziah&#8217;s throne was under the same sovereign scrutiny.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Elijah&#8217;s hairy cloak and leather belt were literal, visible markers of a prophet who lived simply and spoke boldly. The king&#8217;s servants saw the look, the king knew the man, and heaven&#8217;s authority stood unquestioned. God still uses plain-spoken, truth-clad witnesses to confront wayward hearts and call them back to Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Answered.</span>--Said unto.<p><span class= "bld">An hairy man.</span>--Literally, a lord of hair. This might refer to length of hair and beard (so LXX., <span class= "greekheb">?????</span>, "hirsute," "shaggy"); or to a hairy cloak or mantle. The second alternative is right, because a hairy mantle was a mark of the prophetic office from Elijah downwards. (Comp. <a href="/zechariah/13-4.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he has prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:">Zechariah 13:4</a>, "a rough garment;" and <a href="/matthew/3-4.htm" title="And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a leather girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.">Matthew 3:4</a>, where it is said of John Baptist--the second Elias--that "he was clad in camel's hair," and had "a leather girdle about his loins.") The girdle, as Thenius remarks, would not be mentioned alone. The common dress of the Bedawis is a sheep or goat's skin with the hair left on.<p><span class= "bld">Girt with a girdle of leather.</span>--Such as only the poorest would wear. The girdle was ordinarily of linen or cotton, and often costly. The prophet's dress was a sign of contempt for earthly display, and of sorrow for the national sins and their consequences, which it was his function to proclaim. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/20-2.htm" title="At the same time spoke the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off your loins, and put off your shoe from your foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot.">Isaiah 20:2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A hairy man</span>; literally, a <span class="accented">lord</span> <span class="accented">of hair</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>). Some take the meaning to be that he was rough and unkempt, with his hair and beard long; and so the LXX., who give <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>. But the more usual explanation is that he wore a shaggy coat of untanned skin, with the hair outward. Such a garment seems certainly to have been worn by the later prophets (<a href="/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4</a>; <a href="/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>), and to have been regarded as a sign of their profession. But there is no positive evidence that the dress had been adopted by Isaiah's time. <span class="cmt_word">Girt with a girdle of leather.</span> Generally the Israelites wore girdles of a soft material, as linen or cotton. The "curious girdle" of the high priest's ephod was of "fine twined linen," embroidered with gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet (<a href="/exodus/28-8.htm">Exodus 28:8</a>). Girdles of leather, rough and uncomfortable, would only be worn by the very poor and by the ascetic. Elijah may have adopted his rough and coarse costume, either to show contempt for things earthly, as Hengstenberg thinks; or as a penitential garb indicating sorrow for the sins of the people, as Keil supposes; or simple to chastise and subdue the flesh, as other ascetics. <span class="cmt_word">It is Elijah the Tishbite.</span> The description given is enough. The king has no longer any doubt. His suspicion is turned into certainty. There is no living person but Elijah who would at once have the boldness to prophesy the death of the king, and would wear such a costume as described. Elijah is, of course, his enemy, as he had been his father's "enemy" (<a href="/1_kings/21-20.htm">1 Kings 21:20</a>), and will wish him ill, and prophesy accordingly, the wish being "father to the thought." It is not improbable that Elijah had withdrawn himself into obscurity on the accession of Ahaziah, or at any rate on his exhibition of strong idolatrous proclivities (Ewald), as he had done on more than one occasion from Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/17-10.htm">1 Kings 17:10</a>; <a href="/1_kings/19-8.htm">1 Kings 19:8-8</a>).
