The term "remnant" often refers to a small, faithful group preserved by God, but here it highlights the few left after previous judgments. Historically, this reflects the period of the divided kingdom, where the Northern Kingdom (Israel) had already fallen to Assyria, and the Southern Kingdom (Judah) was under threat due to its idolatry and disobedience. Theologically, this forsaking is a consequence of persistent sin, echoing warnings given through prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah. The concept of God forsaking His people is a sobering reminder of the covenantal relationship, where blessings are contingent upon obedience.<p><b>and deliver them into the hands of their enemies.</b><br>This phrase signifies a transfer of power and protection from God to foreign nations. Historically, this was fulfilled when Judah was conquered by Babylon, leading to the exile. The "enemies" here are the surrounding nations that God used as instruments of judgment. This reflects the Deuteronomic cycle of sin, judgment, repentance, and deliverance. Theologically, it underscores the seriousness of breaking covenant with God, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where God warns of such consequences. This also prefigures the ultimate deliverance from sin through Christ, who was delivered into the hands of His enemies for the sake of humanity's redemption.<p><b>And they will become plunder and spoil to all their enemies,</b><br>This phrase describes the fate of Judah as a result of divine judgment. "Plunder and spoil" indicate total defeat and humiliation, where the people and their possessions are taken by conquering nations. Historically, this was realized during the Babylonian conquest, where Jerusalem was sacked, the temple destroyed, and the people exiled. This outcome was a direct result of the nation's failure to heed prophetic warnings and repent. Culturally, being plundered was the ultimate disgrace for a nation, signifying complete loss of autonomy and identity. This serves as a stark warning of the consequences of turning away from God, yet it also sets the stage for future hope and restoration, as God promises to eventually bring His people back from exile, a theme echoed in the prophetic books and ultimately fulfilled in the New Covenant through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his idolatry and evil practices, which provoked God's anger.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which is being addressed in this passage as the remnant of God's inheritance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_judah.htm">Enemies of Judah</a></b><br>The surrounding nations that God would use as instruments of judgment against Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_inheritance.htm">God's Inheritance</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Israel, whom God chose as His own possession.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophetic_judgment.htm">Prophetic Judgment</a></b><br>The declaration of God's intention to forsake Judah due to their persistent disobedience and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_idolatry.htm">The Consequences of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry leads to spiritual and physical ruin.

Every petty power in the neighborhood felt itself at liberty to make incursions with Judaea at its pleasure, to plunder and ravage, and drive off cap-tires, or massacre them in cold blood, or commit, any other atrocity.
