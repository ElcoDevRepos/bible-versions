The act of quickly removing their garments indicates the urgency and willingness of the people to show allegiance to Jehu. This reflects a cultural practice where clothing was used to express honor or to signify a change in status, as seen in other biblical instances like the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem (<a href="/matthew/21-7.htm">Matthew 21:7-8</a>).<p><b>and put it under Jehu on the bare steps.</b><br>Placing garments under Jehu on the steps signifies a gesture of enthronement and recognition of his authority. The "bare steps" could indicate a public place, possibly the steps of a building or a platform, emphasizing the public acknowledgment of Jehu's new role. This act parallels the spreading of cloaks for Jesus, symbolizing the recognition of a kingly figure (<a href="/2_kings/11-12.htm">2 Kings 11:12-14</a>).<p><b>Then they blew the ram&#8217;s horn</b><br>The blowing of the ram's horn, or shofar, was a traditional practice in Israel used to announce significant events, such as the coronation of a king or a call to battle (<a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>). It served as a public declaration and a call to attention, signifying the divine approval and the commencement of Jehu's reign.<p><b>and proclaimed, &#8220;Jehu is king!&#8221;</b><br>The proclamation of Jehu as king fulfills the prophecy given by the prophet Elisha (<a href="/2_kings/9-6.htm">2 Kings 9:6-10</a>). This declaration marks a pivotal moment in Israel's history, as Jehu's reign would lead to the eradication of the house of Ahab and the worship of Baal. The public acclamation underscores the communal acceptance and divine sanction of Jehu's kingship, aligning with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty in appointing leaders (<a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>A commander in the army of Israel, anointed by a prophet to become king and tasked with eradicating the house of Ahab.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_men.htm">The Men (Jehu's Companions)</a></b><br>Fellow officers or soldiers who were present with Jehu and participated in the act of proclaiming him king.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ram's_horn.htm">The Ram&#8217;s Horn (Shofar)</a></b><br>A traditional instrument used in Israel for signaling important events, such as the coronation of a king.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bare_steps.htm">The Bare Steps</a></b><br>Likely a reference to a place of elevation or prominence where Jehu was symbolically lifted up as king.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/proclamation_of_kingship.htm">Proclamation of Kingship</a></b><br>The act of declaring Jehu as king, signifying a divinely ordained change in leadership.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_appointment.htm">Divine Appointment</a></b><br>Jehu's anointing and proclamation as king remind us that God appoints leaders according to His purposes.

When the Lord moves, delay is dangerous (cf. <a href="/joshua/1-11.htm">Joshua 1:11</a>; <a href="/mark/1-18.htm">Mark 1:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Rapid action also prevented interference from the house of Ahab, fulfilling the prophetic word given years earlier in <a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>each man took his garment</b><p>&#8226; Cloaks symbolized personal authority and identity. By laying them down, the commanders surrendered their status to Jehu.<p>&#8226; Jonathan did something similar for David, giving him his robe as a pledge of loyalty (<a href="/1_samuel/18-4.htm">1 Samuel 18:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Crowds placed their garments before Jesus during the triumphal entry, honoring Him as King (<a href="/matthew/21-8.htm">Matthew 21:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The collective response&#8212;&#8220;each man&#8221;&#8212;shows unanimous recognition that God had chosen Jehu.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>put it under Jehu on the bare steps</b><p>&#8226; The steps led up to the meeting room on the fortress roof. Spreading garments turned ordinary stone into a royal platform, a makeshift throne room.<p>&#8226; Such an act echoes the &#8220;red carpet&#8221; concept: removing the dust of common ground so only honor touches the king (cf. <a href="/esther/5-2.htm">Esther 5:2</a>, where the king&#8217;s golden scepter grants access).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Bare steps&#8221; reminds us there was no preplanned ceremony; God&#8217;s appointment alone supplied the dignity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then they blew the ram&#8217;s horn</b><p>&#8226; The shofar announced sacred moments&#8212;Jubilee (<a href="/leviticus/25-9.htm">Leviticus 25:9</a>), victory at Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-4.htm">Joshua 6:4-5</a>), and Solomon&#8217;s enthronement (<a href="/1_kings/1-34.htm">1 Kings 1:34</a>).<p>&#8226; Sounding it here proclaimed that Jehu&#8217;s reign was a divine intervention, not a military coup.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/98-6.htm">Psalm 98:6</a> links the ram&#8217;s horn with joyful acknowledgement of God&#8217;s kingship, pointing to the Lord behind this coronation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and proclaimed, &#8220;Jehu is king!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Their shout seals the transfer of power.

Urgent obedience, symbolic surrender, improvised honor, the blast of the shofar, and a clear verbal confession all converge to acknowledge the man whom God had anointed. The verse illustrates how, when the Lord speaks, His people move quickly, lay down personal rights, and boldly declare His chosen ruler&#8212;foreshadowing the day every knee will bow to the true King.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Then</span> (<span class= "ital">and</span>) <span class= "bld">they hasted.</span>--LXX., "and they heard, and hasted." This is probably original, the sense being that the moment they heard it, they hastily took up their outer garments, and laid them as a carpet for Jehu to walk upon. (Comp. <a href="/luke/19-36.htm" title="And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.">Luke 19:36</a>.) The instantaneous action of the generals shows that there must have existed a strong feeling against Joram in the army and an enthusiasm for Jehu which only required a word from him to precipitate a revolution.<p><span class= "bld">Put it under him on the top of the stairs.</span>--So Kimchi, "at the uppermost step." The words are much discussed by commentators. The LXX. has, "and put it underneath him on the <span class= "ital">garem</span> of the steps" (retaining the Hebrew word <span class= "ital">gerem</span>); the Syriac, "and put it under him on a seat of steps;" the Targum, "at the steps of the hours," i.e., a flight of steps which served as a sundial (comp. <a href="/2_kings/20-11.htm" title="And Isaiah the prophet cried to the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.">2Kings 20:11</a>); the Vulg., "and each one, taking his cloak, put it under his feet <span class= "ital">in similitudinem tribunalis</span>," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, in the fashion of a rostrum, or elevated platform; the Arabic, "on the steps of the rise" (or "elevation").<p>The word <span class= "ital">gerem</span>, rendered "top," can hardly have that meaning. In Hebrew it rarely occurs (<a href="/proverbs/17-22.htm" title="A merry heart does good like a medicine: but a broken spirit dries the bones.">Proverbs 17:22</a>; <a href="/proverbs/25-15.htm" title="By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaks the bone.">Proverbs 25:15</a>), and means <span class= "ital">bone</span>, for which in Aramaic it is the usual term (<a href="/daniel/6-25.htm" title="Then king Darius wrote to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.">Daniel 6:25</a>). In Arabic the word means "body," and it is usually so explained in one passage of the Bible (<a href="/genesis/49-14.htm" title="Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:">Genesis 49:14</a>), "Issachar is a strong ass;" literally, <span class= "ital">an ass of body</span>. As the Aramaic <span class= "ital">garma</span> is used in the sense of "self," some would render the present phrase, "on the stairs themselves." But perhaps we may better translate on the analogy of the Arabic word, "They put (their cloaks) under him, on to ('el) the body of the stairs." The stairway on the outside of the house, leading to the roof, served as an extemporised throne, or rather platform, for the king. (Comp. <a href="/2_kings/11-14.htm" title="And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.">2Kings 11:14</a>.) Some Hebrew MSS. have "upon" for "on to." (Comp. <a href="/2_samuel/21-10.htm" title="And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her on the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped on them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.">2Samuel 21:10</a>, "on the rock.") . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs.</span> Kings were honored by the spreading of garments in their way, that their feet might not touch the dusty ground (<a href="/matthew/20-8.htm">Matthew 20:8</a>). The captains of the host, without hesitation, acclaimed Jehu king on the strength of the prophetical announcement, made his cause their own, and joined in his rebellion. It is reasonably conjectured (Bahr) that "a deep dissatisfaction with Joram must have prevailed in the <span class="accented">army</span>," though whether the dissatisfaction arose from the idolatry of the house of Ahab, or from Joram's withdrawal from the war, may be doubted, Jehu, on the ether hand, was evidently highly esteemed. The captains threw themselves with ardor into his cause, and extemporized a sort of enthronement. As often in an Oriental house, an external staircase led from the court to the upper story or to the roof. This they carpeted with their <span class="accented">begeds</span>, or outer cloaks, and, seating him on the top stair, saluted him as actual king.
