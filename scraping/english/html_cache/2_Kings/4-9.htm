Her interaction with her husband reflects the cultural norms of ancient Israel, where family decisions were often discussed within the household. The Shunammite woman is portrayed as perceptive and hospitable, qualities esteemed in biblical narratives. Her initiative in speaking to her husband highlights her role in recognizing and responding to the presence of God's work through Elisha.<p><b>Behold, now I know</b><br>The phrase "now I know" indicates a moment of revelation or realization. The Shunammite woman has observed Elisha's behavior and character over time, leading to her conviction. This reflects a biblical theme where God reveals His truth progressively, often through personal experience and observation. Her certainty underscores the importance of discernment in recognizing God's messengers.<p><b>that the one who often comes our way</b><br>Elisha's frequent visits suggest a relationship of trust and familiarity between him and the Shunammite family. This regular interaction provides the woman with ample opportunity to observe Elisha's conduct, reinforcing her conclusion about his character. The phrase also highlights the itinerant nature of prophets in ancient Israel, who traveled to deliver God's messages and perform miracles.<p><b>is a holy man of God</b><br>The designation "holy man of God" signifies Elisha's role as a prophet, set apart for divine purposes. Holiness in the biblical context implies moral purity and dedication to God's service. The Shunammite woman's recognition of Elisha as a "man of God" aligns with the broader biblical narrative, where prophets are often identified by their commitment to God's will and their role in conveying His messages.
