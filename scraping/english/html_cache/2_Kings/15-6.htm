His reign is noted for its prosperity and military strength, as well as for his eventual downfall due to pride. The phrase suggests that there were many other deeds and events during his reign that are not detailed in this particular passage. His acts include fortifying Jerusalem, expanding Judah's territory, and developing agriculture and trade. His reign is also marked by a significant earthquake mentioned in <a href="/amos/1.htm">Amos 1:1</a> and <a href="/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a>.<p><b>along with all his accomplishments</b><br>Azariah's accomplishments were significant in terms of military and economic development. He built towers in Jerusalem and strengthened the city's defenses, reflecting a period of stability and growth. His military campaigns extended Judah's influence, and he is credited with innovations in warfare, such as the development of engines to shoot arrows and large stones. His accomplishments are a testament to his leadership and God's favor during the early part of his reign.<p><b>are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</b><br>This phrase indicates that a more detailed account of Azariah's reign can be found in another historical record, the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah. This book is distinct from the biblical books of 1 and 2 Chronicles and is considered a lost text. It was likely a royal archive or annal that recorded the reigns of the kings of Judah. The mention of this book underscores the historical nature of the biblical narrative and suggests that the biblical authors had access to other sources when compiling their accounts. This phrase also highlights the practice of recording royal histories, which was common in the ancient Near East.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azariah.htm">Azariah (Uzziah)</a></b><br>King of Judah who reigned for 52 years.

That single statement invites us to remember:<p>&#8226; A reign that long is rare in the books of Kings, suggesting God&#8217;s favor on Judah during a politically unstable era (cf. <a href="/2_kings/14-23.htm">2 Kings 14:23</a>).<p>&#8226; His &#8220;acts&#8221; include a mixture of military successes, economic growth, and spiritual missteps. <a href="/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6-15</a> fills in the details: fortified cities, a well-equipped army, and inventive defenses.<p>&#8226; Yet even the best r&#233;sum&#233; can be overshadowed by a proud heart; <a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16</a> tells how Azariah&#8217;s arrogance in the temple led to leprosy and lifelong isolation (<a href="/2_kings/15-5.htm">2 Kings 15:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>along with all his accomplishments</b><p>The Holy Spirit highlights that what we see in Kings is only the headline version.

The inspired writer confidently points to public records available to his first readers.<p>&#8226; It underscores selectivity. God has given us everything we need for life and godliness (<a href="/2_peter/1-3.htm">2 Peter 1:3</a>), but not every possible detail. What is preserved in Scripture is precisely what the Lord deems essential for teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/15-6.htm">2 Kings 15:6</a> briefly pauses the narrative to remind us that Azariah&#8217;s life was far fuller than the compressed account offers. His long reign testifies to God&#8217;s blessing, his achievements display God-given abilities, and his recorded story&#8212;though incomplete in Kings&#8212;stands on verifiable history.
