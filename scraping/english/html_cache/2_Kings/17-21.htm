The tearing away signifies God's judgment due to Solomon's idolatry and the people's unfaithfulness (<a href="/1_kings/11-11.htm">1 Kings 11:11-13</a>). The house of David refers to the Davidic dynasty ruling over the united kingdom.

Jeroboam's rise to power was a direct result of the people's discontent with Rehoboam, Solomon's son, and his harsh policies (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16-20</a>). This political shift marked the beginning of the northern kingdom of Israel, distinct from the southern kingdom of Judah.<p><b>and Jeroboam led Israel away from following the LORD</b><br>Jeroboam's leadership was characterized by spiritual apostasy. To prevent the people from returning to Jerusalem for worship, he established alternative centers of worship in Bethel and Dan, introducing golden calves as objects of worship (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>). This act was a direct violation of the first two commandments and set a precedent for idolatry in Israel.<p><b>and caused them to commit a great sin</b><br>The "great sin" refers to the institutionalization of idolatry and the departure from the covenantal worship of Yahweh. Jeroboam's actions led the nation into a pattern of sin that persisted throughout the history of the northern kingdom, ultimately leading to its downfall and exile (<a href="/2_kings/17-22.htm">2 Kings 17:22-23</a>).

He fortified Shechem (<a href="/1_kings/12-25.htm">1 Kings 12:25</a>) and set up rival sanctuaries to solidify power, illustrating how fear can drive compromise.<p>&#8226; The people&#8217;s complicity fulfills Samuel&#8217;s earlier caution that rejecting God&#8217;s kingship leads to regrettable human rule (<a href="/1_samuel/8-18.htm">1 Samuel 8:18-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jeroboam led Israel away from following the LORD</b><p>&#8220;&#8203;&#8230;and Jeroboam led Israel away from following the LORD&#8203;&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/17-21.htm">2 Kings 17:21</a>c)<p>&#8226; Leadership influence: a king&#8217;s choices ripple through an entire nation (<a href="/proverbs/14-34.htm">Proverbs 14:34</a>).

Leadership choices, worship practices, and collective complicity culminated in a &#8220;great sin&#8221; that ultimately led to Israel&#8217;s exile. The verse warns that when God&#8217;s people abandon His clear Word, both leader and follower bear consequences, but it also underscores His unwavering commitment to discipline and ultimately restore those who return to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">For he rent</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--The verse assigns the <span class= "ital">fons et origo mali;</span> it makes the secession of the Ten Tribes from the house of David the ultimate cause of their ruin.

The argument obviously is this--separation from Judah led to the calf-worship, and that to idolatry pure and simple.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For he rent</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for he</span> had rent. The nexus of the verse is with ver. 18. The difference between the fates of Israel and Judah - the survival of Judah for a hundred and thirty-four years - is traced back to the separation under Rehoboam, and to the wicked policy which Jeroboam then pursued, and left as a legacy to his successors. Israel could suffer alone, while Judah was spared, because the kingdom of David and Solomon had been rent in twain, and the two states had thenceforth continued separate. <span class="cmt_word">Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the Lord.</span> The separation alone might not have had any ill result; but it was followed by the appointment of Jeroboam as king, and Jeroboam introduced the fatal taint of idolatry, from which all the other evils flowed, including the earlier destruction of the northern kingdom. Jeroboam not only introduced the worship of the calves, but he "drave Israel from following the Lord " - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> compelled the people to discontinue the practice of going up to worship at Jerusalem (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-13.htm">2 Chronicles 11:13-16</a>), and required them to take part in the calf-worship. <span class="cmt_word">And [thus] made them sin a great sin.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/17-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the LORD] had torn</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#257;&#183;ra&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7167.htm">Strong's 7167: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rend</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1431;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">away from</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8216;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the house</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of David,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1428;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they made Jeroboam</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1443;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3379.htm">Strong's 3379: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jeroboam -- 'the people increase', the name of two Israelites kings</span><br /><br /><span class="word">son</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ben-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Nebat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1425;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5028.htm">Strong's 5028: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nebat -- father of Jeroboam</span><br /><br /><span class="word">king,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yam&#183;l&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
