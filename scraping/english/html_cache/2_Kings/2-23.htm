Bethel, meaning "House of God," was a significant religious site, originally established by Jacob (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>). However, by Elisha's time, it had become a center of idolatry under Jeroboam's reign (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-29</a>). This context highlights the spiritual decline Elisha faced, setting the stage for his prophetic challenges.<p><b>and as he was walking up the road</b><br>The road to Bethel symbolizes Elisha's path of obedience and mission. Roads in biblical narratives often represent journeys of faith or divine appointments. Elisha's walk signifies his commitment to God's calling, despite the spiritual opposition he would encounter.<p><b>a group of boys came out of the city</b><br>The term "boys" here can refer to young men or adolescents, not necessarily children. This group represents the influence of Bethel's idolatrous culture, likely reflecting the community's disdain for true prophetic authority. Their emergence from the city suggests a collective mindset shaped by the prevailing spiritual corruption.<p><b>and jeered at him</b><br>Jeering indicates a deep disrespect for Elisha's prophetic office. In biblical times, prophets were God's messengers, deserving honor and reverence. The mockery signifies a rejection of God's word and authority, echoing Israel's broader rebellion against divine guidance.<p><b>chanting, &#8220;Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!&#8221;</b><br>The chant "Go up" may allude to Elijah's recent ascension to heaven (<a href="/2_kings/2-11.htm">2 Kings 2:11</a>), mocking Elisha's prophetic legitimacy. "Baldhead" could refer to Elisha's physical appearance or be a term of derision, possibly implying a lack of authority or divine favor.

God had confirmed the new prophet with a miracle before he ever reached Bethel.<p>&#8226; Bethel was a notorious center of calf worship established by Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-33</a>). Going there shows Elisha moving straight into hostile spiritual territory, much as Jesus later &#8220;resolutely set His face toward Jerusalem&#8221; (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>).<p>&#8226; By choosing Bethel, God confronts idolatry through His prophet, just as Elijah once confronted Baal on Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-17.htm">1 Kings 18:17-40</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross reference: <a href="/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10-15</a>, where another prophet is opposed at Bethel; yet God insists that His word be spoken there.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as he was walking up the road</b><p>&#8226; Elisha travels alone, without an honor guard or crowd.

Elisha&#8217;s very presence is a testimony that the LORD is still God over a rebellious people.<p>&#8226; The simple detail underscores the literal, historical setting&#8212;real prophet, real road, real city.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a group of boys came out of the city</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Boys&#8221; (na&#703;arim) can describe youths old enough to be soldiers (<a href="/1_kings/20-14.htm">1 Kings 20:14</a>). These are not harmless toddlers but morally accountable young men.<p>&#8226; They &#8220;came out,&#8221; a deliberate, confrontational act similar to the mob that mocked Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-4.htm">Genesis 19:4-5</a>) and the youths who taunted Job (<a href="/job/30-1.htm">Job 30:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The city nourishes their attitude; Bethel&#8217;s idolatrous climate has produced a generation that despises God&#8217;s messenger, fulfilling <a href="/hosea/4-6.htm">Hosea 4:6</a>, &#8220;My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and jeered at him</b><p>&#8226; Mockery of God&#8217;s servants is a serious sin (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>).

These youths cross that line openly.<p>&#8226; Their jeering contrasts with the reverent awe shown earlier by the sons of the prophets who declared, &#8220;The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/2-15.htm">2 Kings 2:15</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a> reminds us, &#8220;God is not mocked.

The youths ridicule Elisha, daring him to disappear as Elijah did, implying that if he were truly a prophet he should prove it by vanishing.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Baldhead&#8221; is an insult aimed at his appearance, but more deeply at his prophetic office. In a culture where the Nazirite vow often involved uncut hair (<a href="/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>), calling him bald suggests he lacks the spiritual power Elijah had.<p>&#8226; Physical ridicule masks spiritual rebellion. As with the soldiers who mocked Christ, &#8220;Hail, King of the Jews!&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/27-29.htm">Matthew 27:29</a>), contempt for the messenger betrays hatred of the message.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/3-17.htm">Isaiah 3:17</a>,24 connects baldness with judgment; ironically, their taunt boomerangs, because judgment soon falls on them, not on Elisha.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/2-23.htm">2 Kings 2:23</a> records more than a casual insult; it exposes a heart of covenant-breaking contempt in Bethel. Elisha, the authenticated successor of Elijah, walks straight into an idolatrous city and is confronted by rebellious youths who mock both his person and his divine commission. Their chant twists Elijah&#8217;s glorious ascension into ridicule and belittles the servant of God. The verse sets the stage for the Lord&#8217;s swift defense of His prophet in the next verse, underscoring the timeless principle that reviling God&#8217;s appointed messenger is, in fact, reviling God Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Went up.</span>--From Jericho, in the plain, Elisha goes now to visit the prophetic community established at Beth-el, the chief seat of the illicit <span class= "ital">cultus</span>.<p><span class= "bld">By the way.</span>--The way <span class= "ital">par excellence</span>; the highroad leading directly up to the gates of the town.<p><span class= "bld">Little children.</span>--<span class= "ital">Young boys</span> (or, <span class= "ital">lads</span>). <span class= "ital">Na'ar</span> is not used rhetorically here, as in <a href="/1_chronicles/29-1.htm" title="Furthermore David the king said to all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God.">1Chronicles 29:1</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/13-7.htm" title="And there are gathered to him vain men, the children of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and could not withstand them.">2Chronicles 13:7</a>.

"Little children" would not be likely to hit upon a biting sarcasm, nor to sally forth in a body to insult the prophet (<a href="/2_kings/2-24.htm" title="And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.">2Kings 2:24</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Mocked.</span>--<a href="/habakkuk/1-10.htm" title="And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn to them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.">Habakkuk 1:10</a>. In Syriac and Chaldee the root implies "to praise, and to praise ironically," <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, to deride. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he went up from thence unto Bethel.</span> The ascent is steep and long from the Jordan valley to the highlands of Benjamin, on which Bethel stood, probably one of not less than three thousand feet. The object of Elisha's visit may have been to inform the "sons of the prophets" at Bethel (ver. 3) of the events that had befallen Elijah. <span class="cmt_word">And as he was going up by the way</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, by the usual road or pathway, for, in the strict sense of the word, roads did not exist in Palestine - <span class="cmt_word">there came forth little children out of the city.</span> "Little children" is an unfortunate translation, raising quite a wrong idea of the tender age of the persons spoken cf. On the other hand, Bishop Patrick's assertion that the words are to be "understood of adult persons, who had a hatred to the prophet," is quite untenable. <span class="accented">Naarim ketanaim</span> would be best translated (as by our Revisers in the margin) "young lads" - boys, that is, from twelve to fifteen. Such mischievous youths are among the chief nuisances of Oriental towns; they waylay the traveler, deride him, jeer him - are keen to remark any personal defect that he may have, and merciless in flouting it; they dog his steps, shout out their rude remarks, and sometimes proceed from abusive words to violent acts, as the throwing of sticks, or stones, or mud. On this occasion they only got as far as rude words. <span class="cmt_word">And mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head! go up, thou bald head!</span> It has been maintained that the scoff of the lads contained an allusion to the ascension of Elijah (Patrick, Pool, Clarke), of which they had beard, and was a call upon Elisha to follow his master's example in quitting the world, that they might be no longer troubled with him. But it is not at all apparent that the lads even knew who Elisha was - they would probably have jeered at <span class="accented">any</span> aged person with whom they had fallen in; and by "Go up" they merely meant "Go on thy way; 'the force of their jeer was not in the word' <span class="accented">aleh</span>, but in the word <span class="accented">kereach</span>, "bald head." Baldness was sometimes produced by leprosy, and then made a man unclean (<a href="/leviticus/13-42.htm">Leviticus 13:42-44</a>); but the boys probably flouted the mere natural defect, in which there was no "uncleanness" (<a href="/leviticus/13-40.htm">Leviticus 13:40, 41</a>), but which they regarded as a fit subject for ridicule. Their sin was disrespect towards old age, combined, perhaps, with disrespect for the prophetical order, to which they may have known from his dress that Elisha belonged. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/2-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">From there,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
