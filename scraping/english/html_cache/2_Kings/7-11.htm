They were responsible for monitoring who entered and exited, making them key figures in the dissemination of information. In this context, the gatekeepers are relaying the astonishing news of the abandoned Aramean camp, which was discovered by the lepers. This act of shouting the news signifies the urgency and importance of the message. The gatekeepers' role here is reminiscent of the watchmen in <a href="/ezekiel/33-6.htm">Ezekiel 33:6</a>, who are tasked with warning the people of impending danger or significant events.<p><b>and it was reported to the king&#8217;s household</b><br>The king's household refers to the royal court, including the king's advisors and officials. In the historical context of 2 Kings, the king of Israel at this time was likely Joram (or Jehoram), son of Ahab. The report reaching the king's household indicates the chain of communication within the city, from the gatekeepers to the highest authority. This reflects the structured hierarchy of ancient Near Eastern societies. The news being reported to the king's household fulfills the prophecy given by Elisha earlier in <a href="/2_kings/7.htm">2 Kings 7:1</a>, where he foretold the end of the siege and the abundance of food.
