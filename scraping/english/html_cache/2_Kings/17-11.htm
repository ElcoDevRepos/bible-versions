High places were often elevated sites used for worship, typically associated with pagan rituals. The Israelites' use of these sites indicates a syncretism with surrounding cultures, directly violating the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). Archaeological evidence from sites like Megiddo and Gezer shows altars and incense stands, confirming the widespread nature of this practice.<p><b>like the nations that the LORD had driven out before them</b><br>This phrase refers to the Canaanite nations that inhabited the land before the Israelites. God had commanded the Israelites to destroy these nations because of their abominable practices (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4-5</a>). The Israelites' imitation of these nations' idolatrous practices was a direct disobedience to God's commands and a failure to remain distinct as His chosen people. This behavior fulfilled the warnings given in <a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-28</a>, where God warned that the land would "vomit out" its inhabitants due to such practices.<p><b>They did wicked things</b><br>The term "wicked things" encompasses a range of idolatrous and immoral activities, including child sacrifice, sexual immorality, and other detestable acts associated with pagan worship (<a href="/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-6.htm">2 Kings 21:6</a>). These actions were not only violations of the Mosaic Law but also affronts to the holiness of God. The prophets frequently condemned these practices, calling the people to repentance (<a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9-10</a>).<p><b>provoking the LORD to anger</b><br>The Israelites' actions provoked God's righteous anger, a recurring theme in the Old Testament. God's anger is not capricious but a response to covenant unfaithfulness and moral corruption (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16-21</a>). This anger led to divine judgment, as seen in the eventual Assyrian conquest and exile of the Northern Kingdom (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). The concept of provoking God to anger is also a warning to future generations, emphasizing the need for obedience and faithfulness (<a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were living in the Northern Kingdom of Israel.
