His journey to Damascus signifies a political alliance with Tiglath-pileser III, the powerful Assyrian king. This alliance was a strategic move to secure protection against threats from neighboring kingdoms, particularly Israel and Aram. Historically, this reflects the geopolitical dynamics of the 8th century BC, where smaller states often sought the favor of dominant empires for survival. Theologically, Ahaz's reliance on Assyria rather than God is seen as a lack of faith, contrasting with the covenantal trust expected of Judah's kings.<p><b>On seeing the altar in Damascus,</b><br>The altar in Damascus likely belonged to the Aramean god Hadad, reflecting the syncretistic practices common in the ancient Near East. Ahaz's interest in this altar indicates his openness to foreign religious influences, which was contrary to the exclusive worship of Yahweh commanded in the Mosaic Law. This act foreshadows the spiritual decline of Judah, as it symbolizes the introduction of idolatrous practices into the temple worship in Jerusalem.<p><b>King Ahaz sent Uriah the priest a model of the altar and complete plans for its construction.</b><br>Uriah the priest's involvement suggests a troubling collaboration between the religious and political leadership in adopting foreign religious practices. The detailed plans and model indicate Ahaz's intent to replicate the altar precisely, showing a deliberate shift in worship practices. This action is reminiscent of the Israelites' earlier struggles with idolatry, as seen in the golden calf incident (Exodus 32). It also contrasts with the detailed instructions God gave for the construction of the tabernacle and temple, emphasizing divine design over human innovation. This episode highlights the tension between faithfulness to God's commands and the temptation to conform to surrounding cultures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahaz.htm">King Ahaz</a></b><br>The king of Judah who is known for his unfaithfulness to God.

Upon the account which follows Prof. Robertson Smith well remarks that the frivolous character of Ahaz "was so-little capable of appreciating the dangers involved in his new obligations, that he returned to Jerusalem with his head full of the artistic and religious curiosities he had seen on his journey. In a national crisis of the first magnitude he found no more pressing concern than the erection of a new altar in the Temple on a pattern brought from Damascus. The sundial of Ahaz (<a href="/2_kings/20-11.htm" title="And Isaiah the prophet cried to the LORD: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.">2Kings 20:11</a>), and an erection on the roof of the Temple, with altars apparently designed for the worship of the host of heaven (<a href="/2_kings/23-12.htm" title="And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and broke them down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.">2Kings 23:12</a>), were works equally characteristic of the trifling and superstitious <span class= "ital">virtuoso,</span> who imagined that the introduction of a few foreign novelties gave lustre to a reign which had fooled away the independence of Judah, and sought a momentary deliverance by accepting a service the burden of which was fast becoming intolerable" (<span class= "ital">Proph. of Israel,</span> p. 251).<p><span class= "bld">Urijah the priest</span>--i.e., the high priest, who appears to be identical with the "credible witness" of <a href="/isaiah/8-2.htm" title="And I took to me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.">Isaiah 8:2</a>.

The new position into which Ahaz had brought himself with respect to Assyria was followed by certain religious changes, which were probably, in part at any rate, its consequence, though some of them may have been the result of his own religious (or irreligious) convictions. He had a new altar made and introduced into the temple, which at first he used for his own private sacrifices (vers. 10-13); then, that his new altar might occupy the pest of honor, he removed from its place the old brazen altar of Solomon, and put it in an inferior position (ver. 14). After this, he required all sacrifices to be offered on the new altar (ver. 15). Finally, he proceeded to interfere with several other of Solomon's arrangements, with what particular object is not very apparent (vers. 17, 18). In carrying out all these changes, he had the high priest of the time for his obsequious servant. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser King of Assyria.</span> It was a practice of the Assyrian monarchs to hold <span class="accented">durbar's</span>, or courts, at central places in the provinces, in the course of their military expeditions, whereat to receive the subject princes of the neighborhood, who were expected to do homage, and bring with them presents, or their fixed tribute. Tiglath-pileser held one such court in the earlier part of his reign at Arpad, a Syrian town, at which were present the kings of Comma-gene, Syria, Tyre, Carchemish, Gaugama, and others. He seems to have held another at some unknown place, about <span class="date">B.C. 732</span> (it may have been at Damascus), which was attended by the kings of Commagene, Car-chemish, Gebal, Hamath, Gaugama, Tubal, Arvad, Ammon, Moab, Askelon, Gaza, Edom, and Judah, the last-mentioned being Yahu-khazi (Jehoahaz), by which is probably meant Ahaz. It is with reason conjectured that this was the occasion mentioned in the text, when "King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser." <span class="cmt_word">And saw an altar that was at Damascus.</span> It is almost certain that this was an Assyrian altar. Ahaz may at one time have turned for help to the gods of Syria (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-23.htm">2 Chronicles 28:23</a>), and asked their aid against his enemies; but the glory of Syria was now gone, her gods were discredited, and the place of power was occupied by Assyria, which had asserted its supremacy. When Ahaz visited Tiglath-pileser at Damascus, and "saw an altar," it was, in all probability, Tiglath-pileser's altar. The Assyrian kings were accustomed to carry altars about with them, and to have them set up in their fortified camps, or in other convenient places. They also, not infrequently, set up altars to the great gods in the countries which they conquered, and required the inhabitants to pay them reverence. Ahaz may either have been required by Tiglath-pileser to set up an Assyrian altar in the temple, or he may have volunteered the act as one which was likely to please his suzerain. <span class="cmt_word">And King Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the high priest <span class="cmt_word">- the fashion of the altar and the pattern of it.</span> Assyrian altars were quite different from Jewish ones. Generally they were of small size, either square with a battlemented edge, or round at the top and supported on a triangular base ('Dict. of the Bible,' <span class="accented">ad voc</span>. "Altar," vol. 1. p. 55, woodcuts Nos. 3 and 5). It is scarcely likely that Ahaz was particularly pleased with the pattern (Keil), and therefore wished to have one like it. He probably merely wished to satisfy his suzerain that he had conformed to some of his religious usages. <span class="cmt_word">According to all the workmanship thereof.</span> Though not very elaborate, the Assyrian altars have an ornamentation which is peculiar and unmistakable. Careful instructions would be needed for workmen who had never seen the sort of object which they were required to produce. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/16-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then King</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
