Asherah was a Canaanite goddess associated with fertility and was often worshipped alongside Baal. The presence of an Asherah pole in the temple signifies a direct violation of the first commandment and a departure from monotheistic worship. This act reflects the syncretism prevalent during Manasseh's reign, where pagan practices were incorporated into the worship of Yahweh, leading to spiritual corruption.<p><b>and set it up in the temple</b><br>The temple in Jerusalem was the central place of worship for the Israelites, built by Solomon as a dwelling place for God's Name. By placing an Asherah pole in the temple, Manasseh desecrated this sacred space, which was meant to be holy and set apart for the worship of Yahweh alone. This act of defilement was a significant affront to the covenant relationship between God and Israel, highlighting the extent of Manasseh's apostasy.<p><b>of which the LORD had said to David and his son Solomon</b><br>The reference to David and Solomon underscores the temple's divine origin and purpose. God had made a covenant with David, promising that his lineage would endure and that his son Solomon would build a house for God's Name. This covenantal promise is recorded in <a href="/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a> and <a href="/1_kings/8.htm">1 Kings 8</a>, where God assures David that his dynasty and the temple would be established forever. Manasseh's actions, therefore, not only violated the sanctity of the temple but also disregarded the divine promises made to his forefathers.<p><b>&#8220;In this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel</b><br>Jerusalem was chosen by God as the spiritual and political center of Israel, a city set apart for His Name. The temple was the focal point of worship and the symbol of God's presence among His people. This divine choice is emphasized in passages like <a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/6-6.htm">2 Chronicles 6:6</a>, where God declares His selection of Jerusalem. Manasseh's idolatry in this chosen city represents a profound betrayal of God's election and purpose for Israel.<p><b>I will establish My Name forever.&#8221;</b><br>The promise to establish God's Name forever in the temple and Jerusalem is a testament to His enduring covenant with Israel. This assurance is rooted in the Davidic covenant and reflects God's desire for a perpetual relationship with His people. The desecration of the temple by Manasseh stands in stark contrast to this promise, highlighting the tension between human unfaithfulness and divine faithfulness. Despite Manasseh's actions, the prophetic hope remains that God's Name will ultimately be vindicated and His purposes fulfilled, as seen in the messianic prophecies pointing to Jesus Christ, who embodies the true temple and the eternal presence of God among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>King of Judah who reigned for 55 years and was known for his idolatrous practices, including setting up an idol in the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/asherah.htm">Asherah</a></b><br>A Canaanite goddess often associated with fertility and worshiped through carved images or poles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_the_lord.htm">The House of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, a sacred place where God's presence dwelt among His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, known for his heart for God and establishing Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/solomon.htm">Solomon</a></b><br>Son of David, known for building the temple in Jerusalem, which was meant to be a dwelling place for God's Name.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is a direct violation of God's commandments and leads to spiritual decay.

It is meant that the Asherah was erected within the Temple itself, probably in the holy place--an act which was the climax of Manasseh's impiety. (Comp. 23:4; <a href="/ezekiel/43-7.htm" title="And he said to me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the middle of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their prostitution, nor by the carcasses of their kings in their high places.">Ezekiel 43:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-30.htm" title="For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, said the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.">Jeremiah 7:30</a> <span class= "ital">seq</span>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house.</span> He introduced into the temple, and set up there for adoration, an elaborately wrought Asherah, or "sacred tree," probably copied from the elaborate sacred trees of the Assyrians ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 2. p. 236).

In each of the two courts he placed an idolatrous altar, whereon the people were invited to deposit their offerings; and probably in the temple building itself, perhaps in the very holy of holies, he placed that lust-exciting emblem of Astarte, which was the most horrible profanation of all true religion, turning the truth and grace of God into lasciviousness (<a href="/jude/1-4.htm">Jude 1:4</a>).
