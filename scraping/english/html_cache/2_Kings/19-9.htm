The mention of Tirhakah, king of Cush, introduces a significant geopolitical element. Cush, often associated with the region south of Egypt, was a powerful kingdom. Tirhakah's involvement suggests a coalition against Assyria, highlighting the widespread resistance to Assyrian expansion. This moment reflects the broader historical context of regional powers uniting against a common threat. The warning to Sennacherib indicates the strategic importance of intelligence in ancient warfare and the constant threat of shifting alliances.<p><b>&#8220;Look, he has set out to fight against you.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the imminent threat posed by Tirhakah's military movements. The anticipation of conflict is a recurring theme in the biblical narrative, where divine intervention often plays a crucial role. The impending battle serves as a backdrop for God's deliverance of Jerusalem, as seen in the subsequent verses. The phrase also reflects the tension and uncertainty faced by rulers in maintaining their empires amidst external threats. It sets the stage for the unfolding drama where God's sovereignty is demonstrated over earthly powers.<p><b>So Sennacherib again sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,</b><br>Sennacherib's decision to send messengers to Hezekiah, the king of Judah, reveals his strategic approach to warfare, combining psychological tactics with military might. This act of sending messengers is a continuation of his earlier attempts to intimidate and demoralize Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem. It reflects the Assyrian practice of using propaganda to weaken enemy resolve. Theologically, this moment highlights the testing of Hezekiah's faith and reliance on God. It also foreshadows the divine intervention that will protect Jerusalem, emphasizing the theme of God's faithfulness to His covenant people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sennacherib.htm">Sennacherib</a></b><br>The king of Assyria, known for his military campaigns and attempts to conquer Jerusalem.

Sennacherib does not <span class= "ital">name</span> Tirhakah, but calls him "the king of Meluhhu," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Meroe. The two successors of Sennacherib had further wars with Tirhakah. Esarhaddon, according to notices in the annals of Assurbanipal, conquered Tirhakah, "king of Mizraim and Cush, and divided Egypt between a number of vassal kings. A list of twenty names is preserved, beginning with" Necho king of Memphis and Sais." This was Esarhaddon's tenth expedition (circ. 671 B.C. ). Tirhakah, however, invaded Egypt once more, for "he despised the might of Asshur, Istar, and the great gods my lords, and trusted to his own power." This led to Assurbanipal's first expedition, which was directed against Egypt. Ewald and Knobel suppose that Isaiah 18 refers to an embassy from Tirhakah asking the co-operation of Judah against the common foe. If it be alleged that Shabataka was still nominal king of Egypt, we may regard Tirhakah as commanding in his father's name. But Egyptian chronology is too uncertain to be allowed much weight in the question.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-14.</span> <span class="accented">- Sennacherib's letter to Hezekiah</span>. Sennacherib seems to have been induced to write to Hezekiah by the fact that he could not march against him at once. A forward movement on the part of Tirhakah was reported to him (ver. 9), and he thought it necessary to meet, or at least watch it. But he must vent his anger on the rebel Judaean monarch in some way. He sends a letter, therefore, as more weighty and impressive than a mere message. He warns Hezekiah against being himself deceived by Jehovah (ver. 10); and he expands his inductive argument in proof of the irresistible might of Assyria, by an enumeration of four more recent conquests (ver. 12). Otherwise, he does little but repeat what Rabshakeh had already urged. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he heard say of Tirhakah King of Ethiopia.</span> Tirhakah was one of the most distinguished of the later Egyptian monarchs. An Ethiopian by birth, and originally ruling from Napata over the Upper Nile valley from the First Cataract to (perhaps) Khartoum, he extended his dominion over Egypt probably about <span class="date">B.C. 700</span>, maintaining, however, Shabatok, as a sort of puppet-king, upon the throne. About <span class="date">B.C. 693</span> he succeeded Shabatok, and held the throne till <span class="date">B.C. 667</span>, being engaged in many wars with the Assyrians. The native form of his name is "Tahrak" or "Tahark," the Assyrian "Tarku" or "Tarqu," the Greek "Taracos" or "Tearchon." He has left numerous memorials in Egypt and Ethiopia, and was regarded by the Greeks as a great conqueror. At the time of Sennacherib's second attack on Hezekiah (about <span class="date">B.C. 699</span>) he was, as appears in the text, not yet King of Egypt, but only of Ethiopia. Still, he regarded Egypt as practically under his suzerainty, and when it was threatened by Sennacherib's approach, he marched to the rescue. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, he is come out to fight against thee.</span> He may have regarded himself as bound in honor to come to the relief of Hezekiah, or he may have been simply bent on defending his own territory.
