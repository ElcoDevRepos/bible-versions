In the context of the Kings of Judah, this is a significant commendation, as many kings did not follow God's ways. The phrase suggests a commitment to the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, emphasizing obedience and faithfulness. This aligns with <a href="/deuteronomy/6-18.htm">Deuteronomy 6:18</a>, which instructs the Israelites to do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord. It also reflects the biblical theme of divine approval being contingent upon adherence to God's laws.<p><b>just as his father Uzziah had done</b><br>Uzziah, also known as Azariah, was a king of Judah who initially did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/15-3.htm">2 Kings 15:3</a>. His reign was marked by military success and prosperity, attributed to his faithfulness to God. However, Uzziah's later years were marred by pride, leading to his downfall and leprosy as a divine punishment (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-21</a>). This phrase highlights the importance of following a godly example, while also serving as a cautionary reminder of the consequences of pride and disobedience. It underscores the biblical principle that leaders are accountable to God for their actions and the spiritual state of their nation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jotham.htm">Jotham</a></b><br>The king of Judah who is the subject of this verse.
