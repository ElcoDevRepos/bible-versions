The burnt offering, typically a sacrifice to the LORD, is used by Jehu in a deceptive manner to gather the worshipers of Baal. This reflects the syncretism and idolatry prevalent in Israel at the time, as the people had turned from worshiping Yahweh to Baal. Jehu's offering is not a genuine act of worship but a strategic move to fulfill his mission of eradicating Baal worship from Israel, as prophesied by Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-17.htm">1 Kings 19:17</a>).<p><b>Jehu said to the guards and officers,</b><br>Jehu, anointed king of Israel, is acting on his divine mandate to destroy the house of Ahab and eliminate Baal worship. The guards and officers are likely his loyal supporters, possibly from the military, who assist him in carrying out this purge. This reflects the political and military power dynamics in the Northern Kingdom, where Jehu's coup is both a religious and political revolution.<p><b>&#8220;Go in and kill them. Do not let anyone out.&#8221;</b><br>This command underscores the severity and totality of Jehu's mission. The phrase reflects the biblical principle of herem, or the devotion of something to destruction for the LORD, seen in earlier biblical narratives such as the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>). Jehu's actions are a fulfillment of divine judgment against idolatry, aligning with the covenantal curses outlined in Deuteronomy for turning away from God.<p><b>So the guards and officers put them to the sword,</b><br>The execution of the Baal worshipers is a decisive act of judgment. The sword is often a symbol of divine judgment in the Bible (<a href="/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3-5</a>). This act is a physical manifestation of God's judgment against idolatry and a fulfillment of the prophetic word given to Elijah and Elisha regarding the house of Ahab and the eradication of Baal worship.<p><b>threw the bodies out,</b><br>The disposal of the bodies signifies the complete rejection and desecration of Baal worship. In ancient Near Eastern culture, proper burial was important, and the lack of it here indicates the utter disgrace and divine judgment upon those who turned from Yahweh to Baal. This act also serves to cleanse the land from the defilement of idolatry.<p><b>and went into the inner room of the temple of Baal.</b><br>The inner room, or sanctuary, of the temple of Baal is the most sacred space for Baal worshipers. Jehu's men entering this space signifies the complete overthrow and desecration of Baal's cultic center. This act is reminiscent of the cleansing of the temple in Jerusalem by later reformers like Hezekiah and Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/18-4.htm">2 Kings 18:4, 23</a>:4-6), who also sought to restore true worship. It foreshadows the ultimate cleansing and restoration brought by Jesus Christ, who cleansed the temple in Jerusalem (<a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13-17</a>), symbolizing the purification of worship and the establishment of a new covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was anointed to destroy the house of Ahab and eradicate Baal worship from Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/guards_and_officers.htm">Guards and Officers</a></b><br>The individuals who carried out Jehu's orders to kill the worshipers of Baal.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_of_baal.htm">Temple of Baal</a></b><br>The place where the worshipers of Baal gathered, which Jehu targeted for destruction.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/baal_worshipers.htm">Baal Worshipers</a></b><br>The individuals who were devoted to the Canaanite god Baal, representing idolatry in Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offering.htm">Burnt Offering</a></b><br>A sacrificial act performed by Jehu, possibly as a deceptive tactic to gather the Baal worshipers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/z/zeal_for_god's_honor.htm">Zeal for God's Honor</a></b><br>Jehu's actions demonstrate a zeal for eradicating idolatry and restoring the worship of Yahweh.

By personally offering the burnt offering he disarms suspicion and fulfills the ruse. Earlier Scripture had commanded the utter removal of idolatry (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-12.htm">Deuteronomy 13:12-17</a>), and Elisha had anointed Jehu for precisely this task (<a href="/2_kings/9-6.htm">2 Kings 9:6-10</a>; cf. <a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16-18</a>).<p>&#8226; The offering is not an act of devotion to Baal; it is the final move that guarantees no worshiper is missing.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s patience with Ahab&#8217;s dynasty has ended; the moment for judgment has arrived (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Jehu&#8217;s timing&#8212;waiting until &#8220;he had finished&#8221;&#8212;shows deliberate planning rather than rash violence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jehu said to the guards and officers, &#8220;Go in and kill them.

After cleverly gathering every idolater and finishing a deceptive sacrifice, Jehu commands his guards to execute complete judgment&#8212;no escape, no survivors. The soldiers obey, discard the bodies, and penetrate the inner sanctuary to eradicate every vestige of Baal. The verse illustrates righteous zeal in carrying out divine justice, the certainty of God&#8217;s word against idolatry, and the ultimate supremacy of the LORD over false gods.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">As soon as he had made an end.</span>--The Syriac has, <span class= "ital">when they </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, the Baal priests) <span class= "ital">had made an end</span>. This is probably right. (Comp. the beginning of <a href="/2_kings/10-24.htm" title="And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that lets him go, his life shall be for the life of him.">2Kings 10:24</a>). We can hardly suppose with Ewald that Jehu personally offered sacrifices in the character of an ardent Baal-worshipper. For the massacre Jehu chose the moment when all the assembly was absorbed in worship.<p><span class= "bld">To the guard and to the captains.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">to the runners</span> (or <span class= "ital">couriers</span>) <span class= "ital">and to the adjutants</span> (or <span class= "ital">squires</span>; <a href="/2_kings/9-25.htm" title="Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden on him;">2Kings 9:25</a>). (Comp. <a href="/1_kings/9-22.htm" title="But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no slaves: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.">1Kings 9:22</a>.) The royal guardsmen and their officers are meant.<p><span class= "bld">Cast them out.</span>--That is, threw the dead bodies out of the temple. This is the explanation of the Targum and the other versions. Thenius asks why this should be specially mentioned, and proposes to understand the verb intransitively, "rushed out," which suits very well with what follows.<p><span class= "bld">And went to the city of the house of Baal</span>.--The word <span class= "ital">city</span> has here its original meaning, which is also that of the Greek <span class= "greekheb">?????</span>--viz., <span class= "ital">citadel, stronghold</span>; properly, a place surrounded by a ring-fence or rampart. Jehu's guards, after the completion of their bloody work in the court of the temple, rushed up the steps into the sanctuary itself, which, like the temple of Solomon, resembled a fortress. ("Ex atrio irruperunt satellites Jehu in ipsam arcem templi."--Sebastian Schmidt.) Gesenius explains the word as meaning the <span class= "ital">temenos</span> or sacred enclosure of the temple, but that does not suit the context. (The origin of the word '<span class= "ital">ir</span>, "city," obscure in Hebrew, is revealed by the cuneiform inscriptions in the Accadian word <span class= "ital">erim</span> or <span class= "ital">eri</span>, meaning "foundation," and <span class= "ital">Uru</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, Ur, a proper name, meaning "the city.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering.</span> It has been concluded from this that Jehu" offered the sacrifices <span class="accented">with his own hand</span>, as though he were the most zealous of Baal's adorers" (Ewald, ' History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 100); but the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the expression used. The suffix <span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;</span> in <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5ba;&#x5dc;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;</span> may be used indefinitely, "when one finished," or "when they finished;" or Jehu may be said to have made the offerings, because he famished the victims, not because he immolated them with his own hand. Throughout heathendom, wherever there wore priests, it was the duty of the prints to slay the victims offered. <span class="cmt_word">That Jehu said to the guard</span> - literally, <span class="accented">to the</span> runners (see the comment on 1 Kings 1:38) - <span class="cmt_word">and to the captains</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, the officers in command of the guard - <span class="cmt_word">Go in, and slay them; let none come forth.</span> We must suppose that some guarded the doors, while others advanced into the crowd and struck right and left. The unarmed multitude seems to have made no resistance. <span class="cmt_word">And they smote them with the edge of the sword</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> cut them down unsparingly, smote and slew till none were left alive - <span class="cmt_word">and the guard and the captains cast them out.</span> This is generally understood to mean that all the bodies were thrown by the guards out of the temple. Dean Stanley says, "The temple was strewn with corpses, which, "as fast as they fell, the guard and the officers threw out with their own hands" ('Jewish Church,' vol. 2. p. 188). But it is not apparent why they should have taken this trouble. Perhaps Bahr is right in suggesting that no more is meant than that the guard and the officers thrust the bodies out of their way, as they pressed forward to enter the sanctuary which contained the sacred images. <span class="cmt_word">And went to the city of the house of Baal.</span> "They made their way," as Ewald says, "into the inner sanctuary, the enclosure of which rose like a lofty fortress - <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span> originally meant "fortress" - where Baal was enthroned, surrounded by the images of his fellow-gods" ('History of Israel,' <span class="accented">l.s.c</span>.). It is to be remembered that the assembled multitude occupied the court or courts of the temple, within which, in a commanding position, was the "house" or "sanctuary" - perhaps reserved for the priests only. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/10-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When he had finished</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1465;&#1514;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;
