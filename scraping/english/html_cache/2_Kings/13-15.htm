Known for his miracles and guidance to the kings of Israel, Elisha's role here is as a divine messenger. His instructions are not merely personal advice but carry the weight of God's will. This reflects the biblical theme of prophets as intermediaries between God and His people, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>&#8220;Take a bow and some arrows.&#8221;</b><br>The bow and arrows symbolize warfare and deliverance. In the ancient Near East, these were common weapons, representing military strength and readiness. The act of taking them signifies preparation for battle, both physically and spiritually. This instruction foreshadows the impending conflict with Aram (Syria) and serves as a prophetic act, similar to other symbolic actions performed by prophets, such as Jeremiah's yoke (<a href="/jeremiah/27-2.htm">Jeremiah 27:2</a>).<p><b>So Jehoash took a bow and some arrows.</b><br>Jehoash, also known as Joash, was the king of Israel at this time. His compliance with Elisha's command indicates his recognition of the prophet's authority and the seriousness of the situation. This act of obedience is crucial, as it sets the stage for the subsequent prophetic declaration. The narrative highlights the importance of following divine instructions, a recurring theme in the Bible, where obedience often leads to divine intervention and victory, as seen in the story of Joshua at Jericho (Joshua 6).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet in Israel, successor to Elijah, known for his miracles and guidance to the kings of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoash.htm">Jehoash (Joash) of Israel</a></b><br>The king of Israel during this time, seeking guidance and deliverance from the Arameans.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bow_and_arrows.htm">Bow and Arrows</a></b><br>Symbolic tools used by Elisha to convey God's message and promise of victory over Aram.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aram.htm">Aram (Syria)</a></b><br>The nation oppressing Israel, against whom God promises victory through Elisha's prophetic actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often struggling with idolatry and seeking deliverance from their enemies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolic_acts_of_faith.htm">Symbolic Acts of Faith</a></b><br>Elisha's instruction to take a bow and arrows is a symbolic act of faith.

Much as Elijah once said to the widow of Zarephath, &#8220;Do not fear. Go and do as you have said&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/17-13.htm">1 Kings 17:13</a>), Elisha&#8217;s command carries the weight of divine authority.<p>&#8226; Jehoash is the king, yet he submits to the prophet&#8217;s voice. This mirrors earlier moments when Naaman obeyed Elisha&#8217;s simple directions and was healed (<a href="/2_kings/5-10.htm">2 Kings 5:10&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene reminds us that victory for God&#8217;s people begins with listening to the Lord, whether through prophets of old or through the written Word today (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Take a bow</b><p>&#8226; The bow is a tool of warfare&#8212;tangible, practical. God often ties His promises to physical means: a staff lifted over the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-16.htm">Exodus 14:16</a>) or five smooth stones in David&#8217;s pouch (<a href="/1_samuel/17-40.htm">1 Samuel 17:40</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming the bow first, Elisha spotlights the upcoming battle with Aram. <a href="/psalms/18-34.htm">Psalm 18:34</a> says, &#8220;He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend a bow of bronze,&#8221; pointing to the Lord as the true trainer behind human skill.<p>&#8226; The instruction invites faith that God can work through ordinary instruments to bring extraordinary deliverance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And some arrows</b><p>&#8226; Arrows imply repeated action, not a one-time shot. Elisha is preparing Jehoash for more than a symbolic gesture; each arrow will matter (as vv. 18&#8211;19 soon reveal).<p>&#8226; The plural recalls <a href="/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>, &#8220;Your arrows pierce the hearts of the king&#8217;s foes,&#8221; portraying decisive, multiple strikes.<p>&#8226; <a href="/zechariah/9-14.htm">Zechariah 9:14</a> pictures the Lord Himself as the archer: &#8220;His arrow will flash like lightning.&#8221; Jehoash&#8217;s arrows will become extensions of that divine power.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So Jehoash took</b><p>&#8226; The king responds without delay or debate&#8212;an example of prompt obedience akin to Joshua&#8217;s quick action when the Lord said, &#8220;Take up the Ark&#8230; and move on ahead&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/3-6.htm">Joshua 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience precedes explanation; Jehoash still does not know the full lesson, yet he acts. This echoes Peter&#8217;s words, &#8220;But at Your word I will let down the nets&#8221; (<a href="/luke/5-5.htm">Luke 5:5</a>), revealing trust that steps first and understands later.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A bow and some arrows</b><p>&#8226; Jehoash gathers exactly what was ordered&#8212;nothing more, nothing less. Complete compliance positions him to receive the promised victory.<p>&#8226; Having the right equipment matters, but having it in humble reliance on God matters more. David carried Goliath&#8217;s sword later on, yet said, &#8220;The battle is the Lord&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p>&#8226; In New-Testament terms, these weapons anticipate the believer&#8217;s readiness to wield &#8220;the shield of faith&#8221; and &#8220;the sword of the Spirit&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-16.htm">Ephesians 6:16&#8211;17</a>): human hands holding instruments empowered by God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/13-15.htm">2 Kings 13:15</a> captures a moment where God, through Elisha, invites King Jehoash to partner with Him in victory over Aram. The prophet&#8217;s simple command and the king&#8217;s immediate obedience show that divine deliverance often begins with listening and acting on God&#8217;s Word, even before all the details are clear. The bow and arrows symbolize the means God provides; faith-filled use of those means leads to triumph, because the battle ultimately belongs to the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Take bow and arrows</span>.--From one of the royal attendants.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows.</span> The prophet was moved, no doubt, by a sudden inspiration he was bidden to assure the weeping king of victory - speedy victory-over Syria. The defense of Israel would not fail because he - a mere weak instrument by whom God had been pleased to work - was taken from the earth. God would bless the king's own efforts. "Take bow and arrows," he exclaims under the prophetic afflatus. "Take them at once into thine hands, and do my bidding." Words would not have been enough; greater assurance and conviction was produced when prophecy took the shape of a symbolical action (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/15-27.htm">1 Samuel 15:27</a>; <a href="/1_kings/11-30.htm">1 Kings 11:30</a>; <a href="/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/13-1.htm">Jeremiah 13:1-11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/18-3.htm">Jeremiah 18:3, 4</a>, etc.). So the Spirit of the Lord moved the prophet to the performance of a symbolical act, or set of acts, which the historian now proceeds to describe. <span class="cmt_word">And he took unto him how and arrows.</span> Joash would take these from the hands of his attendants, who might be carrying his own special weapons after him, as was the practice in Persia ('Ancient Monarchies,' vol. 4. p. 161), or who would at any rate have arms of their own, since they would wait upon him not merely as attendants, but as guards. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/13-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Elisha</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1428;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#238;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_477.htm">Strong's 477: </a> </span><span class="str2">Elisha -- 'God is salvation', a well-known Israelite prophet</span><br /><br /><span class="word">told</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
