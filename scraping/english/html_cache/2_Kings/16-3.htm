The "ways of the kings of Israel" refers to the practices of the northern kingdom, which were often characterized by idolatry and disobedience to God. This is significant because the kings of Israel, starting with Jeroboam, led the people into sin by establishing golden calves and other forms of idol worship (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-30</a>). The phrase suggests a rejection of the Davidic covenant, which promised blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience (2 Samuel 7).<p><b>and even sacrificed his son in the fire</b><br>This act is a reference to the practice of child sacrifice, which was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10</a>). The phrase "sacrificed his son in the fire" is often associated with the worship of the Canaanite god Molech, a detestable practice that involved offering children as burnt offerings. This act of sacrificing his son highlights the extent of the king's apostasy and moral decline. It also serves as a stark contrast to the faith of Abraham, who was willing to sacrifice Isaac but was stopped by God (Genesis 22), demonstrating obedience rather than idolatry.<p><b>according to the abominations of the nations</b><br>The term "abominations" refers to practices that are detestable and offensive to God. These were the customs and religious rites of the Canaanite nations that inhabited the land before the Israelites. The Israelites were explicitly commanded to avoid these practices (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-31.htm">Deuteronomy 12:31</a>). The use of the word "abominations" underscores the severity of the king's actions and aligns them with the sinful practices that led to the Canaanites' expulsion from the land.<p><b>that the LORD had driven out before the Israelites</b><br>This phrase recalls the conquest of Canaan, where God commanded the Israelites to drive out the inhabitants of the land due to their wickedness (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4-5</a>). The driving out of these nations was both a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>) and a judgment against the Canaanites' sinful practices. The king's actions are thus portrayed as a reversal of God's work, as he adopts the very practices that led to the Canaanites' downfall. This serves as a warning of the consequences of turning away from God's commandments and embracing the ways of the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahaz.htm">Ahaz</a></b><br>The king of Judah who is the central figure in this verse.

Most northern kings adopted idolatry beginning with Jeroboam&#8217;s golden calves (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28-33</a>).<p>&#8211; By copying Israel&#8217;s practices, Ahaz traded Judah&#8217;s God-given heritage for man-made religion.

Ahaz appears to have been the first Israelite king who offered such a sacrifice. He, no doubt, regarded it as a last desperate resource against the oppression of his northern enemies. It is absurd to suppose that the king intended it in love to his child, as Thenius suggests. (See <a href="/judges/11-31.htm" title="Then it shall be, that whatever comes forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.">Judges 11:31</a>.)

As the writer of Chronicles says (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-2.htm">2 Chronicles 28:2</a>), "He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, <span class="accented">and made also molten images for Baalim</span>." <span class="accented">Baalim</span> is either a plural of dignity, or a word denoting the different forms under which Baal was worshipped, as Melkarth, Adonis, Rimmon, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Yea, and made his son to pass through the fire.</span> In Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-3.htm">2 Chronicles 28:3</a>) we are told that "he burnt incense in the valley of Hinnom, and burnt his children in the fire," as if he had sacrificed more than one son. The practice of offering children in sacrifice was not a feature of the Assyro-Babylonian religion, as some suppose, but an intrinsic part of the worship of the Phoenicians, common to them with the Moabites, Ammonites, and others. It was based upon the principle of a man's offering to God that which was dearest and most precious to himself, whence the crowning sacrifice of the kind was a man's offering of his firstborn son (see <a href="/2_kings/3-27.htm">2 Kings 3:27</a>; <a href="/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>). Some have supposed that the rite was a mere dedication or lustration, the children passing between two fires, and being thenceforward employed only in God's service. But the expressions used by the sacred writer and others, and still more the descriptions that have come down to us from heathen and patristic authors, make it absolutely certain that the "passing through the fire' was no such innocent ceremony as this, but involved the death of the children. The author of Chronicles says, "Ahaz <span class="accented">burnt</span> his children in the fire;" <a href="/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a>, "They have built also the high places of Baal, <span class="accented">to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings</span> unto Baal;" <a href="/ezekiel/16-21.htm">Ezekiel 16:21</a>, "Thou hast <span class="accented">slain</span> my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire." Josephus declares of Ahaz that he "made his own son a whole burnt offering (<span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f60;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span>)." Diodorus Sicalus describes the ceremony as it took place at Carthage, the Phoenician colony. There was in the great temple there, he says, an image of Saturn (Moloch), which was a human figure with a bull's head and outstretched arms. This image of metal was made glowing hot by a fire kindled within it; and the children, laid in its arms, rolled from thence into the fiery lap below. If the children cried, the parents stopped their noise by fondling and kissing them; for the victim ought not to weep, and the sound of complaint was drowned in the din of flutes and kettle-drums (Died. Sic., 20:14). "Mothers," says Plutarch ('De Superstitione,' &sect; 13), "stood by without tears or sobs; if they wept or sobbed, they lost the honor of the act, and the children were sacrificed notwithstanding." The only doubtful point is whether the children were placed alive in the glowing arms of the image, or whether they were first killed and afterwards burnt in sacrifice; but the description of Diodorus seems to imply the more cruel of the two proceedings. <span class="cmt_word">According to the abominations of the heathen, whom the Lord east out from before the children of Israel.</span> (On the practice of this terrible rite by the Canaanitish nations at the time of the Israelite invasion, see <a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>;
