The presence of male shrine prostitutes indicates the syncretism and idolatry that had infiltrated the worship of Yahweh. Such practices were common in Canaanite religion, where sexual rites were believed to ensure fertility and prosperity. Josiah's actions align with <a href="/deuteronomy/23-17.htm">Deuteronomy 23:17-18</a>, which prohibits such practices among the Israelites. His reforms were a return to the covenantal faithfulness demanded by the Law of Moses.<p><b>that were in the house of the LORD</b><br>The fact that these quarters were located within the temple precincts underscores the extent of the corruption that had taken place. The temple, meant to be a holy place dedicated to the worship of Yahweh, had been defiled by pagan practices. This desecration reflects the spiritual decline of Judah prior to Josiah's reign. The cleansing of the temple is reminiscent of Jesus' actions in the New Testament, where He drives out the money changers (<a href="/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12-13</a>), emphasizing the need for purity in worship.<p><b>where the women had woven tapestries for Asherah</b><br>Asherah was a Canaanite goddess often associated with fertility and motherhood, and her worship was widespread in the ancient Near East. The weaving of tapestries for Asherah suggests the integration of pagan rituals into the religious life of Judah. This practice was likely part of the cultic activities intended to honor the goddess. Josiah's removal of these elements was a direct challenge to the idolatrous practices that had become entrenched in the society. His reforms were a fulfillment of the prophetic call to return to exclusive worship of Yahweh, as seen in the messages of prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/josiah.htm">Josiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who initiated religious reforms to restore the worship of Yahweh and eliminate idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_the_lord.htm">House of the LORD</a></b><br>Refers to the temple in Jerusalem, the central place of worship for the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/male_cult_prostitutes.htm">Male Cult Prostitutes</a></b><br>Individuals involved in pagan rituals, often associated with fertility cults, which were contrary to the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/women_weaving_tapestries_for_asherah.htm">Women Weaving Tapestries for Asherah</a></b><br>Women engaged in creating items for the worship of Asherah, a Canaanite goddess, indicating the syncretism present in Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/asherah.htm">Asherah</a></b><br>A Canaanite goddess often associated with fertility and worshiped alongside Yahweh by some Israelites, contrary to God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_purity_in_worship.htm">Commitment to Purity in Worship</a></b><br>Josiah's actions remind us of the importance of maintaining purity in our worship and eliminating anything that detracts from the true worship of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_leadership.htm">Courage in Leadership</a></b><br>Josiah's reforms required courage and conviction.

(See the comment on 1 Kings 14:24; and note that the male prostitutes, or Galli, who consecrated themselves to the Des Syra, formed an essential element in the Astarte-worship, and accompanied it wherever it was introduced.) Dollinger says ('Jew and Gentile,' vol. 1. pp. 430, 431) of these wretched persons, "To the exciting din of drums, flutes, and inspired songs, the Galli cut themselves on the arms; and the effect of this act, and of the music accompanying it, was so strong upon mere spectators, that all their bodily and mental powers were thrown into a tumult of excitement, and they too, seized by the desire to lacerate themselves, deprived themselves of their manhood by means of potsherds lying ready for the purpose. Thereupon they ran with the mutilated part through the city, and received from the houses which they threw them into, a woman's gear. Not chastity, but barrenness, was intended by the mutilation. In this the Galli only desired to be like their goddess. The relation of foul lust, which they thenceforward occupied towards women, was regarded as a holy thing, and was tolerated by husbands in their wives." <span class="cmt_word">That were by the house of the Lord.</span> The near vicinity is an indication that the Galli took part in the foreign rites introduced into the temple by Manasseh and Amon. The awful profanation of the house of God by such orgies is too terrible to dwell on. <span class="cmt_word">Where the women wove hangings for the grove.</span> "The women" are no doubt the priestesses of the Dea Syra, who are constantly mentioned with the Galli, and, indeed, lived with them. They employed themselves, among other occupations, in weaving "hangings" (literally, "houses," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> "coverings") for the Asherah. It may be gathered from <a href="/ezekiel/16-16.htm">Ezekiel 16:16</a> that these "coverings" were dainty fabrics of many colors. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/23-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He also tore down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1509;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yit&#183;t&#333;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
