The king's inquiry reflects his desperation and helplessness as he walks on the city wall, witnessing the suffering of his people. This moment highlights the role of a king as a shepherd to his people, responsible for their welfare, yet here he is powerless. The king's question also underscores the severity of the famine, as he is approached by a woman with a grievous complaint, indicating the extreme conditions within the city.<p><b>And she answered, &#8220;This woman said to me, &#8216;Give up your son, that we may eat him,</b><br>The woman's response reveals the horrific reality of the famine, where the situation has become so desperate that cannibalism is considered. This echoes the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53-57</a>, where disobedience to God would lead to such dire circumstances. The moral and social breakdown is evident, as the natural affection of a mother for her child is overridden by the instinct for survival. This phrase also serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of turning away from God, as the Israelites had done by worshipping other gods and neglecting the covenant.<p><b>and tomorrow we will eat my son.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The agreement between the two women to eat their children on successive days illustrates the depth of despair and the collapse of societal norms. This situation is reminiscent of the siege of Jerusalem in <a href="/lamentations/4-10.htm">Lamentations 4:10</a>, where similar acts of desperation occurred. The mention of "tomorrow" suggests a false hope or a temporary solution to their immediate hunger, highlighting the futility of their actions. This phrase can also be seen as a type of the ultimate sacrifice, contrasting with the selfless sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who gave Himself willingly for the salvation of others, in stark contrast to the selfish and desperate actions depicted here.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_israel.htm">The King of Israel</a></b><br>Likely King Jehoram, son of Ahab, who was ruling during the time of the Aramean siege of Samaria.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>A desperate mother in Samaria who approaches the king with a grievous complaint during a severe famine.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaria.htm">Samaria</a></b><br>The capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, under siege by the Arameans, leading to extreme famine and desperation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_siege.htm">The Siege</a></b><br>The Aramean army besieged Samaria, causing a severe famine that led to desperate and horrific actions by the inhabitants.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_other_woman.htm">The Other Woman</a></b><br>Another mother involved in the tragic agreement to eat their children due to the famine.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The dire situation in Samaria is a direct result of Israel's disobedience to God.

Earthly authority is powerless when a nation&#8217;s sin has invited divine judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-47.htm">Deuteronomy 28:47&#8211;48</a>).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s inquiry invites a revelation of the horror that unchecked rebellion can breed, fulfilling earlier warnings that rejection of God would drive people to desperate acts (<a href="/leviticus/26-29.htm">Leviticus 26:29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;And she answered,&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Her response is public, raw, and shameless; famine has stripped away normal restraint (<a href="/lamentations/4-9.htm">Lamentations 4:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; The woman&#8217;s willingness to voice such depravity highlights how hardened hearts can become when a society normalizes sin (<a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28&#8211;31</a>).<p>&#8226; She does not cry for bread or mercy, but for justice against a broken agreement&#8212;evidence that sin distorts moral priorities.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;&#8216;This woman said to me, &#8220;Give up your son, that we may eat him,&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Cannibalism was expressly condemned and foretold as a curse for covenant disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53&#8211;55</a>).

Only God&#8217;s intervention&#8212;announced through Elisha and realized within a day (<a href="/2_kings/7-1.htm">2 Kings 7:1, 16</a>)&#8212;can break the siege and restore hope.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/6-28.htm">2 Kings 6:28</a> records a real, horrific moment that fulfills covenant warnings and exposes the depths of human depravity when a nation turns from God. The king&#8217;s helpless question, the woman&#8217;s shocking complaint, and the proposed cannibalism all underline the truth that sin brings judgment, judgment brings desperation, and desperation can erase natural affection.
