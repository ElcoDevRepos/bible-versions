His leadership is significant during a time of Assyrian threat. The phrase underscores the divine appointment and responsibility of Hezekiah over God's people, Israel. This reflects the biblical theme of God raising leaders to guide His people, as seen with Moses and David.<p><b>that this is what the LORD, the God of your father David, says:</b><br>The reference to "the God of your father David" emphasizes the Davidic covenant, which promised a lasting dynasty. It connects Hezekiah to the lineage of David, highlighting God's faithfulness to His promises. This phrase also reinforces the continuity of God's covenantal relationship with Israel through David's line, pointing to the eventual coming of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who is often referred to as the Son of David.<p><b>I have heard your prayer;</b><br>Hezekiah's prayer is a demonstration of his faith and reliance on God. This phrase shows God's responsiveness to sincere prayer, a recurring theme in Scripture. It parallels other instances where God responds to the prayers of His people, such as Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the temple (1 Kings 8).<p><b>I have seen your tears.</b><br>The mention of tears indicates Hezekiah's deep emotional state and genuine repentance. It highlights God's compassion and His attentiveness to human suffering. This mirrors other biblical instances where God is moved by the tears of His people, such as Hannah's prayer for a child (1 Samuel 1).<p><b>I will surely heal you.</b><br>God's promise to heal Hezekiah is a direct intervention in response to prayer. It signifies God's power over life and death and His ability to restore health. This healing can be seen as a type of Christ's healing ministry, where Jesus healed the sick and raised the dead, demonstrating His divine authority.<p><b>On the third day from now you will go up to the house of the LORD.</b><br>The specific mention of "the third day" is significant, often symbolizing restoration and new beginnings in the Bible. This foreshadows Christ's resurrection on the third day, a pivotal event in Christian theology. Going up to the house of the LORD signifies restored fellowship with God and the importance of worship, reflecting the centrality of the temple in Jewish life and worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who is known for his faithfulness to God.

There is not a cry, not a groan, not a tear, not a sigh of his faithful ones, to which the heart of God is not open, which does not touch him, move him, draw forth his sympathy. If he does not always grant our prayers, it is because we "ask amiss" - without faith, or without fervor, or things not good for us. Hezekiah's earnest, faithful, and not unwise prayer was, as such prayers always are, effectual. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> thou shalt be so completely recovered as to be able to quit thy palace and pay thy vows in the courts of the Lord's house.
