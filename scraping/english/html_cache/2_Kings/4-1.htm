These groups were dedicated to learning and proclaiming God's word. The mention of the "wife" indicates a personal and familial crisis, highlighting the vulnerability of women in ancient Israelite society, especially when left without a husband. Elisha, as the successor of Elijah, was a prominent prophet in Israel, known for performing miracles and providing guidance. The woman's appeal to Elisha underscores his role as a spiritual leader and a source of divine intervention.<p><b>&#8220;Your servant, my husband, is dead, and you know that your servant feared the LORD.</b><br>The phrase "your servant" indicates a relationship of respect and service between the deceased husband and Elisha, suggesting that the husband was a faithful follower and possibly a member of the prophetic community. The statement that he "feared the LORD" reflects his piety and devotion, aligning with the biblical principle that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). This fear is not terror but reverence and obedience to God, which was a hallmark of the faithful in Israel.<p><b>And now his creditor is coming to take my two children as his slaves!&#8221;</b><br>In ancient Israel, debt slavery was a common practice where creditors could take the debtor or their family members as servants to work off the debt (<a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2-7</a>, <a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39-41</a>). This reflects the harsh economic realities of the time and the lack of social safety nets for widows and orphans. The Mosaic Law provided some protections for debtors, but the threat of losing her children to slavery highlights the severity of the widow's plight. This situation also sets the stage for Elisha's miraculous intervention, which would demonstrate God's compassion and provision for those in desperate need.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wife_of_the_prophet.htm">The Wife of the Prophet</a></b><br>A widow who is in distress due to her husband's death and the impending threat of her children being taken as slaves to pay off debt.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sons_of_the_prophets.htm">The Sons of the Prophets</a></b><br>A group of prophets or disciples who were under the mentorship of a leading prophet, in this case, Elisha.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God who succeeded Elijah and performed many miracles.

And the man refused to smite him.">1Kings 20:35</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Thou knowest that thy servant did fear the Lord.</span>--She makes this the ground of her claim on the prophet's assistance. In <a href="/1_kings/18-3.htm" title="And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:">1Kings 18:3</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-12.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from you, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry you where I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find you, he shall slay me: but I your servant fear the LORD from my youth.">1Kings 18:12</a> it is said of Obadiah, Ahab's steward, that he "feared the Lord," and on account of this slight resemblance, the Targum, Josephus, and Ephrem Syrus identify the dead man of this verse with Obadiah, who is supposed to have spent all his property in maintaining the prophets (<a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm" title="For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)">1Kings 18:4</a>) (!) Possibly the widow meant to say that her husband's debts were not due to profligate living (<span class= "ital">Thenius</span>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying.</span> We learn from this that the "sons of the prophets" were not merely, all of them, college students, but included fathers of families, who cannot have lived a cloistered life, but must have had separate homes for themselves and their families. Such persons may still have taught in the prophetical schools, as do the married tutors and professors of modern universities. <span class="cmt_word">Thy servant my husband is dead.</span> Elisha had, it seems, known her husband, who had been his "servant," not literally and in deed, but in will and heart, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> always ready to serve him. She recalls this fact to his memory, to predispose him in her favor. <span class="cmt_word">And thou knowest that thy servant did fear the Lord.</span> Here was a second ground for Elisha's interference - the woman's husband had been a God-fearing man, one who not only acknowledged Jehovah, but worshipped him in spirit and in truth. There is a Jewish tradition, or legend, that the woman's husband was the Obadiah of <a href="/1_kings/18-3.htm">1 Kings 18:3-16</a>, but no dependence can be placed on it. Obadiah, the "governor of Ahab's house," can scarcely have been one of the "sons of the prophets." <span class="cmt_word">And the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to he bondmen.</span> In primitive communities, men borrowed upon their personal credit, and the primary security for debt was regarded as being their own persons, the value of their labor, and that of those dependent on them. In Greece and Rome, originally, as in the Hebrew community, borrowers ordinarily raised money by pledging their persons, and, if they could not pay when the debt became due, went into servitude with their children. The Mosaic Law presupposes this state of things, and permits its continuance, but in two respects interferes to modify it: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by requiring that the service exacted shall not be severe (<a href="/leviticus/25-43.htm">Leviticus 25:43, 46</a>), but such as was commonly rendered by hired servants (<a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39, 40</a>); and <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by limiting the period of service to the date of the next jubilee year (<a href="/leviticus/25-40.htm">Leviticus 25:40, 41</a>). In the instance brought here under our notice, it would seem that the creditor had not proceeded to claim his rights until the debtor died, when he on-forced them against the man's children (comp. <a href="/nehemiah/5-1.htm">Nehemiah 5:1-8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/4-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the wife</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(min&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#353;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
