The king's inquiry and her confirmation demonstrate the fulfillment of Elisha's prophecy and the woman's faith in following the prophet's guidance. This moment underscores the importance of prophetic words and the role of women in biblical narratives, as seen in other instances like the widow of Zarephath (<a href="/1_kings/17-8.htm">1 Kings 17:8-24</a>).<p><b>So the king appointed for her an officer, saying,</b><br>The king's decision to appoint an officer reflects the administrative practices of ancient Israel, where officials were often tasked with executing royal decrees. This action shows the king's authority and willingness to ensure justice and restoration for the woman. It also illustrates the biblical theme of God's providence and care for His people, as seen in other stories of divine intervention and restoration, such as Joseph's rise to power in Egypt (Genesis 41).<p><b>&#8220;Restore all that was hers,</b><br>The command to restore the woman's property emphasizes the biblical principle of restitution and justice. In the Mosaic Law, restitution was a key component of maintaining social order and fairness (<a href="/exodus/22.htm">Exodus 22:1-14</a>). This restoration can be seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where He restores what was lost through sin, offering spiritual and sometimes physical restoration to believers.<p><b>along with all the proceeds of the field from the day that she left the country until now.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights the king's generosity and the concept of recompense beyond mere restoration. The inclusion of proceeds from the field suggests a recognition of the woman's loss during her absence and a desire to compensate her fully. This act of grace mirrors the biblical theme of God's abundant provision and blessing, as seen in the parable of the prodigal son, where the father not only welcomes his son back but also celebrates his return with a feast (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Likely King Jehoram of Israel, who is involved in the restoration of the Shunammite woman's property.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shunammite_woman.htm">The Shunammite Woman</a></b><br>A woman from Shunem who had previously shown hospitality to the prophet Elisha and had left her land due to a famine.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>The prophet who had previously warned the Shunammite woman about the coming famine, prompting her to leave.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_officer.htm">The Officer</a></b><br>An appointed official tasked by the king to ensure the restoration of the woman's property and produce.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_famine.htm">The Famine</a></b><br>A significant event that caused the Shunammite woman to leave her land, setting the stage for her return and the king's intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_providence_and_human_agency.htm">Divine Providence and Human Agency</a></b><br>God often works through human authorities to accomplish His purposes, as seen in the king's role in restoring the woman's property.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_relationships.htm">Faithfulness in Relationships</a></b><br>The Shunammite woman's past kindness to Elisha is rewarded, illustrating the principle of sowing and reaping in relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/restoration_and_justice.htm">Restoration and Justice</a></b><br>God's heart for justice is evident in the restoration of what was lost, encouraging believers to trust in His timing and provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_trust.htm">Obedience and Trust</a></b><br>The Shunammite woman's obedience to Elisha's warning and her trust in God's provision serve as a model for believers facing difficult circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_care_for_the_vulnerable.htm">God's Care for the Vulnerable</a></b><br>The account underscores God's concern for the vulnerable and marginalized, encouraging believers to advocate for justice and restoration in their communities.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Kings_8_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Kings 8:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/2_Kings_8_6_God_s_provision_restoration.htm">How does 2 Kings 8:6 demonstrate God's provision and restoration in our lives?
