Jericho, a city with a rich biblical history, was one of the locations where these prophetic communities were established. This indicates the widespread influence and organization of prophetic ministry during this period. The approach of these prophets to Elisha suggests a shared understanding and respect for the prophetic office.<p><b>&#8220;Do you know that the LORD will take your master away from you today?&#8221;</b><br>This question highlights the prophetic insight given to the sons of the prophets, indicating that the impending departure of Elijah was known among the prophetic community. The phrase "the LORD will take your master away" suggests a divine intervention, as Elijah's departure was not a natural death but a supernatural event. This moment foreshadows the ascension of Christ, who was also taken up into heaven. The certainty of the event happening "today" underscores the immediacy and divine timing involved.<p><b>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; he replied.</b><br>Elisha's response shows his awareness and acceptance of the situation. His knowledge of Elijah's impending departure indicates his close relationship with Elijah and his own prophetic insight. This acknowledgment also reflects Elisha's readiness to assume the prophetic mantle, similar to how the disciples were prepared for Jesus' ascension and the coming of the Holy Spirit.<p><b>&#8220;Do not speak of it.&#8221;</b><br>Elisha's request to "not speak of it" may reflect his emotional state, as he was about to lose his mentor and spiritual father. It could also indicate a desire to maintain focus on the task at hand without distraction. This mirrors moments in the New Testament where Jesus instructs his disciples to keep certain revelations private until the appropriate time.

This would seem to imply the existence of a large number of such seminaries at this period. No doubt, when the secular power was most strongly opposed to true religion, the prophetical order had to make increased efforts to raise its numbers and multiply its schools.
