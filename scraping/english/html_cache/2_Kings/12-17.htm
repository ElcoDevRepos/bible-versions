The time referred to is during the reign of Jehoash (Joash) of Judah, a period marked by political instability and external threats. This era is characterized by the ongoing conflict between Israel and Aram (Syria), as well as internal challenges within the kingdom of Judah.<p><b>Hazael king of Aram</b><br>Hazael was a significant figure in the history of the Near East, known for his aggressive military campaigns. He became king of Aram (modern-day Syria) after assassinating Ben-Hadad II, as recorded in <a href="/2_kings/8-15.htm">2 Kings 8:15</a>. Hazael's reign is noted for its expansionist policies, which brought him into conflict with both Israel and Judah. His actions fulfilled the prophecy given to Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/19-15.htm">1 Kings 19:15-17</a>, where Hazael was anointed as a tool of judgment against Israel.<p><b>marched up and fought against Gath</b><br>Gath was one of the five major Philistine cities, located in the coastal region of Canaan. Its capture by Hazael indicates the extent of Aram's military reach and the weakening of Philistine power. The city's strategic location made it a valuable target for any regional power seeking to control trade routes and exert influence over the southern Levant.<p><b>and captured it</b><br>The capture of Gath demonstrates Hazael's military prowess and the vulnerability of the surrounding regions. This event underscores the shifting power dynamics in the region, as Aram's influence expanded at the expense of both Philistine and Israelite territories. The fall of Gath would have had significant implications for the security of Judah and its neighbors.<p><b>Then he decided to attack Jerusalem</b><br>Hazael's decision to attack Jerusalem highlights the threat posed to the kingdom of Judah. Jerusalem, as the capital city, was the political and religious center of Judah, making it a prime target for any invading force. This decision reflects the broader geopolitical ambitions of Hazael and the precarious position of Judah during this period. The attack on Jerusalem is a pivotal moment, as it tests the leadership of Jehoash and the resilience of the city. This event also foreshadows future sieges and captures of Jerusalem, pointing to the city's central role in biblical history and prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hazael.htm">Hazael</a></b><br>King of Aram (Syria), known for his military campaigns against Israel and Judah.

A considerable gap occurs between vers. 16 and 17. We learn from Chronicles some particulars of the interval. Not long after the completion of the repairs, Jehoiada, who had lived to a good old age in complete harmony with the monarch, expired. His piety, and his good services, as preserver of the house of David, as restorer of the temple-worship, and joint-repairer with Joash of the temple itself, were regarded as entitling him to extraordinary funeral honors; and by general consent he was interred within the city of Jerusalem, in the sepulchers of the kings (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-16.htm">2 Chronicles 24:16</a>). His removal led to a fresh religious revolution. "The Jewish aristocracy, who perhaps had never been free from the licentious and idolatrous taint introduced by Rehoboam and confirmed by Athaliah, and who may well have been galled by the new rise of the priestly order, presented themselves before Joash, and offered him the same obsequious homage that bad been paid by the young nobles to Rehoboam. He... feeling himself released from personal obligations by the death of his adopted father, threw himself into their hands. Athaliah was avenged almost upon the spot where she had been first seized by her enemies" (Stanley, 'Jewish Church,' vol. 2. p. 345). Joash began by allowing the reintroduction of idolatry and grove-worship (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-18.htm">2 Chronicles 24:18</a>), and then, when remonstrated with by Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, who had succeeded his father in the office of high priest, had the remonstrant set upon by the people and slain. The writer of Chronicles closely connects this murderous deed with the Syrian war, which followed it within a year (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23</a>), and was generally regarded as a Divine judgment. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Hazael King of Syria went up, and fought against Gath.</span> Hitherto Judah had been safe from any attack on the part of Syria, since Israel had been interposed between the two powers. Now, however, that Hazael had conquered from Jehu the entire trans-Jordanic territory (<a href="/2_kings/10-33.htm">2 Kings 10:33</a>), the case was wholly altered - Judah and Syria had become conterminous along the line of the lower Jordan, and Syria could invade Judaea at any moment. It is surprising that Gath should have been the special object of attack, since Oath (<span class="accented">Abu-Gheith</span>) lay remote from the Syrian frontier, in the southwestern part of Judaea, and could only be reached from Syria by an enemy who was not afraid of leaving Jerusalem behind him. Gath, when last mentioned, was a Judaean city, and was fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="/2_chronicles/11-8.htm">2 Chronicles 11:8</a>); but it was originally Philistine (1 Samuel 5:17), and the Philistines had recovered it before the time of Uzziah (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-6.htm">2 Chronicles 26:6</a>). To which power it belonged when Hazael made war upon it is uncertain. <span class="cmt_word">And took it</span> - probably took it by storm, and plundered it, but did not attempt an occupation - <span class="cmt_word">and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.</span> If Gath be <span class="accented">Abu-Gheith</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> appears probable, it would be distant from Jerusalem not less than forty miles in a direct line. If Hazael, however, was returning to the trans-Jordanic country taken from Israel, it would lie in his way, and might naturally tempt him to make a dash at it, more especially as he was flushed with victory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/12-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At that time</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1443;&#1494;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;z)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_227.htm">Strong's 227: </a> </span><span class="str2">At that time, place, therefore</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Hazael</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1494;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;z&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2371.htm">Strong's 2371: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hazael -- 'God sees', a king of Aram (Syria)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Aram</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1512;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;r&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_758.htm">Strong's 758: </a> </span><span class="str2">Aram -- Syria</span><br /><br /><span class="word">marched up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1500;&#1462;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5927.htm">Strong's 5927: </a> </span><span class="str2">To ascend, in, actively</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and fought</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yil&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#7717;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
