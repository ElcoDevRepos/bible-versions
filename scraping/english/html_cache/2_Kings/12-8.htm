In the context of ancient Israel, priests held significant religious authority and were responsible for temple rituals and maintenance. Their agreement reflects a shift in responsibility, possibly due to inefficiencies or mismanagement in handling temple funds. This decision aligns with the broader biblical theme of accountability and stewardship, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/nehemiah/13-11.htm">Nehemiah 13:11</a>, where leaders are called to correct neglect in temple service.<p><b>that they would not receive money from the people</b><br>The priests' decision to stop collecting money from the people marks a significant change in temple operations. Historically, funds were gathered for temple maintenance and priestly support, as outlined in <a href="/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13-16</a>. This change may have been prompted by King Joash's reforms, aiming to ensure transparency and proper use of resources. The collection of money for religious purposes is a recurring theme in the Bible, emphasizing the importance of integrity in handling offerings, as seen in the New Testament with the story of Ananias and Sapphira in <a href="/acts/5.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>.<p><b>and that they would not repair the temple themselves</b><br>By deciding not to repair the temple themselves, the priests acknowledge their limitations or past failures in maintaining the temple. This decision likely reflects a need for specialized skills or a more organized approach to temple restoration. The temple, as the center of worship and God's dwelling place among His people, required careful upkeep, as emphasized in <a href="/1_chronicles/29.htm">1 Chronicles 29:1-9</a>, where David prepares for the temple's construction. This phrase also foreshadows the involvement of others, such as skilled workers, in the temple's repair, highlighting the collaborative effort needed to restore God's house, a theme echoed in the New Testament with the church as the body of Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoash.htm">Jehoash (Joash)</a></b><br>King of Judah who initiated the repair of the temple.
