These pillars were not only structural but also carried deep spiritual symbolism, representing God's establishment and strength. They are first mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/7-15.htm">1 Kings 7:15-22</a>, where their detailed construction is described. The destruction of these pillars by the Babylonians signifies the end of an era and the judgment upon Judah for their disobedience.<p><b>the Sea</b><br>The "Sea" refers to the large basin or laver used for ceremonial washing by the priests, as described in <a href="/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-26</a>.
