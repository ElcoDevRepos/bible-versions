Springs were vital sources of water in ancient Israel, often central to the life and prosperity of a community. This particular spring was located in Jericho, a city with a rich biblical history, including its miraculous conquest by Joshua (Joshua 6). Elisha's journey to the spring signifies a direct confrontation with the problem at its source, reflecting the biblical theme of addressing sin or corruption at its root.<p><b>cast the salt into it</b><br>Salt in the Bible often symbolizes purification and preservation. In <a href="/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>, salt is required in grain offerings, symbolizing the covenant between God and Israel. Elisha's use of salt here is not a magical act but a symbolic gesture that represents God's power to purify and restore. The act of casting salt into the spring can also be seen as a type of Christ, who purifies and preserves believers through His sacrifice.<p><b>and said, &#8220;This is what the LORD says:</b><br>Elisha speaks with the authority of a prophet, delivering a direct message from God. This phrase underscores the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces, conveying His will to the people. The phrase "This is what the LORD says" is a common prophetic formula, emphasizing that the subsequent action is not by human power but by divine command.<p><b>&#8216;I have healed this water.</b><br>The healing of the water is a divine act, illustrating God's power over creation and His ability to bring life and restoration. This mirrors other biblical instances where God heals or purifies, such as the bitter waters of Marah in <a href="/exodus/15-25.htm">Exodus 15:25</a>. The healing of the water also serves as a sign of God's continued presence and blessing upon the land and its people, despite previous judgments.<p><b>No longer will it cause death or unfruitfulness.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The removal of death and unfruitfulness from the water signifies a reversal of the curse and a restoration of life and productivity. This echoes the promise of abundant life found in <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>, where Jesus speaks of giving life to the full. The transformation of the water can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate restoration and healing that Christ brings to the world, where death and barrenness are overcome through His redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God and the successor of Elijah.

His action mirrors God&#8217;s pattern of confronting trouble at its root, as at Marah where Moses was told to treat the bitter water itself (<a href="/exodus/15-23.htm">Exodus 15:23-25</a>).<p>&#8226; The setting also recalls Joshua&#8217;s earlier curse on anyone who would rebuild Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-26.htm">Joshua 6:26</a>); the lingering barrenness shows that human effort can&#8217;t lift a divine judgment&#8212;only God&#8217;s direct intervention can.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>cast the salt into it</b><p>&#8226;

God is making it clear that the miracle rests on His power, not chemistry&#8212;much like Jesus&#8217; use of mud to open blind eyes (<a href="/john/9-6.htm">John 9:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; The act points forward to believers as &#8220;the salt of the earth&#8221;
