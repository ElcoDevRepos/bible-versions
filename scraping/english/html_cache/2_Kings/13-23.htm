The Hebrew word for "gracious" implies a deep, compassionate love. This grace is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament, as seen in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, where God describes Himself as "compassionate and gracious." It underscores the idea that God's relationship with Israel is based on His character rather than their actions.<p><b>and had compassion on them</b><br>Compassion here indicates a deep emotional response, akin to a parent's love for a child. This reflects God's enduring love and patience, as seen in passages like <a href="/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8-9</a>, where God struggles with the idea of giving up on Israel. It emphasizes that God's actions are motivated by love and mercy, not merely obligation.<p><b>and He turned toward them</b><br>This phrase suggests a deliberate action by God to restore His favor and presence to Israel. It implies a change in relationship status, from one of potential judgment to one of renewed fellowship. This turning is reminiscent of the prodigal son's return in <a href="/luke/15.htm">Luke 15</a>, where the father runs to meet his son, symbolizing God's readiness to forgive and restore.<p><b>because of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</b><br>The covenant mentioned is foundational to Israel's identity and God's dealings with them. It refers to the promises made in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3, 26</a>:3-5, and 28:13-15, where God promises land, descendants, and blessing. This covenant is unconditional, based on God's faithfulness rather than human merit, and is a precursor to the New Covenant through Christ, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>.<p><b>And to this day, the LORD has been unwilling to destroy them</b><br>This phrase indicates the enduring nature of God's promises and His patience. Despite Israel's failures, God remains committed to His covenant. This is echoed in <a href="/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35-37</a>, where God promises that Israel will never cease to be a nation before Him. It highlights God's sovereignty and faithfulness over time.<p><b>or cast them from His presence</b><br>Being in God's presence is a sign of favor and blessing. The threat of being cast away is a serious one, as seen in the exile narratives. However, God's reluctance to do so underscores His desire for relationship and redemption. This is fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus, who reconciles humanity to God, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13-18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who shows grace and compassion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, often straying from God but still under His covenantal care.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham,_isaac,_and_jacob.htm">Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarchs with whom God made His covenant, promising numerous descendants and a land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoahaz.htm">Jehoahaz</a></b><br>The king of Israel during this time, whose reign was marked by idolatry and oppression by the Arameans.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/arameans.htm">Arameans</a></b><br>The oppressors of Israel during Jehoahaz's reign, used by God as a means of discipline.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_unfailing_covenant_faithfulness.htm">God's Unfailing Covenant Faithfulness</a></b><br>Despite Israel's repeated disobedience, God remains faithful to His covenant.
