This practice was prevalent among the surrounding nations, such as the Canaanites, whose religious customs included the worship of Baal and Asherah. Archaeological findings, such as altars and figurines, confirm the widespread nature of these practices in ancient Israel. The Israelites' adoption of idolatry reflects a recurring theme of spiritual adultery, where they turned away from their covenant relationship with Yahweh to follow the gods of the nations around them.<p><b>although the LORD had told them</b><br>God had repeatedly warned the Israelites against idolatry through His prophets and the Law. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-14.htm">Deuteronomy 6:14-15</a> explicitly commands the Israelites not to follow other gods, emphasizing the LORD's jealousy and the consequences of disobedience. The historical books of the Old Testament, including Judges and 1 Samuel, document the cycle of Israel's disobedience, punishment, repentance, and deliverance, highlighting God's consistent communication and warnings to His people.<p><b>&#8220;You shall not do this thing.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the clear and direct command from God against idol worship. The prohibition against idolatry is a central tenet of the Mosaic Covenant, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26:1</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/5-7.htm">Deuteronomy 5:7-9</a>. The command reflects God's desire for exclusive worship and loyalty from His people. The Israelites' failure to heed this command led to their downfall and exile, fulfilling the prophetic warnings given by Moses and later prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah. This command also foreshadows the New Testament teaching of worshiping God in spirit and truth (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>), pointing to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who embodies the true image of God (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The primary subjects of this verse, the Israelites were God's chosen people who were expected to follow His commandments and statutes.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>Objects of worship that the Israelites turned to, in direct disobedience to God's command.

When Israel crossed the line, judgment followed: exile to Assyria confirmed that God&#8217;s word stands unchanged (<a href="/2_kings/17-20.htm">2 Kings 17:20&#8211;23</a>).
