The kingdom was marked by instability and frequent changes in leadership, often through violent means. Pekah, who had seized the throne by assassinating King Pekahiah, faced opposition from within his own ranks. Hoshea's actions are indicative of the internal strife and the lack of a stable succession process in Israel. This period was characterized by alliances and conflicts with surrounding nations, including Assyria, which played a significant role in the region's politics. The conspiracy also highlights the fulfillment of divine judgment against the house of Israel for their continued idolatry and disobedience to God's commandments.<p><b>In the twentieth year of Jotham son of Uzziah,</b><br>Jotham was the king of Judah, the Southern Kingdom, and his reign is noted for his efforts to maintain the worship of Yahweh and his relative stability compared to the Northern Kingdom. The mention of Jotham's reign provides a chronological anchor, situating the events within the broader historical context of the divided monarchy. Jotham's reign is described in <a href="/2_kings/15-32.htm">2 Kings 15:32-38</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/27.htm">2 Chronicles 27</a>, where he is portrayed as a king who did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, although he did not remove the high places. This contrast between the relative faithfulness of Judah and the apostasy of Israel underscores the spiritual decline of the Northern Kingdom.<p><b>Hoshea attacked Pekah, killed him, and reigned in his place.</b><br>Hoshea's assassination of Pekah and subsequent reign marks another violent transition of power in Israel. This act of regicide was not uncommon in the history of the Northern Kingdom, where several kings came to power through similar means. Hoshea's reign, however, would be the last for the Northern Kingdom, as he would eventually become a vassal to the Assyrian Empire before the kingdom's ultimate fall and exile. The political instability and moral decline of Israel during this time are seen as consequences of their departure from the covenant with God. The prophetic voices of Amos and Hosea, who ministered during this period, warned of impending judgment and called for repentance, but their messages went largely unheeded. Hoshea's reign is detailed further in <a href="/2_kings/17.htm">2 Kings 17</a>, where his failure to heed the warnings of the prophets and his reliance on foreign alliances ultimately led to the Assyrian conquest and the end of the Northern Kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hoshea_son_of_elah.htm">Hoshea son of Elah</a></b><br>The conspirator who assassinated Pekah and became king of Israel.
