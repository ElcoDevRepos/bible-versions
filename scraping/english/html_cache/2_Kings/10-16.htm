Jehu's zeal is directed towards eradicating the house of Ahab and the worship of Baal, fulfilling the prophecy given to Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16-17</a>). His actions are seen as a divine mandate to cleanse Israel from idolatry. The term "zeal for the LORD" echoes the fervor of Phinehas in <a href="/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11</a>, who acted decisively against idolatry. Jehu's zeal, however, is complex; while he fulfills God's command, his methods and motivations are later critiqued (<a href="/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4</a>).<p><b>So he had him ride in his chariot.</b><br>Jehu invites Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, to join him in his chariot. This act signifies a public endorsement and partnership. Jehonadab was a leader of the Rechabites, a group known for their strict adherence to Yahweh and rejection of Canaanite practices (Jeremiah 35). By having Jehonadab ride with him, Jehu aligns himself with a respected figure of religious integrity, bolstering his own legitimacy and mission. The chariot, a symbol of power and authority, underscores the seriousness of Jehu's campaign against idolatry. This moment also foreshadows the New Testament call to witness and participate in the mission of God, as seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jehu was anointed as king of Israel and tasked with eradicating the house of Ahab and the worship of Baal.

By saying &#8220;Come with me,&#8221; Jehu invites a respected witness to join him.<p>&#8226; The phrase signals open fellowship, echoing <a href="/amos/3-3.htm">Amos 3:3</a>, &#8220;Can two walk together without agreeing to do so?&#8221;.<p>&#8226; It also safeguards accountability; two are better than one (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Jehu&#8217;s handclasp (<a href="/2_kings/10-15.htm">2 Kings 10:15</a>) seals a covenant-like partnership, much as Jonathan once took David&#8217;s hand in <a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>.<p>The invitation shows confidence that his forthcoming actions align with God&#8217;s revealed will.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and see</b><p>Jehu does not ask Jehonadab merely to hear about events later; he wants him to &#8220;see.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Vision brings confirmation&#8212;&#8220;every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).<p>&#8226; It hints at transparency; Jehu is prepared for scrutiny. Jesus later echoes the same principle, &#8220;Come and see&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>).<p>&#8226; By seeing firsthand, Jehonadab can report faithfully to others, just as Luke investigated events &#8220;from the beginning&#8221; to write an orderly account (<a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3-4</a>).<p>Thus the call to &#8220;see&#8221; underlines the public, verifiable nature of God&#8217;s judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>my zeal for the LORD!</b><p>Jehu&#8217;s zeal is a passionate determination to carry out the specific judgment God pronounced through Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-24</a>).<p>&#8226; Zeal is commendable when anchored in obedience&#8212;&#8220;Phinehas&#8230;was zealous with My zeal&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11</a>).<p>&#8226; God openly affirms Jehu&#8217;s action later: &#8220;You have done well in carrying out what is right in My eyes&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/10-30.htm">2 Kings 10:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet zeal can drift into self-glory. <a href="/hosea/1-4.htm">Hosea 1:4</a> later warns of &#8220;the blood of Jezreel,&#8221; reminding us that even divinely sanctioned judgment can be marred by human excess.<p>&#8226; True zeal must flow from love for God&#8217;s honor, like the Messiah&#8217;s own passion: &#8220;Zeal for Your house has consumed Me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a>).<p>Jehu&#8217;s statement therefore challenges every believer to be fervent (<a href="/romans/12-11.htm">Romans 12:11</a>) yet careful that zeal remains surrendered to God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So he had him ride in his chariot</b><p>By lifting Jehonadab into his royal chariot, Jehu does more than offer a lift.<p>&#8226; He grants shared vantage and status, reminiscent of Joseph riding in Pharaoh&#8217;s second chariot (<a href="/genesis/41-43.htm">Genesis 41:43</a>).<p>&#8226; The gesture publicly aligns Jehonadab with Jehu&#8217;s mission, much like Paul took companions on dangerous journeys (<a href="/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Riding together also positions Jehonadab as a corroborating witness when Jehu reaches Samaria and finishes the purge (<a href="/2_kings/10-17.htm">2 Kings 10:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, the shared ride underscores urgency&#8212;&#8220;the king&#8217;s business required haste&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/21-8.htm">1 Samuel 21:8</a>, KJV).<p>This final action seals Jehonadab&#8217;s role: not a passive observer but an involved partner in the unfolding judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/10-16.htm">2 Kings 10:16</a> captures Jehu&#8217;s heartfelt call for a godly ally to watch&#8212;and certify&#8212;his divinely directed zeal. &#8220;Come with me&#8221; opens the door to accountable fellowship; &#8220;and see&#8221; invites transparent verification; &#8220;my zeal for the LORD&#8221; voices burning obedience to God&#8217;s word; and seating Jehonadab in the chariot visibly unites righteous witness with righteous action.
