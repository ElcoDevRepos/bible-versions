Their seizing of the king, Zedekiah, marks the culmination of the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem, which began in 588 BC. This event fulfills the prophecy given by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/34-2.htm">Jeremiah 34:2-3</a>) that Zedekiah would be captured and delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon. The capture signifies the end of the Davidic reign in Jerusalem, a significant moment in Israel's history.<p><b>and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah</b><br>Riblah was a strategic military location in the land of Hamath, north of Israel, used by the Babylonians as a military headquarters. It was here that Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, held court and made critical decisions regarding his conquests. The transportation of Zedekiah to Riblah underscores the complete control Babylon had over Judah and its king. This movement also fulfills Ezekiel's prophecy (<a href="/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>) that Zedekiah would be taken to Babylon, yet not see it, as he was blinded.<p><b>where they pronounced judgment on him</b><br>The judgment pronounced on Zedekiah was severe, as he was accused of rebellion against Nebuchadnezzar, to whom he had sworn allegiance (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>). This judgment involved the execution of his sons before his eyes and then his own blinding, ensuring that the last sight he saw was the death of his lineage. This act of judgment was not only a political statement but also a fulfillment of divine prophecy, as God had warned through His prophets that disobedience would lead to such consequences (<a href="/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a>). The judgment reflects the broader theme of divine justice and the consequences of breaking covenantal promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_zedekiah.htm">King Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned during the final siege of Jerusalem by the Babylonians.

Nebuchadnezzar with the grandees of his court, perhaps including some dependent princes of the country, held a solemn trial of Zedekiah, as a rebel against his liege lord, in which, no doubt, his breach of oath was made prominent (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-13.htm" title="And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his heart from turning to the LORD God of Israel.">2Chronicles 36:13</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/17-15.htm" title="But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people.
