The movable stands, or bases, were part of the temple furnishings originally crafted by King Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/7-27.htm">1 Kings 7:27-39</a>). These stands were intricately designed and used to support the basins for washing. Ahaz's actions reflect his disregard for the sacred traditions and the temple's sanctity, aligning with his broader pattern of idolatry and political alliances with Assyria (<a href="/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7-8</a>).<p><b>and removed the bronze basin from each of them.</b><br>The bronze basins were essential for the priests' ritual purification, symbolizing the need for cleanliness before approaching God (<a href="/exodus/30-17.htm">Exodus 30:17-21</a>). By removing these basins, Ahaz disrupted the established order of worship and the priestly functions, indicating a shift away from the covenantal practices established by God through Moses. This act can be seen as a physical manifestation of Ahaz's spiritual apostasy.<p><b>He took down the Sea from the bronze oxen that were under it</b><br>The "Sea" refers to the large bronze laver, also crafted by Solomon, which stood on twelve bronze oxen (<a href="/1_kings/7-23.htm">1 Kings 7:23-26</a>). This massive basin was used for the priests' ceremonial washing. The twelve oxen symbolized the twelve tribes of Israel, representing the nation's unity and strength under God's covenant. Ahaz's removal of the Sea from its original position signifies a break from the divinely ordained order and a move towards secularization and foreign influence.<p><b>and put it on a stone base.</b><br>By placing the Sea on a stone base, Ahaz further desecrated the temple's sacred objects. This act may have been an attempt to align with Assyrian practices or to repurpose the temple furnishings for his political agenda. The stone base, lacking the symbolic significance of the bronze oxen, represents a departure from the spiritual heritage of Israel. This change underscores Ahaz's prioritization of political expediency over religious fidelity, contrasting with the faithfulness expected of a Davidic king (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_ahaz.htm">King Ahaz</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned during a time of significant political and spiritual turmoil.

<a href="/2_chronicles/28-24.htm">2 Chronicles 28:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The act likely served two purposes: to strip metal for the tribute he owed Assyria (v. 8) and to erase reminders of a God-centered heritage that challenged his new pagan loyalties (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a> warns against such desecration, yet Ahaz does it to God&#8217;s own house).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and removed the bronze basin from each of them</b><p>&#8226; Each stand carried a smaller basin (laver) used by priests for ceremonial washing before sacrifices (<a href="/exodus/30-17.htm">Exodus 30:17-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Removing those basins hindered the very cleansing God required, signaling that Ahaz cared more for political expedience than for purity before the Lord (<a href="/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16-17</a> contrasts God&#8217;s call to wash with Judah&#8217;s refusal).<p>&#8226;

By lowering the Sea, Ahaz literally brought down what God had elevated, a vivid picture of trading divine glory for human schemes (<a href="/romans/1-23.htm">Romans 1:23</a>).<p>&#8226; The twelve oxen, emblematic of the twelve tribes, were discarded as mere scrap, showing Ahaz&#8217;s disregard for the covenant people themselves (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and put it on a stone base</b><p>&#8226;

The move also aligned temple furniture with pagan altar layout Ahaz had copied from Damascus (<a href="/2_kings/16-10.htm">2 Kings 16:10-11</a>), blending truth with idolatry in direct violation of <a href="/deuteronomy/12-4.htm">Deuteronomy 12:4</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Ahaz&#8217;s alterations were not cosmetic; they were calculated rejections of God&#8217;s authority.

Ahaz spoiled the Temple of its ornamental work, not out of wanton malice, but from dire necessity. He had to provide a present <span class= "ital">for the king of Assyria.</span> Thus these verses are really a continuation of the first statement of <a href="/2_kings/16-10.htm" title="And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.">2Kings 16:10</a>. They inform us how Ahaz managed not to appear empty-handed at Damascus. (So Thenius.) Prof. R. Smith says: "Ahaz, whose treasures had been exhausted by his first tribute, was soon driven by the repeated demands of his masters to strip the Temple even of its ancient bronze-work and other fixed ornaments. The incidental mention of this fact in a fragment of the history of the Temple incorporated in the Book of Kings is sufficient evidence of the straits to which the kingdom of Judah was reduced."<p><span class= "bld">Borders of the bases.</span>--See <a href="/1_kings/7-28.htm" title="And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:">1Kings 7:28</a>. Thenius thinks Ahaz replaced them with unadorned plates, and set the laver up in a different fashion; but the text does not <span class= "ital">say</span> so. (Comp., however, <a href="/2_kings/25-13.htm" title="And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass of them to Babylon.">2Kings 25:13</a>; <a href="/2_kings/25-16.htm" title="The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was without weight.">2Kings 25:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/52-17.htm" title="Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.">Jeremiah 52:17</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And King Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases.</span> By "the bases" are probably meant the stands of the ten brazen layers, which Hiram the Tyrian artificer made for Solomon, and which Solomon placed outside the temple, five on either side of the entrance (<a href="/1_kings/7-39.htm">1 Kings 7:39</a>). The "borders of the bases" seem to have consisted of ornamental panels, on which were carved, in relief, figures of lions, oxen, and cherubim (<a href="/1_kings/7-29.htm">1 Kings 7:29</a>), The object of Ahaz in these mutilations may have been merely destructive, as we find Egyptian kings, after a change of religion, mutilating the tablets, and erasing the inscriptions put up in honor of those gods who had ceased to be in favor with them.
