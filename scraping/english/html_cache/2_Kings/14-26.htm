Throughout the Old Testament, God is depicted as being deeply aware of the suffering of His people. This is reminiscent of <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>, where God sees the affliction of the Israelites in Egypt. The affliction here refers to the hardships faced by the Israelites due to external threats and internal strife during the reign of Jeroboam II. This period was marked by political instability and moral decline, which led to suffering among the people.<p><b>both slave and free,</b><br>This phrase underscores the universality of the suffering experienced by the Israelites, affecting all social classes. In ancient Israel, society was divided into various classes, including slaves and free citizens. The mention of both groups indicates that the affliction was widespread and indiscriminate. This reflects the social and economic challenges of the time, where even those who were free were not exempt from hardship. It also emphasizes God's concern for all individuals, regardless of their social status.<p><b>was very bitter.</b><br>The term "bitter" conveys the severity and intensity of the suffering. In biblical literature, bitterness often symbolizes extreme distress and hardship. This can be seen in the story of Naomi in the Book of Ruth, where she describes her life as bitter due to her losses. The use of "very" intensifies the description, indicating that the Israelites' situation was dire and desperate, requiring divine intervention.<p><b>There was no one to help Israel,</b><br>This phrase highlights the isolation and vulnerability of Israel at this time. Historically, Israel often relied on alliances with neighboring nations for military and political support. However, during this period, such alliances were either unavailable or ineffective. This situation underscores the need for divine intervention, as human efforts were insufficient. It also foreshadows the coming of a savior figure, a theme that is fulfilled in the New Testament with the arrival of Jesus Christ, who is seen as the ultimate helper and redeemer of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is attentive to the suffering of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, experiencing severe affliction and distress during this period.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/affliction_of_israel.htm">Affliction of Israel</a></b><br>The suffering and oppression faced by the Israelites, which was severe and without relief.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bond_nor_free.htm">Bond nor Free</a></b><br>A phrase indicating that all classes of people in Israel, both slaves and free citizens, were suffering without any helper.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_awareness_of_suffering.htm">God's Awareness of Suffering</a></b><br>God is not distant or indifferent to the suffering of His people.

The repetition is perhaps to be accounted for by the desire of the writer to explain how it came to pass that so great a deliverance was granted to Israel under a king who maintained the worship of the calves. He views it as the consequence of God's infinite compassion, and of the extreme bitterness of Israel's sufferings under the Syrians (comp. <a href="/2_kings/13-7.htm">2 Kings 13:7</a> and <a href="/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For there was not any shut up, nor any left</span> (see the comment on 1 Kings 14:10), <span class="cmt_word">nor any helper for Israel.</span> Apart from Jehovah, Israel had no one to come to her aid.
