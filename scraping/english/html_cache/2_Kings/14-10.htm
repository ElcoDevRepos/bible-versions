Edom, located to the southeast of Judah, was a frequent adversary of Israel and Judah. The victory over Edom is recorded earlier in <a href="/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>, where Amaziah struck down ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt and captured Sela. This victory was significant as it reasserted Judah's dominance over Edom, a nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, highlighting the ongoing conflict between the descendants of these two patriarchs.<p><b>and your heart has become proud</b><br>Amaziah's pride following his victory is a common biblical theme where success leads to arrogance. <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a> warns that "pride goes before destruction," illustrating the spiritual danger of pride. Amaziah's pride is a cautionary tale, reminding believers of the importance of humility and reliance on God rather than personal achievements.<p><b>Glory in that and stay at home</b><br>This phrase is a sarcastic admonition from Jehoash, king of Israel, advising Amaziah to be content with his victory over Edom and not to seek further conflict. The advice to "stay at home" suggests that Amaziah should enjoy his success without overreaching. This reflects a broader biblical principle of contentment and the dangers of overambition, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-6.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:6</a>, which values tranquility over striving.<p><b>Why should you stir up trouble so that you fall&#8212;you and Judah with you?</b><br>Jehoash warns Amaziah of the consequences of unnecessary conflict. The phrase "stir up trouble" implies initiating conflict without just cause, which can lead to downfall. Historically, this foreshadows the eventual defeat of Amaziah by Jehoash, as recorded later in <a href="/2_kings/14-12.htm">2 Kings 14:12-14</a>. The warning extends beyond Amaziah to the entire nation of Judah, emphasizing the collective impact of a leader's decisions. This serves as a reminder of the interconnectedness of leaders and their people, as well as the potential for one person's pride to lead to widespread consequences, a theme echoed in the story of King Saul and his disobedience in <a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>King of Judah who became overconfident after defeating Edom.
