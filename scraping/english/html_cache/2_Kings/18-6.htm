Hezekiah's faithfulness is significant in the context of the divided kingdom, where the northern kingdom of Israel had already fallen to Assyria due to their unfaithfulness. His commitment is reminiscent of the covenantal faithfulness required by God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, where the Israelites are commanded to love the LORD with all their heart, soul, and strength.<p><b>and did not turn from following Him;</b><br>Hezekiah's unwavering dedication is emphasized here, indicating his consistent obedience and refusal to deviate from God's path. This steadfastness is a key theme in the Deuteronomic history, where blessings are promised for obedience and curses for disobedience (Deuteronomy 28). Hezekiah's reign is marked by religious reforms, including the removal of high places and the destruction of idols, aligning with the call to exclusive worship of Yahweh.<p><b>he kept the commandments</b><br>This phrase underscores Hezekiah's adherence to the Mosaic Law, which was central to Israel's identity and relationship with God. His observance of the commandments reflects a return to the foundational principles given at Sinai, contrasting with the syncretism and idolatry that plagued Judah. This obedience is a model of covenant faithfulness, akin to the ideal king described in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>, who is to read and follow the law diligently.<p><b>that the LORD had given Moses.</b><br>The reference to Moses connects Hezekiah's actions to the foundational covenant at Sinai, where the law was given as a guide for Israel's life and worship. This continuity with Moses' covenant underscores the legitimacy and divine authority of Hezekiah's reforms. It also points to the prophetic tradition, where leaders are called to return to the covenantal roots, as seen in the ministries of prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah. The Mosaic Law serves as a type of Christ, who fulfills the law and prophets, as noted in <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to reform the religious practices of his people by removing idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Hezekiah reigned.
