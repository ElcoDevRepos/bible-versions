Her marriage to Jehoram, king of Judah, was likely a political alliance between the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah. Ahaziah, her son, became king of Judah but reigned for only one year before his death. His death occurred as a result of Jehu's purge, which was a divinely sanctioned judgment against the house of Ahab (2 Kings 9-10). Athaliah's reaction to her son's death reflects the political instability and the influence of her family's legacy of violence and idolatry.<p><b>she proceeded to annihilate all the royal heirs</b><br>Athaliah's attempt to destroy the royal line of David was a direct threat to the Davidic covenant, which promised that David's lineage would endure forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). Her actions can be seen as an attempt to secure her own power by eliminating any potential rivals. This act of violence is reminiscent of other biblical accounts where rulers sought to eliminate threats to their throne, such as Pharaoh's decree to kill Hebrew male infants (<a href="/exodus/1-22.htm">Exodus 1:22</a>) and Herod's massacre of the innocents (<a href="/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16</a>). Athaliah's usurpation of the throne also highlights the spiritual and moral decline in Judah, as she introduced Baal worship into the kingdom, further distancing the people from their covenant with God. Despite her efforts, God's providence ensured the survival of the Davidic line through Joash, who was hidden by Jehosheba, the wife of the priest Jehoiada, preserving the messianic lineage that would ultimately lead to Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/athaliah.htm">Athaliah</a></b><br>The mother of Ahaziah, she was the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, and the wife of Jehoram, king of Judah.

She was married to Jehoram, son of Jehoshaphat, probably in the lifetime of his father, to cement the alliance concluded between Ahab and Jehoshaphat against the Syrians (<a href="/1_kings/22-2.htm">1 Kings 22:2-4</a>). She inherited much of her mother Jezebel's character, obtained an unlimited ascendancy over her husband, Jehoram, and kept her son Ahaziah in leading-strings. It was unquestionably through her influence that Jehoram was prevailed upon to introduce the Baal-worship into Judah (<a href="/2_kings/8-18.htm">2 Kings 8:18</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/2-5.htm">2 Chronicles 2:5, 11</a>), and Ahaziah prevailed upon to maintain it (<a href="/2_kings/8-27.htm">2 Kings 8:27</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/22-3.htm">2 Chronicles 22:3</a>, "He also Talked in the ways of the house of Ahab: <span class="accented">for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly"</span>). On the death of Ahaziah, she found her position seriously imperiled. The crown would have passed naturally to one of her grandchildren, the eldest of the sons of Ahaziah. She would have lost her position of <span class="accented">gebirah</span>, or queen mother, which would have passed to the widow of Ahaziah, the mother of the new sovereign. If she did not at once lose all influence, at any rate a counter-influence to hers would have been established; and this might well have been that of the high priest, who was closely connected by marriage with the royal family. Under these circumstances, she took the bold resolution described in the next clause. <span class="cmt_word">She arose and destroyed the seed royal.</span> She issued her orders, and had all the members of the house of David on whom she could lay her hands put to death. The royal house had already been greatly depleted by Jehoram's murder of his brothers (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-4.htm">2 Chronicles 21:4</a>), by Arab marauders (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-17.htm">2 Chronicles 21:17</a>), and by Jehu's murder of the "brethren of Ahaziah" (<a href="/2_kings/10-14.htm">2 Kings 10:14</a>); but it is clear that Ahaziah had left several sons behind him, and some of his "brethren" had also, in all probability, left issue. There may also have been many other descendants of David in Judah, belonging to other branches of the house than that of Rehoboam. Athaliah, no doubt, endeavored to make a clean sweep, and get rid of them all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/11-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Athaliah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1506;&#1458;&#1514;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7791;al&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
