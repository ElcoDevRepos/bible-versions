Joash, also known as Jehoash, was the king of Judah who initially followed the ways of the Lord under the guidance of Jehoiada the priest. However, after Jehoiada's death, Joash's reign was marked by a departure from faithfulness, leading to dissatisfaction among his servants. This internal uprising reflects the broader biblical theme of the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>and formed a conspiracy</b><br>The act of forming a conspiracy suggests a premeditated plan to overthrow Joash. In the biblical context, conspiracies often arise when leaders fail to uphold justice and righteousness. This mirrors other biblical accounts, such as the conspiracy against King David by his son Absalom. The formation of a conspiracy against Joash can be seen as divine retribution for his apostasy and the murder of Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, as recorded in <a href="/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20-22</a>.<p><b>and killed him at Beth-millo</b><br>Beth-millo is a location associated with fortifications or a citadel, possibly part of the defenses of Jerusalem. The assassination of Joash at this site underscores the vulnerability of even fortified places when God's protection is withdrawn. The killing of Joash at Beth-millo fulfills the prophecy of judgment against him for his unfaithfulness and the shedding of innocent blood. This event serves as a reminder of the biblical principle that God holds leaders accountable for their actions.<p><b>on the road down to Silla</b><br>The mention of the road down to Silla provides a geographical context, indicating a specific location where the assassination took place. Silla's exact location is uncertain, but it is thought to be near Jerusalem. The road signifies a transition or movement, possibly symbolizing Joash's fall from power and grace. This detail emphasizes the historical reality of the event and situates it within the physical landscape of ancient Judah. The road can also be seen as a metaphor for Joash's spiritual decline, leading to his ultimate downfall.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>King of Judah who initially did what was right in the eyes of the Lord under the guidance of Jehoiada the priest but later turned away from God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/beth-millo.htm">Beth-millo</a></b><br>A location in Jerusalem, possibly a fortress or a significant structure, where Joash was assassinated.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/silla.htm">Silla</a></b><br>A place mentioned in the context of Joash's assassination, indicating the route or area where the event occurred.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/conspiracy.htm">Conspiracy</a></b><br>The act of plotting against Joash by his own servants, leading to his assassination.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants.htm">Servants</a></b><br>The individuals who conspired against and ultimately killed Joash, highlighting betrayal from within his own ranks.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_apostasy.htm">The Danger of Apostasy</a></b><br>Joash's life serves as a warning about the dangers of turning away from God after starting well.

Scripture repeatedly records servants turning against an unfaithful ruler as a means of divine judgment (<a href="/1_kings/16-9.htm">1 Kings 16:9-10</a>; <a href="/2_kings/21-23.htm">2 Kings 21:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse reminds us that leadership is a stewardship; when a king abandons God&#8217;s ways, God may allow that very court to become His instrument of discipline (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and formed a conspiracy</b><p>&#8226; A conspiracy suggests careful, premeditated action, not a spontaneous outburst.

The finality of this phrase highlights that divine warnings had run their course. God had sent prophets (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-19.htm">2 Chronicles 24:19</a>), had given Joash victories (<a href="/2_kings/13-17.htm">2 Kings 13:17</a>), and had allowed Aramean invasions as wake-up calls (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-23.htm">2 Chronicles 24:23-24</a>). Joash ignored them all.<p>&#8226; The execution by his own staff underscores <a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>: &#8220;your sin will find you out.&#8221; Even the palace walls could not shield him from righteous recompense.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at Beth-millo</b><p>&#8226; Beth-millo (&#8220;the House of the Millo&#8221;) lay within or just outside Jerusalem&#8217;s fortifications (<a href="/1_kings/9-24.htm">1 Kings 9:24</a>). Solomon had once strengthened this area to secure the kingdom; now it witnesses a king&#8217;s demise, showing how earthly defenses cannot replace obedience (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Millo also appears in the story of Abimelech&#8217;s treachery (<a href="/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6</a>). Both events involve betrayal inside the covenant community, offering a sobering parallel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on the road down to Silla</b><p>&#8226; Silla&#8217;s precise location is uncertain, but the phrase &#8220;on the road down&#8221; paints a picture of descent&#8212;both literal and spiritual. Joash&#8217;s life had taken a downward trajectory ever since he turned from the Lord (<a href="/revelation/2-4.htm">Revelation 2:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail demonstrates the historical rootedness of Scripture: real people, real places, real consequences (<a href="/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20</a> records God&#8217;s measured judgment on King Joash. The servants&#8217; uprising, their plotted conspiracy, the fatal blow, and the named sites all testify that when a leader abandons covenant faithfulness&#8212;especially after great light and privilege&#8212;God may use even those closest to him as instruments of justice. The verse stands as a sober reminder that no position, fortress, or entourage can shield a heart that has turned away from the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">His servants.</span>--His immediate attendants.
