The request for a "new bowl" signifies purity and a fresh start, symbolizing the new covenant and the transformative power of God. In biblical times, a new vessel was often used in religious rituals to signify holiness and separation from the old, impure ways. This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who brings a new covenant and purifies believers.<p><b>&#8220;and put some salt in it.&#8221;</b><br>Salt in the ancient Near East was a valuable commodity, often used for preservation and purification. In <a href="/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>, salt is required in grain offerings, symbolizing the enduring nature of God's covenant. Here, salt represents purification and healing, foreshadowing the purifying work of Christ. Salt is also a metaphor for the influence of believers in the world, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>, where Jesus calls His followers the "salt of the earth."<p><b>So they brought it to him,</b><br>The obedience of the men of Jericho in bringing the bowl with salt to Elisha demonstrates faith and trust in the prophet's instructions. This act of faith is reminiscent of other biblical instances where obedience to God's commands leads to miraculous outcomes, such as Naaman's healing in <a href="/2_kings/5.htm">2 Kings 5</a>. The willingness to follow Elisha's seemingly simple request highlights the importance of faith and obedience in experiencing God's power and provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God and the successor of Elijah.

A brand-new bowl asserts that the coming miracle is unstained by earlier use or superstition, echoing how Moses threw a clean stick into bitter waters (<a href="/exodus/15-25.htm">Exodus 15:25</a>).<p>&#8226; The request underscores God&#8217;s pattern of employing simple, tangible items&#8212;like Gideon&#8217;s pitchers (<a href="/judges/7-16.htm">Judges 7:16</a>) or the widow&#8217;s jars (<a href="/2_kings/4-3.htm">2 Kings 4:3</a>)&#8212;so that His power, not the object, receives the glory (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he replied,</b><p>&#8226; Elisha&#8217;s immediate response shows confidence in the Lord he serves (<a href="/1_kings/17-24.htm">1 Kings 17:24</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-8.htm">2 Kings 5:8</a>).<p>&#8226; His authority flows from his prophetic office, freshly affirmed when Elijah&#8217;s mantle fell on him (<a href="/2_kings/2-14.htm">2 Kings 2:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; By answering decisively, Elisha displays faith that God can restore what sin or the curse has damaged, echoing Elijah&#8217;s bold commands over drought and rain (<a href="/1_kings/18-41.htm">1 Kings 18:41-45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and put some salt in it.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Salt, biblically, symbolizes preservation, covenant faithfulness, and purification (<a href="/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-19.htm">Numbers 18:19</a>; <a href="/mark/9-50.htm">Mark 9:50</a>).<p>&#8226; Adding salt to the new bowl pictures God&#8217;s ability to reverse corruption&#8212;turning brackish water sweet (<a href="/2_kings/2-21.htm">2 Kings 2:21</a>), just as Jesus calls His followers &#8220;the salt of the earth&#8221; to halt moral decay (<a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The act also underlines that the remedy comes from God through a visible sign; salt cannot naturally heal water, so the miracle is unmistakably divine (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>; <a href="/john/2-9.htm">John 2:9-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So they brought it to him.</b><p>&#8226; The people&#8217;s obedience positions them to witness God&#8217;s power, paralleling Naaman&#8217;s eventual compliance with Elisha&#8217;s directions (<a href="/2_kings/5-14.htm">2 Kings 5:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Faith often moves from hearing to action (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>); by handing Elisha the prepared bowl, the townsfolk show trust beyond mere words.<p>&#8226; Their cooperation illustrates how God invites human participation in His redemptive work&#8212;like filling waterpots at Cana (<a href="/john/2-7.htm">John 2:7</a>) or distributing loaves and fish (<a href="/mark/6-41.htm">Mark 6:41-43</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Elisha&#8217;s call for a new, salt-filled bowl sets the stage for God to cleanse Jericho&#8217;s polluted spring.
