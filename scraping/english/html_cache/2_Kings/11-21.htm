His survival and eventual kingship are a testament to God's providence and the fulfillment of His promises to David's lineage. Joash was hidden in the temple for six years by his aunt Jehosheba and the priest Jehoiada, protecting him from the murderous intentions of Athaliah, who sought to destroy the royal line. This act of preservation highlights the importance of the Davidic covenant, where God promised that David's descendants would continue to rule. Joash's young age also emphasizes his dependence on the guidance of Jehoiada, the high priest, who played a crucial role in his early reign. This situation mirrors other instances in Scripture where God uses the weak or young to accomplish His purposes, such as David's anointing as king while still a shepherd boy.<p><b>when he became king</b><br>Joash's enthronement marks a pivotal moment in Judah's history, as it signifies the restoration of the Davidic line after Athaliah's usurpation. His reign began with a covenant renewal, where the people and the king pledged allegiance to the Lord, highlighting the theocratic nature of Israel's monarchy. Joash's kingship is a reminder of God's faithfulness to His promises, despite human failures and attempts to thwart His plans. The coronation of Joash also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic covenant in Jesus Christ, the eternal King from David's line, who would establish an everlasting kingdom. Joash's reign, beginning at such a tender age, underscores the theme of divine sovereignty and the idea that God can raise leaders according to His will, regardless of human expectations or circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>The young king of Judah who began his reign at the tender age of seven.
