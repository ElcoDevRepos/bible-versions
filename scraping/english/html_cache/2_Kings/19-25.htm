It suggests that the audience, likely the Assyrian king Sennacherib, is being reminded of God's sovereignty and past actions. This phrase emphasizes the importance of listening to God's word and recognizing His authority, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>Long ago I ordained it;</b><br>This phrase highlights God's eternal plan and foreknowledge. It reflects the biblical theme that God is in control of history and events, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>, where God declares the end from the beginning. The use of "ordained" suggests a divine decree, indicating that what is happening is part of God's predetermined plan.<p><b>in days of old I planned it.</b><br>This reinforces the idea of God's timeless sovereignty. The reference to "days of old" connects to the ancient promises and covenants God made with Israel, such as those with Abraham, Moses, and David. It underscores the continuity of God's plan throughout history, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/33-11.htm">Psalm 33:11</a>.<p><b>Now I have brought it to pass,</b><br>This indicates the fulfillment of God's plan in the present moment. It shows that God's purposes are not just theoretical but are actively being realized in history. This aligns with the biblical narrative of God intervening in human affairs, as seen in the Exodus and the conquest of Canaan.<p><b>that you should crush fortified cities into piles of rubble.</b><br>This phrase describes the specific action God has allowed the Assyrians to undertake as part of His judgment. The imagery of crushing fortified cities reflects the historical reality of Assyrian military campaigns, known for their brutality and effectiveness. It also serves as a reminder of God's power to use even pagan nations to accomplish His purposes, as seen in <a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6-11</a>. This can be seen as a type of Christ in that, just as God used Assyria to fulfill His purposes, He later uses Christ to bring about redemption and the ultimate fulfillment of His plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah during the time of the Assyrian threat.

Years before, when Assyria first became threatening, Isaiah, speaking in the person of Jehovah, had exclaimed, "O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine indignation.
