His response was to Ahaz, the king of Judah, who sought Assyrian assistance against the coalition of Rezin, king of Aram, and Pekah, king of Israel. This reflects the political dynamics of the time, where smaller nations often sought alliances with powerful empires for protection. The Assyrian Empire was known for its military prowess and expansionist policies, which often involved responding to requests for aid in exchange for vassalage or tribute.<p><b>marched up to Damascus, and captured it</b><br>Damascus was the capital of Aram (Syria) and a significant city in the ancient Near East. The capture of Damascus by Assyria marked a pivotal moment in the region's history, as it demonstrated Assyria's dominance and the weakening of Aram. This event fulfilled the prophecy found in <a href="/isaiah/7-16.htm">Isaiah 7:16</a>, where it was foretold that the land of the two kings Ahaz dreaded would be laid waste. The capture of Damascus also had significant implications for the balance of power in the region, as it removed a key player from the anti-Assyrian coalition.<p><b>He took its people to Kir as captives</b><br>The deportation of the people of Damascus to Kir reflects the Assyrian policy of mass deportations, which aimed to prevent rebellion by displacing conquered peoples. Kir is mentioned in <a href="/amos/1-5.htm">Amos 1:5</a> as a place associated with Aram, suggesting it was a region under Assyrian control where the Arameans were resettled. This practice of deportation was intended to integrate conquered peoples into the Assyrian Empire and reduce the likelihood of uprisings by breaking their connection to their homeland.<p><b>and put Rezin to death</b><br>Rezin was the last king of Aram, and his death marked the end of Aramean independence. The execution of Rezin by the Assyrians was a common practice for dealing with defeated kings, serving as a warning to others who might oppose Assyrian rule. This act also fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/7.htm">Isaiah 7:1-9</a>, where it was foretold that Rezin's plans against Judah would not succeed. The death of Rezin and the fall of Damascus underscored the futility of opposing the Assyrian Empire and highlighted the consequences of political alliances that went against God's will for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_assyria.htm">King of Assyria</a></b><br>The ruler of the Assyrian Empire, a dominant power in the ancient Near East, known for its military prowess and expansionist policies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/damascus.htm">Damascus</a></b><br>The capital city of Aram (modern-day Syria), a significant political and trade center in the ancient world.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rezin.htm">Rezin</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria) who opposed the kingdom of Judah and was ultimately defeated and killed by the Assyrians.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/kir.htm">Kir</a></b><br>A location to which the inhabitants of Damascus were exiled.

The great conquering monarchs of the East were always glad to receive small states into their alliance for a time, and even to allow them a shadow of independence, while they made use of their services against their near neighbors. Tiglath-pileser was already bent on conquering Samaria and Damascus, and could not fail to perceive that their subjugation would be greatly facilitated by his having the support of Judaea. <span class="cmt_word">For the King of Assyria</span> - rather, <span class="accented">and the King of Assyria - went</span> up against Damascus. Damascus was naturally attacked first, as nearer to Assyria than Samaria, and also as more wealthy and more important. Tiglath-pileser's records contain an account of the campaign, but it is unfortunately much mutilated. We may gather from it, however, that Resin began by meeting his assailant in the field, and engaging him in a battle which was stoutly contested. Eventually the Assyrians were victorious, and Resin, having fled hastily to Damascus, shut himself up within its walls. Tiglath-pileser pursued him, laid siege to the city, and eventually took it, though not perhaps till it had resisted for above a year ('Eponym Canon,' p. 65). The Assyrian monarch thus describes the siege (ibid., p. 121): "Damascus, his city, I besieged, and like a caged bird I enclosed him. His forests, the trees of which were without number, I cut down; I did not leave a tree standing. [I burnt] Hadara, the house of the father of Rezin, King of Syria." <span class="cmt_word">And took it.</span> The ancient Damascene kingdom, which had lasted from the time of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/11-24.htm">1 Kings 11:24</a>), was thus brought to an end. Damascus gave the Assyrians no further trouble; and within little more than thirty years it had been so absolutely absorbed into the empire that its governor was one of the Assyrian eponyms ('Eponym Canon,' p. 68). The capture of the city, foretold by <a href="/amos/1-4.htm">Amos 1:4, 5</a>, was followed by the destruction of its walls and palaces. <span class="cmt_word">And carried the people of it captive.</span> The system of transplanting large masses of the population from one part of the empire to another seems to have begun with Tiglath-pileser. In his very imperfect and fragmentary annals we find the removal of above thirty thousand captives recorded, of whom more than half are women. His example was followed by his successors on a still larger scale. <span class="cmt_word">To Kir</span>. The situation of "Kir" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>) is wholly uncertain. It has been identified with Kis (Elam or Kissia); with the country watered by the Kur; with Kourena or Koura, on the river Mardus; with Karine, the modern Kirrind; with Kirkhi near Diartekr; and with Kiransi in the Urumiyeh country. But the similarity of sound is the sole basis for each and all of these identifications.
