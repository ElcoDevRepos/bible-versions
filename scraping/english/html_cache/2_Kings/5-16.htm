His role as a prophet is to convey God's messages and perform miracles, demonstrating God's power and authority. Elisha's response is significant as it reflects his commitment to God's will and his role as a servant of the Lord.<p><b>&#8220;As surely as the LORD lives</b><br>This phrase is an oath, emphasizing the certainty and seriousness of Elisha's statement. It reflects the Hebrew understanding of God as the living God, contrasting with the lifeless idols worshiped by surrounding nations. This expression is used frequently in the Old Testament to affirm the truthfulness of a statement (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/14-39.htm">1 Samuel 14:39</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/4-2.htm">Jeremiah 4:2</a>).<p><b>before whom I stand</b><br>This indicates Elisha's position as a servant and representative of God. The phrase suggests a posture of readiness and obedience, similar to a courtier standing before a king. It underscores the prophet's direct accountability to God, as seen in other prophetic contexts (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>).<p><b>I will not accept it.&#8221;</b><br>Elisha's refusal to accept gifts from Naaman highlights the principle that God's grace and healing cannot be bought. This act distinguishes the God of Israel from pagan deities, whose favor was often thought to be purchased. It also prefigures the New Testament teaching of salvation as a free gift (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><b>And although Naaman urged him to accept it</b><br>Naaman's insistence reflects the cultural norm of offering gifts in gratitude, especially after receiving a significant favor. In the ancient Near East, it was customary to reward those who performed miraculous deeds. Naaman's persistence also shows his misunderstanding of the nature of God's grace.<p><b>he refused.</b><br>Elisha's steadfast refusal serves as a testimony to the integrity of God's servants and the purity of God's work. It reinforces the message that divine blessings are not commodities to be traded. This act of refusal can be seen as a type of Christ, who also offered grace freely and without cost (<a href="/matthew/10-8.htm">Matthew 10:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet in Israel, successor to Elijah, known for his miracles and strong faith in God.

It underscores absolute confidence that the God who just healed Naaman is alive and active, not a distant idea (<a href="/jeremiah/10-10.htm">Jeremiah 10:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Elisha wants Naaman to know that every decision he makes flows from loyalty to the living LORD, not human custom or reward.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Before whom I stand</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;before whom I stand&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226;

his accountability is vertical before it is horizontal (<a href="/romans/14-4.htm">Romans 14:4</a>).<p>&#8226; By highlighting this relationship, Elisha reminds Naaman that the miracle came from God alone, not from any human power (<a href="/psalms/115-1.htm">Psalm 115:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will not accept it</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;I will not accept it.&#8221;<p>&#8226;

(Comp. <a href="/acts/8-20.htm" title="But Peter said to him, Your money perish with you, because you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.">Acts 8:20</a>.) Such may have been Elisha's feeling. His refusal, strongly contrasting with the conduct of ordinary prophets, Israelite and heathen (comp. <a href="/context/1_samuel/9-6.htm" title="And he said to him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he said comes surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can show us our way that we should go.">1Samuel 9:6-9</a>), would make a deep impression upon Naaman and his retinue.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But he said, As the Lord liveth, before whom I stand, I will receive none.</span> Elisha regards it as best, under the circumstances, to refuse the offered recompense. It was not compulsory on him so to act; for the precept, "Freely ye have received, freely give" (<a href="/matthew/10-8.htm">Matthew 10:8</a>), had not been yet uttered. Pious Israelites commonly brought gifts to the prophets whom they consulted (<a href="/1_samuel/9-7.htm">1 Samuel 9:7, 8</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-3.htm">1 Kings 14:3</a>). But, in the case of a foreigner, ignorant hitherto of true religion, whom it was important to impress favorably, and, if possible, win over to the faith, Elisha deemed it advisable to take no reward. Naaman was thus taught that Jehovah was his true Healer, the prophet the mere instrument, and that it was to Jehovah that his gratitude, his thanks, and his offerings were due. <span class="cmt_word">And he urged him to take it; but he refused.</span> Contests of politeness are common in the East, where the one party offers to give and even insists on giving, while the other makes a pretence of declining; but here both parties were in earnest, and the gift was absolutely declined. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/5-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But Elisha replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1429;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
