Her role as a female prophet in a predominantly patriarchal society highlights the inclusivity of God's calling. Huldah's presence in the narrative underscores the importance of prophecy in guiding the nation of Israel. Her authority and recognition as a prophetess are significant, as she was consulted by high-ranking officials, indicating her respected status.<p><b>This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine authority behind Huldah's message. The use of "the LORD, the God of Israel" reaffirms the covenant relationship between God and His chosen people. It is a reminder of God's sovereignty and His ongoing communication with Israel through prophets. This introduction is typical of prophetic declarations, ensuring that the message is not of human origin but from God Himself.<p><b>Tell the man who sent you</b><br>The "man" referred to here is King Josiah, who had sent his officials to inquire of the Lord after the Book of the Law was found in the temple. This phrase indicates the direct and personal nature of God's message to Josiah. It reflects the biblical principle that God communicates with leaders to guide them in their governance. Josiah's initiative to seek God's guidance demonstrates his commitment to spiritual reform and his desire to align the nation with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/huldah_the_prophetess.htm">Huldah the Prophetess</a></b><br>A respected female prophet in Jerusalem during the reign of King Josiah.

Earlier in the same chapter, Judah had drifted into idolatry, yet God still had His spokesperson ready (compare <a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>, where He preserves a faithful remnant).<p>&#8226; The historical detail encourages us to read the passage literally: a real woman, in a real place, at a real moment, speaking God&#8217;s real words to real leaders.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says</b><p>&#8226; Huldah&#8217;s opening formula echoes the familiar prophetic &#8220;Thus says the LORD,&#8221; anchoring her message in divine&#8212;not personal&#8212;authority (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; She identifies the LORD as &#8220;the God of Israel,&#8221; recalling the covenant name that ties God to His people and His promises (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>). The title reinforces that God&#8217;s upcoming warning springs from His covenant faithfulness: He judges sin precisely because He is loyal to His word (<a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; By front-loading the divine source, the verse teaches us to submit to Scripture&#8217;s authority before we even hear the content. Like Josiah&#8217;s envoys, we are called to receive God&#8217;s word with humility (<a href="/james/1-21.htm">James 1:21</a>) rather than treat it as human opinion (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also foreshadows the hope that, although judgment is coming, the same covenant LORD will ultimately restore any who repent (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Tell the man who sent you</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The man&#8221; is King Josiah (<a href="/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3</a>), yet Huldah uses a generic term, subtly reminding even a godly king that before God he is simply a man&#8212;finite and accountable (<a href="/psalms/103-14.htm">Psalm 103:14</a>; <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>).<p>&#8226; God speaks personally. The message is not abstract theology but a direct word aimed at a specific heart (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>, where Nathan confronts David). Scripture often pairs collective revelation with personal application (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The delegation&#8217;s mission models healthy spiritual leadership: when faced with newfound Scripture (the rediscovered Book of the Law, v. 8), Josiah seeks prophetic confirmation, demonstrating a heart that wants to align national life with God&#8217;s word (<a href="/2_kings/23-1.htm">2 Kings 23:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, the phrase underscores our duty to relay God&#8217;s unaltered message. We do not edit or soften His word; we carry it faithfully to those who need to hear (<a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2, 5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Huldah&#8217;s brief introduction, her authoritative &#8220;This is what the LORD says,&#8221; and the personal directive &#8220;Tell the man who sent you&#8221; together highlight the reliability of Scripture, the sovereignty of God in choosing His messengers, and the personal accountability of every listener&#8212;even kings&#8212;to God&#8217;s revealed word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-20.</span> <span class="accented">- The prophecy of Huldah</span>. The word of the Lord comes to Huldah with the arrival of the messengers, or perhaps previous to it, and she is at once ready with her reply. It divides itself into two parts. In vers. 15-17 the inquiry made is answered - answered affirmatively, "Yes, the fiat is gone forth; it is too late to avert the sentence; the anger of the Lord is kindled, and <span class="accented">shall not be quenched</span>." After this, in vers. 18-20, a special message is sent to the king, granting him an arrest of judgment, on account of his self-humiliation and abasement. "Because his heart was tender, and he had humbled himself before Jehovah, the evil should not happen in his day." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And she said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel.</span> Huldah is the only example of a prophetess in Israel, who seems to rank on the same footing with the prophets. Miriam (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>), Deborah (<a href="/judges/4-4.htm">Judges 4:4</a>), Isaiah s wife (<a href="/isaiah/8-2.htm">Isaiah 8:2</a>), and Anna (<a href="/luke/2-36.htm">Luke 2:36</a>) are called "prophetesses," but in a secondary sense, as holy women, having a certain gift of song or prediction from God. Huldah has the full prophetic afflatus, and delivers God's oracles, just as Isaiah and Jeremiah do. The case is a remarkable exception to the general rule that women should "keel) silence in the Churches." <span class="cmt_word">Tell the man that sent you to me.</span> The contrast between this unceremonious phrase and that used in ver. 18 is best explained by Thenius, who says, "In the first part Huldah has only the subject-matter in mind, while in ver. 18, in the quieter flow of her words, she takes notice of the state of mind of the particular person who sent to make the inquiry." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/22-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And [Huldah] said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;t&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
