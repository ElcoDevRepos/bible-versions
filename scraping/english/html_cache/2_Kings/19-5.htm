Hezekiah is known for his faithfulness to God, as described in <a href="/2_kings/18-5.htm">2 Kings 18:5-6</a>, where he is praised for his trust in the Lord. The context of this passage is the Assyrian threat under King Sennacherib, who had invaded Judah and was besieging Jerusalem. Hezekiah's decision to send his servants indicates his reliance on divine guidance rather than solely on military or political solutions.<p><b>went to Isaiah</b><br>Isaiah was a major prophet in Judah, whose ministry spanned the reigns of several kings, including Hezekiah. He is known for his prophecies concerning both immediate events and future messianic expectations. Isaiah's role as a prophet was to communicate God's will to the people and the king. The act of going to Isaiah signifies seeking divine counsel, reflecting the belief that prophets were God's mouthpieces. This event is part of a larger narrative where Isaiah reassures Hezekiah of God's deliverance, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/37.htm">Isaiah 37</a>, which parallels this account. Isaiah's prophecies often pointed to the coming of a Messiah, which Christians interpret as fulfilled in Jesus Christ, highlighting the continuity of God's plan through history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_hezekiah.htm">King Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during a time of great threat from the Assyrian Empire.
