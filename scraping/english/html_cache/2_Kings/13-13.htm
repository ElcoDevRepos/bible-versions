The expression "rested with his fathers" is a common biblical euphemism for death, suggesting a peaceful transition and continuity with the ancestors. It reflects the belief in an afterlife or a continued existence beyond death, which was a common understanding in ancient Israel. This phrase also implies a sense of honor and respect, as being gathered to one's ancestors was considered a dignified end.<p><b>and Jeroboam succeeded him on the throne</b><br>Jeroboam here refers to Jeroboam II, who became king after Jehoash. This succession marks a continuation of the Jehu dynasty, which was significant in the history of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. Jeroboam II's reign was marked by territorial expansion and relative prosperity, as noted in <a href="/2_kings/14-23.htm">2 Kings 14:23-29</a>. The mention of Jeroboam succeeding Jehoash highlights the dynastic nature of Israel's monarchy, where the throne was typically passed from father to son, maintaining political stability.<p><b>Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel</b><br>Samaria was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, established by King Omri. It served as the political and cultural center of the kingdom. The burial of Jehoash in Samaria signifies his status as a legitimate king of Israel, as it was customary for kings to be buried in the capital city. This burial location also underscores the division between the Northern Kingdom (Israel) and the Southern Kingdom (Judah), as the kings of Judah were buried in Jerusalem. The phrase "with the kings of Israel" indicates that Jehoash was laid to rest among his royal predecessors, affirming his place in the lineage of Israelite kings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoash.htm">Jehoash (Joash)</a></b><br>King of Israel, son of Jehoahaz, who reigned during a tumultuous period marked by conflict with Aram.
