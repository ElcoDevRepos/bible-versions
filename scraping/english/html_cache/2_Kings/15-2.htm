This young age for a king was not uncommon in the ancient Near East, where royal succession often occurred at a young age due to the premature death of a predecessor. Uzziah's early start as king highlights the importance of mentorship and guidance from advisors, which was crucial for young rulers. His reign began during a period of relative stability in Judah, following the reign of his father, Amaziah.<p><b>and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years</b><br>Uzziah's fifty-two-year reign was one of the longest in the history of the divided kingdom, indicating a period of significant stability and prosperity for Judah. His reign is noted for military successes, economic prosperity, and infrastructural development, including fortifications and agricultural advancements. This long reign allowed for continuity in leadership, which was beneficial for the kingdom's development. However, it also ended in tragedy due to Uzziah's pride and subsequent leprosy, as detailed in <a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-21</a>.<p><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Jecoliah; she was from Jerusalem</b><br>Jecoliah's mention signifies the importance of maternal lineage in the biblical narrative, often indicating the influence a mother might have had on a king. Being from Jerusalem, Jecoliah was likely well-acquainted with the religious and cultural traditions of Judah, potentially providing Uzziah with a strong foundation in the faith and practices of his people. The inclusion of her name also underscores the significance of Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Judah, a city chosen by God for His temple and the Davidic line.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/azariah.htm">Azariah (Uzziah)</a></b><br>Also known as Uzziah, he became king of Judah at the age of sixteen and reigned for fifty-two years.

Scripture repeatedly shows the Lord raising up young leaders&#8212;Joash at seven (<a href="/2_kings/11-21.htm">2 Kings 11:21</a>), Josiah at eight (2 Chron 34:1-2), and Jeremiah called in his youth (<a href="/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Youthfulness does not hinder divine purpose; rather, dependence on God often shines more clearly when human strength is limited (<a href="/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Uzziah&#8217;s early accession also underscores Judah&#8217;s stability after his father Amaziah&#8217;s assassination (<a href="/2_kings/14-19.htm">2 Kings 14:19-21</a>), demonstrating that the Lord can maintain order even through abrupt transitions.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years</b><p>&#8226; A fifty-two-year reign is exceptional&#8212;longer than David&#8217;s forty (<a href="/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4-5</a>) and Jeroboam II&#8217;s forty-one (<a href="/2_kings/14-23.htm">2 Kings 14:23</a>). Such longevity speaks to God&#8217;s providential preservation of Judah despite Uzziah&#8217;s later pride (2 Chron 26:16-21).<p>&#8226; Reigning &#8220;in Jerusalem&#8221; stresses the covenant location: the city of David, the temple&#8217;s dwelling, and the messianic promise (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>; <a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13-14</a>). Even amid national decline, the Lord kept His word to maintain David&#8217;s lamp in Jerusalem (<a href="/1_kings/11-36.htm">1 Kings 11:36</a>).<p>&#8226; Uzziah&#8217;s prosperity&#8212;military victories, agricultural success, and fortified towers (2 Chron 26:6-15)&#8212;illustrates the principle that obedience brings blessing, yet sin invites discipline. Long reigns grant extended opportunity either to honor or to forget the Lord (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/8-11.htm">Deuteronomy 8:11-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His mother&#8217;s name was Jecoliah; she was from Jerusalem</b><p>&#8226; Naming the queen mother is standard in Kings (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>; <a href="/2_kings/12-1.htm">2 Kings 12:1</a>), signaling her influence in the royal court and, often, in her son&#8217;s spiritual direction (2 Chron 22:2-3).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Jecoliah &#8230; from Jerusalem&#8221; roots her in the covenant community. A godly mother can shape a king&#8217;s early years, just as Lois and Eunice shaped Timothy&#8217;s faith (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture&#8217;s consistent mention of mothers reminds readers of the formative power of family (<a href="/proverbs/31-28.htm">Proverbs 31:28</a>). Even when later failures emerge, early godliness leaves an indelible imprint, and the Lord remembers every faithful parent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/15-2.htm">2 Kings 15:2</a> underscores three truths: God can elevate the young to places of great responsibility; He can grant extraordinary longevity to fulfill His purposes in the covenant city; and He values the quiet yet profound influence of a faithful mother. The verse invites confidence that the Lord remains sovereign over every season of life, every span of leadership, and every household that looks to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem.</span> These numbers are confirmed by Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-1.htm">2 Chronicles 26:1-3</a>) and by Josephus ('Ant.
