His reign is noted for its departure from the ways of his father, who was a godly king. Jehoram's rule is marked by idolatry and alliances with the northern kingdom of Israel, particularly through his marriage to Athaliah, the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel. This period is characterized by spiritual decline and political instability, setting the stage for the events described in this verse.<p><b>Edom rebelled against the hand of Judah</b><br>Edom, a nation descended from Esau, had been under the control of Judah since the time of King David. The rebellion signifies a significant shift in power dynamics, as Edom had been a vassal state providing tribute to Judah. This rebellion can be seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy given to Esau in <a href="/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a>, where it was foretold that Esau's descendants would eventually break free from Jacob's yoke. The rebellion reflects the weakening of Judah's influence and the consequences of Jehoram's unfaithfulness to God.<p><b>and appointed their own king</b><br>By appointing their own king, Edom asserted its independence and rejected Judah's authority. This act of self-governance indicates a complete break from subjugation and highlights the political fragmentation occurring during Jehoram's reign. The appointment of a king also suggests a desire for stability and leadership amidst the power vacuum created by Judah's declining control. This event foreshadows further challenges to Judah's dominance and serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoram.htm">Jehoram</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this period, son of Jehoshaphat.

On the death of David, Edom seems to have revolted under a prince named Hadad, and to have re-established its independence. It had been again sub-jeered by the time of Jehoshaphat, who appointed a governor over it (<a href="/1_kings/22-47.htm">1 Kings 22:47</a>), and treated it as a portion of his own territories (<a href="/2_kings/3-8.htm">2 Kings 3:8</a>). Now the yoke was finally thrown off, as had been prophesied (<a href="/genesis/27-40.htm">Genesis 27:40</a>). Edom became once more a separate kingdom, and was especially hostile to Judah. In the reign of Ahaz the Edomites "smote Judah" and carried away many captives (<a href="/2_chronicles/28-17.htm">2 Chronicles 28:17</a>). When the Chaldaeans attacked and besieged Jerusalem, they cried, "Down with it, down with it, even to the ground!" (<a href="/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>). They looked on with joy at the capture of the holy city (<a href="/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12</a>), and "stood in the crossway, to cut off such as escaped" (<a href="/obadiah/1-14.htm">Obadiah 1:14</a>). After the return from the Captivity, they were still Judah's enemies, and am especially denounced as such by the Prophet Malachi (<a href="/malachi/1-3.htm">Malachi 1:3-5</a>). In the Maccabee wars, we find them always on the Syrian side (1 Mac. 4:29, 61 1 Mac. 5:3 1 Mac. 6:31; 2 Macc. 10:15, etc.), doing their best to rivet the hateful yoke of the heathen on their suffering brethren.
