The "altars" were unauthorized places of worship, often associated with pagan practices, contrary to the worship of Yahweh in Jerusalem. The "priests of the high places" were those who led these idolatrous practices. Josiah's actions fulfilled the prophecy given in <a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>, where a man of God predicted that a king named Josiah would defile these altars. This act of slaughtering the priests was a decisive move to purify the land and restore true worship, reflecting the seriousness of idolatry's threat to Israel's covenant relationship with God.<p><b>and he burned human bones on them</b><br>Burning human bones on the altars was a way to desecrate them, making them ritually impure and unusable for future worship. This act was a symbolic gesture to ensure that these sites could not be reused for idolatrous practices. It also fulfilled the prophecy mentioned earlier, as the burning of bones was specifically foretold. This action underscores the biblical theme of judgment against false worship and the importance of maintaining purity in worship practices.<p><b>Then he returned to Jerusalem</b><br>After completing his reforms in the northern territories, Josiah returned to Jerusalem, the center of true worship and the location of the Temple. This return signifies a restoration of proper worship practices centralized in Jerusalem, as prescribed in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-14</a>. Josiah's reforms were part of a broader movement to bring the nation back to covenant faithfulness, emphasizing the importance of Jerusalem as the spiritual heart of Israel.

These were the very platforms where sacrifices to false gods had been offered (<a href="/2_kings/23-8.htm">2 Kings 23:8&#8211;14</a>). By acting on the altars themselves, Josiah made a bold public statement:<p>&#8226; Altars dedicated to idols were to be reclaimed for the LORD or destroyed outright, echoing God&#8217;s command in <a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2&#8211;3</a> to &#8220;tear down their altars, smash their sacred stones, and burn their Asherah poles.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The location matters. Josiah&#8217;s judgment took place where the sin had occurred, leaving no room for syncretism (<a href="/exodus/34-13.htm">Exodus 34:13</a>).<p>&#8226; This fulfilled the earlier prophecy spoken at Bethel: &#8220;O altar, altar! This is what the LORD says&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>), showing the reliability of God&#8217;s word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He slaughtered all the priests of the high places</b><p>The text continues: &#8220;he slaughtered all the priests of the high places.&#8221; These were not legitimate Levitical priests but idolatrous ministers installed by kings such as Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>). Josiah&#8217;s drastic step reminds us that:<p>&#8226; False religion&#8217;s leadership must be removed so that truth can flourish (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The severity underscores God&#8217;s jealousy for exclusive worship (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p>&#8226; By eliminating the priests, Josiah ensured that no human voice would lure Israel back into compromise (<a href="/2_kings/23-24.htm">2 Kings 23:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He burned human bones on them</b><p>&#8220;And he burned human bones on them.&#8221; In ancient Israelite culture, desecrating an altar with human remains rendered it permanently unclean (<a href="/numbers/19-16.htm">Numbers 19:16</a>). Josiah&#8217;s action accomplished two things:<p>&#8226; It guaranteed that these pagan structures could never again be used for worship (<a href="/2_chronicles/34-5.htm">2 Chronicles 34:5</a>).<p>&#8226; It visibly fulfilled the prophecy that &#8220;men&#8217;s bones shall be burned upon you&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/13-2.htm">1 Kings 13:2</a>), demonstrating God&#8217;s foreknowledge and Josiah&#8217;s obedience.<p>&#8226; It also symbolized a reversal: instead of humans being sacrificed to idols, the remains testified to God&#8217;s triumph over idolatry (<a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31&#8211;32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then he returned to Jerusalem</b><p>&#8220;Then he returned to Jerusalem.&#8221; Once the purge was complete:<p>&#8226; Josiah went back to the covenant center&#8212;the city of God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; His return signals that reformation work must ultimately lead us back to worship and fellowship with the LORD (<a href="/2_kings/23-21.htm">2 Kings 23:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Jerusalem now stood as the sole sanctioned place for sacrifice, aligning the nation with <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5&#8211;7</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/23-20.htm">2 Kings 23:20</a> records Josiah&#8217;s uncompromising zeal to eradicate idolatry. By acting directly on the altars, eliminating false priests, desecrating the pagan sites with human bones, and then returning to Jerusalem, Josiah fulfilled prophecy, upheld God&#8217;s law, and re-centered worship on the LORD alone. The verse demonstrates that genuine reform confronts sin decisively, removes its agents, and restores God&#8217;s rightful place in the life of His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">He slew.</span>--<span class= "ital">He slaughtered</span>.
