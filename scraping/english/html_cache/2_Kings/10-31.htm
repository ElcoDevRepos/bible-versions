While he executed these tasks with zeal, his commitment to the LORD was incomplete. The phrase "not careful to follow" indicates a lack of diligence and wholehearted devotion. In biblical terms, the heart represents the center of one's being, including mind, will, and emotions. Jehu's failure to follow "with all his heart" suggests a divided loyalty, reminiscent of the warning in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> to love the LORD with all one's heart, soul, and strength. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God desires complete devotion, as seen in the lives of David and other faithful leaders.<p><b>He did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam had caused Israel to commit.</b><br>Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel, established a system of idolatrous worship with golden calves at Bethel and Dan to prevent his people from going to Jerusalem. This act is repeatedly condemned in the biblical narrative as "the sins of Jeroboam." Jehu's failure to remove these idols shows a partial obedience to God. Despite his actions against Baal worship, he maintained the politically expedient but spiritually corrupt practices initiated by Jeroboam. This highlights a recurring issue in Israel's history: leaders who fail to fully eradicate idolatry. The persistence of these sins underscores the challenge of reform and the need for a leader who would fully restore true worship, pointing forward to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who perfectly obeyed the Father and called for worship in spirit and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was anointed by God to destroy the house of Ahab and eradicate Baal worship from Israel.

He is exactly one of those men whom we are compelled to recognize, not for what is good or great in themselves, but as instruments for destroying evil, and preparing the way for good; such as Augustus Caesar at Rome, Sultan Mahmoud II. in Turkey, or one closer at hand in the revolutions of our own time and neighborhood. A destiny, long kept in view by himself or ethers - inscrutable secrecy and reserve in carrying out his plans - a union of cold, remorseless tenacity with occasional bursts of furious, wayward, almost fanatical zeal; - this is Jehu, as he is set before us in the historical narrative, the worst type of a son of Jacob - the 'supplanter'...without the noble and princely qualities of Israel; the most unlovely and the most coldly commended of all the heroes of his country" ('Lectures on the Jewish Church,' vol. 2. p. 289). The estimate is lower than that formed by most other writers; but it is not far from the truth. <span class="cmt_word">For he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin</span> (comp. ver. 29). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/10-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Yet Jehu</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1492;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun -
