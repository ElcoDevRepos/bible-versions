In the context of <a href="/2_kings/11.htm">2 Kings 11</a>, this occurs during the coronation of Joash, a young king who was hidden from Athaliah's murderous intent. The guards' readiness with weapons underscores the seriousness of the situation and the need to safeguard the rightful heir to the throne. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's protection over His chosen leaders, as seen in other instances like David's protection from Saul.<p><b>surrounding the king by the altar and the temple</b><br>The altar and the temple are central to Israel's worship and religious life, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The king's proximity to these sacred sites during his coronation signifies the divine approval and religious legitimacy of his rule. This setting also emphasizes the intertwining of religious and political authority in ancient Israel. The temple, built by Solomon, was the heart of Jewish worship, and the altar was where sacrifices were made, pointing to the future ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is both King and High Priest.<p><b>from the south side to the north side of the temple</b><br>This phrase indicates the comprehensive protection surrounding the king, covering the entire span of the temple area. The temple's orientation and layout are significant, as they reflect the order and structure of Israelite worship. The mention of the south and north sides may also symbolize completeness and thoroughness in the protection provided. This can be seen as a foreshadowing of the comprehensive nature of Christ's protection and reign, which extends over all creation. The temple itself is a type of Christ, who is the true temple where God and humanity meet.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/guards.htm">Guards</a></b><br>These were the royal guards, likely the Carites and the guards mentioned earlier in the chapter, tasked with protecting the young king Joash.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_joash.htm">King Joash</a></b><br>The young king of Judah, who was hidden in the temple for six years to protect him from Queen Athaliah's murderous intentions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/altar.htm">Altar</a></b><br>The altar in the temple where sacrifices were made, symbolizing the presence and worship of God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple.htm">Temple</a></b><br>The sacred place of worship in Jerusalem, central to the religious life of Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/q/queen_athaliah.htm">Queen Athaliah</a></b><br>The usurping queen who sought to destroy the royal line of David but was ultimately overthrown.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection.htm">Divine Protection</a></b><br>Just as Joash was protected by the guards, God provides protection for His people.

The men stationed around him were the royal bodyguard and the temple guard (<a href="/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/23-7.htm">2 Chronicles 23:7</a>). Their stance shows:<p>&#8226; steadfast obedience to the high priest&#8217;s instructions, acknowledging that God-given authority matters (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p>&#8226; readiness to defend God&#8217;s chosen ruler, reflecting earlier moments when faithful servants safeguarded God&#8217;s purposes&#8212;think of Samuel standing beside young David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with weapons in hand</b><p>They were armed because God&#8217;s plan sometimes calls for physical protection alongside spiritual trust. Similar scenes appear when Nehemiah&#8217;s builders carried swords while repairing the wall (<a href="/nehemiah/4-17.htm">Nehemiah 4:17&#8211;18</a>). Yet the weapons were not used rashly; they symbolized preparedness, echoing <a href="/psalms/144-1.htm">Psalm 144:1</a>&#8212;&#8220;Blessed be the LORD, my Rock, who trains my hands for battle.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>surrounding the king</b><p>Joash, only seven years old (<a href="/2_kings/11-21.htm">2 Kings 11:21</a>), was encircled so that no threat&#8212;especially from the usurping queen Athaliah&#8212;could reach him. This circle of defense pictures how God Himself encamps around those who fear Him (<a href="/psalms/34-7.htm">Psalm 34:7</a>) and foreshadows the church&#8217;s call to guard the truth entrusted to us (<a href="/2_timothy/1-14.htm">2 Timothy 1:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>by the altar and the temple</b><p>The coronation took place at the very heart of worship. By positioning the child near the altar, Jehoiada proclaimed that the throne of Judah must remain tethered to the worship of the LORD (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18&#8211;20</a>). Earlier kings failed because they separated politics from piety (<a href="/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28&#8211;30</a>); Joash&#8217;s reign began in the presence of sacrifice and covenant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from the south side to the north side of the temple</b><p>The guard formed a complete line, wall-to-wall coverage across the sanctuary.

The detail underscores thoroughness in carrying out God&#8217;s directives, reminiscent of how priests were to minister &#8220;according to the pattern&#8221; revealed by God (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-19.htm">1 Chronicles 28:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/11-11.htm">2 Kings 11:11</a> shows a divinely orchestrated moment when loyal guards, fully armed, ringed the young king Joash inside the temple. Their disciplined stance, their readiness to defend, and their location in the center of worship declare that God&#8217;s covenant purposes will not be thwarted. Physical vigilance joined with spiritual commitment ensures that the rightful ruler&#8212;chosen and protected by God&#8212;can ascend the throne and lead the people back to covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">The guard.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the Couriers;</span> not therefore the Levites.<p><span class= "bld">Corner.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">side</span>.<p><span class= "bld">Along by.</span>--<span class= "ital">At</span>.<p><span class= "bld">And the temple.</span>--<span class= "ital">And at the Temple</span>.

No one, it must be remembered, was ever allowed to enter inside the sanctuary but the priests and officiating Levites (see <a href="/2_chronicles/23-6.htm">2 Chronicles 23:6</a>). And the temple. "The temple" is here the sanctuary, as in the passage of Chronicles just quoted. The guard occupied a position at the upper end of the court, immediately in front of the altar and the temple porch. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/11-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the guards</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1464;&#1510;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
