Gates were often the center of city life, serving as places for legal matters and public announcements. Jehu, anointed by a prophet to be king (<a href="/2_kings/9.htm">2 Kings 9:1-13</a>), enters with authority to fulfill God's judgment against the house of Ahab. This moment echoes the fulfillment of Elijah's prophecy (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-24</a>) concerning the downfall of Ahab's lineage.<p><b>she asked, &#8220;Have you come in peace,</b><br>Jezebel's question to Jehu is loaded with irony and defiance. The concept of "peace" in Hebrew (shalom) encompasses not just the absence of conflict but also completeness and harmony. Jezebel, known for her idolatry and persecution of prophets (<a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>), challenges Jehu's intentions, perhaps aware of the divine judgment he represents. Her question reflects a deeper spiritual conflict between the worship of Yahweh and Baal.<p><b>O Zimri,</b><br>Jezebel's reference to Zimri is a historical allusion to the king of Israel who reigned for only seven days after assassinating King Elah (<a href="/1_kings/16-9.htm">1 Kings 16:9-20</a>). By calling Jehu "Zimri," Jezebel implies that Jehu's rebellion will be short-lived and ultimately unsuccessful. This comparison underscores the theme of divine justice, as Zimri's actions led to his own demise, just as Jezebel's idolatry and wickedness are about to lead to hers.<p><b>murderer of your master?&#8221;</b><br>Jezebel accuses Jehu of treachery, highlighting the tension between divine mandate and human action. Jehu's killing of Joram, the son of Ahab, was an act of obedience to God's command (<a href="/2_kings/9-24.htm">2 Kings 9:24-26</a>), yet Jezebel frames it as murder. This accusation reflects the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty in using human agents to accomplish His purposes, even when their actions appear morally complex. The term "master" also emphasizes the broken covenantal relationship between Israel's kings and God, as Jehu's actions are part of restoring true worship in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>Anointed by God to be king over Israel, Jehu is tasked with eradicating the house of Ahab and executing divine judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jezebel.htm">Jezebel</a></b><br>The queen mother, known for her idolatry and persecution of the prophets of Yahweh.

Jezebel&#8217;s vantage point suggests pride and distance, yet her words betray fear.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Have you come in peace,</b><p>&#8226; This greeting echoes Joram&#8217;s earlier plea to Jehu&#8212;&#8220;Is it peace, Jehu?&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/9-22.htm">2 Kings 9:22</a>). Both times the question is answered with judgment, not peace.<p>&#8226; True peace cannot exist while rebellion against God continues (<a href="/isaiah/48-22.htm">Isaiah 48:22</a>). Jezebel&#8217;s question shows she knows turmoil surrounds Jehu&#8217;s mission yet hopes to negotiate or stall.<p>&#8226; In Scripture, &#8220;peace&#8221; inquiries often preface prophetic confrontation (<a href="/1_samuel/16-4.htm">1 Samuel 16:4-5</a>); here, the lack of peace underscores God&#8217;s wrath on persistent idolatry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>O Zimri,</b><p>&#8226; Jezebel invokes the name of Zimri, who assassinated King Elah and reigned seven days before dying in a fiery end (<a href="/1_kings/16-9.htm">1 Kings 16:9-19</a>).<p>&#8226; By calling Jehu &#8220;Zimri,&#8221; she labels him a usurper destined for quick failure, ignoring that Jehu&#8217;s rise is ordained by the LORD (<a href="/2_kings/9-3.htm">2 Kings 9:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Her taunt also reveals historical awareness yet spiritual blindness; she recalls past coups but forgets Elijah&#8217;s prophecy against her (<a href="/1_kings/21-23.htm">1 Kings 21:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>murderer of your master?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Jezebel accuses Jehu of regicide, though Jehu acted under divine mandate (<a href="/2_kings/9-6.htm">2 Kings 9:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently treats murder as sin (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>), but distinguishes it from God-sanctioned judgment (<a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>). Jehu is an instrument of divine justice, not a rogue killer.<p>&#8226; Her charge is ironic: Jezebel herself orchestrated murders, including Naboth&#8217;s (<a href="/1_kings/21-7.htm">1 Kings 21:7-15</a>) and God&#8217;s prophets (<a href="/1_kings/18-4.htm">1 Kings 18:4</a>). Her words expose hardened hypocrisy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/9-31.htm">2 Kings 9:31</a> captures Jezebel&#8217;s last attempt to intimidate God&#8217;s appointed avenger. From the palace gate to her sarcastic &#8220;peace&#8221; inquiry, she clings to pride and political gamesmanship. By calling Jehu &#8220;Zimri&#8221; and &#8220;murderer,&#8221; she projects her own guilt while denying divine authority. The verse underscores that no human scheming can thwart God&#8217;s sure judgment; when sin persists, peace is impossible until righteousness prevails.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">And as . . . she said.</span>--<span class= "ital">And Jehu had come into the gate, and she said.</span><p><span class= "bld">Had Zimri . . . master?</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">Art well </span>(<span class= "ital">literally, Is it peace</span>)<span class= "ital">, thou Zimri, his master's murderer</span>? The "Is it peace?" which Jezebel addresses to Jehu, appears to be an ironical greeting. Thenius explains: "Is there to be peace or war between me and thee, the rebel?" referring to the same phrase in <a href="/context/2_kings/9-17.htm" title="And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?">2Kings 9:17-19</a>; <a href="/2_kings/9-22.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the prostitutions of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?">2Kings 9:22</a>, <span class= "ital">supra.</span> The phrase is vague enough to admit of many meanings, according to circumstances. Perhaps Jezebel, in her mood of desperate defiance, repeats the question which Jehoram had thrice asked of Jehu, as a hint that she herself is now the sovereign to whom Jehu owes an account of his doings. She goes on to call him a second <span class= "ital">Zimri--i.e.</span>, a regicide like him who slew Baasha, and likely to enjoy as brief a reign as he. (See <a href="/context/1_kings/16-15.htm" title="In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.">1Kings 16:15-18</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?</span> This is a possible meaning of Jezebel's words, and it has among its advocates - Luther, De Wette, Maurer, and Dathe, besides our own translators. But so defiant an utterance is quite incompatible within intention to captivate and conciliate. Probably, therefore, we should understand the queen either as saying affirmatively, "Peace to thee, Zimri!" (or, "Hail, Zimri!") "slayer of thy lord," or else as asking, "Is it peace" (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "Is it peace now between thee and me?"), Zimri, slayer of thy lord?" In either case, Zimri is an honorific appellation, recalling the fact of another Israelite general, who had revolted, slain his master, and reigned as king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/9-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And as Jehu</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1461;&#1492;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#234;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
