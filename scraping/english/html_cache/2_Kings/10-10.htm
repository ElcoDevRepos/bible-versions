In the context of <a href="/2_kings/10.htm">2 Kings 10</a>, Jehu is executing judgment on the house of Ahab, fulfilling the prophecy given by Elijah. The house of Ahab, known for its idolatry and wickedness, particularly under the influence of Queen Jezebel, was prophesied to face destruction (<a href="/1_kings/21-21.htm">1 Kings 21:21-24</a>). This assurance of God's word not failing is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word is described as accomplishing what He desires.<p><b>for the LORD has done what He promised</b><br>This highlights the fulfillment of divine prophecy. The LORD's promises, especially those concerning judgment and justice, are depicted as inevitable and certain. The historical context here is crucial; the northern kingdom of Israel had turned away from God, and the house of Ahab was a significant part of this apostasy. God's promises, whether of blessing or judgment, are always fulfilled, as seen in other biblical narratives like the deliverance of Israel from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/12-25.htm">Exodus 12:25</a>) and the coming of the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>).<p><b>through His servant Elijah</b><br>Elijah, a major prophet in Israel, was instrumental in delivering God's messages during a time of rampant idolatry. His confrontation with Ahab and Jezebel, particularly on Mount Carmel (1 Kings 18), is a pivotal moment in Israel's history. Elijah's role as a prophet is significant, as he is a type of Christ, foreshadowing the ultimate prophet and savior. Elijah's prophecies, including the judgment on Ahab's house, demonstrate the power and authority of God's word delivered through His chosen servants. Elijah's ministry is a testament to God's faithfulness in sending prophets to guide and warn His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehu.htm">Jehu</a></b><br>The king of Israel who was anointed to destroy the house of Ahab and eradicate Baal worship from Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahab.htm">Ahab</a></b><br>Former king of Israel whose house was prophesied to be destroyed due to his idolatry and wickedness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/elijah.htm">Elijah</a></b><br>The prophet through whom God delivered the prophecy against Ahab's house.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_ahab.htm">The House of Ahab</a></b><br>The royal family of Ahab, which was judged by God for its idolatry and evil practices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jezreel.htm">Jezreel</a></b><br>The location where much of the judgment against Ahab's house took place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_to_his_word.htm">God's Faithfulness to His Word</a></b><br>God's promises and warnings are sure and will come to pass.

Elijah spoke; Jehu acted. Both operated under divine authority (<a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>; <a href="/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Calling Elijah &#8220;servant&#8221; highlights humility and reliability. Prophets are mouthpieces, not inventors.<p>&#8226; The chain&#8212;God &#8594; prophet &#8594; history&#8212;demonstrates the unstoppable progress of God&#8217;s kingdom purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/10-10.htm">2 Kings 10:10</a> is Jehu&#8217;s declaration that God&#8217;s prophetic word is already crashing down on Ahab&#8217;s wicked dynasty. Every phrase stresses the absolute reliability of what God says, whether it concerns mercy or judgment. Because not a single word can fail, believers can live with unshakable confidence in all that the Lord has spoken.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Fall unto the earth.</span>--As a dead thing; man, bird, or beast.
