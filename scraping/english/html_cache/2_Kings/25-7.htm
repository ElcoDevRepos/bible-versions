Zedekiah, the last king of Judah, witnessed the execution of his sons, which was a common practice in ancient times to eliminate any future claims to the throne. This act fulfilled the prophecy given by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3</a>), where it was foretold that Zedekiah would see the king of Babylon and his eyes would behold the punishment of his family. The slaughter of his sons symbolizes the end of the Davidic line's rule in Jerusalem until the coming of the Messiah, who would restore the kingdom in a spiritual sense.<p><b>Then they put out his eyes,</b><br>Blinding a captured king was a customary practice in the ancient Near East to ensure he could not lead or inspire rebellion. This act was particularly cruel as it was done after Zedekiah witnessed the death of his sons, ensuring that their execution was the last thing he saw. This fulfilled the prophecy of <a href="/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>, where it was said that Zedekiah would be brought to Babylon, yet he would not see it. The blinding of Zedekiah serves as a metaphor for the spiritual blindness of Judah, which had turned away from God despite numerous warnings from the prophets.<p><b>bound him with bronze shackles,</b><br>Bronze shackles indicate the severity of Zedekiah's captivity, as bronze was a strong metal, symbolizing the unbreakable nature of his bondage. This imagery reflects the complete subjugation of Judah under Babylonian rule. The use of bronze, often associated with judgment in the Bible, underscores the divine judgment upon Zedekiah and Judah for their disobedience and idolatry. The binding of Zedekiah can be seen as a type of Christ, who was also bound and led away, though Christ's binding was for the purpose of redemption rather than judgment.<p><b>and took him to Babylon.</b><br>The transportation of Zedekiah to Babylon marks the fulfillment of God's judgment upon Judah as prophesied by Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Babylon, a city synonymous with idolatry and opposition to God, becomes the place of exile for the Judean king, symbolizing the nation's spiritual and physical captivity. This event is a pivotal moment in biblical history, leading to the Babylonian Exile, which lasted 70 years as foretold by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>). The exile serves as a period of purification and reflection for the Jewish people, setting the stage for their eventual return and the coming of the Messiah, who would establish a new covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zedekiah.htm">Zedekiah</a></b><br>The last king of Judah, who reigned from 597 to 586 BC.

(So the versions, except that the Targum has "they slew.") The blinding of Zedekiah need not have been done by the conqueror himself, although in the Assyrian sculptures kings are actually represented as blinding and otherwise torturing their captives.

As Zedekiah was no more than thirty-two years of age (<a href="/2_kings/24-18.htm">2 Kings 24:18</a>), his sons must have been minors, who could not justly be held responsible for their father's doings. It was usual, however, in the East, and even among the Jews, to punish children for the sins of their fathers (see <a href="/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24, 25</a>; <a href="/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14-6.htm">2 Kings 14:6</a>; <a href="/daniel/6-24.htm">Daniel 6:24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And put out the eyes of Zedekiah.</span> This, too, was a common Oriental practice. The Philistines blinded Samson (<a href="/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>). Sargon, in one of his sculptures, seems to be blinding a prisoner with a spear (Botta, 'Monumens de Ninive,' pl. 18). The ancient Persians often blinded criminals (Xen., 'Anab.,' 1:9. &sect; 13; Ammian. Mare., 27:12; Procop., 'De Bell. Pers.,' 1:11. p. 80). In modern Persia, it was, until very lately, usual for a king, on his accession, to blind all his brothers, in order that they might be disqualified from reigning. The operation was commonly performed in Persia by means of a red-hot iron rod (see Herod., 7:18). Zedekiah's loss of eyesight reconciled the two apparently conflicting prophecies - that he would be carried captive to Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/22-5.htm">Jeremiah 22:5</a>, etc.), and that he would never see it (<a href="/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13</a>) - in a remarkable manner. <span class="cmt_word">And bound him with fetters of brass</span>; literally, <span class="accented">with a pair of brazen fetters</span>. Assyrian fetters consisted of two thick rings of iron, joined together by a single long link (Botta, <span class="accented">l.s.c.</span>); Babylonian were probably similar. Captives of importance are usually represented as fettered in the sculptures. <span class="cmt_word">And carried him to Babylon.</span> Jeremiah adds (<a href="/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a>) that Nebuchadnezzar "put him in prison till the day of his death:" and so Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,' 10:8. &sect; 7). The latter writer further tells us that, at his death, the Babylonian monarch gave him a royal funeral (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/34-5.htm">Jeremiah 34:5</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/25-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
