The "sight of the LORD" suggests divine omniscience and the moral accountability of leaders. The concept of doing "evil" is often associated with idolatry and disobedience to God's commandments, as seen throughout the books of Kings. This reflects the Deuteronomic history's emphasis on covenant faithfulness.<p><b>but not as his father and mother had done</b><br>The king's parents, Ahab and Jezebel, were notorious for their promotion of Baal worship and persecution of the prophets of Yahweh. This phrase suggests a comparative assessment, indicating that while the king continued in sin, he did not reach the same level of apostasy and wickedness as his parents. This highlights the generational impact of leadership and the potential for partial reform.<p><b>He removed the sacred pillar of Baal</b><br>The removal of the sacred pillar signifies a partial return to the worship of Yahweh, as these pillars were often associated with Canaanite religious practices. This act could be seen as a political or religious move to gain favor with Yahweh or the people who remained faithful to Him. It reflects the ongoing struggle between the worship of Yahweh and the influence of surrounding pagan cultures.<p><b>that his father had made</b><br>This phrase underscores the legacy of Ahab's reign, which was marked by the establishment of Baal worship in Israel. The construction of such pillars was a direct violation of the first commandment and a significant factor in the spiritual decline of the nation. The king's action in removing the pillar suggests an acknowledgment of his father's errors, though it does not indicate a full return to covenant faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jehoram.htm">Jehoram (Joram)</a></b><br>The king of Israel, son of Ahab and Jezebel.

But an image of the god for whom a "house" was built was so much a matter of course in the idolatrous systems of the East, that it might have seemed superfluous to mention it. The actual existence of the image appears later, when its destruction is recorded (<a href="/2_kings/10-27.htm">2 Kings 10:27</a>). It seems that Jehoram, at the commencement of his reign, took warning by the fates of his father and brother, so far as to abolish the state worship of Baal, which his father had introduced, and to remove the image of Baal from the temple where it had been set up. The image, however, was not destroyed - it was only "put away." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/3-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And he did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
