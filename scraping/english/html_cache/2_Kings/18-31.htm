Hezekiah was known for his faithfulness to God, as seen in <a href="/2_kings/18-5.htm">2 Kings 18:5-6</a>, where he is described as a king who trusted in the Lord and held fast to His commandments. The Assyrian king's command not to listen to Hezekiah is a direct challenge to the spiritual leadership and reforms Hezekiah implemented, which included the removal of high places and the destruction of idols.<p><b>for this is what the king of Assyria says:</b><br>The king of Assyria at this time was Sennacherib, a powerful ruler known for his military campaigns and conquests. His words carry the weight of an empire that had already conquered many nations, including the northern kingdom of Israel. The Assyrian empire was known for its brutal tactics and psychological warfare, often using intimidation to subdue its enemies.<p><b>Make peace with me and come out to me.</b><br>This phrase is an offer of surrender, suggesting that the people of Judah should submit to Assyrian rule to avoid destruction. The Assyrian strategy often involved offering terms of peace to encourage submission without a fight, promising safety and prosperity in exchange for loyalty. This tactic is reminiscent of the serpent's temptation in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, where false promises are made to lead God's people away from His protection.<p><b>Then every one of you will eat from his own vine and his own fig tree</b><br>The imagery of eating from one's own vine and fig tree symbolizes peace, prosperity, and security. This promise echoes the covenant blessings described in <a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a> and <a href="/zechariah/3-10.htm">Zechariah 3:10</a>, where living under one's vine and fig tree represents a time of peace and divine favor. However, the Assyrian promise is deceptive, as true peace and prosperity come from obedience to God, not submission to foreign powers.<p><b>and drink water from his own cistern,</b><br>Access to water was crucial in the ancient Near East, and having one's own cistern meant self-sufficiency and stability. The promise of drinking from one's own cistern is an appeal to the basic needs and desires of the people. However, this offer contrasts with the living water that Jesus Christ offers in <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, which represents eternal life and true satisfaction. The Assyrian king's promise is temporary and ultimately unreliable, while God's provision is eternal and trustworthy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The King of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to reform the religious practices of his people by removing idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_assyria.htm">King of Assyria</a></b><br>The ruler of the Assyrian Empire, which was a dominant power during this period.

The passage urges us to reject counterfeit assurances, cling to steadfast leaders who honor Scripture, and rely on the LORD alone for lasting security and provision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">Make an agreement with me by a present.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">make with me a blessing, i.e.</span> (according to the Targum and Syriac), "make peace with me." The phrase does not elsewhere occur. Perhaps it is grounded on the fact that the conclusion of peace was generally accompanied by mutual expressions of goodwill.

Thenius denies the reference to the Egyptian campaign, and makes Sennacherib pose as a father who wishes to make the necessary preparations for the reception of his dear children (!).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the King of Assyria.</span> Rabshakeh, before concluding, tries the effect of blandishments. The King of Assyria is no harsh lord, as he has been represented to them. He will be a kinder master than Hezekiah. Hezekiah condemns them to all the hardships of a siege; and then, if they survive it, to a wasted land, ruined homes, broken cisterns. Sennacherib, if they will but yield to him, promises them peace and prosperity, a time of quiet enjoyment in their own land, and then removal to another equally good, where they will "live and not die," be happy and not miserable. It will be observed that none but material inducements are held out to them. They are expected to barter freedom, independence, religious privileges, country, home, for the sake of creature comforts - for ease, quiet, and security. Setting aside the question whether they could count on the performance of the promises made them, it will be felt that they did well not to be tempted. Better vigorous national life, with any amount of hardship, struggle, and suffering, than the gilded chains of the most peaceful servitude. <span class="cmt_word">Make an agreement with me by a present</span> - rather, <span class="accented">make peace with me</span>, or "make <span class="accented">terms</span> with me" (Knobel, Thenius, Keil, Bahr); in other words, give in your submission - <span class="cmt_word">and come out to me</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> quit the town, surrender it (see <a href="/1_samuel/11-3.htm">1 Samuel 11:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/38-17.htm">Jeremiah 38:17</a>), place yourselves at my mercy, "and then" see what great things I will do for you."

Rabshakeh promises, in the name of Sennacherib, that they shall rest in their own land for a term - an indefinite term - in a blissful state of peace and quietness before any new resolution is taken about them. <span class="cmt_word">And drink ye every one the waters of his cistern</span>; rather, of <span class="accented">his</span> well (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5e8;</span>). Every man who had a field or a vineyard was sure to have a well in it. Cisterns for the storage of rain-water were comparatively uncommon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/18-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1469;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_408.htm">Strong's 408: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">listen</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1456;&#1506;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(ti&#353;&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Hezekiah,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1460;&#1494;&#1456;&#1511;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;iz&#183;q&#238;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2396.htm">Strong's 2396: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hezekiah -- 'Yah has strengthened', a king of Judah, also several other Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1465;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Assyria</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#353;&#183;&#353;&#363;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_804.htm">Strong's 804: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ashshur</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1436;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Make</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1469;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">peace</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1499;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1293.htm">Strong's 1293: </a> </span><span class="str2">Benediction, prosperity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;it&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
