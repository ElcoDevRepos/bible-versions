This report was a direct challenge to the sovereignty of God and the security of Judah. The context is crucial as it highlights the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem, a significant historical event. The report likely included the blasphemous words of the Rabshakeh, Sennacherib's field commander, who mocked the God of Israel (<a href="/2_kings/18-19.htm">2 Kings 18:19-35</a>).<p><b>King Hezekiah</b><br>Hezekiah was the 13th king of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to restore proper worship in the temple. His reign is detailed in <a href="/2_kings/18.htm">2 Kings 18-20</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/29.htm">2 Chronicles 29-32</a>. Hezekiah's response to the Assyrian threat is a testament to his character and reliance on God, contrasting with the idolatry of his father, Ahaz.<p><b>tore his clothes</b><br>Tearing one's clothes was a traditional expression of grief, distress, or repentance in ancient Israel. This act signified Hezekiah's deep anguish and humility before God. It is a physical manifestation of an internal state of mourning, seen elsewhere in the Bible, such as in the story of Job (<a href="/job/1-20.htm">Job 1:20</a>) and when Jacob believed Joseph was dead (<a href="/genesis/37-34.htm">Genesis 37:34</a>).<p><b>put on sackcloth</b><br>Sackcloth, a coarse material, was worn as a sign of mourning or penitence. By donning sackcloth, Hezekiah demonstrated his humility and repentance, seeking God's mercy. This act is often associated with fasting and prayer, as seen in the story of Jonah and the repentance of Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-6</a>).<p><b>and entered the house of the LORD</b><br>Hezekiah's decision to go to the temple underscores his dependence on God in times of crisis. The temple, located in Jerusalem, was the central place of worship and symbolized God's presence among His people. By entering the house of the LORD, Hezekiah sought divine intervention, aligning with the biblical principle of seeking God in prayer during trials (<a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4-5</a>). This act foreshadows the ultimate intercessor, Jesus Christ, who provides access to God through His sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_hezekiah.htm">King Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah, known for his faithfulness to God and his efforts to restore proper worship in the temple.
