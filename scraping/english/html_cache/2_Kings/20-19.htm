This interaction occurs after Isaiah delivers a message from God regarding the future of Hezekiah's kingdom. Hezekiah's relationship with Isaiah is significant, as Isaiah was a major prophet during his reign, providing guidance and delivering God's messages. This reflects the biblical theme of kings seeking counsel from prophets, as seen with other kings like David and Nathan.<p><b>&#8220;The word of the LORD that you have spoken is good.&#8221;</b><br>Hezekiah's response to Isaiah's prophecy is surprising, given that the message foretold future calamity for his descendants and kingdom. His acceptance of the word as "good" indicates a submission to God's will, a theme prevalent throughout scripture, such as in <a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>, where Job accepts God's sovereignty in both blessing and adversity. This phrase also highlights the importance of recognizing divine authority, even when the message is difficult.<p><b>For he thought,</b><br>This phrase introduces Hezekiah's internal reasoning, providing insight into his mindset. It suggests a moment of introspection and personal reflection, which is a common biblical narrative device to reveal character motivations. This internal dialogue is crucial for understanding Hezekiah's priorities and concerns.<p><b>&#8220;Will there not at least be peace and security in my lifetime?&#8221;</b><br>Hezekiah's concern for peace and security during his own reign reflects a common human desire for stability and safety. Historically, Hezekiah's reign was marked by significant challenges, including the Assyrian threat, which makes his desire for peace understandable. This phrase also reveals a potential shortcoming in Hezekiah's character, as he seems more concerned with his immediate circumstances than the long-term consequences for his descendants. This can be contrasted with biblical figures like Moses, who showed concern for future generations (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7-8</a>).

"Good is the word of the Lord" - who "in his wrath has thought upon mercy." The king feels that God might, in justice, have visited him, in his own person, with some immediate affliction or calamity. It is a relief to hear that the blow will not fall during his lifetime. There may be a tinge of selfishness in his acquiescence, but it is not very pronounced, and does not call for any severe animadversion.
