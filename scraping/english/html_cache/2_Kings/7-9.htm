In the biblical narrative, lepers were often marginalized and lived outside the city, yet here they are pivotal in delivering a message of salvation. This reflects a recurring biblical theme where God uses the unlikely or marginalized to fulfill His purposes, similar to how He used shepherds to announce Jesus' birth (<a href="/luke/2-8.htm">Luke 2:8-20</a>).<p><b>We are not doing what is right</b><br>The lepers recognize a moral obligation to share the good news of the Arameans' departure. This acknowledgment of wrongdoing highlights the biblical principle of accountability and the importance of doing what is right in God's eyes, as seen in <a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>, which states that knowing the right thing to do and failing to do it is sin.<p><b>Today is a day of good news</b><br>The term "good news" here is significant, as it prefigures the Gospel message in the New Testament. The lepers' discovery of the abandoned camp and the abundance of resources parallels the spiritual abundance found in Christ. This phrase echoes <a href="/isaiah/52-7.htm">Isaiah 52:7</a>, which speaks of the beauty of those who bring good news, ultimately fulfilled in the proclamation of the Gospel.<p><b>If we are silent and wait until morning light</b><br>The urgency in this phrase underscores the importance of timely action in sharing good news. In a broader biblical context, it reflects the urgency of spreading the Gospel message, as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>, which emphasizes the present as the time of salvation.<p><b>Our sin will overtake us</b><br>The lepers understand that withholding the good news would be sinful. This reflects the biblical teaching that sin is not only in wrongful actions but also in failing to act rightly. The concept of sin overtaking someone is reminiscent of <a href="/genesis/4-7.htm">Genesis 4:7</a>, where sin is described as crouching at the door, ready to overtake Cain if he does not master it.<p><b>Now, therefore, let us go and tell the king&#8217;s household</b><br>This decision to inform the king's household demonstrates obedience and responsibility. It mirrors the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where believers are commanded to go and make disciples, sharing the good news of Jesus Christ. The lepers' actions serve as a type of evangelism, spreading the message of deliverance and salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_four_lepers.htm">The Four Lepers</a></b><br>These were the outcasts who discovered the abandoned Aramean camp.
