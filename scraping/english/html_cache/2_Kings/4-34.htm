The act of lying on the boy is symbolic of Elisha's deep faith and reliance on God's power to bring life. It mirrors the actions of Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/17-21.htm">1 Kings 17:21</a>, where Elijah also stretched himself over a dead child to bring him back to life. This demonstrates a continuity of prophetic ministry and the power of God working through His prophets.<p><b>mouth to mouth, eye to eye, and hand to hand</b><br>Elisha's actions here are intimate and personal, indicating a complete identification with the boy's condition. This physical contact can be seen as a type of Christ, who fully identified with humanity in His incarnation (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>). The specific mention of mouth, eyes, and hands suggests a totality of engagement, symbolizing the life-giving breath of God, the vision of divine purpose, and the work of God's hands. This act of laying on the boy is not a magical ritual but a demonstration of faith in God's power to restore life.<p><b>As he stretched himself out over him</b><br>The stretching out of Elisha over the boy signifies an act of intercession and a physical representation of prayer. It is a vivid picture of the prophet's role as a mediator between God and man, similar to how Christ intercedes for believers (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>). This act also reflects the persistence in prayer and faith, as Elisha does not simply pray from a distance but fully engages in the act of seeking God's intervention.<p><b>the boy&#8217;s body became warm</b><br>The warming of the boy's body is the first sign of life returning, indicating that God is beginning to answer Elisha's prayer. This gradual process highlights the nature of divine miracles, which can sometimes unfold progressively rather than instantaneously. It also serves as a reminder of the power of God to bring life from death, a theme that runs throughout Scripture and finds its ultimate fulfillment in the resurrection of Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/11-25.htm">John 11:25-26</a>).
