The Philistines were a significant enemy of Israel and Judah, often mentioned throughout the Old Testament. Their defeat by Hezekiah signifies a reversal of fortunes, as the Philistines had previously oppressed Israel during the time of the Judges and the early monarchy. This victory demonstrates Hezekiah's strength and God's favor upon his reign, aligning with the covenantal promises of protection and victory for obedience to God.<p><b>as far as Gaza and its borders</b><br>Gaza was one of the five major Philistine cities and a key location in the region. The mention of Gaza indicates the extent of Hezekiah's campaign, reaching deep into Philistine territory. This geographical reference underscores the comprehensive nature of his victory. Historically, Gaza was a strategic city due to its location on trade routes, making its capture significant for controlling the region. The phrase "and its borders" suggests that Hezekiah's influence extended beyond the city itself, securing the surrounding areas.<p><b>from watchtower to fortified city</b><br>This phrase illustrates the thoroughness of Hezekiah's campaign against the Philistines. "Watchtower" refers to smaller, less fortified outposts used for surveillance and early warning, while "fortified city" indicates larger, heavily defended urban centers. The range from watchtower to fortified city implies that Hezekiah's victories were not limited to major battles but included a systematic subjugation of the entire Philistine defense network. This comprehensive approach reflects a strategic military campaign, ensuring the security of Judah's borders and fulfilling the role of a king who protects his people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who reigned during this time.

Hezekiah&#8217;s triumph shows God&#8217;s ongoing fulfillment of His promise to give the land to His people (<a href="/joshua/23-5.htm">Joshua 23:5</a>).<p>- Isaiah, prophesying during Hezekiah&#8217;s reign, had already declared judgment on Philistia (<a href="/isaiah/14-29.htm">Isaiah 14:29&#8211;32</a>); the king&#8217;s campaign is the historical outworking of that word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as far as Gaza and its borders</b><p>&#8220;He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza and its borders&#8221; sets the geographical extent of the victory.<p>- Gaza was the southernmost of the five principal Philistine cities (<a href="/1_samuel/6-17.htm">1 Samuel 6:17</a>). Reaching it indicates a sweeping advance all the way to the edge of the traditional Philistine territory along the Mediterranean coast.<p>- The phrase &#8220;and its borders&#8221; reminds us that God&#8217;s promise to Abraham encompassed specified borders (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>), and here those outer edges are brought under Israelite control again.<p>- Like Solomon&#8217;s dominion &#8220;over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>), Hezekiah&#8217;s reach toward Gaza displays covenant faithfulness rewarded with widened influence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from watchtower to fortified city</b><p>The closing description, &#8220;from watchtower to fortified city,&#8221; accents totality.<p>- A &#8220;watchtower&#8221; (often a lonely outpost in open fields or vineyards, cf. <a href="/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>) represents the smallest, most exposed position. A &#8220;fortified city&#8221; (with walls, gates, and soldiers, cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>) represents the largest, most secure stronghold.<p>- Listing both poles is a Hebrew way of saying &#8220;everywhere in between,&#8221; much like &#8220;from Dan to Beersheba&#8221; (<a href="/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>). Nothing Philistine was left untouched.<p>- The verse implicitly fulfills <a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>, where God promises, &#8220;Your enemies who rise up against you will be defeated before you; they will come at you from one direction but flee from you in seven.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/18-8.htm">2 Kings 18:8</a> records how King Hezekiah, acting in covenant loyalty, broke Philistine power completely&#8212;stretching his victories all the way to Gaza, from the smallest lookout post to the mightiest fortress. The verse underscores that wholehearted trust in the LORD brings real, measurable triumph, just as God&#8217;s Word says, and it assures us that no enemy stronghold can withstand a leader or a people fully yielded to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">He smote.</span>--<span class= "ital">He it was who smote.</span> The reduction of the Philistines was probably subsequent to the retreat of Sennacherib.

Sargon attacked Philistia in <span class="date">B.C. 720</span>, made Gaza and the other towns subject, and committed the custody of them to tributary kings, in whom he had confidence. But opposition soon manifested itself. Sargon's creatures were expelled - Akhimiti from Ash-clod, Padi from Ekron. Hezekiah assisted in this war of independence, attacked Sargon's viceroys, and helped the cities to free themselves. About the year <span class="date">B.C. 711</span> Sargon speaks of a league against Assyria, to which the parties were Philistia, Judaea, Edom, and Moab ('Eponym Canon,' p. 130). The Philistines, whom Hezekiah "smote," must be regarded as Assyrian partisans, whom he chastised in the interests of the national party. He did not seek conquests in Philistia for himself.
