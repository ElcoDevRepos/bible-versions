The middle courtyard likely refers to the area within the palace complex in Jerusalem, suggesting that Isaiah was still within the vicinity when God spoke to him again. This setting underscores the close proximity of the prophet to the king, highlighting the direct communication between God and His chosen leaders. The courtyard was a place of official business and royal affairs, emphasizing the importance of the message being delivered.<p><b>the word of the LORD came to him</b><br>This phrase signifies divine revelation, a common occurrence in the prophetic books where God communicates His will to His prophets. The "word of the LORD" is a powerful expression, indicating that what follows is not merely human opinion but a direct message from God. This underscores the authority and reliability of the prophecy. In the broader biblical context, the "word of the LORD" is often associated with creation, judgment, and salvation, reflecting God's active involvement in the world.<p><b>saying</b><br>This introduces the specific message that God is about to deliver. In the context of <a href="/2_kings/20.htm">2 Kings 20</a>, it is a message of hope and healing for King Hezekiah, who was previously told he would die. The immediacy of God's response to Hezekiah's prayer demonstrates His compassion and willingness to intervene in human affairs. This also reflects the biblical theme of God hearing and responding to the prayers of the faithful, as seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a> and <a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>A major prophet in the Old Testament, Isaiah is known for his prophecies concerning the coming of the Messiah and the future of Israel.

(Keil says that here, as in <a href="/2_kings/10-25.htm" title="And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth.

"The middle court" is probably the second or intermediate court of the royal palace. Isaiah had not gone further than this, when he was arrested in his course by a Divine communication. <span class="cmt_word">That the word of the Lord came to him, saying.</span> How the word of the Lord came to the prophets is an inscrutable mystery. Sometimes, no doubt, it came in vision, which to a certain extent we can understand. But how, when the prophet was secularly engaged, as in this instance, walking across a court, he knew that the thought which occurred to him was a Divine message, it is almost impossible to conceive. Still, we cannot doubt that if God determines to communicate his will to man, he must be able, with the message, to impart an absolute certainty of its source, an assured conviction that it is his word, which precludes all question, hesitation, or dubiety. Isaiah, in the middle of his walk, finds his steps arrested, anew injunction laid upon him, with a necessity of immediately obeying it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/20-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Before</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Isaiah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;&#353;a&#8216;&#183;y&#257;&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3470.htm">Strong's 3470: </a> </span><span class="str2">Isaiah -- 'salvation of Yah', four Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had left</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1428;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3318.htm">Strong's 3318: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, bring, out, direct and proxim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the middle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1499;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hat&#183;t&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#333;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
