Amaziah, the son of Joash, ascended to the throne after his father's assassination. The phrase suggests that Amaziah waited until he had secured his rule and established his authority before taking action. This reflects a common practice in ancient Near Eastern monarchies, where a new king would first consolidate power to prevent internal and external threats. The stability of a kingdom was crucial for a king to enact justice and governance effectively.<p><b>Amaziah executed the servants</b><br>Amaziah's execution of the servants who killed his father is an act of retributive justice, aligning with the principle of lex talionis, or "an eye for an eye," found in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/21-23.htm">Exodus 21:23-25</a>). This action underscores the importance of justice and the king's role as the enforcer of divine law. It also reflects the cultural and legal expectations of the time, where the murder of a king was a grave offense requiring severe punishment. The execution of the conspirators would have served as a deterrent to others who might consider treason.<p><b>who had murdered his father the king</b><br>The murder of Joash, Amaziah's father, is recorded earlier in <a href="/2_kings/12-20.htm">2 Kings 12:20-21</a>. Joash was assassinated by his own servants, which was a significant breach of loyalty and trust. This act of regicide would have created political instability and a crisis of legitimacy for Amaziah. By executing the murderers, Amaziah not only avenged his father's death but also reinforced his own claim to the throne. This action is consistent with the biblical theme of divine justice and the restoration of order following chaos. The execution of the murderers can also be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, restoring divine order and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>The king of Judah who succeeded his father Joash.
