The context of this passage is a coalition of Israel, Judah, and Edom coming against Moab after King Mesha of Moab rebelled against Israelite control. The Moabites hearing of the approaching kings indicates the spread of information and the urgency of the situation. Historically, Moab was located east of the Dead Sea, a region known for its rugged terrain and strategic importance. The Moabite Stone, an archaeological artifact, provides additional context to this period, detailing King Mesha's perspective on the conflict. This phrase highlights the tension and anticipation of impending warfare, a common theme in the Old Testament where nations often rose against each other.<p><b>So all who could bear arms, young and old, were summoned and stationed at the border.</b><br>The summoning of all who could bear arms, regardless of age, underscores the desperation and determination of the Moabites to defend their land. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of mustering all available men for battle, emphasizing the communal responsibility in times of war. The mention of "young and old" suggests a total mobilization, indicating the severity of the threat perceived by Moab. Stationing at the border signifies a strategic defensive position, aiming to confront the enemy before they could penetrate deeper into Moabite territory. This mirrors other biblical accounts where nations prepared for battle at their borders, such as Israel's encounters with the Philistines. The readiness for battle can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual preparedness, a theme echoed in the New Testament where believers are called to be vigilant and ready for spiritual warfare.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moabites.htm">Moabites</a></b><br>The people of Moab, descendants of Lot, who were often in conflict with Israel.
