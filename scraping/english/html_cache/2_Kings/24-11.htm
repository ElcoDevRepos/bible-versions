His reign is well-documented in both biblical and extra-biblical sources. He is known for his military conquests, including the destruction of Jerusalem and the subsequent Babylonian Exile of the Jewish people. This event fulfilled the prophecies of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>) and Habakkuk (<a href="/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>), who warned of Babylon's rise as an instrument of God's judgment against Judah for their idolatry and disobedience.<p><b>came to the city</b><br>The city referred to here is Jerusalem, the capital of the Kingdom of Judah. Jerusalem held significant religious and cultural importance as the location of the Temple, the center of Jewish worship. The arrival of Nebuchadnezzar marked a pivotal moment in Jewish history, as it led to the eventual fall of the city and the destruction of the Temple in 586 BC. This event is a key moment in the biblical narrative, symbolizing the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>while his servants were besieging it</b><br>The siege of Jerusalem by Babylonian forces was a prolonged military campaign that ultimately led to the city's fall. The term "servants" refers to Nebuchadnezzar's military commanders and troops who carried out the siege. This siege is described in detail in <a href="/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a> and <a href="/2_chronicles/36.htm">2 Chronicles 36</a>, highlighting the dire conditions within the city, including famine and despair. The siege fulfilled the warnings given by prophets like Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/24-2.htm">Ezekiel 24:2</a>) and was a direct result of Judah's persistent sin and rebellion against God. The siege and subsequent exile served as a period of purification and reflection for the Jewish people, setting the stage for their eventual return and restoration, as prophesied in books like Isaiah and Daniel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_nebuchadnezzar.htm">King Nebuchadnezzar</a></b><br>The powerful king of Babylon, known for his military conquests and the expansion of the Babylonian Empire.
