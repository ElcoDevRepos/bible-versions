Despite the warnings and judgments from God, these nations clung to their own religious practices. This reflects the broader biblical theme of humanity's tendency to turn away from the worship of the one true God, as seen in the repeated cycles of idolatry throughout the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-19</a>). The making of their own gods signifies a rejection of divine revelation and a reliance on human invention, which is condemned in passages like <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>.<p><b>in the cities where they had settled</b><br>The Assyrian policy of resettlement involved relocating conquered peoples to different parts of the empire to prevent rebellion and to assimilate them into the Assyrian culture. This historical context is crucial for understanding the religious syncretism that developed in Samaria. The cities mentioned would have been those in the region of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, which had been depopulated by the Assyrian conquest. This resettlement is documented in Assyrian records and aligns with the biblical narrative of <a href="/2_kings/17-24.htm">2 Kings 17:24</a>.<p><b>and they set them up in the shrines</b><br>The shrines, or "high places," were local worship sites that often became centers of idolatry. These were originally intended for the worship of Yahweh but had been corrupted over time. The setting up of foreign gods in these shrines indicates a blending of religious practices, which was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-4</a>). This syncretism is a recurring issue in Israel's history, leading to divine judgment.<p><b>that the people of Samaria had made on the high places</b><br>The high places were elevated sites used for worship, often associated with pagan rituals. The people of Samaria, referring to the Israelites of the Northern Kingdom, had already established these sites before the Assyrian conquest. This phrase underscores the continuity of idolatrous practices, as the new settlers adopted and adapted the existing religious infrastructure for their own gods. The high places were a significant factor in the spiritual decline of Israel, as noted in <a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31-33</a>, where Jeroboam set up golden calves at Bethel and Dan. This practice of using high places is contrasted with the centralized worship in Jerusalem, which was the divinely appointed place for sacrifice and worship (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samaritans.htm">Samaritans</a></b><br>A group of people living in the region of Samaria, who were a mix of Israelites and other nations brought in by the Assyrians.
