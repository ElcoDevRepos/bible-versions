His role as a prophet is to convey God's messages, often involving future events or divine will. Elisha's authority is recognized by both Israelites and foreigners, as seen in his interactions with various kings and leaders.<p><b>Go and tell him</b><br>This directive is given to Hazael, a servant of the king of Aram, Ben-Hadad. The context involves Ben-Hadad sending Hazael to inquire of Elisha regarding his illness. The act of sending a messenger to a prophet indicates the recognition of Elisha's prophetic gift and the belief in the power of the God of Israel, even among foreign nations.<p><b>&#8216;You will surely recover.&#8217;</b><br>Elisha's initial message seems to offer hope of recovery. This phrase can be understood as a test or a reflection of the king's current physical condition, suggesting that the illness itself is not immediately fatal. It highlights the complexity of prophetic messages, which can have layers of meaning and require discernment.<p><b>But the LORD has shown me</b><br>This phrase underscores the source of Elisha's knowledge&#8212;divine revelation. It emphasizes the role of prophets as intermediaries who receive insight directly from God. The phrase also indicates a shift from the initial message, revealing a deeper, more significant truth about the situation.<p><b>that in fact he will die.</b><br>Despite the initial message of recovery, the ultimate outcome is death. This reflects the sovereignty of God over life and death and the unfolding of divine plans beyond human understanding. It also foreshadows Hazael's future actions, as he later becomes king and fulfills God's judgment against Israel. This duality in the message can be seen as a test of Hazael's character and intentions, as well as a demonstration of God's omniscience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God, successor to Elijah, known for his miracles and guidance to the kings of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/ben-hadad.htm">Ben-Hadad</a></b><br>The king of Aram (Syria) who was ill and sought a prophecy regarding his recovery.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hazael.htm">Hazael</a></b><br>A servant of Ben-Hadad who was sent to inquire of Elisha about the king's illness and later became king himself.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/aram.htm">Aram (Syria)</a></b><br>A neighboring nation to Israel, often in conflict with Israel during the time of the kings.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophecy.htm">The Prophecy</a></b><br>Elisha's message to Hazael, which contained a dual aspect&#8212;an immediate assurance of recovery and a longer-term prophecy of death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_complexity_of_prophecy.htm">The Complexity of Prophecy</a></b><br>Prophecies can have multiple layers and fulfillments.

The prophet respects the diplomatic protocol yet remains God&#8217;s mouthpiece first (compare <a href="/2_kings/5-4.htm">2 Kings 5:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The command &#8220;go and tell&#8221; mirrors earlier prophetic missions&#8212;Nathan to David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1</a>), Jonah to Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/1-2.htm">Jonah 1:2</a>)&#8212;reminding us that God sends truth to rulers whether they heed it or not.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;You will surely recover.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; On the surface, the illness is not terminal. If left to natural progression, Ben-hadad would recuperate (v. 14 confirms he was well enough to sit on his bed).<p>&#8226; Elisha is not deceiving; he reports a genuine prognosis concerning the sickness itself, similar to how Isaiah first told Hezekiah he would die, then later announced fifteen added years (<a href="/2_kings/20-1.htm">2 Kings 20:1-6</a>). God can reveal successive layers of His plan.<p>&#8226; The statement also exposes Hazael&#8217;s heart. Knowing the king could recover removes any justification for murder; yet Hazael will smother him anyway (v. 15), fulfilling prophecy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But the LORD has shown me</b><p>&#8226; The contrast (&#8220;But&#8221;) signals deeper revelation. Prophets often receive insight that transcends present appearances (<a href="/2_kings/4-27.htm">2 Kings 4:27</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-19.htm">Daniel 2:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Elisha&#8217;s vision produces grief (v. 11-12), illustrating that prophetic knowledge is a burden, not a source of pride.<p>&#8226; This glimpse of divine foreknowledge assures readers that history unfolds under God&#8217;s sovereign eye (<a href="/isaiah/46-9.htm">Isaiah 46:9-10</a>; <a href="/acts/15-18.htm">Acts 15:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that in fact he will die.</b><p>&#8226; The impending death is not from the ailment but from Hazael&#8217;s treachery (v. 15). God reveals both the event and the agent, proving His word infallible (<a href="/1_kings/13-32.htm">1 Kings 13:32</a>).<p>&#8226; The episode foreshadows the violent reign of Hazael and the suffering he will inflict on Israel (v. 12-13; <a href="/2_kings/10-32.htm">2 Kings 10:32</a>; 13:3).<p>&#8226; It warns that personal ambition, when unchecked, leads to bloodshed&#8212;echoing Abimelech&#8217;s rise in <a href="/bsb/judges/9.htm">Judges 9</a> and Judas&#8217;s betrayal in <a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>.<p>&#8226; Yet even this dark turn serves God&#8217;s larger redemptive plan, reminding us that He &#8220;works all things according to the counsel of His will&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Elisha&#8217;s seemingly contradictory words are perfectly consistent: the illness itself is curable, but the king will still die because Hazael will murder him. The verse exposes human scheming, affirms prophetic accuracy, and displays God&#8217;s sovereign foreknowledge. Far from a puzzle, <a href="/2_kings/8-10.htm">2 Kings 8:10</a> invites us to trust that every detail of history&#8212;health, sickness, life, and death&#8212;lies under the wise and righteous rule of the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Unto him.</span>--The reading of some Hebrew MSS., of the Hebrew margin, and of all the versions, as well as of Josephus.<p>The ordinary Hebrew text has "not" (<span class= "ital">lo</span>', instead of <span class= "ital">lo</span>), so that the meaning would be, "Thou shalt not recover." But (1) the position of the negative before the adverbial infinitive is anomalous; and (2) Hazae?s report of Elisha's words, in <a href="/2_kings/8-14.htm" title="So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to you? And he answered, He told me that you should surely recover.">2Kings 8:14</a>, is without the negative particle. (See the Note there.) The Authorised Version is, therefore, right.<p><span class= "bld">Thou mayest certainly recover.</span>--Rather. <span class= "ital">Thou wilt certainly live</span>. Elisha sees through Hazae?s character and designs, and answers him in the tone of irony which he used to Gehazi in <a href="/2_kings/5-26.htm" title="And he said to him, Went not my heart with you, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and olive groves, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?">2Kings 5:26</a>, "Go, tell thy lord--as thou, the supple and unscrupulous courtier wilt be sure to do--he will certainly recover. I know, however, that he will assuredly die, and by thy hand." Others interpret, "<span class= "ital">Thou mightest</span> recover" (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, thy disease is not mortal); and make the rest of the prophe?s reply a confidential communication to Hazael. But this is to represent the prophet as deceiving Benhadad, and guilty of complicity with Hazael, which agrees neither with Elisha's character nor with what follows in <a href="/context/2_kings/8-11.htm" title="And he settled his countenance steadfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.">2Kings 8:11-12</a>.
