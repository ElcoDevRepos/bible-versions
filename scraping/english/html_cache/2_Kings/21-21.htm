Manasseh was known for his idolatry and evil practices, as detailed earlier in <a href="/2_kings/21.htm">2 Kings 21</a>. The phrase suggests a generational perpetuation of sin, highlighting the influence of parental example on children. Biblically, this reflects the principle found in <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, where the iniquity of the fathers affects subsequent generations. It underscores the importance of righteous leadership and the impact of a leader's spiritual direction on their descendants and nation.<p><b>and he served and worshiped the idols</b><br>This part of the verse emphasizes Amon's active participation in idolatry, not merely a passive acceptance. Serving and worshiping idols was a direct violation of the first two commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>), which prohibited the worship of other gods and the making of graven images. The historical context of this period in Judah shows a syncretism where the worship of Yahweh was mixed with pagan practices, influenced by surrounding nations. This idolatry led to moral and spiritual decay, contributing to Judah's eventual downfall and exile.<p><b>his father had served</b><br>The repetition of the father's actions by the son highlights the cyclical nature of sin and the difficulty of breaking free from established patterns of behavior. Manasseh's reign was marked by the introduction of foreign gods and practices, including the worship of Baal and Asherah, and even the desecration of the temple with altars to these deities. This phrase serves as a warning about the long-lasting effects of ungodly leadership and the challenge of reforming a nation steeped in idolatry. It also contrasts with the biblical ideal of a godly heritage, as seen in the examples of righteous kings like David and Josiah, who sought to lead their people back to the worship of the one true God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amon.htm">Amon</a></b><br>The king of Judah who followed in the footsteps of his father, Manasseh, by continuing idolatrous practices.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/manasseh.htm">Manasseh</a></b><br>Amon's father, known for his extensive idolatry and leading Judah into sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, where Amon reigned as king.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/idols.htm">Idols</a></b><br>The false gods that Amon and his father worshiped, contrary to the worship of Yahweh.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, where the temple of the Lord was located, yet was defiled by idol worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/generational_influence.htm">Generational Influence</a></b><br>Amon's actions demonstrate the powerful influence of parental behavior on children.

When <a href="/2_kings/21-21.htm">2 Kings 21:21</a> says, &#8220;He walked in all the ways of his father,&#8221; it means Amon deliberately patterned his life after Manasseh&#8217;s worst choices.<p>&#8226; Walking suggests a settled direction, not a momentary misstep (<a href="/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;All the ways&#8221; signals full-scale imitation&#8212;no room left for personal repentance (<a href="/proverbs/4-14.htm">Proverbs 4:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Manasseh&#8217;s legacy was infamous: child sacrifice, star worship, occult practices (<a href="/2_kings/21-2.htm">2 Kings 21:2-6</a>). Amon&#8217;s walk retraced every dark footprint.<p>The verse underscores how parental influence can steer the next generation, for good or ill (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-18.htm">Ezekiel 20:18</a>). Yet Scripture also shows children can break free (<a href="/2_kings/22-2.htm">2 Kings 22:2</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/18-14.htm">Ezekiel 18:14-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he served the idols his father had served</b><p>Service goes beyond private belief; it is active allegiance.

The verse warns about inherited sin, misplaced service, and corrupt worship, while setting the stage for God&#8217;s redemptive interruption through Josiah.
