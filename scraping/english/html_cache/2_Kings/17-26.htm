The Assyrian Empire, known for its military prowess and administrative efficiency, often relocated conquered peoples to prevent rebellion. This practice is confirmed by Assyrian records and archaeological findings. The king of Assyria at this time was likely Shalmaneser V or Sargon II, who continued the policy of deportation initiated by their predecessors.<p><b>&#8220;The peoples that you have removed and placed in the cities of Samaria</b><br>The "peoples" refer to various groups from different regions of the Assyrian Empire, relocated to Samaria after the fall of the Northern Kingdom of Israel in 722 BC. Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom, was strategically important and fertile. The Assyrians repopulated it with foreigners to dilute national identity and prevent insurrection. This policy led to the emergence of the Samaritans, a mixed population with both Israelite and foreign ancestry, which later caused tensions with the Jews.<p><b>do not know the requirements of the God of the land.</b><br>The "God of the land" refers to Yahweh, the God of Israel. The relocated peoples were unfamiliar with Yahweh's laws and worship practices, which were integral to the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This ignorance highlights the cultural and religious disconnect between the new inhabitants and the land's spiritual heritage. The concept of a "god of the land" reflects the ancient Near Eastern belief that deities were tied to specific territories.<p><b>Because of this, He has sent lions among them,</b><br>The sending of lions is seen as divine retribution for not following Yahweh's laws. In the ancient world, natural disasters or animal attacks were often interpreted as signs of divine displeasure. Lions were common in the region during this period, and their presence would have been a significant threat. This event underscores the belief in divine sovereignty over nature and the expectation that the land's inhabitants honor its deity.<p><b>which are indeed killing them off.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase indicates the severity of the lion attacks, suggesting a high mortality rate among the new settlers. This situation would have been alarming and prompted the appeal to the Assyrian king. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience to God's laws, a recurring theme in the Old Testament. The narrative sets the stage for the introduction of a priest to teach the new inhabitants about Yahweh, illustrating God's desire for all peoples to know Him, foreshadowing the inclusion of Gentiles in the New Covenant through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_assyria.htm">King of Assyria</a></b><br>The ruler who deported the Israelites and resettled other nations in Samaria.

Hence the use of the third person instead of the first. <span class="cmt_word">The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria</span> (see ver. 24), <span class="cmt_word">know not the manner of the God of the land.</span> It was the general belief of the heathen nations of antiquity that each country and nation had its own god or gods, who presided over its destinies, protected it, went out at the head of its armies, and fought for it against its enemies. Each god had his own "manner," or ritual and method of worship, which was, in some respects at any rate, different from that of all other gods. Unless this ritual and method were known, new-comers into any land were almost sure to displease the local deity, who did not allow of any departure from traditional usage in his worship. <span class="cmt_word">Therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, bemuse they know not the manner of the God of the land.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/17-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So they spoke</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
