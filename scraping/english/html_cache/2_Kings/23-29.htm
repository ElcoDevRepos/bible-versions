It reflects his commitment to the independence of Judah and possibly his desire to support Babylon against Assyria and Egypt.

Either way, Josiah acted without prophetic sanction, a striking departure from his earlier obedience (<a href="/2_kings/22-13.htm">2 Kings 22:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene echoes King Ahab&#8217;s self-willed campaign at Ramoth-gilead (<a href="/1_kings/22-29.htm">1 Kings 22:29&#8211;36</a>), warning that even righteous leaders must remain submissive to God&#8217;s current word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But Neco faced him and killed him at Megiddo</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Megiddo&#8221; evokes earlier clashes where God delivered Israel (<a href="/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>), yet here the outcome is reversed.<p>&#8226; According to <a href="/2_chronicles/35-23.htm">2 Chronicles 35:23</a>, archers fatally wounded Josiah, fulfilling the pattern that disobedience brings death (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-47.htm">Deuteronomy 32:47</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/zechariah/12-11.htm">Zechariah 12:11</a> later speaks of &#8220;the mourning of Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo,&#8221; likely recalling the national grief over Josiah&#8217;s death (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-24.htm">2 Chronicles 35:24&#8211;25</a>), underscoring its lasting impact.<p>&#8226; The verse thus shows God&#8217;s immutable justice: personal piety cannot cancel national judgment once the cup of iniquity is full (<a href="/2_kings/23-26.htm">2 Kings 23:26&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/23-29.htm">2 Kings 23:29</a> records how Egypt&#8217;s Pharaoh Neco, hurrying north to aid Assyria, crossed paths with the reforming king Josiah.

If the fall of Nineveh preceded or coincided with this last event, then Nabopalassar must be intended by the historian here. But if, as the chronology of Eusebius and Jerome represents, Cyaraxes the Mede took Nineveh in 609-608 B.C. , or, according to the Armenian chronicle, <span class= "ital">apud</span> Eusebius, in 608-607 B.C. , then Necho's expedition (circ. 609 B.C. ) was really directed against <span class= "ital">a king of Assyria</span> in the strict sense. After the death of Assurbanipal (626 B.C. ) it appears that two or three kings reigned at Nineveh, namely, <span class= "ital">Assur-idil-ilani-ukinni, Bel-sum-iskun</span> and Esar-haddon II. (the Saracus of Abydenus and Syncellus). Nineveh must have fallen before 606 B.C. , as Assyria does not occur in the list of countries mentioned by Jeremiah (<a href="/context/jeremiah/25-19.htm" title="Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people;">Jeremiah 25:19-26</a>) in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, 606 B.C. The probable date of its fall is 607 B.C. A year or so later Necho made a second expedition, this time against the king of Babylon, but was utterly defeated at Carchemish. (See Schrader, <span class= "ital">K. A. T</span>., pp. 357-361.) Josephus says that Necho went to wage war with the Medes and Babylonians, who had just put an end to the Assyrian empire, and that his object was to win the dominion of Asia.<p><span class= "bld">King Josiah went against him.</span>--Probably as a vassal of Assyria, and as resenting Necho's trespass on territory which he regarded as his own. The Syriac adds: "to fight against him: and Pharaoh said to him, Not against thee have I come; return from me. And he hearkened not to Pharaoh, and Pharaoh smote him." This may once have formed part of the Hebrew text, but is more likely a gloss from Chronicles.<p><span class= "bld">At Megiddo.</span>--In the plain of Jezreel (<a href="/1_kings/4-12.htm" title="Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo, and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even to the place that is beyond Jokneam:">1Kings 4:12</a>). (Comp. <a href="/zechariah/12-11.htm" title="In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.">Zechariah 12:11</a>.) Herodotus calls it Magdolus (ii. 159). The fact that this was the place of battle shows that Necho had not marched through southern Palestine, but had taken the shortest route over sea, and landed at Accho (<span class= "ital">Acre</span>). Otherwise, Josiah would not have had to go so far north to meet him.<p><span class= "bld">When he had seen him.</span>--At the outset of the encounter; as we might say, <span class= "ital">the moment he got sight of him.</span> According to the account in Chronicles, which is derived from a different source, Josiah was wounded by the Egyptian archers, and carried in a dying state to Jerusalem (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-22.htm" title="Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and listened not to the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight in the valley of Megiddo.">2Chronicles 35:22</a> <span class= "ital">seq</span>.). Thenius thinks that <a href="/context/jeremiah/15-7.htm" title="And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy my people since they return not from their ways.">Jeremiah 15:7-9</a> was spoken on occasion of Josiah's departure with his army from the north, and that the prophet's metaphor, "her sun went down while it was yet day," refers to the eclipse of Thales, which had recently happened, 610 B.C. (Herod, i. 74, 103). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In his days Pharaoh-Nechoh King of Egypt went up against the King of Assyria.</span> Neku, the "Pharaoh-Nechoh" of this passage, and the Necos of Herodotus (2. 158, 159), was the son of Psamatik I., and succeeded his father on the throne of Egypt, probably in <span class="date">B.C. 610</span>. He was one of the most enterprising of the later Egyptian kings, and appears to have made this expedition in his second or third year. The unsettled condition of Western Asia after the Scythic invasion, and the fall of the Assyrian empire, seemed to give an opportunity for Egypt to reclaim her old dominion over Syria and Mesopotamia. The "King of Assyria," against whom Pharaoh-Nechoh "went up," was probably Nabopolassar, the father of Nebuchadnezzar. His proper rifle was "King of Babylon," which is what Nebuchadnezzar always calls him ('Records of the Past,' vol. 5. p. 113, line 22; vol. 7. p. 71, line 6; p. 75, line 9); but the Jews not unnaturally regarded him as the inheritor of the Assyrian empire, as indeed they regarded the Persian monarchs also (<a href="/ezra/6-22.htm">Ezra 6:22</a>), and therefore gave him the title of "King of Assyria." <span class="cmt_word">To the river Euphrates.</span> The author of Chronicles says that "Necho King of Egypt came up to fight against Carchemish" (or "at Carehemish") "by Euphrates," which shows that his design was to penetrate into Northern Syria, where Carchemish (now <span class="accented">Jerabus</span>) was situated, with a view probably of crossing the Euphrates by the ford at Bir, or by that at Balis, into Mesopotamia. <span class="cmt_word">And King Josiah wont against him.</span> It is possible that Josiah had accepted the position of Babylonian tributary after the fall of the Assyrian kingdom, and thought himself bound to resist an attack upon his suzerain. Or he may simply have resented the violation of his territory, without his permission, by a foreign army. Certainly, if he had allowed the free passage of the Egyptian troops, backwards and forwards, through his country, he would in a short time have lost even the shadow of independence. Nechoh's assurance that his expedition was not against him (Josiah), but against the Assyrians (<a href="/2_chronicles/35-21.htm">2 Chronicles 35:21</a>), was not a thing to be relied upon, any more than his declaration that God had commanded his expedition. <span class="cmt_word">And he slew him at Megiddo, when he had soon him.</span> Megiddo is, beyond all doubt, the present <span class="accented">El-Ledjun</span> on the northern outskirt of the range of hills which separates the Plain of Esdraelon from that of Sharon. It is certainly surprising to find that Josiah had taken up a position so far to the north, leaving Jerusalem, and, indeed, all Judaea, unprotected. But he may have thought the advantages of the position such as to compensate for any risk to the Judaean cities, in which he would, of course, have left garrisons. Or, possibly, as Keil and Bahr suppose, Nechoh may have conveyed his troops to the Syrian coast by sea, and have landed in the Bay of Acre, close to the Plain of Esdraelon. In this case Josiah would have no choice, but, if he opposed the Egyptian monarch at all, must have met him where he did, in the Esdraelon plain, as he entered it from the Plain of Acre. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/23-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At the end of [Josiah's] reign,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1464;&#1441;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;m&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
