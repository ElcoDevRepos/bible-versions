The "deliverer" mentioned here is not named, but it is understood to be a leader or a series of leaders who were raised by God to rescue Israel from their enemies. This reflects a recurring theme in the Old Testament where God raises deliverers, such as the judges in the Book of Judges, to save His people. This deliverance is a foreshadowing of the ultimate deliverer, Jesus Christ, who delivers humanity from sin.<p><b>and they escaped the power of the Arameans</b><br>The Arameans, also known as the Syrians, were a significant threat to Israel during this period. Their power and influence were substantial, and they frequently clashed with Israel. The escape from their power signifies a temporary reprieve and a return to peace, which was a direct result of divine intervention. This deliverance underscores God's sovereignty and His ability to rescue His people from seemingly insurmountable odds.<p><b>Then the people of Israel lived in their own homes as they had before</b><br>This phrase indicates a restoration of normalcy and peace for the Israelites. Living in their own homes suggests a return to stability and security, which had been disrupted by the Aramean oppression. This restoration is reminiscent of the peace and prosperity promised to Israel when they obeyed God, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>.
