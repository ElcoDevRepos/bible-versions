The removal from God's presence signifies a severe judgment, as God's presence was associated with blessing and protection. Theologically, this reflects the covenantal relationship where Israel's unfaithfulness led to divine discipline. The concept of being removed from God's presence echoes the expulsion from Eden (<a href="/genesis/3-23.htm">Genesis 3:23-24</a>), highlighting the gravity of sin and separation from God.<p><b>as He had declared through all His servants the prophets</b><br>The prophets, such as Amos, Hosea, and Isaiah, had repeatedly warned Israel of the consequences of their idolatry and injustice. This phrase underscores the faithfulness of God to His word and the role of prophets as His messengers. The prophetic warnings were not heeded, leading to the fulfillment of their dire predictions. This serves as a reminder of the importance of listening to God's word and the certainty of His promises, both of blessing and judgment.<p><b>So Israel was exiled from their homeland into Assyria</b><br>The exile to Assyria occurred in 722 BC under the reign of King Hoshea, marking the end of the northern kingdom. This event is historically significant as it led to the dispersion of the ten tribes, often referred to as the "Lost Tribes of Israel." Assyrian records corroborate the biblical account, providing archaeological evidence of the conquest and deportation. Theologically, the exile represents the consequences of breaking the covenant with God, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-36.htm">Deuteronomy 28:36-37</a>.<p><b>where they are to this day</b><br>This phrase indicates the lasting impact of the exile, as the northern tribes did not return to their land as a collective group. It highlights the enduring nature of God's judgment and the historical reality of the Assyrian captivity. The phrase also serves as a reminder of the scattered state of Israel, which is a theme throughout the prophetic literature, pointing to a future hope of restoration and regathering, as seen in passages like <a href="/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21-22</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is just and righteous, executing judgment as He had warned through His prophets.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom, consisting of ten tribes, which fell into idolatry and disobedience against God&#8217;s commands.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophets.htm">The Prophets</a></b><br>God's messengers who warned Israel of the consequences of their disobedience, including figures like Elijah, Elisha, Amos, and Hosea.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>The powerful empire that conquered Israel and took the people into exile, fulfilling God's judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/exile.htm">Exile</a></b><br>The event where the Israelites were removed from their land as a consequence of their persistent sin and rebellion against God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin has real consequences, and persistent disobedience leads to separation from God.

But henceforth "the distinctive character of the nation was lost; such Hebrews as remained in their old land became mixed with their heathen neighbours. When Josiah destroyed the ancient high places of the northern kingdom he slew their priests, whereas the priests of Judaean sanctuaries were provided for at Jerusalem. It is plain from this that he regarded the worship of the northern sanctuaries as purely heathenish (comp. <a href="/2_kings/23-20.htm" title="And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there on the altars, and burned men's bones on them, and returned to Jerusalem.">2Kings 23:20</a> with <a href="/2_kings/17-5.htm" title="Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.">2Kings 17:5</a>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and it was only in much later times that the mixed population of Samaria became possessed of the Pentateuch, and set up a worship on Mount Gerizim, in imitation of the ritual of the second Temple. We have no reason to think that the captive Ephraimites were more able to retain their distinctive character than their brethren who remained in Palestine. The problem of the lost tribes, which has so much attraction for some speculators, is a purely fanciful one. The people whom Hosea and Amos describe were not fitted to maintain themselves apart from the heathen among whom they dwelt. Scattered among strange nations, they accepted the service of strange gods (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm" title="And the LORD shall scatter you among all people, from the one end of the earth even to the other; and there you shall serve other gods, which neither you nor your fathers have known, even wood and stone.">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>), and, losing their distinctive religion, lost also their distinctive existence."
