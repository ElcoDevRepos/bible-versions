It reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over history and His ability to declare the end from the beginning, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>. The certainty of prophecy is a recurring theme in Scripture, underscoring God's control over future events.<p><b>when everything in your palace</b><br>The palace represents the royal household and the wealth accumulated by the kings of Judah. This phrase highlights the impending loss of national treasures and the stripping away of royal dignity. The palace was not only a symbol of political power but also of divine blessing, which would be removed due to disobedience.<p><b>and all that your fathers have stored up until this day</b><br>This refers to the accumulated wealth and treasures gathered by previous generations, including those of Solomon, who amassed great wealth (<a href="/1_kings/10-14.htm">1 Kings 10:14-29</a>). The loss of these treasures signifies the end of a legacy and the consequences of turning away from God's commandments.<p><b>will be carried off to Babylon</b><br>Babylon, a rising power at the time, would become the instrument of God's judgment against Judah. This prophecy foreshadows the Babylonian exile, which occurred in 586 BC when Nebuchadnezzar conquered Jerusalem. Babylon's role as an agent of divine judgment is a theme found throughout the prophetic books, such as Jeremiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>Nothing will be left</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the totality of the coming destruction and exile. It reflects the complete desolation that would befall Judah, leaving nothing behind. This total loss serves as a stark warning of the consequences of forsaking the covenant with God.<p><b>says the LORD</b><br>The declaration "says the LORD" affirms the divine authority behind the prophecy. It underscores that the message is not from a human source but from God Himself, who is faithful to His word. This phrase is a reminder of the prophetic office and the role of prophets as God's messengers, as seen throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hezekiah.htm">Hezekiah</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for his faithfulness to God but also for his moment of pride when he showed the Babylonian envoys all his treasures.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah.htm">Isaiah</a></b><br>The prophet who delivered God's message to Hezekiah, warning him of the future consequences of his actions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylon.htm">Babylon</a></b><br>The rising power that would eventually conquer Judah and carry off its treasures and people into exile.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which Hezekiah ruled, and which would later face exile due to its disobedience to God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/envoys_from_babylon.htm">Envoys from Babylon</a></b><br>Representatives from Babylon who visited Hezekiah, leading to the prophecy of future exile.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_pride.htm">The Consequences of Pride</a></b><br>Hezekiah's pride in showing off his wealth led to a prophecy of loss.

It is there said that Divine wrath fell upon Hezekiah, because his heart was lifted up; and that the Babylonian embassy was an occasion in which God made proof of his inward tendencies. Self-confidence and vanity would be awakened in Hezekiah's heart as he displayed all his resources to the envoys, and heard their politic, and perhaps hyperbolical, expressions of wonder and delight, and himself, it may be, realised for the first time the full extent of his prosperity. But it was not only the king's vanity which displeased a prophet who had always consistently denounced foreign alliances as betokening deviation from absolute trust in Jehovah; and a more terrible irony than that which animates the oracle before us can hardly be conceived. Thy friends, he cries, will prove robbers, thine allies will become thy conquerors. That Isaiah should have foreseen that Assyria, then in the heyday of its power, would one day be dethroned from the sovereignty of the world by that very Babylon which, at the time he spoke, was menaced with ruin by the Assyrian arms, can only be accepted as true by those who accept the reality of supernatural prediction. Thenius remarks: "An Isaiah might well perceive i what fate threatened the little kingdom of Judah, in case of a revolution of affairs brought about by the Babylonians." But the tone of the prophecy is not hypothetical, but entirely positive. Besides, Isaiah evidently did not suppose that Merodach-baladan's revolt would succeed. (Comp. <a href="/isaiah/14-29.htm" title="Rejoice not you, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote you is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.">Isaiah 14:29</a>, <span class= "ital">seq.,</span> 21:9.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day, shall be carried into Babylon.</span> These treasures of thy royal house, whereof thou art so proud, and which thou hast of thine own accord made known to the Babylonians, to obtain their alliance, will in fact excite their cupidity, and the time will come when they, or what remains of them and represents them, will be carried off as plunder to Babylon by a conquering monarch, who will strip thy palace of its valuables, and drag thy descendants into captivity, and degrade them to the condition of slaves or servants, and make them discharge menial offices about his court. The revelation was now, it would seem, for the first time made that Babylon, and not Assyria, was the true enemy which Judaea had to fear, the destined foe who would accomplish all the threats of the prophets from Moses downwards, who would destroy the holy city and the glorious temple of Solomon, and carry away the ark of the covenant, and tear the people from their homes, and bring the kingdom of David to an end, and give Jerusalem over as a prey to desolation for seventy years. Henceforth it was Babylon and not Assyria which was feared, Babylon and not Assyria whereto the prophetic gaze of Isaiah himself was directed, and which became in his later prophecies (40 - 66.) the main object of his denunciations. Considering the circumstances of the time, the prophecy is a most extraordinary one. Babylonia was at the time merely one of several kingdoms bordering on Assyria which the Assyrians threatened with destruction. From the time of Tiglath-pileser she had been continually diminishing, while Assyria had been continually increasing, in power. Tiglath-pileser had overrun the country and established himself as king there. Shalmaneser's authority had been uncontested. If just at present a native prince held the throne, it was by a very uncertain tenure, and a few years later Assyria regained complete mastery. No <span class="accented">human</span> foresight could possibly have anticipated such a complete reversal of the relative positions of the two countries as was involved in Isaiah's prophecy - a reversal which was only accomplished by the appearance on the scene of a new power, Media, which hitherto had been regarded as of the very slightest account<span class="cmt_word">.
