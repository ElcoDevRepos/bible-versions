In the ancient Near Eastern context, it was common for entire families to be punished for the crimes of an individual, as a means of eliminating potential threats to the throne. However, Amaziah's choice to spare the children of the murderers reflects a departure from this practice, emphasizing a commitment to justice and individual responsibility. This decision aligns with the biblical principle of personal accountability, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture.<p><b>but acted according to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses</b><br>Amaziah's actions are rooted in adherence to the Mosaic Law, which is foundational to the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The Book of the Law of Moses, primarily the first five books of the Old Testament, contains the legal and moral code given to the Israelites. By following this law, Amaziah demonstrates his desire to govern in a manner that honors God's commandments, setting a standard for righteous leadership.<p><b>where the LORD commanded:</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine authority behind the law. The commandments are not merely human constructs but are given by the LORD, the covenant God of Israel. This divine origin of the law reinforces its importance and the necessity of obedience. It also reflects the theocratic nature of Israel's society, where God's will is central to governance and justice.<p><b>&#8220;Fathers must not be put to death for their children, and children must not be put to death for their fathers;</b><br>This commandment is found in <a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a> and emphasizes the principle of individual responsibility for sin. It serves as a safeguard against unjust punishment and collective retribution, promoting fairness and justice. This principle is echoed in other parts of Scripture, such as <a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>, which reiterates that each person is accountable for their own actions. It reflects God's justice and mercy, ensuring that punishment is proportionate and just.<p><b>each is to die for his own sin.&#8221;</b><br>The emphasis on personal accountability is a key aspect of biblical justice. This principle is foundational to the understanding of sin and atonement in the Bible. It foreshadows the New Testament teaching on personal responsibility for sin and the need for individual repentance and faith in Jesus Christ for salvation. In a broader theological context, it points to the ultimate justice of God, who judges each person according to their deeds, while also providing a means of redemption through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amaziah.htm">Amaziah</a></b><br>- The king of Judah who reigned after his father Joash.

Sons, it might be assumed, would be cognizant of their father's intention, and would so be accessories before the fact. And the law of <span class="accented">claim</span>, or "blood-feud," would make it dangerous to spare them, since they would be bound to avenge their father's death on his destroyer. That the practice prevailed among the Israelites appears from <a href="/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24</a>, where we find the children of Achan involved in his fate, and again from <a href="/2_kings/9-26.htm">2 Kings 9:26</a>, where we are told that Naboth's sons suffered with their father. But it was contrary to an express command of the Law, as the writer goes on to show. <span class="cmt_word">According unto that which is written in the book of the Law of Moses.</span> "The book of the Law of Moses" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e1;&#x5b5;&#x5e4;&#x5b6;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5e8;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;&#x5be;&#x5de;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;</span>) may be either the Pentateuch regarded as one book, or Deuteronomy, the particular" book" of the Pentateuch in which the passage occurs. In either case the passage is fatal to the theory of the late' composition of Deuteronomy, which is here found to have ruled the conduct of a Jewish king a hundred and fifty years before Manasseh, two hundred before Josiah, and two hundred and eighty before the return from the Captivity - the dates assigned to Deuteronomy by recent "advanced" critics. <span class="cmt_word">Wherein the Lord commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.</span> As usual, when one sacred writer quotes another, the quotation is not exact. "But" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x5dd;</span>) is inserted at the beginning of the final clause, and the form of the verb in the same clause is modified. It seems to be intended that we should be made to feel that it is the sentiment or meaning conveyed, and not the phraseology in which it is wrapped up, that is of importance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/14-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Yet</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#7791;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
