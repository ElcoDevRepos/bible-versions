Aram was a significant power in the region, often in conflict with Israel. As commander, Naaman held a position of great authority and influence, reflecting the importance of military prowess in ancient Near Eastern societies. His role is comparable to other military leaders in the Bible, such as Joshua or Joab, who were instrumental in their nations' military successes.<p><b>was a great man in his master&#8217;s sight and highly regarded</b><br>Naaman's status as a "great man" indicates his favor with the king of Aram, likely due to his military successes. This phrase suggests a relationship of trust and respect between Naaman and the king, highlighting the importance of loyalty and competence in leadership roles. In the ancient world, military leaders often held significant political power, and Naaman's esteem would have extended beyond the battlefield.<p><b>for through him the LORD had given victory to Aram</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the sovereignty of God over all nations, not just Israel. It suggests that God can use anyone, even those outside His chosen people, to accomplish His purposes. This is a recurring theme in the Bible, where God uses foreign nations to discipline or deliver Israel (e.g., Cyrus in <a href="/isaiah/45.htm">Isaiah 45:1</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament message of salvation being available to all nations.<p><b>And he was a mighty man of valor</b><br>The term "mighty man of valor" is used throughout the Old Testament to describe warriors of exceptional bravery and skill, such as Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>) and David's mighty men (2 Samuel 23). This designation underscores Naaman's reputation as a formidable and respected warrior, emphasizing his strength and courage despite his affliction.<p><b>but he was a leper</b><br>Leprosy in the Bible often symbolizes sin and impurity, as it rendered individuals ceremonially unclean and isolated them from society (Leviticus 13-14). Naaman's leprosy presents a stark contrast to his military achievements and social standing, highlighting the limitations of human power and the universal need for divine intervention. This condition sets the stage for his encounter with the prophet Elisha, which ultimately points to themes of humility, faith, and God's power to heal and restore. Naaman's healing can be seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, offering cleansing and restoration to all who come to Him in faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/naaman.htm">Naaman</a></b><br>A commander of the army of Aram, highly esteemed by his king and known for his valor.
