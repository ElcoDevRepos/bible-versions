This miracle is a testament to Elisha's role as a prophet and a foreshadowing of Christ's power over death, as seen in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43-44</a>). The act of raising the dead is a rare and significant miracle in the Old Testament, highlighting God's power and compassion. Gehazi's presence in the king's court suggests a time before his leprosy (<a href="/2_kings/5-27.htm">2 Kings 5:27</a>), indicating a chronological context for this narrative.<p><b>Just then the woman whose son Elisha had revived came to appeal to the king for her house and her land.</b><br>The timing of the woman's arrival is providential, suggesting divine orchestration. The Shunammite woman had left her land due to a famine (<a href="/2_kings/8.htm">2 Kings 8:1-2</a>) and returned to find her property taken. Her appeal to the king reflects the legal and social customs of the time, where a king could intervene in property disputes. This moment underscores God's provision and timing, as her arrival coincides with Gehazi's testimony, ensuring her story is heard by the king.<p><b>So Gehazi said, &#8220;My lord the king, this is the woman, and this is the son Elisha restored to life.&#8221;</b><br>Gehazi's identification of the woman and her son serves as a witness to the truth of his account. In the ancient Near Eastern context, witnesses were crucial for verifying claims. This recognition by Gehazi not only authenticates the miracle but also provides the king with firsthand evidence of God's power through Elisha. The restoration of the woman's son is a type of Christ's resurrection power, prefiguring the ultimate restoration and life found in Jesus. The king's subsequent actions (<a href="/2_kings/8-6.htm">2 Kings 8:6</a>) demonstrate the influence of a testimony corroborated by living evidence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gehazi.htm">Gehazi</a></b><br>The servant of Elisha, who is recounting the miracles performed by Elisha to the king of Israel.

Here, Gehazi&#8217;s narrative serves as a providential setup for what follows.<p>&#8226; God orchestrates events so that testimony aligns with tangible evidence, reinforcing faith (<a href="/psalms/145-4.htm">Psalm 145:4-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Just then the woman whose son Elisha had revived came to appeal to the king for her house and her land</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Just then&#8221; (literally &#8220;while he was still speaking,&#8221;) shows God&#8217;s perfect timing (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>&#8226; The woman had obeyed Elisha&#8217;s earlier warning to leave during a seven-year famine (<a href="/2_kings/8-1.htm">2 Kings 8:1-2</a>). Returning, she finds her property confiscated and appeals for justice.<p>&#8226; Her initiative reflects faith and courage; she seeks restoration because she trusts the same God who restored her son (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>; <a href="/luke/18-1.htm">Luke 18:1-8</a>).<p>&#8226; The convergence of her arrival with Gehazi&#8217;s story is no coincidence; it is divine appointment, reminiscent of Ruth &#8220;happening&#8221; upon Boaz&#8217;s field (<a href="/ruth/2-3.htm">Ruth 2:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So Gehazi said, &#8220;My lord the king, this is the woman, and this is the son Elisha restored to life.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Gehazi&#8217;s identification provides immediate, irrefutable confirmation of the miracle, satisfying the Mosaic standard of at least two witnesses (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The living son stands as undeniable proof of God&#8217;s power, echoing Jesus&#8217; words that works authenticate the messenger (<a href="/john/10-25.htm">John 10:25, 37</a>-38).<p>&#8226; The king&#8217;s subsequent action&#8212;granting full restitution plus lost income (<a href="/2_kings/8-6.htm">2 Kings 8:6</a>)&#8212;demonstrates that God not only revives but also restores (<a href="/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; For the woman, this moment seals a double blessing: her child&#8217;s life and her livelihood, paralleling Job&#8217;s later restoration (<a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_kings/8-5.htm">2 Kings 8:5</a> showcases God&#8217;s sovereign orchestration of events to validate His prophet&#8217;s miracle, protect His faithful servant, and testify to His life-giving, restoring power. Gehazi&#8217;s timely testimony, the woman&#8217;s bold appeal, and the king&#8217;s swift justice converge to illustrate that the Lord who raises the dead also arranges circumstances for the vindication and provision of His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">A dead body.</span>--<span class= "ital">The dead.</span><p><span class= "bld">Cried.</span>--<span class= "ital">Was crying.</span> Literally, the Hebrew runs, <span class= "ital">And it came to pass, he </span>(emphatic) <span class= "ital">was telling</span> . . . <span class= "ital">and behold the woman was crying,</span> &c.

As an eye-witness (<a href="/2_kings/4-29.htm">2 Kings 4:29-36</a>), he could give all the details. <span class="cmt_word">That, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land.</span> The coincidence can scarcely have been accidental. Divine providence so ordered matters that, just when the king's interest in the woman was most warm, she should appear before him to urge her claim. At another time, Jehoram would, it is probable, have been but slightly moved by her complaint. Under the peculiar circumstances, he was deeply moved, and at once granted the woman the redress for which she asked. <span class="cmt_word">And Gehazi said, Wry lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.</span> The Shunammite was accompanied by her son, now a boy of at least tea or eleven years old - the actual object of Elisha's miracle. The king's interest in the woman would be still more roused by this circumstance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/8-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1440;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
