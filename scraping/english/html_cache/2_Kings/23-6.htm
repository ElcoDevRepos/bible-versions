Its presence in the temple indicates the extent of idolatry that had infiltrated Judah. This act of removal signifies a return to monotheistic worship, aligning with the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). The temple, meant to be a place of worship for Yahweh, had been defiled, and King Josiah's reforms aimed to restore its sanctity.<p><b>to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem</b><br>The Kidron Valley, located east of Jerusalem, served as a boundary and a place for disposing of impurities. Historically, it was used for the disposal of idols and other unclean items (<a href="/1_kings/15-13.htm">1 Kings 15:13</a>). The valley's use in this context underscores the seriousness of purging idolatry from the land, as it was a place associated with judgment and cleansing.<p><b>and there he burned it</b><br>Burning the Asherah pole was a symbolic act of total destruction, ensuring that it could not be reused or revered. This act of burning is reminiscent of the destruction of the golden calf in <a href="/exodus/32-20.htm">Exodus 32:20</a>, where Moses also burned the idol. It signifies a complete rejection of idolatry and a return to covenant faithfulness.<p><b>ground it to powder</b><br>Grinding the Asherah pole to powder further emphasizes the thoroughness of its destruction. This act ensured that no remnant of the idol remained, symbolizing the obliteration of false worship. It reflects the biblical principle of eradicating sin completely, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/9-21.htm">Deuteronomy 9:21</a>, where Moses ground the golden calf to powder.<p><b>and threw its dust on the graves of the common people</b><br>The act of scattering the dust on graves signifies defilement, as contact with the dead was considered unclean (<a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11</a>). This action could symbolize the judgment on those who participated in or tolerated idolatry. It also serves as a warning to the living about the consequences of turning away from God.
