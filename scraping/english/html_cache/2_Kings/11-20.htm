The rejoicing follows the end of Athaliah's tyrannical rule, which was marked by idolatry and violence. The people&#8217;s joy reflects a return to the Davidic line through Joash, which was significant for maintaining the covenantal promises God made to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). This moment of rejoicing can be seen as a type of the ultimate joy believers will experience in the reign of Christ, the true King from the line of David (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p><b>And the city was quiet,</b><br>The quietness of the city signifies peace and stability after a period of turmoil and unrest. Athaliah's reign was characterized by chaos and the usurpation of the throne, which disrupted the social and religious order. The quietness can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to bring peace to His people when they follow His ways (<a href="/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>). This peace foreshadows the peace that Christ brings to the hearts of believers and ultimately to the world (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>).<p><b>because Athaliah had been put to the sword at the royal palace.</b><br>Athaliah's execution marks the end of her illegitimate rule. She was the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, and her reign in Judah was an extension of the idolatry and wickedness associated with her parents. Her death at the royal palace, the center of her power, symbolizes the removal of evil from the heart of the nation. This act of justice aligns with the biblical principle that God will not allow wickedness to prevail indefinitely (<a href="/psalms/37-28.htm">Psalm 37:28</a>). The removal of Athaliah can be seen as a precursor to the ultimate defeat of evil through Christ's victory over sin and death (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/athaliah.htm">Athaliah</a></b><br>The daughter of Ahab and Jezebel, Athaliah was the queen mother who usurped the throne of Judah by killing the royal family, except for Joash, who was hidden by Jehosheba.

The verse reminds believers that when God&#8217;s righteous order is restored, joy and peace naturally follow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_kings/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">All the people of the land . . . the city.</span>--Thenius calls this an "evident contrast between the soldiery and the. citizens; the former exulting in their work, the latter not lifting a finger while the idolatrous tyrant was being put to death " (connecting the first half of the verse with the second; after Ewald). But his assumption that "all the people of the land," here and in <a href="/2_kings/11-14.htm" title="And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.">2Kings 11:14</a>, means "the soldiery" ("die ganze in Jerusalem anwesende Kriegerische Landesmannschaft--Die Kriegsmannschaft") is certainly wrong. "The people of the land" are plainly opposed to the royal guards--"the Praetorians"--who effected the revolution, as civilians to soldiers.<p><span class= "bld">The city was in quiet.</span>--The citizens of Jerusalem accepted the revolution without attempting any counter movement. No doubt there was a strong element of Baal-worshippers and partisans of Athaliah in the capital. "The people of the land" (<span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, probably, the people whom the centurions had called together from the country, at the instance of Jehoiada, according to <a href="/2_chronicles/23-2.htm" title="And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 23:2</a>) are contrasted with the burghers of Jerusalem. The phrase, "the city was in quiet" (or "had rest," <a href="/judges/5-31.htm" title="So let all your enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love him be as the sun when he goes forth in his might. And the land had rest forty years.">Judges 5:31</a>), may, however, possibly refer to the deliverance from the tyranny of Athaliah.<p><span class= "bld">And they slew Athaliah.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">and Athaliah they had slain</span>; an emphatic recurrence to the real climax of the story (<a href="/2_kings/11-16.htm" title="And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain.">2Kings 11:16</a>), by way of conclusion.<p><span class= "bld">Beside.</span>--Rather,<span class= "ital"> in, i.e.</span>, within the palace enclosure. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And all the people of the land rejoiced.</span> "All the people of the land" has here, perhaps, a wider signification than in vers. 18 and 19.

Ewald has no ground for his statement that the heathenizing party was strong in Jerusalem, and that the worshippers of Jehovah "had for a long time to keep watch in the temple, to prevent surprise by the heathenizing party" ('History of Israel,' vol. 4. p. 136, note 3).
