This was a common practice to prevent rebellion by mixing populations. Worshiping the LORD indicates an acknowledgment of Yahweh, the God of Israel, possibly due to fear of the lions sent by God (<a href="/2_kings/17-25.htm">2 Kings 17:25-26</a>). This reflects a syncretistic approach, where they attempted to incorporate the worship of Yahweh into their existing religious practices. This situation highlights the tension between true worship and syncretism, a recurring theme in Israel's history (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>).<p><b>but they also appointed for themselves priests of all sorts</b><br>The appointment of priests "of all sorts" suggests a lack of adherence to the Levitical priesthood established by God (<a href="/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>). This action demonstrates a disregard for the divinely ordained structure of worship and priesthood. It reflects the broader issue of Israel's failure to maintain the purity of worship as commanded in the Law. This mirrors the earlier sin of Jeroboam, who appointed non-Levitical priests (<a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>), leading Israel into idolatry.<p><b>to serve in the shrines of the high places</b><br>High places were local worship sites often associated with idolatry and pagan practices. Despite their initial purpose for worshiping Yahweh, they became centers of syncretistic worship, blending the worship of God with that of other deities. This practice was condemned by the prophets and was a significant reason for Israel's downfall (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-12</a>). The persistence of high places throughout Israel's history illustrates the challenge of maintaining pure worship and the ease with which God's people can be led astray.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The Northern Kingdom of Israel, which had been taken into Assyrian captivity due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_samaritans.htm">The Samaritans</a></b><br>A mixed population that arose after the Assyrians resettled people from various nations into the land of Israel, leading to a syncretistic form of worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whom the people superficially feared but did not fully obey.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests_from_all_sorts_of_people.htm">Priests from all sorts of people</a></b><br>Individuals appointed by the people to serve as priests, contrary to the Levitical priesthood established by God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_places.htm">High places</a></b><br>Sites of worship that were often associated with idolatry and unauthorized religious practices.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_syncretism.htm">The Danger of Syncretism</a></b><br>Mixing true worship with pagan practices leads to a diluted faith that is not pleasing to God.
