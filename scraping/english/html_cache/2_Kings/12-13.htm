The money mentioned here was collected as offerings and contributions from the people, intended for the maintenance and repair of the temple. This reflects the communal responsibility and reverence the Israelites had for their place of worship. The collection of money for the temple is reminiscent of the contributions for the tabernacle in <a href="/exodus/25.htm">Exodus 25:1-7</a>, where the Israelites gave willingly for the construction of the sanctuary.<p><b>was not used for making silver basins, wick trimmers, sprinkling bowls, trumpets,</b><br>These items were essential for the daily rituals and ceremonies conducted in the temple. Silver basins and sprinkling bowls were used for purification rites, while wick trimmers were necessary for maintaining the lamps in the temple, ensuring that the light, symbolizing God's presence, was never extinguished. Trumpets were used in various religious ceremonies and festivals, as seen in <a href="/numbers/10.htm">Numbers 10:1-10</a>. The absence of new articles being made suggests a focus on structural repairs rather than the creation of new ceremonial objects.<p><b>or any articles of gold or silver for the house of the LORD.</b><br>Gold and silver articles were significant in the temple, symbolizing purity, holiness, and the glory of God. The original temple, built by Solomon, was renowned for its opulence and the extensive use of gold and silver (<a href="/1_kings/6-20.htm">1 Kings 6:20-22</a>). The decision not to use the money for these articles indicates a prioritization of practical repairs over ornamental enhancements. This practical approach can be seen as a reflection of the need to restore the temple's function and integrity, rather than its external beauty. This focus on restoration over embellishment can be seen as a type of Christ, who emphasized the importance of inner purity over outward appearances (<a href="/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25-28</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joash.htm">Joash (Jehoash)</a></b><br>King of Judah who initiated repairs for the temple.

There is no contradiction between this statement and that of the writer of Chronicles (<a href="/2_chronicles/24-14.htm">2 Chronicles 24:14</a>), who tells us that, <span class="accented">after the entire repairs were completed</span>, the surplus money was expended in this way, on the purchase of "vessels to minister and to offer, spoons, and vessels of gold and silver." We can well understand that, after the spoiling of the temple by successive kings to buy off enemies - by Rehoboam to content Shishak (<a href="/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>), by Asa to gratify Benhadad (<a href="/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>), and by Joash himself (ver. 18) to procure the retreat of Hazael from the siege of Jerusalem, the vessels of the temple must have required renovating almost as much as the fabric itself; and when it was found that there remained a surplus over and above all that was needed for building purposes, we cannot wonder that it was applied to the renewal of the vessels, absolutely essential as they were for the service of the sanctuary. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_kings/12-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">However,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_389.htm">Strong's 389: </a> </span><span class="str2">A particle of affirmation, surely</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the money</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1505;&#1462;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;ke&#183;sep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun -
