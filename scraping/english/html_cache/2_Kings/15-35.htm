Despite reforms by some kings, these sites persisted in Israel and Judah. The failure to remove them indicates incomplete obedience to God's commands (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-4</a>). This reflects a recurring theme in the history of Israel, where partial reforms were made, but full adherence to God's law was lacking. The persistence of high places suggests a struggle between traditional Canaanite practices and the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>the people continued sacrificing and burning incense there.</b><br>Sacrificing and burning incense were central acts of worship, intended to be performed at the temple in Jerusalem. The continuation of these practices at high places indicates a syncretism, blending Yahweh worship with local customs. This disobedience highlights the people's attachment to familiar religious practices, despite prophetic warnings (<a href="/1_kings/22-43.htm">1 Kings 22:43</a>). It underscores the challenge of leading a nation to pure worship and the ease with which people revert to comfortable traditions.<p><b>Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the house of the LORD.</b><br>Jotham, king of Judah, is noted for his construction projects, which included fortifying Jerusalem. The Upper Gate was part of the temple complex, possibly enhancing security or accessibility. This act demonstrates Jotham's commitment to the temple, aligning with his generally positive evaluation as a king who did what was right in the eyes of the LORD (<a href="/2_kings/15-34.htm">2 Kings 15:34</a>). The rebuilding signifies a focus on maintaining and improving the central place of worship, contrasting with the neglect of removing high places. This action can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate restorer and builder of God's spiritual house, the Church (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jotham.htm">Jotham</a></b><br>The king of Judah during this time, known for doing what was right in the eyes of the LORD, yet failing to remove the high places.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/high_places.htm">High Places</a></b><br>Elevated sites where people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense, often associated with idolatrous practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/u/upper_gate_of_the_house_of_the_lord.htm">Upper Gate of the House of the LORD</a></b><br>A significant construction attributed to Jotham, indicating his commitment to the temple and worship of Yahweh.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/partial_obedience.htm">Partial Obedience</a></b><br>Jotham's failure to remove the high places serves as a reminder that partial obedience is not full obedience.

Despite good leadership traits already attributed to Jotham (see <a href="/2_kings/15-34.htm">2 Kings 15:34</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/27-2.htm">2 Chronicles 27:2</a>), something important remained unresolved.<p>- Similar &#8220;nevertheless&#8221; moments are found with Asa (<a href="/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>) and Jehoshaphat (<a href="/1_kings/22-43.htm">1 Kings 22:43</a>), reminding us that a king&#8217;s personal faithfulness does not automatically transform national worship.<p>- The contrast underscores God&#8217;s consistent standard: wholehearted obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2-4</a>) rather than partial reforms.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the high places were not taken away</b><p>- High places were local worship sites, often blending true worship with pagan practices. God had clearly forbidden them (<a href="/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-13.htm">Deuteronomy 12:13-14</a>).<p>- By leaving them intact, Jotham perpetuated a compromise that had plagued Judah since Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/3-2.htm">1 Kings 3:2-3</a>).<p>- The verse echoes the assessment of his father Uzziah (<a href="/2_kings/15-4.htm">2 Kings 15:4</a>) and will be repeated about future kings, showing a recurring blind spot in Judah&#8217;s spiritual life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the people continued sacrificing and burning incense there</b><p>- Worship persisted, but in the wrong place and manner. Outward religious activity does not equal obedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22-23</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-11.htm">Isaiah 1:11-15</a>).<p>- Incense and sacrifices belong at the temple altar (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-7</a>). Persisting elsewhere fostered syncretism and dulled the nation&#8217;s discernment, setting the stage for later judgment under Ahaz (<a href="/2_kings/16-3.htm">2 Kings 16:3-4</a>) and ultimately the exile (<a href="/2_kings/17-9.htm">2 Kings 17:9-12</a>).<p>- The people&#8217;s persistence shows that reforms must reach the heart, not just policy (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the house of the LORD</b><p>- Though he failed to remove the high places, Jotham honored God by strengthening the temple infrastructure (<a href="/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>).<p>- The Upper Gate likely served as a fortified northern entrance, enhancing security and facilitating proper worship traffic&#8212;practical ministry that mattered (compare Hezekiah&#8217;s later repairs, <a href="/2_chronicles/29-3.htm">2 Chronicles 29:3</a>).<p>- His building project illustrates that leaders can do genuine good even while leaving other issues unresolved. It foreshadows Christ, the ultimate Builder of God&#8217;s house (<a href="/hebrews/3-3.htm">Hebrews 3:3-6</a>), who will one day purge all compromise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>- The verse shows a mixed report: sincere temple investment but lingering high-place compromise.<p>- God records both faithfulness and failure, urging us toward complete obedience.<p>- Partial reforms may stabilize a nation temporarily, yet only wholehearted allegiance to God&#8217;s revealed will brings lasting blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burned incense, still in the high places.</span> <span class="cmt_word">He built the higher gate of the house of the Lord.</span> The "higher gate "is thought to be that towards the north, and its fortification implied a fear of attack from that quarter. It must have become amply evident to the kings of Judah, at any rate from the time of the attack on Menahem (ver. 19), that the independence of both kingdoms was menaced by Assyria, and that it was of great importance that their principal fortresses should be placed in a state of efficient defense. Azariah had paid great attention to the fortifying and arming of Jerusalem (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-9.htm">2 Chronicles 26:9, 15</a>), and his son now followed in his footsteps. From <a href="/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a> we learn that he not only built the high gate of the temple, but also "on the wall of Ophel built much," Nor was he content with fortifying the capital. He also "built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers." Tiglath-pileser had made war on his father ('Eponym Canon,' pp. 117, 118).
