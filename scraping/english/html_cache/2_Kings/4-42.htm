The name "Baal" indicates a place associated with a local deity, common in Canaanite culture before Israel's conquest. This man's journey from Baal-shalishah to meet Elisha suggests a recognition of Elisha's prophetic authority and a willingness to support his ministry, despite the region's pagan associations.<p><b>came to the man of God</b><br>The term "man of God" is a title often used for prophets in the Old Testament, emphasizing their role as God's spokespersons. Elisha, as a successor to Elijah, was recognized for his prophetic ministry and miracles, which affirmed his divine calling and authority.<p><b>with a sack of twenty loaves of barley bread</b><br>Barley was a common grain in ancient Israel, often associated with the food of the poor due to its lower cost compared to wheat. The offering of twenty loaves indicates a significant gift, reflecting generosity and faith, especially during a time of famine (as indicated earlier in the chapter).<p><b>from the first ripe grain</b><br>Offering the first fruits was a practice rooted in the Law of Moses, symbolizing trust in God's provision and acknowledging His sovereignty. This act of bringing the first ripe grain to Elisha demonstrates obedience to God's commands and a recognition of the prophet's role in God's work.<p><b>&#8220;Give it to the people to eat,&#8221; said Elisha.</b><br>Elisha's instruction to distribute the bread reflects a theme of divine provision, reminiscent of God's provision of manna in the wilderness. This act prefigures the miracles of Jesus, particularly the feeding of the 5,000, highlighting God's ability to multiply resources and meet the needs of His people. Elisha's command also underscores the importance of sharing God's blessings with others, a principle echoed throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elisha.htm">Elisha</a></b><br>A prophet of God who succeeded Elijah.

On the present occasion, which was "a time of dearth" (<a href="/2_kings/4-42.htm" title="And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give to the people, that they may eat.">2Kings 4:42</a> is connected by the construction with the preceding narrative), <span class= "ital">one</span> pious person brought his opportune gift to Elisha.<p><span class= "bld">And full ears of corn in the husk thereof</span>.--Heb., <span class= "ital">and karmel in his wallet</span>. The word karmel occurs besides in <a href="/leviticus/2-14.htm" title="And if you offer a meat offering of your first fruits to the LORD, you shall offer for the meat offering of your first fruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.">Leviticus 2:14</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-14.htm" title="And you shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that you have brought an offering to your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.">Leviticus 23:14</a>. The Targum and Syriac render "bruised grain;" the Jewish expositors "tender and fresh ears of corn." In some parts of England unripe corn is made into a dish called "frumenty." The word <span class= "ital">ciqlon</span> only occurs in this place. The Vulg. renders it by <span class= "ital">pera</span> ("wallet"). The LXX. (Alex.) repeats the Hebrew in Greek letters. The Vatican omits the word. It reads: "twenty barley loaves and cakes of pressed fruit" (<span class= "greekheb">???????</span>). The Syriac gives "garment." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_kings/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 42-44.</span> - 4. <span class="accented">The feeding of a hundred men on twenty loaves</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there came a man from Baal-shalisha.</span> "Baal-shalisha" is reasonably identified with the "Beth-shalisha" of Eusebius and Jerome, which they place twelve Roman miles north of Diospolis, or Lydda (now Ludd). By "north" we must probably understand "northeast," since the "land of Shalisha" lay between the territories of Ephraim and Benjamin (<a href="/1_samuel/9-4.htm">1 Samuel 9:4</a>). The position thus indicated would not be very far from the Gilgal (<span class="accented">Jiljileh</span>) of <a href="/2_kings/2.htm">2 Kings 2</a>. and 2 Kings 4:38. <span class="cmt_word">And brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits.</span> It is clear that the more pious among the Israelites not only looked to the prophets for religious instruction (ver. 23), but regarded them as having inherited the position of the Levitical priests whom Jeroboam's innovations had driven from the country. The firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil were assigned by the Law (<a href="/numbers/18-13.htm">Numbers 18:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-4.htm">Deuteronomy 18:4, 5</a>) to the priests. <span class="cmt_word">Twenty loaves of barley.</span> The "loaves" of the Israelites were cakes or rolls, rather than "loaves" in the modern sense of the word. Each partaker of a meal usually had one for himself. Naturally, twenty "loaves" would be barely sufficient for twenty men. <span class="cmt_word">And full ears of corn</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a few ripe ears of the same corn as that whereof the bread was made. Ears of corn were offered as firstfruits at the Passover (<a href="/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10</a>), and were regarded as the most natural and becoming tokens of gratitude for God's harvest mercies. <span class="cmt_word">In the husk thereof</span>;
