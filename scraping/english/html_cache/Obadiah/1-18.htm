In biblical symbolism, fire often represents judgment, purification, and the presence of God. Here, it signifies the power and strength of Israel in executing divine judgment. Historically, the Israelites were often in conflict with the Edomites, descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother. This phrase suggests a reversal of fortunes, where Israel will be empowered to overcome its adversaries.<p><b>and the house of Joseph a burning flame</b><br>The "house of Joseph" refers to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, Joseph's sons, who were significant tribes in the northern kingdom of Israel. The imagery of a "burning flame" complements the "blazing fire," indicating a united and potent force. This reflects the biblical theme of God restoring and uniting His people to fulfill His purposes. The mention of Joseph highlights the broader inclusion of all Israel in this prophetic victory.<p><b>but the house of Esau will be stubble&#8212;</b><br>The "house of Esau" represents the Edomites, who were often antagonistic towards Israel. Stubble is dry and easily consumed by fire, symbolizing vulnerability and impending destruction. This imagery indicates the complete and swift judgment that will befall Edom. Historically, Edom's hostility towards Israel, including during the Babylonian invasion, is well-documented, and this prophecy foretells their downfall as a consequence.<p><b>Jacob will set it ablaze and consume it.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the active role of Israel in executing judgment upon Edom. The imagery of setting ablaze and consuming suggests total destruction, leaving nothing behind. This reflects the biblical principle of divine retribution, where those who oppose God's people face His judgment. It also underscores the theme of God's sovereignty in using His chosen people as instruments of His will.<p><b>Therefore no survivor will remain from the house of Esau.&#8221;</b><br>This statement indicates the totality of Edom's destruction, leaving no remnant. It reflects the severity of divine judgment against those who oppose God's covenant people. Historically, Edom eventually ceased to exist as a distinct nation, fulfilling this prophecy. This serves as a warning of the consequences of enmity against God's purposes and people.<p><b>For the LORD has spoken.</b><br>This phrase underscores the authority and certainty of the prophecy. When the LORD speaks, it is a guarantee of fulfillment, as His word is unchangeable and sovereign. This assurance is a common biblical motif, emphasizing that God's declarations are trustworthy and will come to pass. It serves as a reminder of God's ultimate control over history and His faithfulness to His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_jacob.htm">House of Jacob</a></b><br>Represents the descendants of Jacob, also known as Israel.
