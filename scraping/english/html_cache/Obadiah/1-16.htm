Historically, Edom, descended from Esau, had a longstanding enmity with Israel, descended from Jacob. The "drinking" symbolizes their participation in the plundering and celebration over Jerusalem's downfall. The holy mountain signifies Jerusalem, a place set apart for God's presence and worship. This act of desecration by Edom is seen as a direct affront to God, who considers Jerusalem sacred.<p><b>so all the nations will drink continually</b><br>This part of the verse shifts from Edom to a broader judgment against all nations that oppose God and His people. The "drinking" here symbolizes experiencing God's wrath and judgment. The idea of drinking from the cup of God's wrath is a recurring biblical theme, seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15-29</a> and <a href="/revelation/14-10.htm">Revelation 14:10</a>. The term "continually" emphasizes the completeness and inevitability of this judgment, suggesting that it will be relentless and inescapable for those who oppose God.<p><b>They will drink and gulp it down</b><br>This phrase intensifies the imagery of judgment. The act of "gulping down" suggests an overwhelming and forceful experience of God's wrath, leaving no room for escape or reprieve. It conveys the idea that the nations will fully experience the consequences of their actions against God and His people. This imagery is consistent with prophetic literature, where the cup of wrath is often depicted as being consumed fully, leaving nothing behind.<p><b>they will be as if they had never existed</b><br>This final phrase underscores the totality of the judgment. The nations that oppose God will face such complete destruction that their existence will be utterly erased, as if they had never been. This echoes the biblical theme of divine retribution, where those who defy God face ultimate obliteration. It also serves as a sobering reminder of God's sovereignty and justice, reinforcing the idea that no power can stand against Him. This concept is mirrored in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/37-10.htm">Psalm 37:10</a> and <a href="/malachi/4.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>, which speak of the wicked being cut off and reduced to nothing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/edomites.htm">Edomites</a></b><br>The descendants of Esau, who are the primary audience of Obadiah's prophecy.

What was done on Zion&#8217;s hill becomes the pattern: profane the sacred, drink the cup, choke on its contents, vanish. The passage steadies believers&#8212;God will settle accounts&#8212;and urges unbelievers to trade the cup of wrath for the cup of salvation offered in Christ (<a href="/john/3-36.htm">John 3:36</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/obadiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - As ye have drunk. There are two interpretations of this passage. By the first, the people addressed are considered to be the Jews, and the word "drunk" is taken metaphorically in both clauses (see note on Nahum 3:11). The meaning is then this - As ye Jews, who are upon my holy mountain, the people of election, have not escaped from suffering the wrath of God, so all the nations shell feel the same, and that to a much more terrible extent. Confirmatory of this explanation is the language of Jeremiah, who (<a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15-29</a>) bids all the nations to drink the cup of God's wrath, beginning at Jerusalem and passing on to Edom, and then says, in answer to any who refuse the offered draught, "Lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished?" The same notion is found also in <a href="/jeremiah/49-12.htm">Jeremiah 49:12</a> and <a href="/lamentations/4-21.htm">Lamentations 4:21</a>, etc. But there are objections to this view of the passage. The previous verse enunciated the doctrine of retribution; this verse confirms the former with the words, "for as ye," etc. It would be no proof of the <span class="accented">lex</span> <span class="accented">talionis</span> on the Edomites to cite what had happened to the Jews. What is wanted is an assertion that what they had done should be repaid to them in like coin, Besides, the prophecy is nominally addressed to the Edomites, not to the Jews, and it would he most harsh to change the subject suddenly here. "Upon my mountain" cannot be equivalent to "ye who are upon my mountain;" nor is such an expression ever used to signify "Judaeans." It is best, therefore, to take the clause as referring to the Edomites and their comrades, who, after their victory, indulged in unseemly revelry, and profaned the mountain hallowed by God's presence in the temple with their idolatrous festival The "drinking" in this first clause is literal; in the following clause it is figurative. Septuaguint, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, "thou didst drink," which makes the connection of the subject here with that in ver. 15 more evident, and it has probably been altered by the translators for that purpose. <span class="cmt_word">So shall all the heathen drink continually.</span> The prophet plays on the word "drink." The nations shall drink, not wine, but the wrath of God (<a href="/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>). The nations are spoken of here because Edom is taken as a type of all nations hostile to God, and the retribution that falls on him is extended to all who assume his attitude towards God's people (Keil). <span class="accented">Continually</span>; Vulgate<span class="accented">, jugiter</span>, perpetually, in uninterrupted succession.
