The name "Obadiah" means "servant of the LORD," which is fitting for a prophet. The term "vision" indicates a divine revelation, suggesting that Obadiah received this message directly from God. Prophetic visions were a common way God communicated with His prophets, as seen in other books like Isaiah and Ezekiel.<p><b>This is what the Lord GOD says about Edom&#8212;</b><br>Edom, descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, had a long-standing enmity with Israel. The Edomites lived in the region south of the Dead Sea, known for its rugged terrain and strong fortresses. The phrase "Lord GOD" emphasizes God's sovereignty and authority over all nations, including Edom. The judgment against Edom is a recurring theme in the prophets, reflecting their pride and hostility towards Israel (see <a href="/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/49.htm">Jeremiah 49</a>, and <a href="/ezekiel/25.htm">Ezekiel 25</a>).<p><b>We have heard a message from the LORD;</b><br>The use of "we" suggests that this message was not only for Obadiah but was also confirmed by other prophets or leaders. It indicates a collective understanding or acknowledgment of God's revelation. The phrase underscores the importance of prophetic messages being recognized and validated within the community of believers.<p><b>an envoy has been sent among the nations to say,</b><br>The imagery of an envoy or messenger suggests a call to action among the nations. In ancient times, envoys were sent to deliver important messages or to rally support for military campaigns. This reflects the seriousness of the impending judgment and the divine orchestration behind the events. It also highlights the theme of God using nations to accomplish His purposes, as seen in other prophetic books like Habakkuk.<p><b>&#8220;Rise up, and let us go to battle against her!&#8221;&#8212;</b><br>This call to battle signifies a divine judgment against Edom. The nations are being summoned to execute God's justice. The language of rising up and going to battle is reminiscent of other biblical calls to action, such as in Judges and 1 Samuel. It underscores the inevitability of God's judgment and the futility of resisting His will. The battle against Edom serves as a type of the ultimate victory of God over all His enemies, foreshadowing the final judgment and the establishment of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/obadiah.htm">Obadiah</a></b><br>The prophet who received the vision.

The question of authorship is discussed in the Excursus.<p><span class= "bld">Thus saith the Lord God concerning Edom.--</span>After these words we should expect the words of the message, not the statement that a message had come. Among the attempts at explanation, the two most plausible are: (1) The two-fold heading is due to a later hand than Obadiah, who only prefixed the first part, "vision," &c., to his work; (2) These words are merely a mode of stating generally that the seer of the vision was divinely inspired. The view taken of the authorship and composition must decide between these two. If an earlier oracle is incorporated in the book, it is more natural to conclude that the second part of the double title, which in a slightly different form occurs also in <a href="/jeremiah/49-7.htm" title="Concerning Edom, thus said the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?">Jeremiah 49:7</a>, was introduced in order to bring the prophecy into closer similarity to the circle of oracles against foreign nations which is contained in Jeremiah.<p><span class= "bld">Arise ye</span> . . .--Now at length we have the Divine message. Long ago, in the mysterious oracle of Dumah (<a href="/isaiah/21-11.htm" title="The burden of Dumah. He calls to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?">Isaiah 21:11</a>), the foreboding of a pending chastisement of Seir found a voice, and now, as in consequence of a signal from heaven, or as if brought by an angel, goes forth the summons to the nations to begin the movement against Edom. The cup of iniquity was full. There is a suggestiveness even in the vagueness of the summons. The nations, without distinction of good or bad, must become the instruments of the Divine chastisement of overweening pride. Edom becomes the type of wickedness that has reached a head, and against which all the sounder elements of the world unite with God. For the full picture, here suggested only in a word, see <a href="/context/isaiah/13-1.htm" title="The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.">Isaiah 13:1-17</a>, and comp. <a href="/joel/2-11.htm" title="And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp is very great: for he is strong that executes his word: for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?">Joel 2:11</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-11.htm" title="Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD has raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.">Jeremiah 51:11</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/obadiah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The vision of Obadiah.</span> This is the title of the book, declaring from whom and through whom the revelation comes (<a href="/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>). Under the word "vision" in prophetic language is included, not only what the seer saw, the mental picture presented to his inner senses, but also all that he is commissioned to disclose or enunciate. <span class="cmt_word">Thus saith the Lord God concerning Edom</span>. The prophet declares that God speaks through him. One might have expected that the actual words of Jehovah would follow here instead of tidings heard from him. And this difficulty has led some to suppose these introductory words spurious or the insertion of a later hand, others to include them and the rest of the verse in a parenthesis, so as to begin the "vision" with God's words in ver. 2. But these suggestions are unnecessary. The prophet, as the mouthpiece of God, calls his own words the message of the Lord - signifies that what had been revealed to his mind he was bound to communicate to others as a direct warning from God. The Edomites were the descendants of Esau, and bound by ties of blood to the Israelites; but they had always been their most bitter enemies (<a href="/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>). They are regarded as a type of the powers of the world hostile to true religion, whose end is destruction. <span class="cmt_word">We have heard.</span> "We" - I myself and other prophets; or the Judaeans, the prophet identifying himself with his countrymen. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>, I heard, so <a href="/jeremiah/49-14.htm">Jeremiah 49:14</a>; Arabic, "ye have heard." <span class="cmt_word">A rumour;</span> <span class="accented">a report</span> (<a href="/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>); <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">auditum</span> (Vulgate). It means here "tidings" (comp. <a href="/matthew/24-6.htm">Matthew 24:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>: and <a href="/romans/10-16.htm">Romans 10:16, 17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">An ambassador;</span> <span class="accented">a messenger</span>; as though the prophet saw the minister of God's wrath going forth among the heathen to rouse them to war against Edom. Perowne thinks that there is an allusion to the composite character of Nebuchadnezzar's army with which he attacked the Edomites. The Septuagint renders, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>: so the Syriac, Chaldee, and Symmachus translate "message." This rendering is explained by the following clause. <span class="cmt_word">The heathen</span> (<span class="accented">goyim</span>); <span class="accented">the nations, as</span> vers. 2, 15. <span class="cmt_word">Arise ye, and let us rise.</span> This has been taken as if "arise ye" were the herald's message, and "let us rise" the response of the nations echoing his words; but it is more forcible to consider the whole clause as the message, the ambassador joining himself with the heathen as their leader and comrade in the war of vengeance.
