Historically, Edom was located southeast of Judah, in a mountainous region. The Edomites were known for their wisdom and strategic location, which made them feel secure. However, this prophecy indicates that their security would be shattered. The pillaging of Esau symbolizes the complete devastation and humiliation that would come upon Edom. This judgment is consistent with the biblical theme of divine retribution against nations that oppose God's people, as seen in other prophetic books like <a href="/jeremiah/49-10.htm">Jeremiah 49:10</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/25-12.htm">Ezekiel 25:12-14</a>.<p><b>his hidden treasures sought out!</b><br>Edom was known for its wealth, partly due to its control of trade routes and its natural resources. The phrase "hidden treasures" suggests that Edom's wealth was not only abundant but also carefully guarded. The prophecy indicates that even these well-protected riches would be discovered and taken by their enemies. This serves as a metaphor for the futility of relying on material wealth and human wisdom for security, echoing themes found in <a href="/proverbs/11-28.htm">Proverbs 11:28</a> and <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>. The uncovering of hidden treasures also symbolizes the exposure of Edom's pride and self-reliance, which would ultimately lead to their downfall.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The twin brother of Jacob, Esau is the ancestor of the Edomites.
