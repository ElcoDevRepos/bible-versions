Historically, the Israelites faced several exiles, notably the Assyrian exile of the northern kingdom and the Babylonian exile of the southern kingdom. The term "host" suggests a large group, emphasizing the significant number of Israelites affected. This prophecy speaks to the hope of restoration and return, a common theme in the prophetic books, reflecting God's covenant faithfulness.<p><b>will possess the land of the Canaanites</b><br>The Canaanites were the original inhabitants of the land promised to Abraham and his descendants. This phrase indicates a reversal of fortunes, where the exiled Israelites will reclaim territories once occupied by their ancestors. It echoes the promise of land given to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a> and the conquest under Joshua. This possession signifies God's fulfillment of His promises and the restoration of Israel's inheritance.<p><b>as far as Zarephath</b><br>Zarephath was a Phoenician city located between Tyre and Sidon, in present-day Lebanon. Mentioned in <a href="/1_kings/17-9.htm">1 Kings 17:9</a>, it is where Elijah was sent during a drought. The inclusion of Zarephath highlights the extent of the territory to be reclaimed, extending beyond traditional Israelite borders, symbolizing a broader restoration and influence.<p><b>and the exiles from Jerusalem who are in Sepharad</b><br>Sepharad is a location mentioned only here in the Bible, and its exact identification is uncertain. Some scholars suggest it could refer to a region in Asia Minor or Spain. The mention of Jerusalem exiles indicates those taken during the Babylonian conquest. This phrase underscores the widespread dispersion of the Jewish people and the promise of their return from distant lands.<p><b>will possess the cities of the Negev</b><br>The Negev is a desert region in southern Israel. Historically, it was part of the territory allotted to the tribe of Judah. The promise of possessing the Negev cities signifies the restoration of Judah's land and the reestablishment of the community. This restoration is a testament to God's redemptive plan and His ability to bring His people back to their homeland, fulfilling His promises of restoration and blessing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/exiles_of_the_sons_of_israel.htm">Exiles of the Sons of Israel</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites who were taken captive and scattered among the nations, particularly among the Canaanites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanites.htm">Canaanites</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the land of Canaan, a region that was often in conflict with Israel throughout biblical history.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/zarephath.htm">Zarephath</a></b><br>A city located in the region of Sidon, north of Israel, known for its mention in the account of Elijah and the widow.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/exiles_of_jerusalem.htm">Exiles of Jerusalem</a></b><br>Refers to the people of Judah who were taken into captivity, particularly during the Babylonian exile.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sepharad.htm">Sepharad</a></b><br>A location mentioned in the Bible, traditionally identified with a region in Asia Minor or possibly Spain, representing the far reaches of the Jewish diaspora.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/n/negev.htm">Negev</a></b><br>A desert region in the southern part of Israel, often associated with the promise of land and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_restoration.htm">God's Faithfulness in Restoration</a></b><br>The promise of restoration for the exiles demonstrates God's unwavering faithfulness to His covenant people.

This would imply that the Ephraimitas should be the first to go into exile, and on their return should occupy the territory of the Canaanites on the north. But <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;</span> may mean "domain." Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et transmigratio exercitus hujus filiorum Israel, omnia loca Chananaeorum usque ad Sareptam.</span> The general meaning is that Jewish captives, who have been taken to other lands, shall return and possess the cities of the south. The sentence in the Hebrew is incomplete. Our translators supply, "shall possess." Pusey (in agreement with the Chaldee, and virtually with the Septuagint) renders, "which are among the Canaanites;" and this seems to be correct, making "shall possess the cities of the south" the predicate of both clauses. So the first portion of the verse means, as Henderson says, the number of Israelitish captives which were found in Phoenicia, into which they had been sold at different times as slaves (comp. vers. 11, 14; <a href="/joel/3-6.htm">Joel 3:6, 7</a>). <span class="accented">This host.</span> Not a general deportation, but only the portion of the people referred to. From this expression some have inferred that Obadiah himself was one of this body. This is possible, but not necessary. The captives who are among the Canaanites, even <span class="accented">unto Zarephath</span>; <span class="accented">as far as Zarephath</span>, were probably placed there for safe keeping before being sold into Greece and other countries. Zarepbath ("Melting house"), the <span class="accented">Sarepta</span> of St. Luke (Luke 4:26), now <span class="accented">Surafend</span> or <span class="accented">Sarafend</span>, and celebrated in the history of Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17-9.htm">1 Kings 17:9</a>, etc.), lay between Tyre and Sidon, a little inland, and was a town of some importance, as its ruins prove. The captivity of Jerusalem. The captives from Jerusalem. Which is in Sepharad; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f18;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;</span> "as far as Ephrathah;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">quae in Bosphoro est.</span> The name occurs nowhere else in the Bible, and its identification cannot be established. Jerome suggests, in his commentary, that it is the Assyrian for "boundary," and not a proper name at all. The Peshito and the rabbins And modern Jews interpret it as "Spain." Keil supposes it to be "Sparta;" Pusey, "Sardis." For this last explanation some ground has been found in an inscription of Nakshi-Rustam, where a place called <span class="accented">Cparda</span> occurs in a list of tribes between Cappadocia and Ionia; and <span class="accented">Cparda is</span> considered to be the Persian form of <span class="accented">Sardis</span> (see Schrader, 'Keilinschr.,' p. 445, etc.). A further confirmation of this identification is found in the complaint of Joel (Joel 3:6 [4:6, Hebrew], that the Phoenicians had sold Israelites "unto the sons of the Grecians." Professor Sayce, in a note to G. Smith's 'History of Babylonia,' p. 156, places "Saparda" on the Black Sea. It may be questioned, however, whether some town nearer Judaea is not intended. Ewald would read "Sepharam," a town in North Palestine. The two bodies of captives <span class="cmt_word">shall possess the cities of the south.</span> The Negeb.
