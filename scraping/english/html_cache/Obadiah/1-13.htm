The "gate" symbolizes the city's entry point, a place of both commerce and justice. Entering the gate during a disaster implies taking advantage of the city's vulnerability. Historically, Edom and Israel had a fraught relationship, tracing back to Esau and Jacob. The Edomites, descendants of Esau, are rebuked for exploiting their kin's misfortune. This reflects a broader biblical principle against taking advantage of others' suffering, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/17-5.htm">Proverbs 17:5</a>, which warns against gloating over calamity.<p><b>nor gloat over their affliction in the day of their disaster</b><br>Gloating over another's misfortune is condemned throughout Scripture. This phrase highlights the Edomites' schadenfreude, or pleasure derived from the suffering of others. Such behavior is contrary to the biblical call to love one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>). The "day of their disaster" refers to the specific time of Jerusalem's fall, a moment of divine judgment and human suffering. This attitude of gloating is also addressed in <a href="/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17-18</a>, which advises against rejoicing when an enemy falls, lest the Lord see and disapprove.<p><b>nor loot their wealth in the day of their disaster</b><br>Looting during a time of disaster is an act of opportunistic greed. The Edomites are criticized for plundering Jerusalem's wealth, taking advantage of the city's weakened state. This act of looting is not just a physical theft but a moral failing, reflecting a heart hardened against compassion and justice. The prohibition against such behavior is consistent with the biblical theme of justice and righteousness, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10.htm">Isaiah 10:1-2</a>, which condemns those who rob the poor and deprive the oppressed of their rights. This phrase underscores the importance of integrity and righteousness, even in times of chaos and opportunity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/obadiah.htm">Obadiah</a></b><br>The prophet who authored this book, delivering a message of judgment against Edom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, often in conflict with Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>Referred to as "My people," the nation chosen by God, experiencing disaster during this prophecy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_disaster.htm">Day of Disaster</a></b><br>A time of calamity and judgment for Israel, during which Edom is condemned for its actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gate.htm">Gate</a></b><br>Symbolic of entering a city, representing Edom's invasion or opportunistic behavior during Israel's distress.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_schadenfreude.htm">Avoiding Schadenfreude</a></b><br>As Christians, we are called to love our neighbors and even our enemies.
