Gloating over another's misfortune is condemned throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/24-17.htm">Proverbs 24:17-18</a>, which warns against rejoicing when an enemy falls. This phrase underscores the principle of empathy and compassion, even towards adversaries. The "day" refers to a specific time of judgment or calamity, often seen as a divine act of justice.<p><b>your brother&#8217;s day of misfortune</b><br>The term "brother" refers to the close kinship between Edom and Israel, as both nations descended from Esau and Jacob, respectively. This familial relationship is emphasized to highlight the betrayal and lack of solidarity shown by Edom. The "day of misfortune" likely refers to the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BC, a time of great suffering for Judah. The historical context reveals the deep-seated animosity between the two nations, despite their shared ancestry.<p><b>nor rejoice over the people of Judah in the day of their destruction</b><br>Rejoicing over Judah's destruction is condemned as it reflects a heart contrary to God's desire for justice and mercy. The destruction of Jerusalem was a significant event, marking the end of the Davidic kingdom and the beginning of the Babylonian exile. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of God's judgment and the call for humility and repentance. The rejoicing of Edom is seen as a violation of the covenantal relationship and a failure to recognize God's sovereignty.<p><b>nor boast proudly in the day of their distress</b><br>Boasting in another's distress is portrayed as arrogance and pride, which are consistently condemned in Scripture. This attitude reflects a lack of understanding of God's justice and mercy. The "day of their distress" refers to the severe trials faced by Judah, including the siege and destruction of Jerusalem. This phrase serves as a warning against pride and self-exaltation, reminding readers of the need for humility before God. The prophetic literature often contrasts human pride with divine sovereignty, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11-12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/obadiah.htm">Obadiah</a></b><br>The prophet who authored the book, delivering a message of judgment against Edom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/edom.htm">Edom</a></b><br>A nation descended from Esau, Jacob's brother, often in conflict with Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, representing the people of God during the time of Obadiah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/esau.htm">Esau</a></b><br>The ancestor of the Edomites, brother of Jacob, representing a historical and familial connection to Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/day_of_misfortune/destruction/distress.htm">Day of Misfortune/Destruction/Distress</a></b><br>Refers to the time of Judah's suffering and calamity, possibly during the Babylonian invasion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_schadenfreude.htm">Avoiding Schadenfreude</a></b><br>Rejoicing in others' misfortune is contrary to God's heart.
