In the Greco-Roman world, rhetoric and eloquence were highly valued, and Christians were called to stand out by speaking truthfully and purely. The term "wholesome" suggests speech that is healthy and edifying, aligning with biblical teachings found in <a href="/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a>, which encourages believers to speak in ways that build others up. The idea of being "above reproach" is a recurring theme in the pastoral epistles, highlighting the need for leaders and believers to live in a manner that is blameless and beyond criticism, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>.<p><b>so that anyone who opposes us will be ashamed</b><br>This part of the verse addresses the potential for opposition and persecution faced by early Christians. By maintaining integrity and purity in speech, believers can disarm critics and detractors. The concept of causing opponents to be "ashamed" is not about humiliation but rather about demonstrating the truth and righteousness of the Christian message, leading to conviction and possibly repentance. This aligns with <a href="/1_peter/3-16.htm">1 Peter 3:16</a>, which speaks of having a good conscience so that those who slander believers may be put to shame by their good behavior.<p><b>having nothing bad to say about us</b><br>The goal of living and speaking in a manner that leaves no room for legitimate criticism is emphasized here. In a cultural context where honor and shame were significant social dynamics, maintaining a reputation that is free from blame was crucial for the witness of the early church. This reflects the teachings of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>, where believers are encouraged to let their light shine before others, so that they may see their good deeds and glorify God.

His words, too, must be well weighed and thoughtful, as well as earnest and impassioned; they must be such as would expose him neither to contempt nor to the charge of presumption. Between the lines of the exhortation of the 7th and 8th verses we can read the anxiety of the Apostle that his representative in Crete should take all possible care that the matter of his teaching and preaching was studied and prepared with all the attention and thought so important a duty demanded. He should remember, too, that the <span class= "ital">words</span> as well as the <span class= "ital">works</span> of the Christian teacher will be subject to a sharp and often hostile criticism. These warnings and reminders of St. Paul, it should be borne in mind, belong to all ages of the faith.<p><span class= "bld">That he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</span>--The older authorities, with one exception, read "of us," instead of "of you." If Titus fairly carries out the exhortation of the last two verses, then the enemy, either the false teacher or the Pagan opponent of Christianity, confounded by the pure, self-sacrificing, earnest life, overcome by the well-weighed, thoughtful utterance of great truths, by the impassioned exhortation to men and women to lead noble, honest lives, will surely be ashamed of his bitter opposition, when he finds neither in the life nor in the teaching anything which he can fairly criticise as "bad." As the better supported reading, "of us," associates St. Paul and others with Titus, the evil thing which might have been said of Titus in reality would be spoken against St. Paul and the elder Apostles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/titus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> <span class="accented">- Us</span> for <span class="accented">you</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Sound speech</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x1fc6;</span>); still depending upon <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>.
