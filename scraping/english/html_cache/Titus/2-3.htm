In the early church, older women held a respected position and were expected to model Christian virtues. The term "reverent" suggests a demeanor that is fitting for someone who serves God, reflecting holiness and respectability. This aligns with the broader biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/31-30.htm">Proverbs 31:30</a>, which praises a woman who fears the Lord. The cultural context of the time placed high value on the wisdom and experience of older women, making their role in the community crucial for maintaining moral and spiritual standards.<p><b>not slanderers</b><br>The instruction against slander highlights the destructive power of words. Slander, or malicious gossip, can cause division and harm within the church community. <a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-6</a> warns about the tongue's potential to corrupt and destroy. In the Greco-Roman world, where oral communication was a primary means of information exchange, the integrity of speech was vital. This directive encourages older women to use their words to build up rather than tear down, reflecting the biblical call to speak truth in love (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>).<p><b>or addicted to much wine</b><br>This phrase addresses the issue of self-control, particularly concerning alcohol consumption. In the ancient world, wine was a common beverage, but excessive drinking could lead to moral and social problems. The Bible consistently warns against drunkenness (<a href="/proverbs/20.htm">Proverbs 20:1</a>, <a href="/ephesians/5-18.htm">Ephesians 5:18</a>), advocating for moderation and self-discipline. By advising older women to avoid addiction, the text underscores the importance of maintaining a clear mind and a godly lifestyle, which is essential for their role as mentors and examples to younger believers.<p><b>but teachers of good</b><br>The role of older women as "teachers of good" highlights their responsibility to instruct and guide others in righteous living. This teaching is not limited to formal settings but includes everyday interactions and mentorship. The concept of teaching good aligns with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>), where all believers are called to make disciples and teach obedience to Christ's commands. Older women, through their wisdom and experience, are uniquely positioned to impart valuable lessons on faith, character, and practical godliness to the next generation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A young pastor and a trusted companion of the Apostle Paul, tasked with organizing the church in Crete and ensuring sound doctrine.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/older_women.htm">Older Women</a></b><br>Mature women in the Christian community who are called to live exemplary lives and mentor younger women.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/crete.htm">Crete</a></b><br>An island in the Mediterranean where Titus was stationed to establish church order and combat false teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_in_behavior.htm">Reverence in Behavior</a></b><br>Older women are called to live in a manner that reflects holiness and respect for God.

Scripture honors this stage: &#8220;Gray hair is a crown of glory; it is attained along the path of righteousness&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-31.htm">Proverbs 16:31</a>). Much like he asks Timothy to treat &#8220;older women as mothers&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/5-2.htm">1 Timothy 5:2</a>), Paul expects seasoned sisters in Christ to model the faith that has carried them through decades.<p>Practical outflow:<p>&#8226; See their years as a stewardship, not a sideline.<p>&#8226; View themselves as living illustrations of <a href="/psalms/92-14.htm">Psalm 92:14</a>&#8212;still &#8220;bearing fruit in old age.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Likewise</b><p>This small word ties the women&#8217;s calling to what Paul just said to older men (<a href="/titus/2-2.htm">Titus 2:2</a>). Everyone in the church receives specific, but coordinated, instructions. Peter uses a similar bridge when he writes, &#8220;Likewise, you who are younger, submit&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>). The point: the gospel shapes every demographic in parallel, producing a unified witness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Are to be reverent in their behavior</b><p>Reverence speaks of a demeanor fitting for those who belong to God. Paul&#8217;s picture echoes <a href="/1_timothy/2-9.htm">1 Timothy 2:9-10</a>, where women are urged to adorn themselves with &#8220;proper clothing, with modesty and self-control&#8230; with good deeds.&#8221;<p>Ways reverence shows up:<p>&#8226; Speech that edifies (<a href="/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Actions that point people to Christ (<a href="/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Attitudes soaked in worship (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Not slanderers</b><p>The tongue can either bless or destroy (<a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-6</a>).

Immediately he explains the purpose&#8212;&#8220;that they may train the younger women&#8221; (<a href="/titus/2-4.htm">Titus 2:4-5</a>). Lois and Eunice lived this out when they nurtured Timothy&#8217;s faith (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>).<p>What &#8220;teaching good&#8221; can look like:<p>&#8226; Modeling Christlike marriage and family life.<p>&#8226; Sharing testimonies of God&#8217;s faithfulness through trials (<a href="/psalms/71-18.htm">Psalm 71:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Discipling younger believers in Scripture and prayer (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/titus/2-3.htm">Titus 2:3</a> calls mature women to a life that is worshipful, wise with words, sober-minded, and actively investing in others. When older sisters embrace this high calling, the whole church benefits, the next generation is equipped, and the gospel&#8217;s beauty shines all the brighter.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/titus/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">The aged women likewise.</span>--St. Paul, faithful to what had now become one of the guiding principles of Christianity, the equal position of women in the city of God, fellow-heirs with men in the citizenship of the city which hath foundations, proceeds to remind the elder women of Crete of their own high duties in the company of believers. They now--the women--must remember that the position which Christ and His disciples had claimed for them in the world was not without its grave responsibilities. These aged women of the flock. like the elders just exhorted, had also much to do for Christ.<p><span class= "bld">That they be in behaviour as becometh holiness.</span>--That is, <span class= "ital">that they should show themselves as it becometh holiness; </span>or, more literally, <span class= "ital">in demeanour</span> <span class= "ital">reverend.</span> The Greek word rendered "in behaviour," or "in demeanour," includes dress, appearance, conversation, manner; includes an outward deportment dependent on something more internal. The elder Christian woman in her whole bearing should exhibit a certain dignity of sacred demeanour; there should be something in her general appearance, in her dress, in her speech, in her every-day behaviour, which the younger and more thoughtless sister could respect and reverence--an ideal she might hope one day, if the Master spared her so long, herself to reach. For an admirable gloss on these words, see <a href="/context/1_timothy/2-9.htm" title="In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with modesty and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;">1Timothy 2:9-10</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Not false accusers.</span>--Or better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">not slanderers.</span> St. Paul knew well how easily old age yields itself to this temptation. Old age is at times intolerant, censorious, even bitter, forgetful especially of the days of youth; but Christ's aged saints must use their voice for better things than these.<p><span class= "bld">Not given to much wine.</span>--This warning was probably called for, owing to the evil habits and customs of the Cretans.<p><span class= "bld">Teachers of good things.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">teachers of what is good.</span> Beza's rendering, "mistresses of honour" (<span class= "ital">honestatis magistr?</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>is singular and expressive. This does not mean that these aged women should occupy the place of public instructresses, but that they should, by here and there speaking a kind warning word, and, better still, by the golden silence of a useful honoured life, teach their younger sisters lessons of truth and faith and love.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/titus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> <span class="accented">- That</span> for <span class="accented">the</span>, A.V; <span class="accented">be reverent in demeanor</span> for <span class="accented">that they be in behavior as becometh holiness</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">slanderers</span> for <span class="accented">false accusers</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">nor</span> for <span class="accented">not</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">enslaved</span> for <span class="accented">given</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">that which is good</span> for <span class="accented">good things</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Reverent</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>); only here in the New Testament, twice in 4 Maccabees (in 9:25, where the eldest of the seven brothers who suffered martyrdom ruder Antiochus Epiphanes is called <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>; and in 11:20, where it is coupled with <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, "age," or "generation"); it is not uncommon in classical Greek.
