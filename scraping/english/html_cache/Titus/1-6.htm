In the biblical context, this aligns with the qualifications for leadership found in <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>, where an overseer is also required to be above reproach. The emphasis is on a reputation that is untarnished, reflecting the holiness expected of church leaders. This standard is rooted in the Old Testament, where leaders were often held to higher moral standards (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/21-6.htm">Leviticus 21:6-8</a>).<p><b>the husband of but one wife</b><br>This phrase suggests marital faithfulness and commitment, emphasizing monogamy. It reflects the cultural context of the Greco-Roman world, where polygamy was not the norm, but infidelity and divorce were common. The requirement underscores the importance of family stability and fidelity as a reflection of one's ability to lead the church. This mirrors the relationship between Christ and the Church, as described in <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-33</a>, where Christ is depicted as the faithful bridegroom.<p><b>having children who are believers</b><br>The expectation that an elder's children are believers highlights the leader's ability to manage his household well, as seen in <a href="/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4-5</a>. This requirement suggests that the elder's faith and leadership should be evident in his family life, serving as a microcosm of his potential to lead the church. The spiritual condition of the children reflects the elder's influence and teaching within the home.<p><b>and who are not open to accusation of indiscretion or insubordination</b><br>This phrase addresses the behavior and reputation of the elder's children, indicating that they should not be known for reckless or rebellious behavior. The cultural context of the time placed significant importance on family honor and reputation. Insubordination, or rebellion, was seen as a serious issue, reflecting poorly on the father's ability to lead. This requirement aligns with the broader biblical theme of obedience and respect for authority, as seen in passages like <a href="/ephesians/6.htm">Ephesians 6:1-4</a>, which instructs children to obey their parents.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who wrote the letter to Titus, providing guidance on church leadership and sound doctrine.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>- A trusted companion of Paul, tasked with organizing the church in Crete and appointing elders.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders.htm">Elders</a></b><br>- Church leaders who are to be appointed based on specific qualifications, including moral and familial integrity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/crete.htm">Crete</a></b><br>- The island where Titus was stationed to establish church order and appoint qualified leaders.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cretan_church.htm">Cretan Church</a></b><br>- The early Christian community in Crete, which required strong leadership to combat false teachings and maintain order.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/b/blamelessness_in_leadership.htm">Blamelessness in Leadership</a></b><br>Elders must be above reproach, demonstrating integrity and moral uprightness in all aspects of life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_family_life.htm">Faithful Family Life</a></b><br>The requirement for an elder to be the husband of one wife underscores the importance of marital faithfulness and stability.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/raising_believing_children.htm">Raising Believing Children</a></b><br>An elder's ability to lead his family in faith is a reflection of his capability to lead the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consistency_in_character.htm">Consistency in Character</a></b><br>The character of an elder should be consistent both in private (family life) and public (church leadership) settings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_modeling_for_the_church.htm">Role Modeling for the Church</a></b><br>Elders serve as role models for the congregation, exemplifying Christian virtues and family values.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Titus_1_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Titus 1:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Titus_1_6_Church_leader_family_traits.htm">How does Titus 1:6 define the qualifications for church leadership in families?

When these qualities are present, the church gains leaders whose lives echo their message, bringing honor to Christ and strength to His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/titus/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">If any be blameless.</span>--The candidate for the holy office must have naught laid to his charge; he must be of such a character that no one could bring a reasonable accusation against him. Blameless must be his life, spotless his name. As it has been well said, "the office of presbyter must never be allowed to cover or condone damaged reputations."<p><span class= "bld">The husband of one wife.</span>--See Notes on <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm" title="A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;">1Timothy 3:2</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Having faithful children.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">believing children.</span> In searching out these presbyters, whose charge would involve so many and such responsible duties, Titus must look for men of ripe age. There were even grave objections to the appointment of the comparatively young to this office. We have seen how anxious St. Paul was for Timothy, his well-known and trusted friend, on account of his want of years. Timothy must have been at least approaching forty years of age when St. Paul warned him so earnestly of his behaviour and his life, "Let no man despise thy youth." These presiding Cretan elders should be married men, with children already, so to speak, grown up.<p>These requirements evidently show that Christianity had been established in Crete for a very considerable period. We must remember some thirty-three years had passed since that memorable Pentecost feast of Jerusalem, when "Cretes" were among the hearers of those marvellous utterances of the Spirit. Besides the children of the candidates for the presbyter's office being professing Christians, they must also be free from all suspicion of profligacy.<p><span class= "bld">Not accused of riot.</span>--More accurately rendered, <span class= "ital">dissoluteness.</span> The Greek word here rendered "riot" implies a self-indulgent or even a reckless expenditure. Such careless selfishness well-nigh always ends in profligacy. In the case of men whose duties included the superintendence of the Church's funds, it was imperatively necessary that their homes and families should be free from all suspicion of anything like that reckless waste or extravagance which in so many cases imperceptibly passes into dissoluteness and profligacy.<p><span class= "bld">Or unruly.</span>--That is, disobedient to their parents. If the presbyter was incapable of teaching his own children obedience and order, what hope was there that his influence would be of any value with his flock? All these early instructions to the master-builders whose task it was to lay the early storeys of the Christian Temple are very decisive as to the state of St. Paul's mind; and we must not forget <span class= "ital">whence</span> St. Paul directly drew his wisdom. The Apostles of the Lord never seem to have thought of the Christian priesthood of the future <span class= "ital">developing into a caste or</span> <span class= "ital">order.</span> Anything more diametrically opposed to the mediaeval notion of church government than the Pastoral Epistles can hardly be imagined. The writer of the Epistles to Timothy and to Titus never dreamed of building up a priestly order with views, thoughts, hopes, and joys differing from those of the ordinary worker of the world. St. Paul's presbyters were to be chosen, among other qualities, for the white and blameless lives of their families.
