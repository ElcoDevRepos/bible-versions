In the context of the early church, rebellion often manifested as a refusal to adhere to apostolic teaching. This rebellion can be seen as a continuation of the human tendency to resist God's authority, as seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the rebellion of Korah (Numbers 16). The rebellious nature of humanity is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing the need for submission to God's will.<p><b>and full of empty talk</b><br>The term "empty talk" refers to speech that is devoid of truth and substance. In the early church, this often involved false teachings and vain discussions that distracted believers from the core message of the Gospel. This aligns with warnings found in other New Testament writings, such as <a href="/1_timothy/1-6.htm">1 Timothy 1:6</a>, where Paul cautions against turning to meaningless talk. The emphasis here is on the danger of words that lead believers away from sound doctrine and the truth of Christ.<p><b>and deception</b><br>Deception is a key tactic of false teachers, who mislead others for personal gain or out of ignorance. This deception can be subtle, mixing truth with falsehood, making it difficult for believers to discern. The New Testament frequently warns against false prophets and teachers, as seen in <a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>, where they are described as secretly introducing destructive heresies. The presence of deception underscores the need for discernment and adherence to the truth of Scripture.<p><b>especially those of the circumcision</b><br>This phrase refers to Jewish Christians who insisted that Gentile converts must adhere to Jewish laws, particularly circumcision, to be saved. This group, often called the "Judaizers," posed a significant challenge to the early church, as seen in <a href="/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a> and the Council of Jerusalem. Their insistence on circumcision as necessary for salvation contradicted the message of salvation by grace through faith in Christ alone, as emphasized in <a href="/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>.
