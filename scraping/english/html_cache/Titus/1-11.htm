The Greek word used here implies a forceful action, suggesting that these false teachers are causing significant harm. In the early church, maintaining doctrinal purity was crucial, as false teachings could easily spread and disrupt the faith of new believers. This aligns with other New Testament passages, such as <a href="/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3-7</a>, where Paul instructs Timothy to command certain people not to teach false doctrines.<p><b>For the sake of dishonorable gain</b><br>The motivation of these false teachers is financial profit, which is condemned throughout Scripture. This echoes the warnings found in <a href="/1_timothy/6-5.htm">1 Timothy 6:5-10</a> about the dangers of loving money. In the cultural context of the time, itinerant teachers often relied on the support of their followers, and some exploited this for personal gain. This behavior contrasts sharply with the selfless example of Christ, who taught and served without seeking material reward.<p><b>they undermine entire households</b><br>The reference to "households" indicates the communal nature of early Christian gatherings, which often took place in homes. False teachings could disrupt not just individual faith but entire family units, which were the foundational building blocks of the church. This phrase highlights the widespread impact of false doctrine, as seen in <a href="/2_timothy/3-6.htm">2 Timothy 3:6</a>, where Paul warns of those who worm their way into homes and gain control over gullible women.<p><b>and teach things they should not</b><br>This underscores the content of the false teachings, which are contrary to the apostolic doctrine. The early church faced numerous heresies, such as Gnosticism, which distorted the truth of the Gospel. The phrase calls for discernment and adherence to sound doctrine, as emphasized in passages like <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6-9</a>, where Paul warns against any gospel contrary to what was originally preached.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A trusted companion of the Apostle Paul, Titus was left in Crete to organize the church and appoint elders.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The Apostle who wrote the letter to Titus, providing guidance on church leadership and sound doctrine.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cretans.htm">Cretans</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Crete, known for their challenging cultural traits, which included deceit and laziness, as mentioned earlier in Titus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals within the church who were spreading false doctrines for personal gain, causing disruption in households.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/households.htm">Households</a></b><br>The early Christian communities often met in homes, making the stability of these households crucial for the church's health.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/guarding_against_false_teaching.htm">Guarding Against False Teaching</a></b><br>The church must be vigilant in identifying and silencing false teachings that can disrupt the faith and unity of believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_church_leadership.htm">The Role of Church Leadership</a></b><br>Elders and leaders have a responsibility to protect the congregation from harmful doctrines and ensure that teaching aligns with sound biblical truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/motivations_matter.htm">Motivations Matter</a></b><br>The motivation behind teaching and ministry should be pure and God-honoring, not driven by personal gain or selfish ambition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/impact_on_families.htm">Impact on Families</a></b><br>False teachings can have a profound impact on families, highlighting the need for discernment and strong biblical foundations within the home.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/pursuing_sound_doctrine.htm">Pursuing Sound Doctrine</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to pursue sound doctrine and be rooted in Scripture to withstand false teachings and grow in their faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Titus_1_11_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Titus 1:11?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Stop_false_teachings_in_church.htm">How can we "silence" false teachers in our church community today?

It was no longer individuals that their poisonous teaching affected, but they were undermining the faith of whole families. For an example how Titus and his presbyters were to stop the mouths of these teachers of what was false, compare <a href="/context/matthew/22-34.htm" title="But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.">Matthew 22:34-46</a>, where the Lord, by His wise, powerful, yet gentle words, first put the Sadducees to silence, and then so answered the Pharisees that "neither durst any man from that day forth ask Him any more questions."<p><span class= "bld">Teaching things which</span> <span class= "bld">they</span> <span class= "bld">ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.</span>--Here St. Paul goes to the root of the evil, when he shows what was the end and aim of these "teachers" life. It was a mean and sordid ambition, after all--merely base gain. When this is the main object of a religious teacher's life, his teaching naturally accommodates itself to men's tastes. He forgets the Divine Giver of his commission, and in his thirst for the popularity which brings with it gold, his true work, as the faithful watchman of the house of Israel, is forgotten and ignored.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/titus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> <span class="accented">- Men who overthrow</span> for <span class="accented">who subvert</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Whose mouths must be stopped</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); here only in the New Testament, not found in the LXX., but common in classical Greek.
