The early Christian community was encouraged to live out their faith through tangible actions, aligning with <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>, which states that faith without works is dead. The call to "learn" suggests a process of growth and discipleship, indicating that good works are not innate but cultivated through teaching and practice. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative that emphasizes the transformation of believers into the likeness of Christ, who exemplified a life of service and compassion.<p><b>in order to meet the pressing needs of others</b><br>The early church was characterized by a strong sense of community and mutual support, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, where believers shared their possessions to ensure no one was in need. This phrase highlights the practical aspect of Christian love, which is not merely theoretical but actively seeks to address the immediate and tangible needs of others. The historical context of the early church, often facing persecution and poverty, made such support crucial for survival and witness. This call to action reflects the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized caring for the "least of these" (<a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>).<p><b>so that they will not be unfruitful</b><br>Fruitfulness in the Christian life is a recurring theme in the New Testament, symbolizing spiritual growth and the visible evidence of a transformed life. Jesus spoke of bearing fruit as a sign of true discipleship in <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5</a>, where He states that those who abide in Him will bear much fruit. The concept of fruitfulness is also linked to the idea of living a life that glorifies God and advances His kingdom. In the cultural context of the time, fruitfulness was often associated with productivity and blessing, contrasting with the barrenness that symbolized disobedience or judgment. This phrase serves as a reminder that good works are not only beneficial to others but also essential for the spiritual vitality and witness of the believer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Titus, providing guidance and instruction for church leadership and Christian living.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A trusted companion of Paul, serving as a leader in the early church on the island of Crete, tasked with organizing and instructing the believers there.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cretan_believers.htm">Cretan Believers</a></b><br>The recipients of Paul's letter, who were encouraged to live out their faith through good works and sound doctrine.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/crete.htm">Crete</a></b><br>An island in the Mediterranean Sea where Titus was stationed to oversee the church and ensure the believers were living according to the teachings of Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/urgent_need.htm">Urgent Need</a></b><br>Situations requiring immediate attention and assistance, highlighting the importance of readiness and willingness to help others.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_learning.htm">The Importance of Learning</a></b><br>Believers must be taught and learn to devote themselves to good works.

A last reminder to the brethren, whom with a loving thought he calls "ours," constantly to practise good and beneficent works. In the expression "let ours also learn," it would seem as though St. Paul would have Christians <span class= "ital">trained</span> to the wise and thoughtful performance of works of mercy and charity.<p>It was with such injunctions as these that men like St. Paul and St. James laid the foundation storeys of those great Christian works of charity--all undreamed of before the Resurrection morning--but which have been for eighteen centuries in all lands, the glory of the religion of Jesus--one grand result of the Master's presence with us on earth, which even His bitterest enemies admire with a grudging admiration.<p>In the short compass of these Pastoral Epistles, in all only thirteen chapters, we have no less than <span class= "ital">eight</span> special reminders to be earnest and zealous in good works. There was evidently a dread in St. Paul's mind that some of those who <span class= "ital">professed</span> a love of Jesus, and <span class= "ital">said</span> that they longed after the great salvation, would content themselves with a dreamy acquiescence in the great truths, while the life remained unaltered. It is noteworthy that these Epistles, containing so many urgent exhortations <span class= "ital">to work</span> for Christ, were St. Paul's last inspired utterances. The passages in question are <a href="/titus/1-16.htm" title="They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate.">Titus 1:16</a>; <a href="/titus/2-7.htm" title="In all things showing yourself a pattern of good works: in doctrine showing soundness, gravity, sincerity,">Titus 2:7</a>; <a href="/titus/2-14.htm" title="Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="/titus/3-14.htm" title="And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.">Titus 3:14</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-10.htm" title="But (which becomes women professing godliness) with good works.">1Timothy 2:10</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-10.htm" title="Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.">1Timothy 5:10</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-18.htm" title="That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;">1Timothy 6:18</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-21.htm" title="If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honor, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared to every good work.">2Timothy 2:21</a>. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/titus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Our <span class="accented">people</span> for <span class="accented">ours</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Our people also.</span> The natural inference is that Titus had some fund at his disposal with which he was to help the travelers, but that St. Paul wished the Cretan Christians to contribute also.
