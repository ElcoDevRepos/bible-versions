In the pastoral epistles, Paul often uses this formula to highlight key doctrinal points (<a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a>, <a href="/1_timothy/3.htm">1 Timothy 3:1</a>, <a href="/1_timothy/4-9.htm">1 Timothy 4:9</a>, <a href="/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11</a>). It serves as an assurance to the reader that the teachings are divinely inspired and worthy of full acceptance. The emphasis on trustworthiness reflects the early church's need for sound doctrine amidst false teachings.<p><b>And I want you to emphasize these things,</b><br>Paul instructs Titus to stress the importance of the teachings he has shared. This reflects the role of church leaders in ensuring that congregations remain grounded in sound doctrine. The emphasis on "these things" likely refers to the preceding verses, which discuss salvation by grace, regeneration, and renewal by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/titus/3-4.htm">Titus 3:4-7</a>). The repetition of core truths is crucial for spiritual growth and stability.<p><b>so that those who have believed God</b><br>This phrase identifies the audience as believers, those who have placed their faith in God. The wording suggests a personal relationship and trust in God's promises. The context of belief here is not just intellectual assent but a transformative faith that results in action. This aligns with the broader biblical theme that faith without works is dead (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><b>will take care to devote themselves to good deeds.</b><br>The call to action for believers is to be intentional about living out their faith through good works. This reflects the biblical principle that salvation, while by grace, results in a life of service and obedience (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>). The cultural context of the early church, surrounded by pagan practices, required a distinct Christian witness through ethical living. Good deeds are seen as a natural outflow of a regenerated life.<p><b>These things are excellent and profitable for the people.</b><br>The teachings and resulting good deeds are described as beneficial, not just for the individual believer but for the community as a whole. This reflects the communal nature of the early church, where the actions of individuals impacted the entire body. The emphasis on what is "excellent and profitable" aligns with the biblical call to pursue what is noble and praiseworthy (<a href="/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a>). The profitability here is both spiritual and practical, contributing to the well-being and witness of the church.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who authored the letter to Titus, providing guidance and instruction for church leadership and Christian living.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>- A trusted companion of Paul, serving as a leader in the early church, specifically in Crete, where he was tasked with organizing and strengthening the church.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/crete.htm">Crete</a></b><br>- An island in the Mediterranean Sea where Titus was stationed to oversee the church and ensure sound doctrine and good works among believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trustworthy_teachings.htm">Trustworthy Teachings</a></b><br>Paul emphasizes the reliability of his teachings, encouraging believers to hold fast to sound doctrine.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/emphasis_on_good_works.htm">Emphasis on Good Works</a></b><br>Believers are called to actively engage in good works as a natural outflow of their faith in God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/profitable_for_all.htm">Profitable for All</a></b><br>Good works are not only beneficial for the individual believer but also for the community and the broader society.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_action.htm">Faith and Action</a></b><br>Genuine faith in God should manifest in tangible actions that reflect His love and righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_responsibility.htm">Leadership Responsibility</a></b><br>Church leaders, like Titus, are tasked with teaching and encouraging believers to live out their faith through good works.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Titus_3_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Titus 3:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_commit_to_good_deeds_daily.htm">How can we "devote ourselves to good works" in daily life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Why_are_good_works_profitable.htm">Why are "good works" described as "profitable for the people"?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Titus_3_8_Eph_2_10_on_good_works.htm">How does Titus 3:8 connect with Ephesians 2:10 on good works?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_faith_inspire_good_deeds.htm">What role does faith play in motivating us toward good works?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_can_churches_promote_insistence.htm">How can church communities encourage members to "insist on these things"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Titus_3_8_Importance_of_good_works.htm">How does Titus 3:8 emphasize the importance of good works in Christian life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Titus_3_8_s_early_Christian_context.htm">What is the historical context of Titus 3:8 in early Christian communities?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Titus_3_8_and_faith-alone_salvation.htm">How does Titus 3:8 align with the doctrine of salvation by faith alone?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_titus_3.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Titus 3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_are_bible_question_answers.htm">What are the answers to Bible questions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_is_true_spiritual_worship.htm">What is worshiping God in spirit and truth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_marrow_controversy.htm">What is the Marrow Controversy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/do_titus_3_5-6_and_james_2_17_conflict.htm">Does Titus 3:5&#8211;6, emphasizing salvation by mercy alone, conflict with James 2:17, which stresses the necessity of good works?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Titus 3:8 Mean</div><b>This saying is trustworthy.</b><p>Paul begins with a familiar affirmation, &#8220;This saying is trustworthy&#8221; (<a href="/titus/3-8.htm">Titus 3:8</a>), signaling that what follows is a solid, reliable truth believers can build upon. He uses the same formula elsewhere&#8212;&#8220;The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a>; cf. <a href="/1_timothy/3-1.htm">1 Timothy 3:1</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-11.htm">2 Timothy 2:11</a>)&#8212;to highlight doctrines central to the faith, such as Christ&#8217;s incarnation and salvation by grace. By declaring the statement &#8220;trustworthy,&#8221; Paul leaves no room for doubt: the gospel he has just summarized in <a href="/titus/3-4.htm">Titus 3:4-7</a> is accurate, immovable, and worthy of wholehearted belief.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And I want you to emphasize these things</b><p>Paul continues, &#8220;And I want you to emphasize these things.&#8221; Titus, as a pastor on Crete, is charged with constantly reminding the church of the gospel&#8217;s core truths (see <a href="/2_timothy/2-14.htm">2 Timothy 2:14</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-11.htm">1 Timothy 4:11</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-12.htm">2 Peter 1:12-15</a>). Repetition is intentional&#8212;so the message of grace doesn&#8217;t drift into the background.

Such a life is both beautiful in God&#8217;s sight and immensely beneficial to everyone it touches.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/titus/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">This is a faithful saying.</span>--Then St. Paul, having, in those few but sublime words we have been considering, painted our present happy state--happy even on earth, where the glorious promised inheritance was still only a hope--and having shown how that this blessedness was the result of no efforts of our own, but that we owe it solely to the tender love and to the divine pity of God for man--cries out, Yes, "faithful is this saying!"<p><span class= "bld">And these things I will that thou affirm constantly.</span>--I will that ever and again, in the congregation, these words of mine, woven into the tapestry of creed, or hymn of thanksgiving or supplication, be repeated by the faithful believers in the Lord, to remind them, not only of the glorious hope of eternal life, but also to bring Him to their remembrance to whom they owe this glorious heritage; and as they repeat or hear the words telling them of the wondrous mercy showed to them for no merit or desert of their own, they will the more willingly think kindly of, and act loyally with, other men still living in that deep and loathsome darkness where they once dwelt, until God, in His pity, delivered them. Hearing this "faithful saying," thought? the old man St. Paul, my children in Christ will surely be disposed to be more loyal subjects, more faithful citizens, more loving neighbours, though their civil magistrates, their fellow-citizens, their neighbours, be still idolaters, living without God in the world. And there was yet another reason for the constant repetition of this "faithful saying:" men would see that they owed all their glorious Christian privileges, their present peace, their future hope, to God's free grace--that <span class= "ital">they</span> had done nothing to deserve all this. Surely such a thought would spur them on to noble deeds, if it were only to show they were not wholly ungrateful. So he writes, Yes, affirm constantly this faithful saying.<p><span class= "bld">That they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works.</span>--But not only would St. Paul have them show their gratitude for the great mercy they had received, but he is specially anxious that they who by God's grace had been led into the Christian company should now not only quietly and unobtrusively take their part in good works, but should ever be careful to be forward in all such things; he would have Christians conspicuous in their generous zeal to forward all good and useful undertakings. "Good works" here by no means is confined to works of mercy and charity though, of course, they include such, still they possess in this passage a far more comprehensive signification. All useful and beneficent undertakings, public as well as private, are reckoned among these "good works." As was observed before, St. Paul's ideal Christian must be a generous, public-spirited man. In the eyes of this great teacher the cloistered ascetic would have found but little favour; his hero, while ever the devoted, self-sacrificing lover of the Lord, must be known among his fellow-citizens "as careful to maintain good works."<p><span class= "bld">These things are good and profitable unto men.</span>--The accurate translation of the Greek here would be, <span class= "ital">These are the things which are good and profitable</span> <span class= "ital">unto men;</span> but the older authorities omit the article, <span class= "ital">ta, </span>before <span class= "ital">kala.</span> The rendering, then (omitting the article), as given in the English version, would be correct: "These things"--that is, this practical everyday teaching, which bids Christians distinguish themselves among their fellow-citizens and countrymen in all generous and useful enterprises--in all good things, whether public or private--these things, says the Apostle, are good and profitable unto men; in sharp contrast to the unpractical and useless points insisted upon in the false teaching, apparently too common in the Cretan Church, and against which Titus is earnestly warned in the next (9th) verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/titus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> <span class="accented">- Faithful is the saying</span> for <span class="accented">this is a faithful saying</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">concerning these things</span> for <span class="accented">these things</span>, A.V., <span class="accented">confidently</span> for <span class="accented">constantly</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to the end that</span> for <span class="accented">that</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">God</span> for <span class="accented">in God</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">may</span> for <span class="accented">might</span>, A.V.; full stop after <span class="accented">good works</span>, and colon after <span class="accented">men. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Faithful is the saying</span>; as <a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a> (where see note).

"Never be weary of dwelling on these important truths, and asserting them with authority. For such doctrine is really good and profitable for those whom you are commissioned to teach. But leave alone the foolish and unprofitable controversies." <span class="cmt_word">To the end that</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>). It is not necessary to give to <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span> the meaning "<span class="accented">to</span> the end that," in such a sentence as this (see note on Titus 2:12). After words of <span class="accented">command</span> especially, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, frequently, has simply the force of "that." So here, "lay it down as a rule that they which have believed God must be careful to maintain good works." If the sentence had run on without interruption, it would have been <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>.

The meaning is not the same as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span>, "to believe in," or "on," but "to believe" (as <a href="/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3, 17</a> and <a href="/1_john/5-10.htm">1 John 5:10</a>, where the context shows that it is the act of believing God's promise that is meant). And so here, the <span class="accented">believing</span> refers to the promises implied in the preceding reference to the <span class="accented">hope</span> and the <span class="accented">inheritance.</span> May be careful (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>); only here in the New Testament, but common in the LXX. and in classical Greek. The word means "to give thought" about a thing, "to be careful" or "anxious" about it. <span class="cmt_word">To maintain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); usually in the sense of "presiding over" or "ruling" (as <a href="/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4, 5, 12</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>). Here, alter the analogy of the classical use, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x27;&#x1ffd;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, to "undertake," to "carry on," or the like, fairly expressed by to "maintain." The idea does not seem to be "to stand at the head of," or "to be foremost in." <span class="cmt_word">Good works</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> practical godliness of all kinds (see ver. 14). <span class="cmt_word">These things are good</span>, etc. If the reading of the T.R., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>, is retained, the rendering ought to be, "These <span class="accented">are the things that are</span> really <span class="accented">good and profitable unto men</span>, not foolish questions, etc., they are unprofitable." But the R.T. omits the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>. With regard to the interpretation above given of ver. 8, it must be admitted that it is very doubtful. But the great difficulty of the other way of rendering it, as most commentators do, is that it is impossible to say which part of what precedes is "the faithful saying" alluded to; and that the "care to maintain good works" is not that which naturally springs from it; whereas the reiteration in ver. 8 implies that "good works" is the special subject of "the faithful saying." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/titus/3-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[This]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
