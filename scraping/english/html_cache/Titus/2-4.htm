This mentorship is not merely about imparting knowledge but involves modeling godly behavior. The Greek word for "train" here implies teaching with the intent of developing self-control and wisdom. This aligns with <a href="/proverbs/31.htm">Proverbs 31</a>, which describes a virtuous woman as one who is wise and instructs others in kindness.<p><b>to love their husbands</b><br>In the Greco-Roman world, marriages were often arranged, and love was not always the foundation. The instruction to love one's husband is counter-cultural, emphasizing a Christian marriage based on mutual respect and affection. <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-33</a> further elaborates on the love between husband and wife, comparing it to Christ's love for the church. This love is sacrificial and selfless, reflecting the nature of Christ.<p><b>and children</b><br>The inclusion of children highlights the importance of family in Christian life. In ancient times, children were seen as a blessing from God, as reflected in <a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3-5</a>. The training to love children involves nurturing them in the faith, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are instructed to teach God's commandments diligently to their children. This love is not just emotional but involves guiding them in righteousness and preparing them for a life of faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A young pastor and a trusted companion of the Apostle Paul, tasked with organizing the church in Crete and ensuring sound doctrine.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The Apostle who wrote the letter to Titus, providing guidance on church leadership and Christian living.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/crete.htm">Crete</a></b><br>An island in the Mediterranean where Titus was stationed to oversee the church and address issues of false teaching and moral laxity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/o/older_women.htm">Older Women</a></b><br>Mature women in the faith who are called to mentor and teach younger women in the church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/y/young_women.htm">Young Women</a></b><br>The recipients of the training, encouraged to live out their faith in practical ways, particularly in their family roles.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_mentorship.htm">The Role of Mentorship</a></b><br>Older women have a vital role in guiding younger women, sharing wisdom and experience to help them navigate their roles as wives and mothers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/love_as_a_foundation.htm">Love as a Foundation</a></b><br>The instruction to love husbands and children is foundational, emphasizing that love should be the driving force in family relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_faith.htm">Practical Faith</a></b><br>Christianity is not just about beliefs but also about living out those beliefs in everyday life, particularly in the home.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/counter-cultural_living.htm">Counter-Cultural Living</a></b><br>In a world that often devalues traditional family roles, Christians are called to uphold and cherish these roles as God-given and valuable.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_community.htm">The Importance of Community</a></b><br>The church community provides support and accountability, helping individuals grow in their faith and fulfill their roles effectively.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Titus_2_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Titus 2:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_can_young_women_love_husbands_today.htm">How can young women "love their husbands" in today's society according to Titus 2:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_can_young_women_love_their_children.htm">What practical steps help young women "love their children" as instructed in Titus 2:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Proverbs_31_s_link_to_Titus_2_4_teachings.htm">How does Proverbs 31 support the teachings found in Titus 2:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_churches_help_women_with_Titus_2_4.htm">In what ways can church communities support women in fulfilling Titus 2:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_can_older_women_guide_younger_women_2.htm">How can older women effectively teach younger women as described in Titus 2:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Titus_2_4_Women_s_role_in_home.htm">How does Titus 2:4 define the role of women in a Christian household?

In Ephesus the representative of the Apostle was directed himself to exhort the younger women; very likely the same charge being given here to the aged women of the congregations was owing to the state of the Cretan Christian, which called not only for more practical and homely, but also for more individual, exhortations. So here this special work was left for the elder women among the faithful to carry out. Such a reformation, not only in the discipline of the Church, but also in the individual life and conversation, as St. Paul desired to see in Crete, would never be brought about by a sermon, or even by many sermons, however eloquent and earnest, from Titus. It would be a matter requiring long time and patience, and would, as observed above, rather follow as the result of patient individual effort and holy example.<p><span class= "bld">To love their husbands, to love their children.</span>--There was evidently in Crete a feverish longing for excitement, for novelty in religious teaching; hence the demand for, and consequent supply of, the "fables" and "commandments of men" spoken of in <a href="/titus/1-14.htm" title="Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.">Titus 1:14</a>. Women as well as men preferred rather to <span class= "ital">do</span> something for religion and for God, and thus to wipe out past transgressions, and perhaps to purchase the liberty of future licence. They preferred the rigid and often difficult observance of the elaborate ritual, "the tithing of the mint, and anise, and cummin," to quietly and reverently "doing their Father's business.' St. Paul's method of correcting this false and unhealthy view of religion was to recall women as well as men to the steady, faithful performance of those quiet every-day duties to which God had, in His providence, called them. The first duty of these younger women, St. Paul tells Titus, and which he would have their elder sisters impress on them, was the great home duty of loving their husbands and children. While St. Paul would never have the women of Christ forget their new and precious privileges in the present, their glorious hopes in the future, yet here on earth he would never let them desert, or even for a moment forget, their first and chiefest duties. Their work, let them remember, lay not abroad in the busy world. Their first duty was <span class= "ital">to make home life beautiful</span> by the love of husband and child--that great love which ever teaches forgetfulness of self.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/titus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- Train</span> for <span class="accented">teach</span>... <span class="accented">to be sober</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Train</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>); only here in the New Testament, not found in the LXX., but common in classical Greek in the sense of to "<span class="accented">correct</span>," "control," or "moderate," which is its meaning here.
