In the early church, as today, there were individuals who claimed to have a relationship with God but lacked genuine faith. This echoes Jesus' warning in <a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a> about those who call Him "Lord" but do not do the will of the Father. The context of Titus is Paul's instruction to Titus on Crete, where false teachers were a significant problem. The Cretans were known for their moral laxity, as noted by the poet Epimenides, whom Paul quotes in <a href="/titus/1-12.htm">Titus 1:12</a>. This cultural backdrop makes the profession of faith without corresponding action particularly egregious.<p><b>but by their actions they deny Him</b><br>Actions speak louder than words, and this phrase underscores the importance of living out one's faith. <a href="/james/2-14.htm">James 2:14-26</a> discusses the relationship between faith and works, emphasizing that faith without works is dead. The denial of God through actions can be seen in the behavior of the Pharisees, whom Jesus criticized for their hypocrisy (Matthew 23). The historical context of Crete, with its reputation for deceit and immorality, provides a stark contrast to the life of integrity expected of believers.<p><b>They are detestable</b><br>The term "detestable" is strong language, often used in the Old Testament to describe idolatry and practices that are abominable to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25-26</a>). This indicates the severity of the offense in God's eyes. In the cultural context of Crete, where idolatry and pagan practices were prevalent, such behavior would be particularly abhorrent to a holy God. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's call for His people to be set apart and holy (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>).<p><b>disobedient</b><br>Disobedience is a recurring theme in Scripture, often linked with rebellion against God. In <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22-23</a>, Samuel tells Saul that rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry. The disobedience of these individuals in Crete reflects a heart that is not submitted to God's authority. This is contrasted with the obedience of Christ, who was obedient even to death on a cross (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>), serving as the ultimate example for believers.<p><b>and unfit for any good deed</b><br>This phrase suggests a lack of usefulness or fruitfulness in the kingdom of God. In <a href="/john/15-5.htm">John 15:5-6</a>, Jesus speaks of the necessity of abiding in Him to bear fruit; apart from Him, one can do nothing. The idea of being "unfit" is akin to being disqualified or rejected, similar to the imagery of salt losing its saltiness in <a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>. The cultural context of Crete, with its emphasis on self-indulgence and moral corruption, would render such individuals ineffective in promoting the gospel and doing good works, which are the evidence of true faith (<a href="/ephesians/2-10.htm">Ephesians 2:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A trusted companion of the Apostle Paul, Titus was a Gentile convert and a leader in the early church.
