It emphasizes the divine intention behind the act of salvation, highlighting God's sovereign plan.<p><b>having been justified by His grace</b><br>Justification is a legal term meaning to be declared righteous. In the context of the New Testament, it refers to the believer being declared righteous before God. This justification is not earned by works but is a gift of grace, underscoring the unmerited favor of God. <a href="/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24</a> and <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a> also emphasize salvation by grace through faith, not by works. The concept of grace is central to the gospel message, contrasting with the law and works-based righteousness.<p><b>we would become heirs</b><br>The idea of becoming heirs is rooted in the cultural and legal practices of inheritance in the ancient world, where sons would inherit their father's estate. Spiritually, believers are considered children of God and co-heirs with Christ, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>. This inheritance includes the promises of God and eternal life, reflecting the believer's new identity and status in God's family.<p><b>with the hope of eternal life</b><br>Hope in the biblical sense is a confident expectation, not wishful thinking. Eternal life is a central promise of the Christian faith, assured through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This hope is both a present reality and a future promise, as seen in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16 and 1</a> <a href="/john/5-13.htm">John 5:13</a>.

"Heirs," see <a href="/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>, where this thought of our heirship of heaven is enlarged.

A veil, impenetrable to mortal eye, hangs between us and the many mansions of the Father's house. "It doth not yet appear what we shall be;" we only know that then, we, in company with an innumerable host of blessed beings, shall share in the beatific vision; we only know that then "we shall ever be with the Lord;" and that with this thought and with these words are we to comfort one another. (See <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm" title="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.">1Thessalonians 4:17-18</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/titus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> <span class="accented">- Might</span> for <span class="accented">should</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Being justified by his grace</span>; showing very clearly that righteousness in man did not precede and cause the saving mercy of God, but that mercy went before and provided the justification which is altogether of grace, and which issues in the possession of eternal life. <span class="cmt_word">Heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</span> This seems to be the right rendering rather than that in the margin, <span class="accented">heirs, according to hope, of eternal life</span>, making "<span class="accented">eternal</span> life" depend upon "heirs."
