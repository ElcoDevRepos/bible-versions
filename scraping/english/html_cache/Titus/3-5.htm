It reflects the biblical theme that salvation is an act of God, not a human achievement. In the broader context of the New Testament, this aligns with passages like <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which stress that salvation is a gift from God. The concept of God as Savior is rooted in the Old Testament, where God repeatedly delivers Israel from physical and spiritual bondage.<p><b>not by the righteous deeds we had done</b><br>This phrase underscores the insufficiency of human works for salvation. It echoes <a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>, which describes human righteousness as "filthy rags" before God. The cultural context of the time included a strong emphasis on adherence to the Law among Jewish communities, but this statement clarifies that even the most devout observance cannot earn salvation. This aligns with Paul's broader teaching in Romans and Galatians, where he argues against justification by works of the Law.<p><b>but according to His mercy</b><br>Mercy is a central attribute of God throughout Scripture, often linked with His covenantal love (hesed) in the Old Testament. This phrase highlights that salvation is an unmerited favor, a theme prevalent in the Psalms and the prophetic writings. The mercy of God is a recurring theme in the New Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_peter/1-3.htm">1 Peter 1:3</a>, which speaks of being born again to a living hope through God's mercy.<p><b>through the washing of new birth</b><br>This phrase likely refers to the concept of spiritual rebirth, which is central to Christian theology. It connects to Jesus' conversation with Nicodemus in <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3-5</a>, where He speaks of being "born of water and the Spirit." The imagery of washing may also allude to baptism, a rite symbolizing purification and initiation into the Christian community. In the cultural context, washing was a common metaphor for spiritual cleansing.<p><b>and renewal by the Holy Spirit</b><br>The Holy Spirit's role in renewal is a key aspect of New Testament teaching. This phrase suggests a transformation that goes beyond mere moral improvement, indicating a fundamental change in nature. The Holy Spirit is depicted as the agent of this renewal, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>, which speaks of becoming a new creation in Christ. The concept of renewal ties back to Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>, which promise a new heart and spirit given by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Titus, providing guidance and instruction for church leadership and Christian living.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A trusted companion of Paul, serving as a leader in the early church, particularly on the island of Crete.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_spirit.htm">Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The third person of the Trinity, involved in the process of regeneration and renewal of believers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/crete.htm">Crete</a></b><br>The location where Titus was ministering, known for its challenges in establishing a strong Christian community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/regeneration.htm">Regeneration</a></b><br>The spiritual rebirth and transformation of a believer, emphasized in this passage as a work of the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/salvation_by_grace,_not_works.htm">Salvation by Grace, Not Works</a></b><br>Emphasize that our salvation is entirely a result of God's mercy and grace, not our own righteous deeds.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>Highlight the Holy Spirit's work in regeneration and renewal, transforming believers into new creations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_mercy.htm">Understanding Mercy</a></b><br>Reflect on the depth of God's mercy, which is the foundation of our salvation and should inspire gratitude and humility.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/living_out_our_new_birth.htm">Living Out Our New Birth</a></b><br>Encourage believers to live in a way that reflects their new identity in Christ, empowered by the Holy Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_assurance_of_salvation.htm">The Assurance of Salvation</a></b><br>Reassure believers of their secure position in Christ, based on God's mercy and the work of the Holy Spirit, not their own efforts.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Titus_3_5_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Titus 3:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Titus_3_5_Grace_not_works_saves_us.htm">How does Titus 3:5 emphasize salvation by grace rather than works?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_rebirth_washing_in_renewal.htm">What role does the "washing of rebirth" play in our spiritual renewal?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Holy_Spirit_renewal_daily.htm">How can we apply "renewal by the Holy Spirit" in daily Christian living?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Titus_3_5_Eph_2_8-9_on_grace.htm">Connect Titus 3:5 with Ephesians 2:8-9 on salvation and grace.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_God_s_mercy_on_our_actions.htm">How should understanding God's mercy in Titus 3:5 affect our interactions with others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Titus_3_5_Role_of_works_in_salvation.htm">How does Titus 3:5 define the role of works in salvation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_washing_of_rebirth.htm">What is the significance of "washing of rebirth" in Titus 3:5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Titus_3_5_and_grace_how_do_they_align.htm">How does Titus 3:5 align with the concept of grace in Christianity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_titus_3.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Titus 3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_the_washing_of_regeneration.htm">What is the washing of regeneration?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_happened_at_the_antioch_incident.htm">What is the washing of regeneration?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_palingenesis_mean.htm">What does palingenesis mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/is_gal._5_16-17_spirit_vs._flesh_scientific.htm">In Galatians 5:16&#8211;17, is the concept of spirit warring against the flesh scientifically implausible or metaphysical speculation?

We contribute nothing but the sin that made it necessary. By His mercy, He washes us clean, grants new life, and continually renews us through the Holy Spirit. Our hope, confidence, and daily walk all flow from this grace-centered rescue.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/titus/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Not by works of righteousness.</span>--This by no means asserts that such works ever had been done, and then produced, as it were, before the bar of God, and weighed and found insufficient; but it simply maintains that to <span class= "ital">win</span> salvation such <span class= "ital">must</span> be done. Sad experience, more forcibly than any theological assertion, has demonstrated to us all the utter impossibility of any of us, even the holiest, ever, even for one day, doing the works of a purely righteous man.<p><span class= "bld">But according to his mercy.</span>--As there was nothing in us which called for such a salvation, as there were no acts of ours which deserved reward, His gift of salvation, which includes (<a href="/titus/3-7.htm" title="That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.">Titus 3:7</a>) eternal life, was owing entirely to His divine love which saw and pitied our misery, our endless suffering. Out of this hopeless state the eternal pity lifted us, and put us into a state of salvation. The next clause specifies the outward and visible sign of the salvation our loving God was pleased to ordain in His Church, namely, "baptism;" but here great care must be taken properly to understand what St. Paul meant by this baptism, to which he attributed so great power. In St. Paul's mind it was no mere observance, but was a sacrament, in which all that was inward properly and completely accompanied all that was outward. In another place the Apostle has grandly paraphrased his words here. In the Galatian Letter (<a href="/galatians/3-27.htm" title="For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.">Galatians 3:27</a>) he writes how "that as many as were baptised into Christ have put on Christ," that is, have entered into vital union with Him--a blessed state, which most surely leads to life eternal, if the baptised only remain faithful.<p><span class= "bld">By the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.</span>--Seeing, then, that God <span class= "ital">has</span> saved us by His own act, independently of any work of ours, we ask, How has He effected this? The words we are here considering give the answer to the question. The Greek should be rendered, "by the laver of regeneration," &c. Then, by means of the laver of regeneration, &c, has God put us into a state of salvation. In other words, He has effected this by means of "baptism" (for the laver here can only signify the baptismal font, and is called the laver of regeneration because it is the vessel consecrated to the use of that sacrament), whereby, in its completeness as a sacrament, the new life in Christ is conveyed. Baptism, then, is the means through which we receive the saving grace of Christ; in its laver we are born again to a new life, in it we receive strength through the Holy Ghost constantly to renew and to develop this new life, <span class= "ital">for it is not only the laver of regeneration but also of renovation by the Holy Spirit.</span> But baptism is here understood in all its completion--the outward visible sign accompanied with the inward spiritual grace. In the case of one who is come to years of understanding seeking baptism, repentance and faith in the promises of God are absolutely required. In the case of infants, who have also from the very earliest times been, through this same laver, enrolled in the communion of Christians, the same profession is required, only they make it by their sureties, and directly that they have come to years of discretion they solemnly and publicly assent to what had been already affirmed in their name. Thus, by means of the laver of regeneration, &c, or, in other words, by baptism <span class= "ital">in all its completion</span>--the outward act being accompanied with the inward faith--He saved us, that is, put us into a state of salvation. Of the difference between "regeneration" and "renovation," the first, "regeneration," is well explained in the words of the collect for Christmas Day, which speaks of the "regenerated" as "made God's children by adoption and grace." The second, "renovation," the same collect goes on to speak of, when it prays that "the regenerated" "may daily be renewed by the Holy Spirit." The first, "regeneration," is spoken of by St. John in his words, "Ye must be born again" (<a href="/john/3-7.htm" title="Marvel not that I said to you, You must be born again.">John 3:7</a>); the second is alluded to by St. Paul when he wrote, "the inward man is renewed day by day" (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-16.htm" title="For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.">2Corinthians 4:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/titus/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- Done in</span> for <span class="accented">of</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">did ourselves</span> for <span class="accented">hare done</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">through</span> for <span class="accented">by</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">By works</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e. in consequence of.</span> God's kindness and love to man did not spring from man's good work as the preceding and producing conditions (comp. <a href="/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>, and the notes of Bishops Ellicott and Lightfoot).

All this, as the cause of our <span class="accented">salvation</span>, the apostle emphatically denies. -Not, etc., <span class="cmt_word">but according to his mercy he saved us</span>. The predisposing cause, the rule and measure of our salvation, was God's mercy and grace, originating and completing that salvation. <span class="cmt_word">Through the washing of regeneration</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). Here we have the means <span class="accented">through</span> or <span class="accented">by</span> which God's mercy saves us. The <span class="accented">washing</span> or rather <span class="accented">laver</span> of regeneration (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="accented">-</span> found elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="/ephesians/5-26.htm">Ephesians 5:26</a>, in exactly the same connection - is the <span class="accented">laver</span> or <span class="accented">bath</span> in which the washing takes place. The nature or quality of this bath is described by the words, "of regeneration" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>); elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href="/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>, where it seems rather to mean the great restoration of humanity at the second advent. The word is used by Cicero of his restoration to political power, by Josephus of the restoration of the Jews under Zerubbabel, and by several Greek authors; and the LXX. of <a href="/job/14-14.htm">Job 14:14</a> have the phrase, <span class="greek">&#x1f15;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, but in what sense is not quite clear, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, therefore, very fifty describes the new birth in holy baptism, when the believer is put into possession of a new spiritual life, a new nature, and a new inheritance of glory. And the laver of baptism is called "the laver of regeneration," because it is the ordained means by or through which regeneration is obtained. <span class="cmt_word">And renewing of the Holy Ghost<span class="accented">.</span></span> It is doubtful whether the genitive <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span> depends upon <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;</span> or upon <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. Bengel, followed by Alford, takes the former, "per lavacrum et renovationem;" the Vulgate (<span class="accented">lavacrum regenerationis et renova-tionis Spiritus Sancti</span>), the latter, followed by Huther, Bishop Ellicott, and others. It is difficult to hit upon any conclusive argument for one side or the other. But it is against the latter construction that it gives such a very long rambling sentence dependent upon <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>. "The <span class="accented">laver</span> of regeneration and of the renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior." And it is in favor of the former that the "laver of regeneration" and "the renewing of the Holy Ghost" seem to describe very clearly the two parts of the sacrament, the outward visible sign and the inward spiritual grace; the birth of water and of the Holy Ghost. So that Bengel's rendering seems on the whole to be preferred. <span class="cmt_word">Renewing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>); only here and <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, and not at all in the LXX. or in classical Greek. But the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> is found in <a href="/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-10.htm">Colossians 3:10</a>.

This renewal is the work of the Holy Ghost in the new birth, when men are "born again" of the Spirit (<a href="/john/3-5.htm">John 3:5</a>). Alford is wrong in denying its application here to the first gift of the new life. It is evidently parallel with the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>.
