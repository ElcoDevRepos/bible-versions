Paul left Titus there to continue the work of establishing the church, indicating the importance of strong leadership in a challenging environment.<p><b>was that you would set in order what was unfinished</b><br>The phrase suggests that the church in Crete was in its early stages and needed further organization.

The term "set in order" implies a systematic approach to establishing church governance and addressing any doctrinal or moral issues.<p><b>and appoint elders in every town</b><br>Elders, or presbyters, were to be appointed as leaders in each local congregation. This practice aligns with the early church's structure, where elders were responsible for teaching, shepherding, and maintaining doctrinal purity. The plural "elders" suggests a plurality of leadership, which was common in the early church to provide accountability and shared responsibility.<p><b>as I directed you</b><br>Paul's directive to Titus underscores the apostolic authority and the importance of adhering to the teachings and practices established by the apostles. This phrase highlights the continuity of church leadership and the transmission of apostolic tradition.

Crete--over whose Christian population Titus had been placed by St. Paul--was a well-known large and populous island in the Mediterranean. It lies geographically further south than any of the European islands, and, roughly speaking, almost at an equal distance from each of the three Old World continents--Europe, Asia, Africa. We identify it with the Caphtor of the Old Testament (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-23.htm" title="And the Avims which dwelled in Hazerim, even to Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelled in their stead.)">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/47-4.htm" title="Because of the day that comes to spoil all the Philistines, and to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remains: for the LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor.">Jeremiah 47:4</a>; <a href="/amos/9-7.htm" title="Are you not as children of the Ethiopians to me, O children of Israel? said the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?">Amos 9:7</a>). In modern times it is known by us as Candia. Very early it was the scene of an advanced civilisation. In the <span class= "ital">Odyssey</span> it is mentioned as possessing ninety cities; in the <span class= "ital">Iliad</span> as many as one hundred. Metellus added it, B.C. 69, to the Roman dominion. In the days of Augustus it was united into one province with Cyrene. It abounded with Jews of wealth and influence; this we learn from the testimony of Philo and of Josephus. It probably received the gospel from some of those of "Crete" who we are expressly told were present when the Spirit was poured on the Apostles on the first Pentecost after the Resurrection (<a href="/acts/2-11.htm" title="Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.">Acts 2:11</a>). The apparently flourishing state of Christianity on the island at this time was in great measure, no doubt, owing to the residence and labours among them of the Apostle St. Paul, whose work appears to have been mainly directed to preaching the gospel and to increasing the number of the converts, which, from the wording of <a href="/titus/1-5.htm" title="For this cause left I you in Crete, that you should set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed you:">Titus 1:5</a>, was evidently very great, elders (presbyters) being required in every city.<p>The task of organising the Church had been left for a season. We are ignorant of the circumstance which summoned the old Apostle from the scene of what seems to have been most successful labours. He left behind him one of the ablest of his disciples, Titus--a tried and well-known Christian leader of the second half of the first century--to organise the church life and to regulate the teaching of the powerful and numerous Christian community of Crete. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/titus/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> <span class="accented">- Were</span> for <span class="accented">are</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">appoint</span> for <span class="accented">ordain</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">gave thee charge</span> for <span class="accented">had appointed thee</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Left I thee in Crete.</span> We have no account of St. Paul's visit to Crete, nor do we know how the gospel was first brought to Crete. It may have been by some of those "Cretes" who were at Jerusalem on the Day of Pentecost, and heard the apostles speak in their tongue "the wonderful works of God" (<a href="/acts/2-11.htm">Acts 2:11</a>), or by other Christian Jews visiting the Jewish community in Crete (note to ver. 1). If St. Paul was returning from Spain, and travelling by ship eastward, Crete would be on his way. The importance of the island, with which he made some acquaintance on his voyage from Caesarea to Rome (<a href="/acts/27-7.htm">Acts 27:7, 8</a>), and the large Jewish colony there, may naturally have inclined him to visit it. How long he remained there we do not know, but he did not stay long enough to organize the Church there completely. There were still things "wanting" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>), as it follows. This mention of Crete is an important chronological mark. The order of St. Paul's progress, as gathered from the three pastoral Epistles, is very distinct - Crete, Miletus, Troas, Macedonia, Corinth, Nicopolis, Rome. He dropped Titus at Crete, and left Timothy behind at Ephesus. The Epistle to Titus, therefore, is the first of the three pastoral Epistles, and this is borne out by another circumstance. When he wrote to Titus he had not made up his mind whether he should send Artemas or Tychicus to take his place in Crete when he rejoined the apostle (<a href="/titus/3-12.htm">Titus 3:12</a>). But when he wrote 2 Timothy he had sent Tychicus to Ephesus to replace Timothy (<a href="/2_timothy/4-12.htm">2 Timothy 4:12</a>), and Titus had already joined him, and been sent on by him to Dalmatia, presumably from Nicopolis. <span class="cmt_word">Set in order</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>); only here in the New Testament, and not found in the LXX. nor in classical Greek, except as a technical word in the art of rhetoric. But <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span> is very common in classical Greek (<span class="accented">see</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). The force of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> in the compound here is "further," or "in addition." St. Paul had set the Church in order up to a certain point. But there were still certain things wanting, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> (see <a href="/titus/3-13.htm">Titus 3:13</a>; <a href="/luke/18-22.htm">Luke 18:22</a>); and these Titus was to supply and give the finishing touch to. <span class="cmt_word">Appoint</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>). This is a better rendering than the A.V. "ordain," because it is a general word for "to appoint, make." Probably the A.V. "ordain" was not intended to be taken in a strictly technical sense, but is used as in <a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-3.htm">Hebrews 8:3</a>. The technical word was usually "to order." "The Ordering of Deacons," or "of Priests," is the title of the service in the Book of Common Prayer. "Meet to be ordered," "shall surcease from ordering," occur repeatedly in the rubrics, <span class="cmt_word">Elders</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> presbyters, or priests (comp. <a href="/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>; and see <a href="/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">In every city</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); city by city. The phrase has a peculiar significance in Crete, which used to be famous for its hundred cities. It shows, too, that Christianity was widely spread among the cities of the island. The germ of the episcopal office, one bishop and many presbyters, is here very conspicuous. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/titus/1-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The reason</span><br /><span class="grk">&#967;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(charin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5484.htm">Strong's 5484: </a> </span><span class="str2">Accusative case of charis as preposition; through favor of, i.e. On account of.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I left</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#941;&#955;&#953;&#960;&#972;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(apelipon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_620.htm">Strong's 620: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and leipo; to leave behind; by implication, to forsake.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(se)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
