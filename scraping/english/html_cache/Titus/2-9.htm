The instruction for slaves to submit to their masters reflects the social order of the time. This submission is not an endorsement of slavery but a call for Christian slaves to live out their faith within their circumstances. The phrase "in everything" suggests a comprehensive obedience, aligning with <a href="/colossians/3-22.htm">Colossians 3:22</a>, which also instructs slaves to obey their earthly masters. This submission is ultimately an act of service to God, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5-8</a>, where slaves are encouraged to serve as if serving Christ.<p><b>to be well-pleasing</b><br>The call to be "well-pleasing" emphasizes the attitude and quality of the work performed by slaves. This aligns with the broader Christian principle of doing all things for the glory of God (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-31.htm">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>). The term suggests a positive demeanor and a commitment to excellence, reflecting the transformation of character that comes from a relationship with Christ. This attitude can serve as a testimony to the masters and others, potentially leading them to Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>, which encourages believers to live such good lives among the pagans that they may glorify God.<p><b>not argumentative</b><br>The instruction to avoid being argumentative highlights the importance of maintaining peace and unity, even in difficult circumstances. This aligns with the broader biblical teaching on the value of a gentle and quiet spirit (<a href="/1_peter/3-4.htm">1 Peter 3:4</a>) and the call to live at peace with everyone (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>). By not being argumentative, slaves could demonstrate the transformative power of the Gospel in their lives, setting an example of Christ-like humility and submission, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-14.htm">Philippians 2:14-15</a>, which encourages believers to do everything without complaining or arguing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/titus.htm">Titus</a></b><br>A young pastor and a trusted companion of the Apostle Paul, tasked with organizing and teaching the church in Crete.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The Apostle who authored the letter to Titus, providing guidance on church leadership and Christian living.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/slaves.htm">Slaves</a></b><br>In the context of the Roman Empire, slaves were a significant part of the household and economic structure.

With some special reference to the peculiar circumstances of the Church in Crete, St. Paul had been giving general directions to his representative (<a href="/context/titus/2-1.htm" title="But speak you the things which become sound doctrine:">Titus 2:1-8</a>) respecting instruction and advice he considered it expedient should be given to the varied orders and ages of professing Christians in the island. These directions were arranged with respect to "age" and "sex." He now turns to the question of the instruction of another large class, among whom were to be found many Christians--"the slaves." These he masses together under one head. Not improbably these "words" to be addressed particularly to slaves were called out by some particular instances of insubordination and of impatience under their unhappy condition among the Cretan slaves. Indeed, the repeated warnings to this unfortunate and oppressed class (see <a href="/ephesians/6-5.htm" title="Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;">Ephesians 6:5</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-22.htm" title=" Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;">Colossians 3:22</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-1.htm" title="Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed.">1Timothy 6:1</a>) tell us that among the difficulties which Christianity had to surmount in its early years was the hard task of persuading "the slave" that the divine Master who promised him a home, if he were faithful and true, among the many mansions of His Father, meant not that the existing relations of society should be then changed, or its complex framework disturbed. St. Paul knew it was a hard matter to persuade the bondman, fellow-heir of heaven with the freeman, to acquiesce patiently in his present condition of misery and servitude. Hence these repeated charges to this class. These poor sufferers were to obey cheerfully, readily, as the next clause told them.<p><span class= "bld">And to please them well in all things; not answering again.</span>--The last words are better translated <span class= "ital">not gainsaying; </span>the Vulgate has <span class= "ital">contradicentes.</span> It signifies that they should obey cheerfully, willingly, without sullenness; not thwarting or setting themselves against their masters' plans or desires or orders; and the Apostle, in <a href="/titus/2-10.htm" title="Not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.">Titus 2:10</a>, gives them a noble inducement for this brave, sweet patience he would have so earnestly pressed upon them. Such conduct on their part, he tells them, would serve greatly to help the Master's cause; it would prepossess many hostile minds in favour of a religion which could so powerfully influence even the slave. Chrysostom comments thus: "Greeks form their estimate of doctrines not from the doctrine itself, but from the actions and the life" (of those who profess the doctrine). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/titus/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- In subjection to</span> for <span class="accented">obedient unto</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">be well-pleasing to them</span> for <span class="accented">please them well</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">gainsaying</span> for <span class="accented">answering gain</span>, A.V.
