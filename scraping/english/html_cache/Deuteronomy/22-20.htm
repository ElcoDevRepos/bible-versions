The law provided a process to address such claims, ensuring justice and protecting the innocent. This reflects the broader biblical principle of truth and justice, as seen in <a href="/exodus/23.htm">Exodus 23:1-2</a>, which warns against spreading false reports and perverting justice.<p><b>and no proof of the young woman&#8217;s virginity can be found,</b><br>The "proof" refers to the physical evidence of virginity, typically the bloodstained cloth from the wedding night, as described earlier in <a href="/deuteronomy/22-13.htm">Deuteronomy 22:13-19</a>. This practice underscores the cultural importance placed on virginity and marital purity. The absence of proof could lead to severe consequences, highlighting the gravity of sexual purity in Israelite society. This emphasis on purity is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to live pure lives (<a href="/1_thessalonians/4-3.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:3-7</a>).

Now the Holy Spirit signals a turn: &#8220;If, however,&#8221; the facts point the other way.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s law never lets slander stand unchecked, yet it just as firmly refuses to excuse real sin (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-18.htm">Deuteronomy 19:18-19</a>; <a href="/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Justice in Israel required careful inquiry, witnesses, and evidence, not a rush to judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-4.htm">Deuteronomy 17:4</a>; 19:15).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>this accusation is true</b><p>&#8226; Truth is established only after investigation by the city elders (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-18.htm">Deuteronomy 22:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The husband&#8217;s claim concerns covenant faithfulness; if it proves correct, the marriage covenant has been violated before it was even consummated (<a href="/jeremiah/3-8.htm">Jeremiah 3:8</a>; <a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s character is truth (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).

Here that evidence is missing.<p>&#8226; Absence of proof after due inquiry becomes positive evidence of sin (<a href="/numbers/5-31.htm">Numbers 5:31</a>).<p>&#8226; The principle anticipates the New Testament call for two or three witnesses before judgment (<a href="/matthew/18-16.htm">Matthew 18:16</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-19.htm">1 Timothy 5:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of the young woman&#8217;s virginity</b><p>&#8226; Virginity symbolized covenant purity and the exclusive devotion expected in marriage (<a href="/leviticus/21-13.htm">Leviticus 21:13-14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8-9</a>).<p>&#8226; For believers today, it pictures the church&#8217;s promised purity as the bride of Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>).<p>&#8226; Sexual intimacy, reserved for marriage, guards the gospel picture of Christ&#8217;s faithful love (<a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>can be found</b><p>&#8226; A final, sober conclusion: the charge stands, evidence is absent, guilt is confirmed.

When an accusation is verified and evidence of virginity is truly lacking, Israel must act. The passage affirms that marital faithfulness matters to the Lord, that truth must always triumph over slander or sentiment, and that sin brings real consequences. Today the verse calls believers to honor marriage with the same seriousness, to pursue purity of heart and body, and to rejoice that Christ, the faithful Bridegroom, has covered every repentant sinner with His own righteousness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/22-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If, however,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;im-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
