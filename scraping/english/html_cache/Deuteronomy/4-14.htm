It highlights the transitional phase as the Israelites prepared to enter the Promised Land. This was a pivotal moment when God was establishing His covenant with His people.<p><b>the LORD commanded me</b><br>Moses is the speaker here, and the phrase underscores his role as the mediator between God and the Israelites. The LORD's command signifies divine authority and the importance of obedience to God's instructions. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israel's governance, where God directly guides His people through chosen leaders.<p><b>to teach you</b><br>Teaching was a critical component of Moses' leadership. It involved not just the transmission of laws but also the inculcation of a way of life that reflected God's holiness. This teaching was meant to be comprehensive, covering all aspects of life and worship, ensuring that the Israelites understood and internalized God's expectations.<p><b>the statutes and ordinances</b><br>These terms refer to the specific laws and decrees given by God. Statutes (Hebrew: "chukkim") often relate to religious practices and rituals, while ordinances (Hebrew: "mishpatim") typically concern civil and moral laws. Together, they form a complete legal and ethical system intended to set Israel apart as a holy nation.<p><b>you are to follow</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the necessity of obedience. The laws were not merely suggestions but were to be actively followed. Obedience was a covenantal requirement, and it was through adherence to these laws that Israel would maintain its relationship with God and receive His blessings.<p><b>in the land</b><br>The land refers to Canaan, the Promised Land, which was central to God's covenant with Abraham and his descendants. It was a land flowing with milk and honey, symbolizing abundance and God's provision. Possession of the land was contingent upon Israel's faithfulness to God's commands.<p><b>that you are crossing the Jordan</b><br>The Jordan River was a significant geographical boundary that the Israelites had to cross to enter the Promised Land. This crossing symbolized a new beginning and the fulfillment of God's promises. It also prefigures Christian baptism, representing a passage from the old life into the new.<p><b>to possess</b><br>Possession of the land was both a gift and a responsibility. It required active participation and faithfulness from the Israelites. This concept of possession also points to the spiritual inheritance believers have in Christ, which requires living in accordance with God's will to fully experience His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the commandments from God and was tasked with teaching them to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel who gave the commandments to Moses for the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were to receive and follow the statutes and ordinances.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>The boundary the Israelites were to cross to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which the Israelites were about to enter.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>God&#8217;s statutes and ordinances are given for our good and are meant to guide us in righteous living.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_leadership_in_teaching.htm">Role of Leadership in Teaching</a></b><br>Just as Moses was commanded to teach the people, spiritual leaders today have the responsibility to teach God&#8217;s Word faithfully.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_god's_promises.htm">Preparation for God&#8217;s Promises</a></b><br>The Israelites were to learn and follow God&#8217;s laws as they prepared to enter the Promised Land.

The phrase grounds the command in a real moment in history, showing God&#8217;s dealings are not abstract ideas but specific acts in time (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/1-3.htm">Deuteronomy 1:3</a>, &#8220;In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the Israelites everything the LORD had commanded him concerning them&#8221;). Just as God had delivered earlier commands at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-1.htm">Exodus 19:1-6</a>), He now renews them for a new generation on the brink of their next step.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD commanded me</b><p>The initiative is entirely the LORD&#8217;s; Moses serves as mediator, not originator. Divine authority stands behind every statute, removing any notion that these words are optional or culturally conditioned. Compare <a href="/deuteronomy/5-4.htm">Deuteronomy 5:4-5</a>, where Moses reminds Israel, &#8220;The LORD spoke to you face to face&#8230;, I was standing between the LORD and you at that time, to declare to you the word of the LORD.&#8221; Much later, Jesus echoes the same pattern: &#8220;For I have not spoken on My own, but the Father who sent Me has commanded Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/12-49.htm">John 12:49</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to teach you</b><p>God&#8217;s commands are meant to be understood, not mystified. Teaching bridges revelation and obedience. Notice the repetition in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>, &#8220;You shall teach them diligently to your children,&#8221; underscoring a multi-generational classroom. Effective teaching includes:<p>&#8226; clarity&#8212;explaining what God said;<p>&#8226; relevance&#8212;showing how it fits everyday life;<p>&#8226; urgency&#8212;calling for decision now.<p>Paul later mirrors this in <a href="/acts/20-20.htm">Acts 20:20</a>, &#8220;I did not shrink back from telling you anything that was beneficial and teaching you publicly and from house to house.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the statutes and ordinances</b><p>&#8220;Statutes&#8221; focus on fixed prescriptions; &#8220;ordinances&#8221; on justice and right order. Together they cover moral, civil, and ceremonial life. <a href="/psalms/19-7.htm">Psalm 19:7-9</a> celebrates this comprehensive scope: &#8220;The law of the LORD is perfect&#8230; the statutes of the LORD are trustworthy&#8230; the ordinances of the LORD are sure.&#8221; God&#8217;s word addresses every sphere&#8212;home, marketplace, sanctuary&#8212;leaving no corner autonomous.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you are to follow</b><p>Knowledge without obedience defeats the purpose. <a href="/deuteronomy/8-6.htm">Deuteronomy 8:6</a> urges, &#8220;So you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, to walk in His ways and to fear Him.&#8221; The expectation is active, continuous practice, not one-time compliance. <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> later echoes, &#8220;Be doers of the word, and not hearers only.&#8221; Obedience proves faith and secures blessing (<a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the land</b><p>The commands are tied to a context&#8212;a covenant people living in a covenant land. God was creating a society that would display His character to surrounding nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6-8</a>). Life in Canaan was not to mirror Egypt&#8217;s oppression nor Canaan&#8217;s idolatry (<a href="/leviticus/18-3.htm">Leviticus 18:3-4</a>) but was to showcase holiness, justice, and compassion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that you are crossing the Jordan</b><p>Israel stands at the threshold of promise and responsibility. This crossing marks a decisive break from wilderness wandering to settled inheritance (<a href="/joshua/3-17.htm">Joshua 3:17</a>). It recalls earlier unbelief that delayed entry (<a href="/numbers/14-34.htm">Numbers 14:34</a>) and highlights God&#8217;s patience in giving a renewed opportunity. Each generation likewise faces its own Jordan moments&#8212;points of decision requiring trust and obedience (<a href="/hebrews/3-15.htm">Hebrews 3:15-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to possess</b><p>Possession speaks of receiving and stewarding God&#8217;s gift, not seizing it by human strength. <a href="/deuteronomy/1-8.htm">Deuteronomy 1:8</a>, &#8220;See, I have placed the land before you. Go in and possess it.&#8221; God grants, Israel occupies. The land foreshadows the believer&#8217;s inheritance &#8220;kept in heaven&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>) and the ultimate restoration when Christ reigns. Obedience is the pathway to enjoying what God has already promised (<a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43-45</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/4-14.htm">Deuteronomy 4:14</a> reveals a timeless pattern: at a concrete moment, God authoritatively entrusts His servant to teach His comprehensive commands so that His people may live them out in the place He prepares and provides. History, authority, instruction, obedience, context, transition, and inheritance all converge. When we embrace and practice God&#8217;s statutes, we step into the fullness of His promised life and witness His glory in our generation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/4-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1460;&#1428;&#1493;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;hi&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
