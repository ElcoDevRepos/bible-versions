The tithe, or tenth, was a portion of one's produce set aside for sacred purposes. This practice is rooted in the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where the people acknowledged God's provision and sovereignty by returning a portion of their increase. The concept of tithing is first seen with Abraham giving a tenth to Melchizedek (<a href="/genesis/14-20.htm">Genesis 14:20</a>) and is later codified in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30-32</a>).<p><b>in the third year, the year of the tithe</b><br>The third year tithe, also known as the "poor tithe," was distinct from the annual tithe that supported the Levites and the temple service. Every third year, the tithe was designated for the local community's needy, emphasizing social justice and care for the marginalized. This cycle reflects God's concern for the welfare of all His people and ensures that the blessings of the land are shared equitably. The third-year tithe is mentioned again in <a href="/deuteronomy/14-28.htm">Deuteronomy 14:28-29</a>, highlighting its importance in the community's life.<p><b>you are to give it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow</b><br>This directive underscores the inclusive nature of God's provision. The Levites, who had no inheritance of land, relied on the tithes for their sustenance (<a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-24</a>). The foreigner, fatherless, and widow represent vulnerable groups within society who lacked the means to provide for themselves. By including these groups, the law reflects God's heart for justice and compassion, as seen throughout Scripture (<a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>; <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>). This provision ensured that the community's prosperity extended to all its members, fostering a spirit of generosity and care.<p><b>that they may eat and be filled within your gates</b><br>The phrase "within your gates" indicates that this act of giving was to occur locally, within the towns and cities of Israel. This localized distribution ensured that the needs of the community were met directly and efficiently. The goal was not merely to provide sustenance but to ensure that these individuals were "filled," suggesting a standard of care that went beyond mere survival to include dignity and well-being. This reflects the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor as oneself (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>; <a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>) and prefigures the New Testament call to care for the least of these (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levite.htm">Levite</a></b><br>Members of the tribe of Levi, who were set apart for religious duties and did not have a land inheritance like the other tribes of Israel.

The verse affirms that authentic worship involves systematic, cheerful generosity, reflecting the LORD&#8217;s unwavering concern for justice and compassion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><a href="/context/deuteronomy/26-12.htm" title="When you have made an end of tithing all the tithes of your increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and have given it to the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within your gates, and be filled;">Deuteronomy 26:12-15</a>. <span class= "bld">DECLARATION OF THE TITHE.</span><p>(12) <span class= "bld">When thou hast made an end.</span>--The time fixed for making the confession prescribed in <a href="/context/deuteronomy/26-13.htm" title="Then you shall say before the LORD your God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of my house, and also have given them to the Levite, and to the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all your commandments which you have commanded me: I have not transgressed your commandments, neither have I forgotten them.">Deuteronomy 26:13-15</a>, according to Jewish usage, was the Passover-eve of the fourth year, i.e., the first feast after the completion of the year of tithing. It would seem that something was still to be gathered from the trees after the Feast of Tabernacles, and thus there would still be some produce untithed at that feast in any given year. But the tithe of the third year must be separated to the very last item before the Passover of the fourth.<p><span class= "bld">The third year, which is the year of tithing.</span>--See <a href="/context/deuteronomy/14-28.htm" title="At the end of three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase the same year, and shall lay it up within your gates:">Deuteronomy 14:28-29</a>.

It is taken by Jewish commentators to include everything that could possibly be required as holy under any law, whether tithe, or firstfruit of trees not yet made common, or anything that from any cause had not been brought to Jerusalem during the three previous years.<p><span class= "bld">I . . . have given . . . unto the Levite (the first tithe), and unto the stranger. . . .</span> (the poor's tithe).--Rashi. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-15.</span> - On the occasion of presenting the tithes, a special service was also to be made. The tithe here referred to is the vegetable or predial tithe, which, at the end of each third year, as here prescribed, was to be converted into a gift to the poor and needy. This, properly the second tithe (LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>), but usually called the third tithe (Tobit 1:7, 8; Josephus, 'Antiq.,' 4:8, 22), is quite distinct from the Levitical tithe prescribed in <a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30-33</a> and <a href="/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21-32</a>; and it is a mistake to suppose that the law here was designed to contravene or supersede that in the earlier books (see Kitto, 'Bibl. Cycl.,' 3:1010). As this tithe completed the triennial series of tithes which the Israelites had to offer, it was fitting that in presenting it a solemn declaration should be made by the offerer to the effect that he had honorably and conscientiously discharged all the obligations in this respect which the Law laid upon him. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The third year, which is the year of tithing</span>. As each week ended with a Sabbath, so a sabbatical year ended each cycle or week of years; and as on it no tithes were levied, "the year of tithing" here specified would be the third and the sixth years in each septennial period. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you have finished laying aside</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1438;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;&#601;&#183;&#7733;al&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3615.htm">Strong's 3615: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be complete, at an end, finished, accomplished, or spent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a tenth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1456;&#1513;&#1474;&#1463;&#1447;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#8216;&#183;&#347;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4643.htm">Strong's 4643: </a> </span><span class="str2">Tenth part, tithe</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of your produce</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1464;&#1514;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1435;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
