In ancient Israel, family names were significant as they were tied to one's identity, inheritance, and social standing. The concept of a family name being recognized in Israel underscores the communal nature of the society, where individual actions could impact the entire family line. This reflects the broader biblical theme of generational blessings and curses, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5-6</a>.<p><b>will be called</b><br>The use of "will be called" suggests a formal declaration or recognition by the community. In biblical times, names and titles were often given to signify a person's character or actions. This public naming serves as a form of social accountability and reflects the communal values of ancient Israel, where public opinion and reputation were powerful forces.<p><b>&#8220;The House of the Unsandaled.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase refers to the specific cultural practice described earlier in <a href="/deuteronomy/25.htm">Deuteronomy 25</a>, where a man who refuses to fulfill his duty of levirate marriage is publicly shamed. The removal of a sandal was a symbolic act of disgrace and rejection, as sandals were associated with one's right to walk and claim land. This act of unsandaling is a public declaration of the man's failure to uphold his familial responsibilities. The concept of being "unsandaled" can be connected to the broader biblical theme of redemption and inheritance, as seen in the story of Ruth and Boaz (<a href="/ruth/4-7.htm">Ruth 4:7-8</a>), where the sandal exchange signifies the transfer of redemption rights. This also typologically points to Christ, who fulfills all righteousness and redeems His people, contrasting with the failure depicted in this passage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /
