In the context of Deuteronomy, Moses is addressing the Israelites as they prepare to enter the Promised Land. The "ordinances" refer to the laws and commandments given by God, which are detailed throughout the Torah. Listening implies not just hearing but understanding and internalizing these laws. This concept of obedience is echoed in the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>), which calls for wholehearted devotion to God.<p><b>and keep them carefully</b><br>The call to "keep them carefully" underscores the need for diligent observance of God's commandments. This careful keeping is a recurring theme in Deuteronomy, where the Israelites are reminded of the blessings tied to obedience and the curses associated with disobedience (Deuteronomy 28). The Hebrew word for "keep" (shamar) conveys a sense of guarding or watching over, indicating the seriousness with which these laws should be treated.<p><b>then the LORD your God will keep His covenant</b><br>The covenant mentioned here is the Abrahamic Covenant, which God established with Abraham and reaffirmed with Isaac and Jacob. This covenant includes promises of land, descendants, and blessing (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). The conditional nature of this statement highlights the reciprocal relationship between God and His people, where divine faithfulness is met with human obedience. This covenantal relationship is central to the narrative of the Old Testament and is fulfilled in the New Covenant through Jesus Christ (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>).<p><b>and the loving devotion</b><br>"Loving devotion" translates the Hebrew word "chesed," which encompasses love, mercy, and faithfulness. It is a key attribute of God's character, often associated with His covenantal faithfulness. This term is frequently used in the Psalms to describe God's enduring love and kindness (Psalm 136). The concept of "chesed" is foundational to understanding God's relationship with His people, as it reflects His unwavering commitment to them despite their failures.<p><b>that He swore to your fathers</b><br>This phrase refers to the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;to whom God made His covenantal promises. The act of swearing an oath signifies the seriousness and unchangeable nature of God's promises. The historical context of these patriarchal promises is crucial, as they form the basis for Israel's identity and mission. The fulfillment of these promises is seen throughout the biblical narrative, culminating in the coming of Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs (<a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and promises to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving the laws and promises as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God who promises blessings for obedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_covenant.htm">The Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between God and the Israelites, involving blessings for obedience and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_blessing.htm">Obedience and Blessing</a></b><br>The passage underscores the principle that obedience to God's commandments results in His blessings.
