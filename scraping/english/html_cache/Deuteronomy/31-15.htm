The "tent" refers to the Tent of Meeting, a sacred place where Moses would communicate with God. This tent was a precursor to the Tabernacle and later the Temple, symbolizing God's presence among His people. The appearance of the LORD here underscores His direct involvement and guidance in the transition of leadership from Moses to Joshua.<p><b>in a pillar of cloud</b><br>The pillar of cloud is a recurring symbol of God's presence and guidance throughout the Israelites' journey in the wilderness. It first appeared in <a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>, leading the Israelites by day. This cloud provided protection, guidance, and a visible assurance of God's presence. It also served as a barrier between the Israelites and the Egyptians during the crossing of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19-20</a>). The cloud's presence at the tent emphasizes God's continued guidance and protection as Israel prepares to enter the Promised Land.<p><b>and the cloud stood over the entrance to the tent</b><br>The cloud standing over the entrance signifies God's approval and readiness to communicate. This positioning indicates a moment of divine instruction and revelation, as seen in other instances where God speaks to Moses (<a href="/exodus/33-9.htm">Exodus 33:9-11</a>). The entrance of the tent is a place of meeting and revelation, symbolizing the threshold between the divine and the human.
