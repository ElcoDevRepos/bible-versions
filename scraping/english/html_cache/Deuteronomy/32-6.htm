The term "repay" suggests a covenant relationship where Israel is expected to respond to God's faithfulness with obedience. The words "foolish and senseless" indicate a lack of spiritual discernment and understanding, often used in wisdom literature to describe those who reject God's ways (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). Historically, this reflects Israel's repeated cycle of disobedience despite God's deliverance and provision, as seen throughout the wilderness journey and the period of the Judges.<p><b>Is He not your Father and Creator?</b><br>Here, God is identified as both "Father" and "Creator," emphasizing His role in Israel's origin and sustenance. The fatherhood of God implies a relationship of care, authority, and discipline (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>). As Creator, God is the source of life and order, echoing the creation narrative in Genesis. This dual role underscores Israel's dependence on God and their obligation to honor Him. The fatherhood of God is further developed in the New Testament, where believers are called children of God through faith in Christ (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>).<p><b>Has He not made you and established you?</b><br>This phrase reinforces God's active role in forming and sustaining the nation of Israel. "Made" refers to God's creative power, not only in the physical sense but also in shaping Israel as a people set apart for His purposes (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). "Established" suggests stability and security, which God provided through the covenant and the giving of the Law. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are described as a new creation in Christ (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>) and are established in faith (<a href="/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who delivered them from Egypt and established them as His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering a song to the Israelites as a reminder of God's faithfulness and their obligations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience of Moses' song, described here as "foolish and unwise" for their lack of gratitude and faithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_song_of_moses.htm">The Song of Moses</a></b><br>A poetic passage in <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>, serving as a witness against Israel for their future disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where Moses delivers this message, as the Israelites prepare to enter the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_god's_fatherhood.htm">Recognizing God's Fatherhood</a></b><br>Acknowledge God as our Father and Creator, deserving of our respect and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_foolishness_and_ingratitude.htm">Avoiding Foolishness and Ingratitude</a></b><br>Reflect on areas in life where we may be acting foolishly or ungratefully towards God&#8217;s provisions and guidance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_identity_in_god.htm">Understanding Our Identity in God</a></b><br>Embrace our identity as God&#8217;s children, which calls us to live in a way that honors Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_remembrance.htm">The Importance of Remembrance</a></b><br>Regularly remember and recount God&#8217;s past faithfulness to strengthen our faith and commitment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responding_to_god's_discipline.htm">Responding to God&#8217;s Discipline</a></b><br>View God&#8217;s discipline as an expression of His love, intended to guide us back to righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_32_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 32:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_32_6_Israel_s_bond_with_God.htm">How does Deuteronomy 32:6 highlight Israel's relationship with God as Father?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Israel_s_spiritual_state_2.htm">What does "foolish and unwise" reveal about Israel's spiritual condition?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Recognizing_God_as_Father_daily.htm">How can we recognize God as our "Father" in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Deut_32_6_Prov_1_7_on_wisdom.htm">Connect Deuteronomy 32:6 with Proverbs 1:7 on wisdom and understanding.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_stay_wise_in_our_faith_journey.htm">How can we avoid being "foolish and unwise" in our faith journey?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Deut_32_6_God_s_role_as_Father_Creator.htm">How does Deuteronomy 32:6 challenge our understanding of God's role as a Father and Creator?
