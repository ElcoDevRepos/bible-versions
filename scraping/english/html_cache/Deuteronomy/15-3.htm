This distinction is significant because the Israelites were bound by specific laws and covenants that did not apply to foreigners. The permission to collect debts from foreigners reflects the different social and legal obligations that existed between Israelites and non-Israelites. This practice underscores the importance of community and covenant within Israel, as well as the recognition of different economic relationships with those outside the covenant. In a broader biblical context, this distinction can be seen in the way Israel was called to be a separate and holy nation (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>), yet also to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<p><b>but you must forgive whatever your brother owes you</b><br>The term "brother" here refers to fellow Israelites, emphasizing the familial and covenantal relationship among the people of God. The command to forgive debts every seven years, known as the Year of Release or Shemitah, is rooted in the principle of mercy and social justice. This practice ensured that poverty and debt did not become permanent conditions within the community, reflecting God's concern for the poor and marginalized (<a href="/deuteronomy/15.htm">Deuteronomy 15:1-2</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate forgiveness and release found in Jesus Christ, who cancels the debt of sin for believers (<a href="/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13-14</a>). This principle of forgiveness and release is echoed in the New Testament teachings on forgiveness and the Jubilee (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>), highlighting the continuity of God's redemptive plan throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws to the Israelites before they enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving instructions on how to live in community and obedience to God's laws.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners</a></b><br>Non-Israelites living among or interacting with the Israelites, subject to different rules regarding debt.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites are about to enter, where these laws will be applied.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbatical_year.htm">Sabbatical Year</a></b><br>The seventh year in which debts are to be forgiven among the Israelites, emphasizing mercy and community support.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/principle_of_mercy.htm">Principle of Mercy</a></b><br>The command to forgive debts among brothers highlights God's desire for mercy and compassion within the community of believers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_support.htm">Community Support</a></b><br>By forgiving debts, the Israelites were to ensure that no one among them was perpetually burdened, fostering a supportive and caring community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/distinction_in_relationships.htm">Distinction in Relationships</a></b><br>The distinction between how debts are handled with foreigners versus fellow Israelites underscores the special bond and responsibility within the family of faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reflection_of_god's_forgiveness.htm">Reflection of God's Forgiveness</a></b><br>Just as God forgives our spiritual debts, we are called to forgive others, reflecting His grace and mercy in our relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_stewardship.htm">Practical Stewardship</a></b><br>This law encourages wise financial stewardship and generosity, reminding believers to manage resources in a way that honors God and supports others.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_15_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 15:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_15_3_Israelite_vs_foreigner_debts.htm">How does Deuteronomy 15:3 differentiate between debts of Israelites and foreigners?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Financial_lessons_from_Deut_15_3.htm">What principles of financial stewardship can be drawn from Deuteronomy 15:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Deut_15_3_Jesus_on_forgiveness.htm">How does Deuteronomy 15:3 relate to Jesus' teachings on forgiveness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Deut_15_3_guide_us_with_non-believers.htm">In what ways can Deuteronomy 15:3 guide our interactions with non-believers today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Deut_15_3_on_community_duty.htm">How can Deuteronomy 15:3 influence our understanding of community responsibility?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Deut_15_3_and_Christian_forgiveness.htm">How does Deuteronomy 15:3 align with the concept of forgiveness in Christianity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_differentiate_debt_for_foreigners.htm">Why does Deuteronomy 15:3 differentiate between foreign and fellow Israelites regarding debt?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_shaped_Deut_15_3_s_instructions.htm">What historical context influenced the instructions in Deuteronomy 15:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_15.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_debt.htm">What does the Bible say about Christian debt?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_didn't_debt_cancellation_ruin_economy.htm">Deuteronomy 15:1&#8211;2 prescribes canceling debts every seven years&#8212;how would this not destabilize an ancient economy?

These were never subject to the sabbatical release because they were commercial, not covenantal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;But you must forgive whatever your brother owes you&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Here &#8220;brother&#8221; means a fellow Israelite&#8212;someone inside the covenant community (<a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35-37</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Forgive&#8221; is literal: wipe the slate clean. The creditor must not demand repayment after the seventh year begins (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-2.htm">Deuteronomy 15:2</a>).<p>&#8226; This command fostered unity and compassion, reflecting God&#8217;s own deliverance of Israel from Egypt (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-15.htm">Deuteronomy 15:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross-reference: The prophet Jeremiah later enforced this very law, commanding Judean nobles to free Hebrew servants, showing the ongoing relevance of the release principle (<a href="/jeremiah/34-8.htm">Jeremiah 34:8-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What this reveals about God&#8217;s heart</b><p>&#8226; God cares for the vulnerable; He legislated mercy so the poor would not be crushed by perpetual debt (<a href="/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>; <a href="/psalms/146-7.htm">Psalm 146:7-9</a>).<p>&#8226; He also values personal responsibility; Israelites still had six years to repay, and foreigners remained accountable for their obligations (<a href="/proverbs/22-7.htm">Proverbs 22:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The balance of compassion and justice points to the character of God who is both gracious and righteous (<a href="/psalms/85-10.htm">Psalm 85:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>New Testament echoes and practical application</b><p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; parable of the unmerciful servant amplifies the principle: forgiven people must forgive others (<a href="/matthew/18-23.htm">Matthew 18:23-35</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul urged believers to &#8220;owe no one anything, except to love one another&#8221; (<a href="/romans/13-8.htm">Romans 13:8</a>), reiterating financial integrity and brotherly love.<p>&#8226; Modern believers can:<p>&#8211; Show tangible mercy to fellow Christians burdened by debt or need (<a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17-18</a>).<p>&#8211; Honor contracts with non-believers ethically and promptly (<a href="/2_corinthians/8-21.htm">2 Corinthians 8:21</a>).<p>&#8211; Remember that our ultimate release from sin&#8217;s debt came at Christ&#8217;s cross, motivating generous, forgiving hearts (<a href="/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/15-3.htm">Deuteronomy 15:3</a> makes a clear, covenant-based distinction: Israelites could collect debts from non-Israelites, yet they were commanded to cancel debts owed by their fellow covenant members at the close of every seventh year. This safeguarded national compassion without undermining legitimate external commerce. The verse showcases God&#8217;s blend of mercy toward His people and justice toward all, a pattern ultimately fulfilled in Jesus and still instructive for believers who seek to live with both integrity and grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A foreigner</span>; a stranger of another nation, having no internal social relation to Israel (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5db;&#x5b0;&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span>), as distinguished from the stranger who lived among them and had claims on their benevolence (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>). Of such they might exact a debt, without regard to the year of release. "This rule breathes no hatred of foreigners, but simply allows the Israelites the right of every creditor to demand his debts and enforce the demand upon foreigners, even in the sabbatical year. There was no severity in this, because foreigners could get their ordinary income in the seventh year as well as in any other" (Keil). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/15-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">You may collect</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1490;&#1468;&#1465;&#1425;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(tig&#183;g&#333;&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5065.htm">Strong's 5065: </a> </span><span class="str2">To drive, to tax, harass, tyrannize</span><br /><br /><span class="word">something from a foreigner,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1499;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#601;&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5237.htm">Strong's 5237: </a> </span><span class="str2">Foreign, alien</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1462;&#1469;&#1498;&#1464;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;e&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3027.htm">Strong's 3027: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">must forgive</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1461;&#1445;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#353;&#183;m&#234;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect Jussive - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8058.htm">Strong's 8058: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fling down, to jostle, to let alone, desist, remit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">whatever</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your brother</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1495;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#238;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_251.htm">Strong's 251: </a> </span><span class="str2">A brother, )</span><br /><br /><span class="word">owes you.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(yih&#183;yeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/deuteronomy/15-3.htm">Deuteronomy 15:3 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/deuteronomy/15-3.htm">Deuteronomy 15:3 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/deuteronomy/15-3.htm">Deuteronomy 15:3 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/deuteronomy/15-3.htm">Deuteronomy 15:3 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/deuteronomy/15-3.htm">Deuteronomy 15:3 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/deuteronomy/15-3.htm">Deuteronomy 15:3  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/deuteronomy/15-3.htm">Deuteronomy 15:3 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/deuteronomy/15-3.htm">Deuteronomy 15:3 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/deuteronomy/15-3.htm">Deuteronomy 15:3 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/deuteronomy/15-3.htm">Deuteronomy 15:3 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/deuteronomy/15-3.htm">OT Law: Deuteronomy 15:3 Of a foreigner you may exact it: (Deut.
