It signifies the initial yield of the harvest, which is to be dedicated to God as an acknowledgment of His provision and sovereignty. This practice is a tangible expression of gratitude and trust in God's continued blessing. The offering of firstfruits is also a reminder of the Israelites' dependence on God for sustenance and prosperity. In the New Testament, the idea of firstfruits is used metaphorically to describe Christ as the "firstfruits" of those who have fallen asleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>), indicating His resurrection as the first of many to come.<p><b>from the soil of the land that the LORD your God is giving you</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine gift of the Promised Land to the Israelites. The land is not merely a possession but a fulfillment of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It underscores the idea that the land is a divine inheritance, not earned by the Israelites' own efforts but given by God's grace. This gift requires a response of obedience and faithfulness, as seen in the requirement to offer the firstfruits. The land's fertility and productivity are seen as blessings from God, reinforcing the covenant relationship.<p><b>and put them in a basket</b><br>The act of placing the firstfruits in a basket signifies preparation and intentionality in worship. It reflects the care and reverence with which the Israelites are to approach God. The basket, a common item in ancient agrarian societies, symbolizes the gathering and offering of the best of what one has. This act of offering is not just a ritual but a heartfelt expression of devotion and acknowledgment of God's provision.<p><b>Then go to the place the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for His Name</b><br>This phrase points to the centralization of worship in a specific location chosen by God, which would later be identified as Jerusalem, where the Temple was built. The "dwelling for His Name" signifies God's presence among His people, a concept that is central to Israelite worship. This requirement underscores the importance of unity and communal worship in the life of Israel. It also foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who is described as the ultimate dwelling of God among men (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), and the establishment of a new covenant where believers themselves become the temple of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the law, God's chosen people, who are being instructed on how to live in the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land given by God to the Israelites, a place of abundance and blessing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/firstfruits.htm">Firstfruits</a></b><br>The initial yield of the harvest, symbolizing the best and the first portion dedicated to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who provides the land and its produce.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_place_of_god's_name.htm">The Place of God's Name</a></b><br>Refers to the central place of worship, which would later be established in Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_principle_of_firstfruits.htm">The Principle of Firstfruits</a></b><br>The act of giving the firstfruits is a demonstration of faith and trust in God's provision.

God had already specified this principle (<a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10-11</a>).<p>&#8226; By setting aside the first portion, the worshiper publicly recognizes that the land, seed, rain, and increase all come from &#8220;the LORD your God,&#8221; not from human effort alone (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>; <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse assumes Israel is now settled &#8220;in the land.&#8221; Possession of Canaan is a covenant gift (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10</a>). The act of giving back part of that gift turns gratitude into visible obedience.<p>&#8226; For believers today, the principle stands: honor the Lord with the &#8220;first&#8221; of every blessing (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/16-2.htm">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>), trusting Him to supply the rest (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Put them in a basket</b><p>The instruction adds a practical detail that carries spiritual weight.<p>&#8226; A basket gathered fresh produce securely and neatly. Worship was not meant to be careless; it was organized, intentional, and respectful (<a href="/1_corinthians/14-40.htm">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>).<p>&#8226; The basket&#8217;s limited space symbolized giving a representative portion rather than the entire harvest&#8212;an offering, not a tax (<a href="/deuteronomy/26-4.htm">Deuteronomy 26:4</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Transporting a filled basket involved personal effort. Worshiper and offering arrived together, underscoring that God desires the giver&#8217;s heart more than the gift itself (<a href="/micah/6-6.htm">Micah 6:6-8</a>; <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then go to the place the LORD your God will choose as a dwelling for His Name</b><p>The journey with the basket mattered as much as the produce inside it.<p>&#8226; God, not the people, selected the worship site (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5-7</a>). Eventually that &#8220;place&#8221; became Jerusalem and the temple (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-16.htm">2 Chronicles 7:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Centralized worship kept Israel from drifting into regional idols (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-30.htm">Deuteronomy 12:30-31</a>). Holiness and unity were protected when everyone came to one God-appointed location (<a href="/psalms/122-1.htm">Psalm 122:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;dwelling for His Name&#8221; reminds us that God&#8217;s presence is tied to His revealed character. Approaching on His terms foreshadows coming to Him through the one Mediator He Himself provides&#8212;fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-24.htm">Hebrews 9:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Today the &#8220;place&#8221; is no longer a physical temple but God&#8217;s people gathered in Christ&#8217;s name (<a href="/1_peter/2-4.htm">1 Peter 2:4-5</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>). Yet the principle remains: worship is designed by God, not invented by us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/26-2.htm">Deuteronomy 26:2</a> calls Israel to:<p>1. Recognize God&#8217;s ownership by bringing the earliest and best of every harvest.<p>2. Prepare that tribute thoughtfully&#8212;symbolized by a carefully packed basket.<p>3. Present it where and how God commands, acknowledging His right to direct worship.<p>The verse teaches wholehearted gratitude, intentional giving, and humble submission to God&#8217;s chosen way of meeting with His people&#8212;truths that still shape faithful worship today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The first of all the fruit of the earth.</span> (On the law of the firstfruits, see <a href="/numbers/18-12.htm">Numbers 18:12</a>;
