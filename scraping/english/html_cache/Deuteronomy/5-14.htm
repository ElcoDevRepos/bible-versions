This day is set apart as holy, emphasizing rest and worship. The Sabbath is a covenant sign between God and Israel (<a href="/exodus/31-16.htm">Exodus 31:16-17</a>), symbolizing trust in God's provision. It foreshadows the rest found in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>), who offers spiritual rest to believers.<p><b>on which you must not do any work&#8212;</b><br>The prohibition of work on the Sabbath underscores the importance of rest and reliance on God. It serves as a reminder of God's deliverance from Egypt (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>) and a call to trust in His provision. This commandment highlights the need for physical and spiritual renewal, pointing to the ultimate rest in Christ (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><b>neither you, nor your son or daughter,</b><br>The inclusion of family members emphasizes the communal aspect of the Sabbath. It is a time for families to come together in worship and rest, reinforcing the importance of spiritual leadership within the household. This reflects the broader biblical theme of generational faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>).<p><b>nor your manservant or maidservant,</b><br>The command extends to servants, highlighting the principle of equality and compassion. It reflects God's concern for all people, regardless of social status, and anticipates the New Testament teaching of equality in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). This provision ensures that everyone experiences rest and renewal.<p><b>nor your ox or donkey or any of your livestock,</b><br>Including animals in the Sabbath rest demonstrates God's care for all creation. It reflects the biblical principle of stewardship and compassion for animals (<a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>). This provision ensures that the Sabbath is a day of rest for all living beings, aligning with the creation mandate to care for the earth.<p><b>nor the foreigner within your gates,</b><br>The inclusion of foreigners underscores the universal nature of God's covenant. It reflects the biblical theme of hospitality and care for the stranger (<a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a>). This provision anticipates the New Testament message of the gospel being for all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>so that your manservant and maidservant may rest as you do.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes equality and justice, ensuring that servants receive the same rest as their masters. It reflects God's concern for social justice and the dignity of all people. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to love and serve one another (<a href="/john/13-34.htm">John 13:34-35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who delivered God's commandments, including the Sabbath law, to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God who received the law and were commanded to observe the Sabbath.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath.htm">Sabbath</a></b><br>A day of rest on the seventh day, instituted by God as a sign of His covenant with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants_and_livestock.htm">Servants and Livestock</a></b><br>Included in the command to rest, highlighting the comprehensive nature of the Sabbath rest.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners</a></b><br>Non-Israelites living among the Israelites, also commanded to observe the Sabbath rest.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_rest.htm">The Purpose of Rest</a></b><br>The Sabbath is a gift from God, designed for physical rest and spiritual renewal.
