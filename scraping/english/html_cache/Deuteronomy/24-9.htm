As a result, God struck her with leprosy. This event underscores the seriousness of speaking against God's chosen leaders and the consequences of rebellion. It highlights God's justice and the importance of maintaining respect for divinely appointed authority. The incident with Miriam also serves as a warning to the Israelites to remain faithful and obedient to God's commands.<p><b>on the journey</b><br>The journey refers to the Israelites' exodus from Egypt and their subsequent wanderings in the wilderness. This period was marked by numerous challenges and tests of faith, as God led His people towards the Promised Land. The journey was not just a physical trek but also a spiritual journey, where the Israelites learned to trust and depend on God. The wilderness experience is often seen as a time of purification and preparation for entering into God's promises.<p><b>after you came out of Egypt</b><br>The exodus from Egypt is a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing deliverance and redemption. It is a powerful demonstration of God's power and faithfulness to His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The liberation from slavery in Egypt is a type of the greater deliverance from sin that is fulfilled in Jesus Christ. Just as the Israelites were freed from physical bondage, believers are freed from spiritual bondage through Christ's sacrifice.
