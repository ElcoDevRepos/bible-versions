The term "Israelite brothers" emphasizes the familial and covenantal relationship among the people of Israel, highlighting the severity of the crime as it disrupts the unity and trust within the community. Kidnapping is seen as a violation of the commandment to love one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>) and is contrary to the principles of justice and righteousness that God established for His people. The act of kidnapping is not only a personal offense but also a communal one, as it threatens the social fabric of the nation.<p><b>whether he treats him as a slave or sells him</b><br>This clause indicates the potential outcomes of kidnapping, either forcing the victim into slavery or selling them. Both actions are considered grave offenses, as they dehumanize the individual and violate the God-given dignity of every person. The reference to slavery connects to the broader biblical narrative of the Israelites' own experience of slavery in Egypt, which God delivered them from (<a href="/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2</a>). This historical context underscores the importance of justice and freedom within the Israelite community. The prohibition against such actions reflects God's desire for His people to live in a society marked by justice and compassion.<p><b>the kidnapper must die</b><br>The prescribed punishment for kidnapping is the death penalty, reflecting the seriousness of the crime. This severe consequence serves as a deterrent and underscores the value of human life and freedom. The death penalty for kidnapping aligns with other capital offenses in the Mosaic Law, such as murder (<a href="/exodus/21-12.htm">Exodus 21:12</a>) and adultery (<a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>), which also threaten the moral and social order of the community. The emphasis on justice in this commandment points to God's holiness and His requirement for His people to uphold His standards.<p><b>So you must purge the evil from among you</b><br>This phrase highlights the communal responsibility to maintain purity and righteousness within the nation. The concept of purging evil is a recurring theme in Deuteronomy (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5, 17</a>:7), emphasizing the need to remove sin and its influence to preserve the holiness of the community. This directive reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience to His laws is essential for His continued blessing and presence among them. The call to purge evil also foreshadows the ultimate purification from sin through Jesus Christ, who came to take away the sins of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are receiving the laws and commandments through Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/kidnapper.htm">Kidnapper</a></b><br>An individual who unlawfully seizes and carries away a person by force or fraud, particularly for the purpose of enslavement or sale.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader who delivered God's laws to the Israelites, including the laws in Deuteronomy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, where the Israelites are to live according to God's laws.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_community.htm">Covenant Community</a></b><br>The collective body of Israelites bound by the covenant with God, emphasizing communal responsibility and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sanctity_of_human_life_and_freedom.htm">Sanctity of Human Life and Freedom</a></b><br>This law underscores the value God places on human life and personal freedom.

Justice in Israel was not mob vengeance but orderly adjudication under God&#8217;s law.<p>&#8226; The use of &#8220;brothers&#8221; reminds Israel that their community is family, making betrayal all the more heinous (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>; <a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whether he treats him as a slave or sells him</b><p>&#8226; Motive does not mitigate guilt.

Corporate responsibility required decisive action so that the nation remained a holy people (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Purging evil pointed forward to Christ, who ultimately bore sin outside the camp (<a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>) and calls His church to disciplined purity (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience brings blessing; tolerating injustice invites judgment (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15&#8211;25</a>; <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/24-7.htm">Deuteronomy 24:7</a> unequivocally condemns kidnapping, equating it with a capital offense because it violates the God-given dignity and freedom of a covenant brother. Whether the abductor intends personal servitude or financial profit, the crime demands the severest penalty to protect the community and uphold God&#8217;s holiness. By insisting that Israel purge such evil, the Lord calls His people then&#8212;and believers today&#8212;to honor human life, pursue justice, and guard the purity of the covenant community.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">If a man be found stealing (a soul) any of his brethren . . .</span>--See <a href="/exodus/21-16.htm" title="And he that steals a man, and sells him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.">Exodus 21:16</a>.<p>(8,9) <span class= "bld">Take heed in the plague of leprosy. . . .

There might be a tendency to relax the law in the case of great or wealthy persons. But this would be felt keenly by poorer lepers, who could obtain no exemption.
