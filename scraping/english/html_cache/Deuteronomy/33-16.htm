The "choice gifts" refer to the agricultural bounty, including grain, wine, and livestock, which were seen as direct blessings from God. This reflects the covenantal promise made to the patriarchs, particularly Abraham, about the land flowing with milk and honey (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). The land's fertility is a sign of divine favor and fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>and with the favor of Him who dwelt in the burning bush</b><br>This phrase connects to the theophany experienced by Moses in <a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3</a>, where God revealed Himself in the burning bush. The "favor" indicates divine presence and blessing, emphasizing God's ongoing relationship with His people. The burning bush symbolizes God's holiness, power, and the mystery of His presence. This reference serves as a reminder of God's covenantal faithfulness and His role as the deliverer of Israel. It also foreshadows the coming of Christ, who embodies God's presence among His people (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>May these rest on the head of Joseph</b><br>Joseph, one of the twelve sons of Jacob, receives a special blessing. His tribes, Ephraim and Manasseh, are often given prominence in Israel's history. The "head of Joseph" signifies leadership and honor, reflecting Joseph's role in saving his family during the famine (<a href="/genesis/45-7.htm">Genesis 45:7</a>). This blessing acknowledges Joseph's faithfulness and God's providence in his life, serving as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate savior and provider for His people.<p><b>and crown the brow of the prince of his brothers</b><br>Joseph is referred to as the "prince of his brothers," highlighting his preeminence among the tribes. This title reflects his leadership and the double portion of inheritance given to his descendants. The imagery of a crown signifies authority and honor, pointing to the future leadership roles of Ephraim and Manasseh in Israel's history.
