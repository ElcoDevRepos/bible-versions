The inclusion of a judge indicates a system of governance where legal and spiritual matters were intertwined. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israel, where God was seen as the ultimate authority. The judge, often a leader or elder, was tasked with interpreting and applying the Law. This system ensured that decisions were made in accordance with divine principles. The phrase "at that time" suggests a dynamic leadership structure, adaptable to the needs of each generation. This anticipates the later establishment of the Sanhedrin, a council of judges and priests, during the Second Temple period. The New Testament echoes this structure in passages like <a href="/matthew/23-2.htm">Matthew 23:2-3</a>, where Jesus acknowledges the authority of the teachers of the Law.<p><b>Inquire of them,</b><br>The act of inquiring implies seeking wisdom and guidance, recognizing the authority of those appointed by God. This reflects a humble submission to God's established order. In the broader biblical narrative, inquiry of God or His representatives is a recurring theme, seen in figures like David (<a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>) and Jehoshaphat (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-3.htm">2 Chronicles 20:3-4</a>). It underscores the importance of seeking divine direction in decision-making. This practice is mirrored in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to seek wisdom from God (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p><b>and they will give you a verdict in the case.</b><br>The verdict represents a binding decision, reflecting the authority vested in the priests and judge. This process ensured that justice was administered according to God's Law, maintaining social order and righteousness. The Hebrew word for "verdict" can also mean "sentence" or "judgment," emphasizing the finality and seriousness of the decision. This system prefigures the ultimate judgment of Christ, who is described as the righteous judge in <a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a>. The concept of a divine verdict is also seen in <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>, where the dead are judged according to their deeds.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levitical_priests.htm">Levitical Priests</a></b><br>Members of the tribe of Levi, set apart for religious duties and to serve as mediators between God and the Israelites.
