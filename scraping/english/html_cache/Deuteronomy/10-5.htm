The mountain is traditionally identified as Jebel Musa in the Sinai Peninsula. This descent signifies Moses' role as mediator between God and Israel, highlighting the importance of obedience and the renewal of the covenant after the incident of the golden calf (Exodus 32). It underscores the theme of repentance and restoration.<p><b>and placed the tablets in the ark I had made</b><br>The tablets refer to the Ten Commandments, which are central to the covenant between God and Israel. The ark, known as the Ark of the Covenant, was a sacred chest made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold (<a href="/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10-22</a>). It symbolizes God's presence and His covenant with His people. The act of placing the tablets in the ark signifies the permanence and sacredness of God's law. The ark later resided in the Holy of Holies within the Tabernacle and eventually the Temple, representing God's throne on earth.<p><b>as the LORD had commanded me</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Moses' obedience to God's instructions, a recurring theme in Deuteronomy. It reflects the importance of following divine commands precisely, as seen throughout the Pentateuch. This obedience is a model for Israel and later believers, illustrating the principle that God's instructions are to be followed without deviation.<p><b>and there they have remained</b><br>The enduring presence of the tablets in the ark signifies the lasting nature of God's covenant and law. This phrase suggests the continuity and faithfulness of God to His promises. The ark's presence among the Israelites served as a constant reminder of God's covenant and His requirements for holiness and obedience. The permanence of the tablets also points to the eternal nature of God's word, as echoed in <a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>, "Your word, LORD, is eternal; it stands firm in the heavens."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites and the mediator between God and His people.
