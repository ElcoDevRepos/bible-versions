The preservation of clothing symbolizes God's care and sustenance, ensuring that their basic needs were met despite the harsh conditions. This miracle underscores the theme of divine faithfulness and provision, which is a recurring motif throughout the Bible. It also serves as a reminder of God's ability to provide for His people in seemingly impossible situations, reflecting His sovereignty and power. This provision can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides for the spiritual needs of believers, ensuring they are clothed in righteousness.<p><b>and your feet did not swell</b><br>The reference to the Israelites' feet not swelling is another testament to God's protection and care. In the harsh desert environment, where long journeys on foot could lead to physical ailments, this preservation is significant. It indicates God's concern for the physical well-being of His people, ensuring they were able to continue their journey without hindrance. This can be connected to other scriptures where God promises to sustain and uphold His people, such as <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>, which speaks of those who hope in the Lord renewing their strength. It also reflects the idea of spiritual endurance, where believers are sustained by God's grace through life's trials.<p><b>during these forty years</b><br>The forty-year period in the wilderness is significant in biblical history, representing a time of testing, discipline, and reliance on God. This period was a result of the Israelites' disobedience and lack of faith, as seen in <a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>, where God decrees that the generation that doubted Him would not enter the Promised Land. The number forty often symbolizes a period of trial and preparation in the Bible, as seen in the forty days of rain during the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>) and Jesus' forty days of fasting in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). This time in the wilderness was meant to teach the Israelites dependence on God and prepare them for life in the Promised Land, much like how believers are refined through trials to grow in faith and reliance on Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who delivered God's laws and instructions, including the message in Deuteronomy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who wandered in the wilderness for forty years due to their disobedience and lack of faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert region where the Israelites wandered after their exodus from Egypt, a place of testing and reliance on God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision.htm">God's Provision</a></b><br>The miraculous sustenance provided by God, including clothing that did not wear out and feet that did not swell.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/forty_years.htm">Forty Years</a></b><br>The period of time the Israelites spent in the wilderness, symbolizing a generation and a time of testing and preparation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_provision.htm">God's Faithfulness in Provision</a></b><br>God provided for the Israelites' physical needs in miraculous ways, demonstrating His faithfulness and care.

That signals supernatural intervention, not clever desert tailoring.<p>&#8226; The lesson: if God can preserve cloth, He can preserve the people wearing it. Jesus echoes this in <a href="/matthew/6-28.htm">Matthew 6:28-30</a> when He points to lilies: &#8220;If God so clothes the grass of the field&#8230; will He not much more clothe you?&#8221; Trust is the appropriate response.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and your feet did not swell</b><p>&#8226; Blister-free, edema-free feet over miles of sand and rock highlight physical preservation. <a href="/deuteronomy/2-7.htm">Deuteronomy 2:7</a> says the Lord watched over every step; <a href="/psalms/105-37.htm">Psalm 105:37</a> testifies that &#8220;there was none feeble among His tribes&#8221; when they left Egypt.<p>&#8226; Healthy feet meant they could keep moving toward the Promised Land.

Remembering that reliability fuels present obedience and confident hope for every step still to come.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee.</span>--The Jewish commentators say that it grew with their growth, from childhood to manhood. We cannot say that anything miraculous is certainly intended, though it is not impossible. It may mean that God in His providence directed them to clothe themselves in a manner suitable to their journey and their mode of life, just as He taught them how to make and clothe His own tabernacle with various fabrics and coverings of skin. This tabernacle, which was God's dwelling, was (like the Temple) a figure of man. (Comp. <a href="/ezekiel/16-10.htm" title="I clothed you also with broidered work, and shod you with badgers' skin, and I girded you about with fine linen, and I covered you with silk.">Ezekiel 16:10</a> : "I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with badgers' skin.")<p><span class= "bld">Neither did thy foot swell.</span>--Just as those who were to die in the wilderness could not live, so those who were to enter Canaan were preserved in health through the journey thither. It seems allowable to point out the spiritual interpretation of the passage also. If "the way" that God leads any of His children through this present evil world should seem long, and should entail constant need of renewal and cleansing in His sight, He provides us with "raiment that waxes not old," in the everlasting righteousness of His Son, and also in the good works which He prepares for us to walk in--that "fine linen which is the righteousness of saints." He also says of those that wait on the Lord that they shall "walk, and not faint" (<a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm" title="But they that wait on the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.">Isaiah 40:31</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - As the manna furnished by God's creative power saved them from hunger, so by God's providence and care their raiment was marvelously kept from decay, and they had not to go barefoot from their sandals being worn out. Waxed not old upon thee; literally, <span class="accented">d</span>i<span class="accented">d not fall away</span>, <span class="accented">waste away from upon thee</span>. This cannot mean that such was the abundant supply of raiment to the Israelites in the Arabian desert, that there was no need for them to wear garments rent and tattered from long use, as they had large flocks and herds whence a sufficient supply of wool and leather could be obtained, and there were among them skilled artificers, by whom these could be made into articles of clothing (Rosenm&uuml;ller, J. D. Michaelis, etc.). For, as Knobel observes, "This were something too insignificant beside the miraculous manna; and besides, this does not lie in the expression, which rather intimates that the clothes upon them were not worn out nor fell from them in rags, because God gave them a marvelous durability." At the same time, there is no reason to suppose that the Israelites did not make use of such supplies as were within their reach for purposes of clothing, any more than that they lived only on manna during the forty years of their wandering. Still less need we resort to such fanciful suppositions as that the garments of the Israelitish children expanded as they grew up, like the shells of snails - which is the notion of some of the Jewish rabbins, and adopted by some of the Christian Fathers (see Deyling, 'Obss. Sacc.,' II. 17. p. 247). <span class="cmt_word">Neither did thy foot swell.</span> The verb here is found in only one other passage (<a href="/nehemiah/9-21.htm">Nehemiah 9:21</a>), where this passage is repeated; and the meaning is doubtful.

In <a href="/deuteronomy/29-5.htm">Deuteronomy 29:5</a>, the shoe or sandal is specially mentioned in the same connection as here. The verb, however, cannot mean tear or torn, neither does it mean swell; the idea involved is rather that of softening, or , melting or flowing; and the meaning here seems to be, "Thy foot did not get into a bruised and wounded state" - which would have been the case had their sandals not been preserved from breaking or being worn out. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/8-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Your clothing</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1502;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1448;&#1514;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1436;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;im&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
