Lending was often necessary due to the agrarian lifestyle, where a bad harvest could lead to financial hardship. The Mosaic Law provided guidelines to ensure fairness and compassion in lending practices. This reflects the broader biblical principle of loving one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>) and caring for the community. The term "neighbor" here implies a fellow Israelite, emphasizing the covenant community's mutual responsibility.<p><b>do not enter his house</b><br>This instruction highlights the respect for personal privacy and dignity. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a person's home was considered a sacred space, and entering without permission was a violation of personal boundaries. This commandment underscores the importance of respecting others' property and personal space, aligning with the broader biblical theme of treating others with respect and kindness (<a href="/matthew/7-12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>).<p><b>to collect security</b><br>The concept of "security" refers to a pledge or collateral given to ensure the repayment of a loan. In biblical times, this could include items like clothing or tools essential for daily living. The law here protects the borrower from potential exploitation or humiliation. By prohibiting the lender from entering the borrower's home, it ensures that the borrower retains dignity and control over the situation. This principle is echoed in other parts of the Mosaic Law, such as <a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26-27</a>, which instructs lenders to return a poor man's cloak by sunset. This reflects God's concern for justice and mercy, themes central to the prophetic writings (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience receiving the laws, God's chosen people in the Old Testament.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbor.htm">Neighbor</a></b><br>Refers to fellow Israelites, emphasizing community and mutual respect.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lending_and_security.htm">Lending and Security</a></b><br>The act of lending and the practice of taking collateral, which is regulated by this law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The context in which these laws are given, as the Israelites prepare to enter and settle in it.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_personal_space.htm">Respect for Personal Space</a></b><br>The command not to enter a neighbor's house to collect security emphasizes respecting personal boundaries and dignity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_in_financial_dealings.htm">Compassion in Financial Dealings</a></b><br>This law encourages lenders to act with compassion and understanding, recognizing the humanity of the borrower.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_trust.htm">Community and Trust</a></b><br>By not intruding into a neighbor's home, the law fosters trust and community cohesion, essential for a healthy society.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_concern_for_justice.htm">God's Concern for Justice</a></b><br>This law reflects God's desire for justice and fairness in all aspects of life, including economic transactions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_love_for_neighbors.htm">Practical Love for Neighbors</a></b><br>The application of this law is a practical expression of loving one's neighbor, as it requires consideration and empathy.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_24_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 24:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deuteronomy_24_10_Respect_others_how.htm">How does Deuteronomy 24:10 guide us in treating others with respect?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Deut_24_10_on_God_s_care_for_dignity.htm">What does Deuteronomy 24:10 reveal about God's concern for personal dignity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Deut_24_10_in_finance.htm">How can we apply Deuteronomy 24:10 in modern financial transactions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Deut_24_10_to_Jesus_love_teachings.htm">How does Deuteronomy 24:10 connect with Jesus' teachings on loving neighbors?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Deut_24_10_principles_for_community_today.htm">What principles from Deuteronomy 24:10 can improve our community relationships today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Deut_24_10_on_lending_and_compassion.htm">What does Deuteronomy 24:10 teach about lending practices and compassion?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Deut_24_10_God_s_care_for_dignity.htm">How does Deuteronomy 24:10 reflect God's concern for human dignity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_protect_borrower_s_home_in_Deut_24_10.htm">Why is the borrower&#8217;s home protected in Deuteronomy 24:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_24.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_christian_sociology.htm">What defines Christian sociology?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_do_old_and_new_covenants_differ.htm">How do the Old and New Covenants differ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/proof_israelites_inherited_cities_vineyards.htm">Joshua 24:13 - Is there any archaeological proof supporting the idea that the Israelites inherited cities and vineyards they did not build or plant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/who_were_the_old_testament_prophets.htm">Who were the Old Testament prophets in the Bible?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Deuteronomy 24:10 Mean</div><b>When you lend anything to your neighbor</b><p>&#8220;&#8203;When you lend anything to your neighbor&#8230;&#8221;

He might stand outside and summon the debtor to produce his pledge, but he was not insolently to enter the house and lay hands on any part of the owner's property. To stand outside and call is still a common mode of seeking access to a person in his own house or apartment among the Arabs, and is regarded as the only respectful mode. There would be thus a mitigation of the severity of the exaction, the tendency of which would be to preserve good feeling between the parties. If the debtor was needy, and being such could give in pledge only some necessary article, such as his upper garment in which he slept at night, the pledge was to be returned ere nightfall, that the man might sleep in his own raiment, and have a grateful feeling towards his creditor. In many parts of the East, with the Arabs notably, it is customary for the poor to sleep in their outer garment. "During the day the poor while at work can and do dispense with this outside raiment, but at night it is greatly needed, even in summer. This furnishes a good reason why this sort of pledge should be restored before night" (Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' 1:192, 500). The earlier legislation (<a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25, 26</a>) is evidently assumed here as well known by the people. <span class="cmt_word">It shall be righteousness unto thee</span> (see on Deuteronomy 6:25). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/24-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you lend</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;a&#353;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5383.htm">Strong's 5383: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lend, borrow on security, interest</span><br /><br /><span class="word">anything</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1488;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#353;&#183;&#353;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4859.htm">Strong's 4859: </a> </span><span class="str2">A loan</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to your neighbor,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1469;&#1506;&#1458;&#1498;&#1464;&#8234;&#8236;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#601;&#183;r&#234;&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
