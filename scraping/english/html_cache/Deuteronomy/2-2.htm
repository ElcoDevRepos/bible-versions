It refers to a period after the Israelites had wandered in the wilderness for 40 years due to their disobedience and lack of faith. The timing is significant as it marks a transition from wandering to preparing to enter the Promised Land. This moment is pivotal in the history of Israel, as it signifies a new beginning and a fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>the LORD said to me</b><br>The phrase emphasizes direct communication from God to Moses, highlighting Moses' role as a prophet and leader. This divine communication underscores the authority of the message and the importance of obedience to God's instructions.

This communication is consistent with other instances where God provides guidance, such as in <a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a> when God calls Moses from the burning bush.
