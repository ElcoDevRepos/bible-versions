In the context of ancient Israel, holiness was not just a moral or ethical state but a status conferred by God. The Israelites were to be distinct from the surrounding nations in their worship, lifestyle, and obedience to God's commandments. This idea of being set apart is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be holy (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). The holiness of Israel was both a privilege and a responsibility, requiring them to live according to God's laws.<p><b>The LORD your God has chosen you</b><br>The concept of divine election is central here. God's choice of Israel was not based on their merit or size but on His sovereign will and love (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>). This election is a recurring theme throughout the Bible, illustrating God's initiative in establishing a covenant relationship with His people. In the New Testament, this theme is expanded to include all who believe in Christ, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/1-4.htm">Ephesians 1:4-5</a>, where believers are described as chosen before the foundation of the world.<p><b>to be a people for His prized possession</b><br>The term "prized possession" indicates a special treasure or valued property. In the ancient Near Eastern context, a king's treasured possession was something he valued above all else. This reflects the intimate and cherished relationship God desired with Israel. This concept is mirrored in <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>, where the church is described as a "chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God&#8217;s special possession," highlighting the continuity of God's plan from Israel to the church.<p><b>out of all peoples on the face of the earth.</b><br>This phrase underscores the universal scope of God's sovereignty and His particular choice of Israel among all nations. It highlights the uniqueness of Israel's calling and mission to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>). This selection was not for Israel's benefit alone but was intended to bring blessing to all nations, a promise first given to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>. The ultimate fulfillment of this promise is found in Jesus Christ, through whom all nations are blessed (<a href="/galatians/3-8.htm">Galatians 3:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are being addressed in this passage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who has chosen the Israelites as His special possession.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites are preparing to enter and possess as promised by God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant.htm">Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between God and the Israelites, where they are to follow His commandments and He will be their God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/chosen_and_set_apart.htm">Chosen and Set Apart</a></b><br>Understand that being chosen by God is a call to holiness and distinctiveness in the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_choice.htm">God's Sovereign Choice</a></b><br>Recognize that God's choice is based on His love and purpose, not on human merit or achievement.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_and_purpose.htm">Identity and Purpose</a></b><br>Embrace your identity as part of God's people, with a purpose to reflect His character and glory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_the_covenant.htm">Faithfulness to the Covenant</a></b><br>Live in obedience to God's commands as a response to His covenantal love and faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/universal_application.htm">Universal Application</a></b><br>While this passage speaks directly to Israel, it also foreshadows the inclusion of all believers as God's chosen people through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_7_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 7:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_7_6_Our_identity_as_chosen_today.htm">How does Deuteronomy 7:6 define our identity as God's chosen people today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Duties_of_being_holy_to_the_LORD.htm">What responsibilities come with being "a people holy to the LORD"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Chosen_believers_identity_in_NT.htm">How does being "chosen" relate to New Testament teachings on believers' identity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Living_holiness_daily_how.htm">How can we live out our holiness in daily life and decisions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_do_we_show_we_re_His_treasure.htm">What actions demonstrate our commitment to being "His treasured possession" now?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_Israel_chosen_in_Deut_7_6.htm">Why does Deuteronomy 7:6 emphasize Israel as a chosen people above others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Deut_7_6_vs_God_s_universal_love.htm">How does Deuteronomy 7:6 align with the concept of God's universal love?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_was_Deuteronomy_7_6_written.htm">What historical context led to the writing of Deuteronomy 7:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_7.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/does_psalm_117_conflict_with_deut._7_6.htm">Does Psalm 117 conflict with other biblical passages that imply exclusivity or a chosen people, such as Deuteronomy 7:6, and if so, how? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_collectivism.htm">What defines collectivism?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_was_israel_chosen_by_god.htm">Why was Israel chosen by God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_was_kristallnacht_significant.htm">What was the significance of Kristallnacht?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Deuteronomy 7:6 Mean</div><b>For you are a people holy to the LORD your God.</b><p>God declares Israel &#8220;holy,&#8221; meaning He literally set them apart for His own purposes.
