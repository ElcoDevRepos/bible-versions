The term "foreigner" refers to non-Israelites living among them, often without the same rights and privileges. This directive reflects God's character as loving and just, and it aligns with the broader biblical theme of loving one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>). The call to love the foreigner is a reminder of the universal nature of God's love and the expectation that His people reflect that love in their actions. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches the parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-37</a>), illustrating that love transcends ethnic and cultural boundaries.<p><b>since you yourselves were foreigners in the land of Egypt</b><br>This phrase serves as a reminder of the Israelites' own history and experiences. Having been foreigners and slaves in Egypt, they understood the hardships and vulnerabilities associated with being outsiders. This historical context is crucial, as it grounds the command in empathy and shared experience. The Israelites' deliverance from Egypt is a central narrative in the Old Testament, symbolizing God's salvation and faithfulness (<a href="/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40-42</a>). It also prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who offers salvation to all people, regardless of their background (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>). By recalling their past, the Israelites are encouraged to treat foreigners with the same grace and kindness that God extended to them. This principle of remembering one's past to inform present behavior is a recurring theme in Scripture, urging believers to act justly and love mercy (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites who delivered God's laws and commandments, including the exhortation in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-19.htm">Deuteronomy 10:19</a>.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were once foreigners and slaves in Egypt, and to whom the command to love the foreigner is given.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites lived as foreigners and were enslaved before God delivered them through Moses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigners.htm">Foreigners (Gerim)</a></b><br>Non-Israelites living among the Israelites, often vulnerable and without the same rights as native-born citizens.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites were entering, where they were to practice justice and love towards foreigners.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_past.htm">Understanding Our Past</a></b><br>Recognize that the Israelites' past as foreigners in Egypt is a reminder of their dependence on God's grace and provision.
