In the context of Deuteronomy, Moses is reminding the Israelites that their worship should be directed solely to Yahweh, who delivered them from Egypt. This aligns with the first commandment, which calls for exclusive devotion to God. The concept of God being our praise is echoed in the Psalms, where worship and adoration are central themes (e.g., <a href="/psalms/22-3.htm">Psalm 22:3</a>).<p><b>and He is your God</b><br>This reaffirms the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The declaration "He is your God" is a reminder of the personal and communal relationship that the Israelites have with Yahweh. It underscores the idea of God as a personal deity who is actively involved in the lives of His people. This relationship is foundational to the identity of Israel as a nation chosen by God, as seen in <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a> and reiterated throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>who has done for you these great and awesome wonders</b><br>This phrase refers to the miraculous acts God performed on behalf of the Israelites, particularly during the Exodus from Egypt and their journey through the wilderness. These wonders include the plagues, the parting of the Red Sea, and the provision of manna. Such acts are not only historical events but also serve as signs of God's power and faithfulness. They are often recalled in later scriptures, such as in <a href="/nehemiah/9-17.htm">Nehemiah 9:17</a>, to remind the people of God's past deliverance and to encourage trust in His future provision.<p><b>that your eyes have seen</b><br>This emphasizes the firsthand experience of the Israelites with God's miraculous deeds. The phrase underscores the importance of eyewitness testimony in establishing the truth of God's actions. It also serves as a call to remember and pass down these experiences to future generations, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9</a>.
