It marks a turning point where God reaffirms His covenant with Israel and establishes new directives for worship and service.<p><b>the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi</b><br>The Levites were chosen by God to serve in a special capacity, distinct from the other tribes of Israel. This setting apart is significant as it underscores the principle of divine election and service. The Levites did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes, emphasizing their unique role in spiritual matters.<p><b>to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD</b><br>The ark was the most sacred object in Israel, symbolizing God's presence and covenant with His people. The Levites, specifically the Kohathites, were tasked with its transportation, highlighting the holiness and reverence required in handling sacred objects. This duty foreshadows the role of Christ as the ultimate mediator of God's presence.<p><b>to stand before the LORD to serve Him</b><br>This phrase indicates the Levites' role in ministering before God, which included duties in the tabernacle and later the temple. Their service was a continual reminder of the need for mediation between God and humanity, pointing to Jesus Christ as the ultimate High Priest.<p><b>and to pronounce blessings in His name</b><br>The Levites were responsible for blessing the people, a role that involved invoking God's favor and presence. This practice is rooted in the Aaronic blessing found in <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a>, which emphasizes God's grace and peace.

The appointment of the tribe of Levi for service took place in connection with that of Aaron and his sons to the priesthood (<a href="/numbers/3-4.htm">Numbers 3:4</a>). The service to which the tribe of Levi was chosen appertained to the tribe as such, including the priests as well as the non-priestly Levites, though parts of it specially belonged to the one class rather than the other. Thus the <span class="cmt_word">bearing of the ark</span> was the special duty of non-priestly Levites, the Kohathites (<a href="/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4</a>, etc.; <a href="/1_chronicles/15-15.htm">1 Chronicles 15:15</a>); but was also, on peculiarly solemn occasions, discharged by the priests (<a href="/joshua/3-6.htm">Joshua 3:6</a>, etc.; Joshua 6:6; 8:33; <a href="/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3, 6</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">To stand before the Lord to minister</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto him</span> was the special function of the priests (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/40-46.htm">Ezekiel 40:46</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15, 16</a>); but as the service of the Levites was also a sacred service, they too are said to stand to minister before the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-7.htm">Deuteronomy 18:7</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/23-6.htm">2 Chronicles 23:6</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/29-4.htm">2 Chronicles 29:4, 5, 11, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To bless in his name</span> does not mean, as some propose, to invoke the Name of God, or to praise his Name, but to pronounce a benediction or invoke a blessing on the people in his Name (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/6-18.htm">2 Samuel 6:18</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/16-2.htm">1 Chronicles 16:2</a>). This was the special duty of the priests (cf. <a href="/numbers/6-22.htm">Numbers 6:22-27</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/23-13.htm">1 Chronicles 23:13</a>), but might also be done by others (as by David), and in this benediction the Levites might join (<a href="/2_chronicles/25-27.htm">2 Chronicles 25:27</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1460;&#1431;&#1493;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;hi&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
