Partiality, or favoritism, is condemned throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>, <a href="/james/2.htm">James 2:1-9</a>). In the ancient Near Eastern context, justice systems often favored the wealthy and powerful, but Israel was called to a higher standard, reflecting God's own impartial nature (<a href="/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>).<p><b>hear both small and great alike.</b><br>This phrase underscores the equal treatment of all individuals, regardless of their social or economic status. In a society where class distinctions were pronounced, this command ensured that the rights of the poor and marginalized were protected (<a href="/exodus/23-3.htm">Exodus 23:3</a>, <a href="/proverbs/22-2.htm">Proverbs 22:2</a>). It reflects the biblical theme of God's concern for justice and equity (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>).<p><b>Do not be intimidated by anyone,</b><br>Judges were to exercise courage and integrity, resisting pressure from influential figures. This echoes the biblical narrative where leaders like Joshua were encouraged to be strong and courageous (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>). The fear of man can lead to compromised justice, but reliance on God provides the strength to uphold righteousness (<a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>).<p><b>for judgment belongs to God.</b><br>This statement acknowledges that ultimate justice is divine. Judges serve as God's representatives, administering His justice on earth (<a href="/psalms/82.htm">Psalm 82:1-4</a>). It reflects the theocratic nature of Israel's governance, where God was the supreme authority. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Christ is depicted as the ultimate judge (<a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a>).<p><b>And bring to me any case too difficult for you, and I will hear it.&#8221;</b><br>Moses, as the leader and prophet, served as the final arbiter in complex cases, prefiguring Christ as the ultimate mediator and judge (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). This system ensured that justice was not hindered by human limitations. It also highlights the importance of seeking wisdom and guidance in difficult situations, a theme prevalent in the wisdom literature (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The leader of the Israelites who is delivering God's commandments and instructions to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The chosen people of God, receiving guidance on how to live justly and righteously.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judges.htm">Judges</a></b><br>- Appointed leaders among the Israelites tasked with making fair and impartial decisions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>- The land God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which the Israelites are preparing to enter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>- The ultimate judge and authority, whose standards of justice are to be upheld by the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/impartiality_in_judgment.htm">Impartiality in Judgment</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to judge fairly, without favoritism, reflecting God's just nature.

St. Paul in <a href="/context/romans/13-1.htm" title="Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.">Romans 13:1-4</a>, which is, again, only an expansion of this sentence. For the latter part of this verse comp. <a href="/context/exodus/18-22.htm" title="And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for yourself, and they shall bear the burden with you.">Exodus 18:22-26</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall not respect persons</span>; literally, <span class="accented">look at</span> or <span class="accented">regard aces</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. ye shall not deal partially, favoring the one party rather than the other (comp. <a href="/exodus/23-2.htm">Exodus 23:2, 3</a>; <a href="/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>); the small as well as the great were to be heard, and neither for favor nor from fear were they to pervert justice. <span class="cmt_word">The judgment is God's</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. appointed by God and administered in his name, the judge acting for God and by his authority, and being answerable to him (comp. <a href="/2_chronicles/19-6.htm">2 Chronicles 19:6</a>). Hence the phrases, "to inquire of God," "to bring before God" (<a href="/exodus/18-15.htm">Exodus 18:15, 19</a>; <a href="/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>; <a href="/exodus/22-8.htm">Exodus 22:8</a>, etc.) phrases still in use among the Arabs for a summoning to judicial trial. In the case of a matter coming before the judges which they found it beyond their power to decide, they were to bring it before Moses as a superior authority (see <a href="/exodus/18-26.htm">Exodus 18:26</a>) "Some think there were certain causes reserved to the cognizance of Moses; but the contrary appears by these words, that all manner of causes were brought before the judges; and they, not the people, brought such causes before Moses as they found too hard for them to determine. So that they, not the person whose cause it was, judged of the difficulty of the cause. See Selden, lib. 1. "De Synedriis, cap. 16." (Bishop Patrick). <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/1-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Show no partiality</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;ak&#183;k&#238;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5234.htm">Strong's 5234: </a> </span><span class="str2">To regard, recognize</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in judging;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(bam&#183;mi&#353;&#183;p&#257;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124;
