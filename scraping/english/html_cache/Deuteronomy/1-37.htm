The phrase highlights God's displeasure with Moses due to the people's rebellion at Kadesh Barnea, where they refused to enter the Promised Land. This anger is linked to Moses' own failure at Meribah (<a href="/numbers/20-10.htm">Numbers 20:10-12</a>), where he struck the rock instead of speaking to it as God commanded. This incident underscores the seriousness of disobedience and lack of faith, even for a leader like Moses. It also reflects the collective responsibility and consequences of the community's actions.<p><b>and He said, &#8220;Not even you shall enter the land.</b><br>God's pronouncement that Moses would not enter the Promised Land serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of disobedience. Despite Moses' pivotal role in leading the Israelites out of Egypt and through the wilderness, his failure to uphold God's holiness at Meribah resulted in this severe judgment. This decision emphasizes God's justice and the importance of obedience to His commands. It also foreshadows the need for a perfect mediator, pointing to Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfills the law and leads His people into the ultimate Promised Land. Moses' exclusion from entering Canaan serves as a type of the law, which cannot bring salvation, highlighting the necessity of grace through faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to lead His people out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

As the spies presumed to investigate the route and order of the conquest, a matter of Divine guidance, so Moses presumed to alter the prescribed order for the miracle in Kadesh. Like transgressions incurred like penalties. The fault for which the people had suffered could not be overlooked in the leader. (See also Notes on <a href="/context/deuteronomy/3-23.htm" title="And I sought the LORD at that time, saying,">Deuteronomy 3:23-28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-49.htm" title="Get you up into this mountain Abarim, to mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel for a possession:">Deuteronomy 32:49</a>.)

This parenthetical reference to himself was probably thrown in by Moses for the purpose of preparing for what he was about to say respecting Joshua, in whom the people were to find a leader after he himself was gone. It may be noted also that Moses distinguishes between the anger of the Lord against him, and the wrath which broke forth upon the people - a distinction which is aptly preserved in the Authorized Version by the words "was wroth" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5e4;</span>) and "was angry" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">For your sakes</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because of you</span>, <span class="accented">on accent of</span> you.
