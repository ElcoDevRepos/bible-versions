The context is the aftermath of war, where women from conquered nations could be taken as wives. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of integrating captives into society, though with specific regulations to protect the dignity of the woman. The displeasure here is not specified, but it implies a change of heart or circumstances that lead to the man no longer desiring the marriage.<p><b>you are to let her go wherever she wishes.</b><br>This command emphasizes the woman's autonomy after the dissolution of the marriage. Unlike other ancient cultures where women could be treated as property, this directive ensures her freedom. It reflects a measure of compassion and respect for her rights, allowing her to choose her own path without further obligation to the man who initially took her captive. This provision is unique in its time, highlighting a moral standard that values personal freedom.<p><b>But you must not sell her for money</b><br>This prohibition against selling the woman underscores the principle that she is not to be treated as a commodity. In the ancient world, slavery and the selling of captives were common practices. However, this law sets Israel apart by forbidding such actions, ensuring that the woman is not exploited for financial gain. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of justice and protection for the vulnerable.<p><b>or treat her as a slave,</b><br>The instruction not to treat her as a slave further reinforces her dignity and humanity. It prevents the man from reducing her status to that of a servant or property, which was a common fate for captives in other cultures. This reflects the biblical principle of equality before God and the inherent value of every individual, regardless of their background or circumstances.<p><b>since you have dishonored her.</b><br>The term "dishonored" acknowledges the impact of the man's actions on the woman's life. By taking her as a wife and then rejecting her, he has disrupted her life and potentially damaged her reputation. This acknowledgment of dishonor serves as a moral reminder of the consequences of his actions and the need for restitution. It aligns with the biblical call for repentance and making amends for wrongs committed, emphasizing the importance of integrity and responsibility in relationships.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_men.htm">Israelite Men</a></b><br>The passage addresses Israelite men who might take a captive woman as a wife.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/captive_woman.htm">Captive Woman</a></b><br>A woman taken as a captive during warfare, who may become a wife to an Israelite man.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, who is conveying God's laws to the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The context of these laws is the Israelites' future life in the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_covenant.htm">God's Covenant</a></b><br>The overarching theme of Deuteronomy is the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_human_dignity.htm">Respect for Human Dignity</a></b><br>The law in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-14.htm">Deuteronomy 21:14</a> underscores the importance of treating all individuals with dignity and respect, even in difficult circumstances like war.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/protection_of_the_vulnerable.htm">Protection of the Vulnerable</a></b><br>This passage provides a legal framework to protect a vulnerable person (the captive woman) from exploitation and abuse, reflecting God's concern for justice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/marriage_as_a_covenant.htm">Marriage as a Covenant</a></b><br>The passage highlights the seriousness of marriage as a covenant, not to be entered into or dissolved lightly.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice_and_mercy.htm">God's Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>The law reflects God's justice and mercy, ensuring that even those who are powerless have rights and protections.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_context_and_timeless_principles.htm">Cultural Context and Timeless Principles</a></b><br>While the cultural context of ancient Israel differs from today, the principles of justice, mercy, and respect for human dignity remain relevant.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_21_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 21:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_21_14_Dignity_in_treatment.htm">How does Deuteronomy 21:14 emphasize the importance of treating others with dignity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_don_t_sell_her_teach_on_value.htm">What does "you must not sell her for money" teach about human value?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Deut_21_14_to_modern_commitments.htm">How can we apply Deuteronomy 21:14 to modern relationships and commitments?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_this_verse_link_to_NT_love.htm">In what ways does this verse connect to the New Testament teachings on love?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Deut_21_14_God_s_justice_compassion.htm">How does Deuteronomy 21:14 reflect God's justice and compassion in the Old Testament?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Deut_21_14_vs_modern_women_s_rights.htm">How does Deuteronomy 21:14 align with modern views on women's rights and autonomy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_were_captive_women_treated_as_in_Deut_21_14.htm">What historical context explains the treatment of captive women in Deuteronomy 21:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Interpret_Deut_21_14_with_NT_teachings.htm">How should Christians interpret Deuteronomy 21:14 in light of New Testament teachings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_truth_according_to_the_bible.htm">What does the Bible teach about money?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_would_god_allow_war_captives_as_brides.htm">Deuteronomy 21:10&#8211;14: Why would a just God permit the taking of war captives as brides under these conditions? </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_deut._14_22-27_contradict_tithing.htm">Deuteronomy 14:22-27 says tithes can be exchanged for money if travel is too far.

Scripture acknowledges human frailty yet still holds the man accountable.<p>&#8226; The law never excuses fickle love but regulates it so the woman is protected (see <a href="/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s concern for the vulnerable appears throughout the Law, from widows and orphans (<a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22</a>) to sojourners (<a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you are to let her go wherever she wishes</b><p>Her freedom is non-negotiable.
