This location is significant as it marks the culmination of their 40-year journey through the wilderness. The phrase underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to bring the Israelites to a land flowing with milk and honey, despite their previous disobedience and the challenges faced along the way.<p><b>Sihon king of Heshbon</b><br>Sihon was the Amorite king who ruled over Heshbon, a significant city located east of the Jordan River. The defeat of Sihon is recorded in <a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-31</a>, where the Israelites requested passage through his land, but Sihon refused and attacked them. This victory was crucial as it demonstrated God's power and faithfulness in delivering Israel from their enemies. The conquest of Sihon's territory became part of the inheritance for the tribes of Reuben and Gad.<p><b>and Og king of Bashan</b><br>Og was the king of Bashan, a region known for its fortified cities and giants, as mentioned in <a href="/deuteronomy/3.htm">Deuteronomy 3:1-11</a>. The defeat of Og was another testament to God's might and the fulfillment of His promises. Og's kingdom was given to the half-tribe of Manasseh. The victory over Og is often cited as an example of God's ability to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles, reinforcing the theme of divine intervention and support.<p><b>came out against us in battle</b><br>This phrase highlights the aggressive stance taken by these kings against the Israelites. Despite the Israelites' peaceful intentions, both Sihon and Og chose to confront them militarily. This reflects the broader theme of opposition faced by God's people throughout their history, and the necessity of relying on divine strength rather than human power.<p><b>but we defeated them</b><br>The defeat of Sihon and Og is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, symbolizing God's direct intervention and the fulfillment of His covenant promises. These victories are often referenced in later biblical texts (e.g., <a href="/psalms/135-10.htm">Psalm 135:10-12</a>) as reminders of God's faithfulness and power. The phrase also foreshadows the ultimate victory of Jesus Christ over sin and death, serving as a type of Christ's triumph over spiritual adversaries.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sihon,_king_of_heshbon.htm">Sihon, King of Heshbon</a></b><br>Sihon was the Amorite king who ruled over Heshbon.
