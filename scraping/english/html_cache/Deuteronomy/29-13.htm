The establishment of Israel as God's people is a recurring theme throughout the Pentateuch, highlighting God's sovereign choice and grace. This covenant is not just a legal agreement but a relational bond, signifying Israel's identity and purpose. The term "establish" indicates a firm and enduring relationship, suggesting permanence and divine intention. This echoes the covenantal language found in <a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>, where God calls Israel a "kingdom of priests and a holy nation."<p><b>and He may be your God</b><br>This phrase underscores the reciprocal nature of the covenant. God being their God implies not only worship and obedience from the Israelites but also God's protection, provision, and guidance. This relationship is central to the identity of Israel and is foundational to the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, which calls for exclusive devotion to the LORD. The phrase also points to the fulfillment of God's promises, as seen in the covenant with Abraham in <a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>, where God promises to be the God of Abraham and his descendants.<p><b>as He promised you</b><br>This highlights the faithfulness of God in keeping His promises. The promises referred to are those made to the patriarchs, which are foundational to Israel's understanding of their relationship with God. This assurance of God's faithfulness is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, providing hope and encouragement to the Israelites. It also serves as a reminder of God's unchanging nature, as seen in <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>, where God is described as one who does not lie or change His mind.<p><b>and as He swore to your fathers,</b><br>The mention of the patriarchs&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8212;anchors the covenant in historical promises. God's oath to the patriarchs is a solemn commitment, underscoring the seriousness and reliability of His word. This oath is first seen in <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a> with Abraham, reaffirmed to Isaac in <a href="/genesis/26-3.htm">Genesis 26:3-4</a>, and to Jacob in <a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>. The swearing of an oath by God is significant, as it indicates an unbreakable promise, further emphasized in <a href="/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13-18</a>, where God's oath is linked to His unchangeable purpose.<p><b>to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</b><br>This phrase connects the current generation of Israelites to their ancestral heritage, reinforcing their identity as heirs of the covenant. The patriarchs are central figures in Israel's history, representing the initial recipients of God's promises. The mention of these three patriarchs serves as a reminder of God's long-term plan and faithfulness across generations. It also points to the continuity of God's redemptive plan, which ultimately finds fulfillment in Jesus Christ, a descendant of Abraham, as highlighted in <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a> and <a href="/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>, where Christ is identified as the seed through whom the promises are realized.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is delivering God's message to the people in the plains of Moab.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who are about to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham,_isaac,_and_jacob.htm">Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarchs to whom God made His covenant promises, establishing a lineage through which He would bless the nations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/plains_of_moab.htm">Plains of Moab</a></b><br>The location where Moses is addressing the Israelites before they enter the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_renewal.htm">Covenant Renewal</a></b><br>The event where God reaffirms His covenant with the Israelites, emphasizing their identity as His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_identity.htm">Covenant Identity</a></b><br>Understand that being part of God's people is rooted in His promises and faithfulness, not our own merit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_of_god.htm">Faithfulness of God</a></b><br>Reflect on God's unwavering commitment to His promises, as seen in His dealings with the patriarchs and the nation of Israel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/continuity_of_god's_plan.htm">Continuity of God's Plan</a></b><br>Recognize the continuity of God's redemptive plan from the Old Testament to the New Testament, culminating in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/our_response_to_god's_covenant.htm">Our Response to God's Covenant</a></b><br>Consider how we, as believers, are called to live in response to being part of God's covenant people, embracing our identity in Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intergenerational_faithfulness.htm">Intergenerational Faithfulness</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of passing down the faith and God's promises to future generations, as seen in the lineage of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_29_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 29:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Deut_29_13_affirm_God_s_covenant.htm">How does Deuteronomy 29:13 affirm God's covenant with His people today?

"He takes all this trouble for the sake of establishing thee in His presence for a people" (Rashi). The people's part, as described in this verse, is only to accept the position. And thus the covenant of Deuteronomy 29 is brought into the closest similarity with that which is called the New Covenant in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:">Jeremiah 31:31</a>, <a href="/hebrews/8-8.htm" title="For finding fault with them, he said, Behold, the days come, said the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:">Hebrews 8:8</a>; the form of which is "I will" be to them a God, and "they shall" be to me a people. God undertakes for the people's part of the covenant as well as His own. In Deuteronomy the first half of the New Covenant appears here in Deuteronomy 29, "that He may be unto thee a God." The second part appears in <a href="/context/deuteronomy/30-6.htm" title="And the LORD your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.">Deuteronomy 30:6-8</a>, "The Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart . . . to love the Lord thy God."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/29-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and so that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;ma&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4616.htm">Strong's 4616: </a> </span><span class="str2">Purpose -- intent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">He may establish</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1511;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1501;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;q&#238;m-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6965.htm">Strong's 6965: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arise, stand up, stand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1465;&#1514;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Direct object marker &#124;
