In the context of ancient Israel, the law was central to the covenant relationship between God and His people. The children, who had not experienced the giving of the law at Sinai, needed to be taught its precepts. This reflects the broader biblical theme of generational teaching, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>, where parents are instructed to diligently teach their children. It underscores the responsibility of the community to ensure that the knowledge of God&#8217;s law is not lost.<p><b>will listen and learn to fear the LORD your God</b><br>Listening and learning are active processes that require engagement and commitment. The fear of the LORD is a recurring theme in the Bible, signifying reverence, awe, and obedience to God. <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a> states, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom," indicating that understanding and respecting God's authority is foundational to a righteous life. This fear is not about terror but about recognizing God's holiness and sovereignty, leading to a life of obedience and worship.<p><b>as long as you live in the land</b><br>The land of Canaan was a significant part of God's promise to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). Living in the land was contingent upon Israel's faithfulness to God's covenant. The land was not just a physical territory but a place where Israel was to live out its identity as God's chosen people. The conditional nature of this promise is echoed in later warnings and prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are tied to obedience and disobedience.<p><b>that you are crossing the Jordan to possess.</b><br>Crossing the Jordan River was a pivotal moment for the Israelites, marking the transition from their wilderness wanderings to entering the Promised Land. This event is detailed in <a href="/joshua/3.htm">Joshua 3-4</a>, where the miraculous crossing signifies God's faithfulness and power. The possession of the land was both a fulfillment of God's promise and a call to faithfulness. The Jordan River itself holds symbolic significance, representing a boundary between the old life and the new, much like the crossing of the Red Sea. This typology can be seen as a foreshadowing of the believer's journey from the bondage of sin to the freedom found in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is delivering his final instructions before they enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, preparing to enter the land promised to their ancestors.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/children.htm">Children</a></b><br>The next generation of Israelites who are to be taught the law.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whom the Israelites are to fear and obey.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land across the Jordan River that God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_teaching_the_next_generation.htm">The Importance of Teaching the Next Generation</a></b><br>The verse underscores the responsibility of parents and leaders to ensure that children understand and respect God's laws.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_the_lord_as_a_foundation.htm">Fear of the LORD as a Foundation</a></b><br>Instilling a reverent fear of the LORD is crucial for a life of obedience and wisdom.

Here the command is not optional&#8212;every child is included so that no generation drifts from covenant faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who do not know the law</b><p>These little ones lack firsthand knowledge. They have not witnessed Sinai or the wilderness miracles (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/11-2.htm">Deuteronomy 11:2</a>). Without intentional instruction, they will grow up spiritually ignorant. God therefore establishes a rhythm of public reading (31:10-12) to close that knowledge gap.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will listen and learn</b><p>&#8220;Faith comes by hearing&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>), so hearing precedes learning.<p>&#8226; Listening: the gathered assembly hears the actual words of God.<p>&#8226; Learning: minds are engaged, truth is absorbed, and worldview is shaped.<p>The same pattern surfaces in <a href="/nehemiah/8-2.htm">Nehemiah 8:2-3</a>, where Ezra reads the Law aloud and the people gain understanding.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to fear the LORD your God</b><p>The objective is not mere information but reverent relationship. &#8220;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). This awe-filled respect produces obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-2.htm">Deuteronomy 6:2</a>) and guards against idolatry (<a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14</a>). Genuine fear combines trust, love, and submission&#8212;an anchor for life in the land.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as long as you live in the land</b><p>Israel&#8217;s tenure in Canaan is tied to ongoing covenant fidelity (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-40.htm">Deuteronomy 4:40</a>; 30:20). Continuous hearing of the Law fosters sustained fear of God, which in turn secures prolonged blessing and stability (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-28.htm">Deuteronomy 12:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that you are crossing the Jordan to possess</b><p>The verse is spoken on the threshold of promise. God links their future occupation of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/1-2.htm">Joshua 1:2-3</a>) with faithful attention to His Word. Possession is a gift; retention depends on obedience. The Jordan crossing will mark a new chapter, but the Law remains their unchanging guide.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/31-13.htm">Deuteronomy 31:13</a> underscores God&#8217;s plan for generational discipleship. Public, regular reading of Scripture guarantees that even children unfamiliar with the Law can hear it, learn it, and develop a holy fear of the LORD. This reverence is the key to enjoying and retaining the inheritance God provides. By keeping Scripture central, every generation safeguards its walk with God and the blessings of His covenant.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/31-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then their children</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1438;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
