Chewing the cud and having a completely divided hoof are criteria for an animal to be considered clean. This reflects the broader Levitical laws found in <a href="/leviticus/11.htm">Leviticus 11</a>, which outline the dietary restrictions for the Israelites. These laws served to set Israel apart from other nations, emphasizing holiness and obedience to God.<p><b>you are not to eat the following:</b><br>The prohibition against eating certain animals underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands. It also highlights the concept of ritual purity, which was central to the Israelites' relationship with God. The dietary laws were a tangible way for the Israelites to demonstrate their commitment to God's covenant.<p><b>the camel, the rabbit, or the rock badger.</b><br>These specific animals are mentioned because they do not meet both criteria of chewing the cud and having a completely divided hoof. The camel, while chewing the cud, has a partially divided hoof. The rabbit and rock badger chew the cud but do not have hooves at all. These animals were common in the regions surrounding Israel, and their mention indicates a practical aspect of the law, as these animals were likely encountered by the Israelites.<p><b>Although they chew the cud,</b><br>Chewing the cud is a process where animals regurgitate and re-chew their food, which was seen as a sign of cleanliness and purity. This characteristic alone, however, is not sufficient for an animal to be considered clean according to the law. The emphasis on chewing the cud may symbolize meditation on God's word, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1-2.htm">Psalm 1:2</a>, where the righteous person meditates on the law day and night.<p><b>they do not have a divided hoof.</b><br>The divided hoof is another criterion for determining cleanliness. It symbolizes separation and distinction, much like the Israelites were to be distinct from other nations. The divided hoof can also be seen as a metaphor for walking in righteousness, as believers are called to walk in the ways of the Lord.<p><b>They are unclean for you,</b><br>Declaring these animals unclean reinforces the idea of separation and holiness. The concept of uncleanness is not just about physical impurity but also about spiritual and moral purity. In the New Testament, Jesus fulfills the law, and the focus shifts from external observance to internal purity (<a href="/mark/7-18.htm">Mark 7:18-23</a>).

Though New-Covenant believers are not bound by these dietary laws (<a href="/mark/7-19.htm">Mark 7:19</a>; <a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>), the passage still calls us to distinguish between what pleases the Lord and what does not (<a href="/ephesians/5-10.htm">Ephesians 5:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/14-7.htm">Deuteronomy 14:7</a> teaches that God&#8217;s people are to follow His precise instructions, not settling for partial obedience.
