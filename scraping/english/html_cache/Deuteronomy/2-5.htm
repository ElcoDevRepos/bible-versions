This command restrains Israel&#8217;s military impulse as they march toward Canaan.<p>- Similar restraint is seen when God later says, &#8220;Do not harass the Moabites&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9</a>) and &#8220;Do not provoke the Ammonites&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>).<p>- God often calls His people to peace when it serves His larger purposes; compare, &#8220;If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone&#8221; (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>).<p>- The directive reminds us that obedience is not merely about conquering territory but about honoring God&#8217;s specific instructions, even when the surrounding nations are kin to Israel through common ancestry (<a href="/genesis/36-1.htm">Genesis 36:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for I will not give you any of their land</b><p>- Israel&#8217;s claim to territory rests entirely on God&#8217;s promise; what He has not granted, they must not take.<p>- <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a> affirms that God &#8220;determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their lands,&#8221; highlighting His sovereign right to assign real estate to nations.<p>- In <a href="/joshua/24-4.htm">Joshua 24:4</a> God says, &#8220;I gave Esau the hill country of Seir as his possession,&#8221; underscoring that Edom&#8217;s borders are as divinely established as Israel&#8217;s.<p>- This teaches contentment with God-given inheritance and respect for boundaries, reflecting the eighth commandment&#8217;s principle against theft.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>not even a footprint</b><p>- The phrase drives home total prohibition: Israel may not occupy &#8220;even the space of a sole of the foot.&#8221;<p>- Earlier, God promised Israel, &#8220;Every place where the sole of your foot treads will be yours&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>), but here He draws a clear line&#8212;His promise does not include Edom.<p>- The specificity underscores that partial obedience (taking only a small portion) would still be disobedience.<p>- It also highlights God&#8217;s detailed care in fulfilling both promise and restriction; He governs large empires and tiny footprints alike.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as his possession</b><p>- Esau, Jacob&#8217;s twin, received Mount Seir by divine grant (<a href="/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8</a>). Though the birthright and covenant blessings flowed through Jacob, God still honored His word to Esau with a secure homeland.<p>- <a href="/genesis/27-39.htm">Genesis 27:39-40</a> shows Isaac blessing Esau with a dwelling &#8220;away from the richness of the earth,&#8221; yet God graciously designates a specific territory for him.<p>- <a href="/malachi/1-2.htm">Malachi 1:2-3</a> and <a href="/romans/9-10.htm">Romans 9:10-13</a> contrast God&#8217;s elective purposes in Jacob and Esau, but neither passage negates His faithfulness to temporal promises made to Esau&#8217;s lineage.<p>- This scene testifies that God keeps every promise&#8212;to friend and foe, to chosen and non-chosen alike&#8212;demonstrating His justice and integrity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/2-5.htm">Deuteronomy 2:5</a> teaches that Israel must respect Edom&#8217;s God-given land, abstaining from provocation or encroachment.

this, however, does not necessarily follow from the use of this word, for it has also the meaning to buy (comp. <a href="/hosea/3-2.htm">Hosea 3:2</a>, and the corresponding Arabic verb, <span class="accented">kara</span>, which in certain conjugations has the meaning to borrow or hire). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/2-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Do not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_408.htm">Strong's 408: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not</span><br /><br /><span class="word">provoke them,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(ti&#7791;&#183;g&#257;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hitpael - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1624.htm">Strong's 1624: </a> </span><span class="str2">To stir up (strife), engage in strife</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1440;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I will not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">give you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;et&#183;t&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5414.htm">Strong's 5414: </a> </span><span class="str2">To give, put, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">any of their land,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1469;&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8217;ar&#183;&#7779;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
