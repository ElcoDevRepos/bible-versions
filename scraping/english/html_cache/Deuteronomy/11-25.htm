It reflects the covenantal promise that God made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, ensuring that their descendants would inherit the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). Historically, this promise was fulfilled during the conquest of Canaan under Joshua's leadership (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>). Theologically, it underscores the sovereignty of God in granting success to His chosen people, a theme echoed in <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>, "If God is for us, who can be against us?"<p><b>the LORD your God will put the fear and dread of you upon all the land,</b><br>This statement highlights God's active role in instilling fear among the nations surrounding Israel. This divine intervention is seen in the accounts of Rahab in Jericho, who acknowledged the fear of Israel's God (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>). The fear and dread serve as a psychological warfare tactic, ensuring that Israel's enemies are demoralized before any physical confrontation. This concept is also seen in the Exodus narrative, where the fear of God fell upon the Egyptians (<a href="/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14-16</a>).<p><b>wherever you set foot,</b><br>This phrase signifies the extent of the land that the Israelites were to possess, as promised to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/13-17.htm">Genesis 13:17</a>). It implies a divine mandate for expansion and dominion, which is later echoed in the Great Commission given by Jesus to His disciples to spread the Gospel to all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). The physical act of setting foot symbolizes taking possession and authority, a concept that is spiritually applied in the New Testament to the believers' authority in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22-23</a>).<p><b>as He has promised you.</b><br>This final phrase reaffirms the faithfulness of God in keeping His promises. It connects to the overarching narrative of God's covenant with Israel, which is a central theme throughout the Pentateuch. The fulfillment of God's promises is a testament to His unchanging nature (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>) and serves as a type of the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises in Christ, who is the "Yes" and "Amen" of all God's promises (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>). This assurance of God's faithfulness encourages believers to trust in His promises today.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The leader of the Israelites who is delivering God's message to the people.
