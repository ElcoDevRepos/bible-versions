It is a continuation of Moses recounting the events that took place after the defeat of King Og of Bashan. The timing is significant as it marks a transition from the wilderness wanderings to the conquest of Canaan. This period is crucial in Israel's history as it represents the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>I also pleaded</b><br>Moses' act of pleading indicates a deep, earnest prayer or supplication. This reflects Moses' intimate relationship with God, characterized by open communication and heartfelt intercession. The Hebrew word used here can imply a sense of desperation or urgency, highlighting Moses' strong desire for God's favor. This moment is reminiscent of other instances where Moses interceded for the people, such as in <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>, demonstrating his role as a mediator.<p><b>with the LORD:</b><br>The use of "LORD" in all capital letters signifies the covenant name of God, Yahweh, emphasizing His eternal, self-existent nature and His special relationship with Israel. This covenantal aspect is crucial, as Moses' plea is based on the promises and faithfulness of God. The context of this plea is Moses' request to enter the Promised Land, which God ultimately denies due to Moses' earlier disobedience at Meribah (<a href="/numbers/20-12.htm">Numbers 20:12</a>).

By using the same phrase he has repeated throughout his speech (see <a href="/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9</a>; 3:18; 4:14), Moses signals, &#8220;Pay attention&#8212;this is just as real and historical as the battles I&#8217;ve cataloged.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The setting matters: Israel is camped in the plains of Moab, looking across the Jordan at Canaan (<a href="/numbers/22-1.htm">Numbers 22:1</a>). The people are poised for success, yet their leader still feels unfinished business with God.<p>&#8226; This timing also reminds us that earthly achievements never cancel spiritual longings; even after triumph, Moses knows he must seek the LORD afresh (cf. <a href="/psalms/90-17.htm">Psalm 90:17</a>, the prayer of Moses).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I also pleaded</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Pleaded&#8221; reveals the intensity of Moses&#8217; request; it is the same earnest intercession he showed for Israel in <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-13</a> and <a href="/numbers/11-2.htm">Numbers 11:2</a>. Prayer for others and prayer for self both call for holy boldness.<p>&#8226; The little word &#8220;also&#8221; hints that Moses has spent much of Deuteronomy urging, teaching, and interceding for the nation (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-21.htm">Deuteronomy 3:21-22</a>). Now, in addition, he brings his personal desire. God welcomes leaders who pour out personal petitions as freely as corporate ones.<p>&#8226; This plea underscores that no amount of lifetime service earns automatic privileges. Even Moses must ask; privilege in God&#8217;s kingdom is granted, never presumed (<a href="/james/4-2.htm">James 4:2</a>b).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Moses directs his plea to &#8220;the LORD,&#8221; the covenant name revealed in <a href="/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14-15</a> and celebrated for mercy and justice in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>. He knows exactly whom he addresses&#8212;a God both approachable and authoritative.<p>&#8226; By calling on the LORD, Moses models exclusive allegiance. Victories over pagan kings have not diluted his focus; he prays to the One who truly holds the land in His hand (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-14.htm">Deuteronomy 10:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase anticipates verses 24-25, where Moses appeals to God&#8217;s &#8220;greatness and strong hand.&#8221; Prayer starts by recognizing the character of the One we approach, then flows into specific requests.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/3-23.htm">Deuteronomy 3:23</a> captures a real moment late in Moses&#8217; life: fresh from military success, he marks the time, pours out a fervent personal plea, and directs it to the covenant LORD. The verse teaches that timing in prayer matters, fervency is welcomed, and requests must be anchored in a relationship with the one true God. Even the greatest servant stands as a petitioner, reminding us that access to blessings&#8212;and even to the Promised Land itself&#8212;remains entirely in God&#8217;s sovereign hands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) Here begins the second section according to the Jewish division, called "And I besought" (<span class= "ital">vaeth channan</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p>(23-28) <span class= "bld">And I besought the Lord at that time.</span>--Two things Moses is recorded to have asked <span class= "ital">for himself </span>in the story of the exodus. The first is written in <a href="/exodus/33-18.htm" title="And he said, I beseech you, show me your glory.">Exodus 33:18</a>, "I beseech thee shew me thy glory;" the second is before us here. "O Lord GOD (Adonai Jehovah), thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness and thy mighty hand . . . I pray thee let me go over and see the good land beyond Jordan." It would seem that Moses desired not so much to view the land (which, indeed, was granted him), but to see the greatness of Jehovah manifested in the conquest, as he had seen it in the victories over Og and Sihon. While we cannot allow for a moment that "the old fathers looked only for transitory promises" (see Notes on <a href="/deuteronomy/5-16.htm" title="Honor your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you; that your days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with you, in the land which the LORD your God gives you.">Deuteronomy 5:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/22-7.htm" title="But you shall in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to you; that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days.">Deuteronomy 22:7</a>), yet it is impossible not to feel in this prayer of Moses the pressure of the veil which hung over the unseen world before <span class= "ital">the </span>coming of our Saviour, who "brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel." Moses evidently did not realise that he might see the works of Jehovah and His glory still more clearly in the other world.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-29.</span> - Prayer <span class="accented">of Moses</span>. Moses knew that he was not to enter the Promised Land with the people; but, reluctant to relinquish the enterprise which he had so far conducted until he should see it successfully finished, he besought the Lord that at least he might be permitted to cross the Jordan, and see the goodly land. This prayer was presented probably just before Moses asked God to set a man over the congregation to be their leader to the promised land (<a href="/numbers/27-15.htm">Numbers 27:15-17</a>); for the command to give a charge to Joshua, in that office, follows immediately, as part of God's answer to Moses' request (ver. 28), and the expression "at that time" (ver. 23) points back to the charge of Moses to Joshua, as contemporaneous with the offering of his prayer. In this prayer Moses appeals to what he had already experienced of God's favor to him, in that he had begun to show him his greatness and his mighty power. The reference is to the victories already achieved over the Amorites; these were tokens of the Divine power graciously manifested to Israel, and Moses appeals to them as strengthening his plea for further favors (comp. the pleading, <a href="/exodus/33-12.htm">Exodus 33:12</a>, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/3-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1460;&#1430;&#1493;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;hi&#183;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Pronoun - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">time</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1461;&#1445;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6256.htm">Strong's 6256: </a> </span><span class="str2">Time, now, when</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I also pleaded</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1456;&#1495;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1463;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;e&#7791;&#183;&#7717;an&#183;nan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hitpael - Consecutive imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2603.htm">Strong's 2603: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bend, stoop in kindness to an inferior, to favor, bestow, to implore</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with the LORD:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/deuteronomy/3-23.htm">Deuteronomy 3:23 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/deuteronomy/3-23.htm">Deuteronomy 3:23 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/deuteronomy/3-23.htm">Deuteronomy 3:23 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/deuteronomy/3-23.htm">Deuteronomy 3:23 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/deuteronomy/3-23.htm">Deuteronomy 3:23 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/deuteronomy/3-23.htm">Deuteronomy 3:23  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/deuteronomy/3-23.htm">Deuteronomy 3:23 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/deuteronomy/3-23.htm">Deuteronomy 3:23 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/deuteronomy/3-23.htm">Deuteronomy 3:23 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/deuteronomy/3-23.htm">Deuteronomy 3:23 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/deuteronomy/3-23.htm">OT Law: Deuteronomy 3:23 I begged Yahweh at that time saying (Deut.
