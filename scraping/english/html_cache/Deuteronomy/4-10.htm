This location is central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel. Horeb is often associated with divine revelation and is a place where God manifested His presence. The event underscores the holiness and majesty of God, as well as the seriousness of His commandments. It is a reminder of the covenant established between God and His people, which is foundational to their identity and mission.<p><b>the LORD said to me, &#8220;Gather the people before Me to hear My words</b><br>This command emphasizes the importance of communal worship and instruction. God&#8217;s words are central to the life of the community, and Moses acts as the mediator between God and the people. The gathering of the people signifies unity and collective responsibility in receiving and obeying God's commandments. This moment foreshadows the New Testament gatherings of believers to hear the teachings of Jesus and the apostles, highlighting the continuity of God's revelation through His chosen messengers.<p><b>so that they may learn to fear Me all the days they live on the earth</b><br>The fear of the LORD is a recurring theme in Scripture, representing reverence, awe, and obedience to God. It is foundational for wisdom and understanding (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). This fear is not about terror but about recognizing God's holiness and authority. The phrase underscores the lifelong commitment required from the Israelites to live in accordance with God's will. It also points to the enduring nature of God's commandments, which are relevant for all generations.<p><b>and that they may teach them to their children.&#8221;</b><br>This highlights the importance of passing down the faith and God's commandments to future generations. It reflects the biblical principle of discipleship and the responsibility of parents to instruct their children in the ways of the LORD (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>). This teaching ensures the continuity of faith and obedience within the community. It also prefigures the Great Commission in the New Testament, where believers are called to make disciples of all nations, teaching them to observe all that Jesus commanded (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is recounting God's instructions to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel who gave the commandments and laws to His people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/horeb.htm">Horeb</a></b><br>Another name for Mount Sinai, where God gave the Ten Commandments to Moses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God who were delivered from Egypt and are receiving God's laws.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly.htm">The Assembly</a></b><br>The gathering of the Israelites to hear God's words and learn His commandments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_reverence.htm">The Importance of Reverence</a></b><br>Understanding the fear of the LORD is foundational to a life of faith.

It is noticeable that the giving of the Law appears to have taken place about fifty days after the Passover in Egypt. Jewish writers associate the Feast of Pentecost with the memory of the event. A similar association, and a contrast between the first and last Pentecost, appears to have been present to St. Paul's mind in 2 Corinthians 3. The law given at Sinai is the "ministration of death," and is contrasted with the "ministration of the Spirit"--the letter that killeth with the Spirit that giveth life. (Comp. also <a href="/context/galatians/4-24.htm" title="Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which engenders to bondage, which is Agar.">Galatians 4:24-26</a>, and <a href="/context/hebrews/12-18.htm" title="For you are not come to the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,">Hebrews 12:18-24</a>.) The word "specially" is not in the Hebrew of this verse.<p><span class= "bld">The day . . . in Horeb</span> is not only to be regarded as a <span class= "ital">special </span>subject of instruction; it is the root of the whole matter.<p><span class= "bld">Gather me the people together.</span>--The Greek here is <span class= "greekheb">???????????</span><span class= "ital">, </span>which might be paraphrased according to New Testament language, "Form a Church of this people," The "day of the assembly" alluded to in this and other passages (as <a href="/deuteronomy/10-4.htm" title="And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spoke to you in the mount out of the middle of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them to me.">Deuteronomy 10:4</a>) may be similarly paraphrased as "the day of the Church." It seems to be the source of the expression used by St. Stephen, "the Church in the wilderness" (<a href="/acts/7-38.htm" title="This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spoke to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give to us:">Acts 7:38</a>). Thus the analogy between Israel's receiving the <span class= "ital">letter </span>of the law at Sinai, and the gift of the Holy Spirit in Jerusalem is still further brought out.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Specially the day</span>.
