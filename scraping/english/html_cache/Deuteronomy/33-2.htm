As the leader and prophet of Israel, Moses is delivering a blessing to the tribes of Israel before his death. This context is significant as it marks the end of Moses' leadership and the transition to Joshua.<p><b>The LORD came from Sinai</b><br>Sinai is the mountain where God gave the Law to Moses, symbolizing God's covenant with Israel. This phrase recalls the theophany at Mount Sinai, where God revealed Himself in power and majesty. It emphasizes God's direct involvement with His people and His role as the lawgiver.<p><b>and dawned upon us from Seir;</b><br>Seir is a mountainous region associated with Edom, south of the Dead Sea. The imagery of "dawning" suggests a new beginning or revelation. This could symbolize God's guidance and presence as Israel journeyed through the wilderness, highlighting His protection and leadership.<p><b>He shone forth from Mount Paran</b><br>Mount Paran is located in the desert region between Sinai and Canaan. The shining forth indicates God's glory and presence. This phrase may also connect to the wilderness wanderings, where God led Israel with a pillar of cloud by day and fire by night, demonstrating His constant presence.<p><b>and came with myriads of holy ones,</b><br>The "myriads of holy ones" likely refer to angels, emphasizing God's majesty and the heavenly host that accompanies Him. This imagery underscores God's supreme authority and the divine support for Israel. It also connects to other biblical passages where God is depicted as the Lord of hosts.<p><b>with flaming fire at His right hand.</b><br>Flaming fire symbolizes God's holiness, judgment, and power. The right hand is often associated with strength and authority. This imagery reinforces the idea of God's powerful presence and His ability to protect and judge. It also foreshadows the New Testament depiction of Christ, who is seated at the right hand of God, embodying divine authority and power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who reveals Himself to His people and leads them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sinai.htm">Sinai</a></b><br>The mountain where God gave the Law to Moses, symbolizing God's covenant and revelation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/seir.htm">Seir</a></b><br>A mountainous region associated with Edom, representing God's expansive presence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_paran.htm">Mount Paran</a></b><br>A location in the wilderness, often associated with God's guidance and protection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/myriads_of_holy_ones.htm">Myriads of Holy Ones</a></b><br>Likely referring to angels or divine beings accompanying God, emphasizing His majesty and power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_revelation_and_covenant.htm">God's Revelation and Covenant</a></b><br>God's appearance from Sinai signifies His desire to reveal Himself and establish a covenant with His people.

"from his celestial seat, where myriads of angels surround his throne" (Rosenm&uuml;ller). The rendering "with," though that of the Targum, LXX., and Vulgate, cannot be retained; nor does Scripture represent God as attended by angels when he comes forth to manifest his glory to men. They are represented as surrounding his throne in heaven (<a href="/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>; <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>), as his servants awaiting his behest, and his host that do his pleasure (<a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>; <a href="/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2, 3</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-21.htm">Psalm 103:21</a>); and God is represented as dwelling in the midst of them (<a href="/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>). Hence he is represented here as coming forth from among them to manifest himself to his people. <span class="cmt_word">A fiery law</span>. There is a various reading here; instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5dd;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5ea;</span>, fire of law, many codices have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5ea;</span> in one word, and this is supported by the Samaritan text and other authorities, and is accepted by most critics and interpreters. It is a fatal objection to the textual reading that <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> is not a Semitic word, but one of Persian origin, brought by the Jews from Babylonia, and found only in the post-exilian books (<a href="/esther/1-8.htm">Esther 1:8, 19</a>; <a href="/esther/2-8.htm">Esther 2:8, 12</a>; <a href="/esther/3-8.htm">Esther 3:8, 14</a>; <a href="/esther/4-11.htm">Esther 4:11, 15</a>; <a href="/ezra/7-12.htm">Ezra 7:12, 21</a>; <a href="/ezra/8-36.htm">Ezra 8:36</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-9.htm">Daniel 2:9, 13, 15</a>; <a href="/daniel/6-5.htm">Daniel 6:5, 9, 13, 16</a>); and in them as applied to the Law of God only by heathens. It is, therefore, altogether improbable that this word should be found in any Hebrew writing anterior to the Captivity. Besides, what is the sense of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>, supposing <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5ea;</span> to mean "law?" The words cannot be rendered, as in the Authorized Version, by "fiery law;" they can only be rendered by "a fire, a law," or "a fire of law," and What either of these may mean it is not easy to see. The ancient versions vary here very considerably: LXX., <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: Vulgate, <span class="accented">fin dextera ejus ignea lex</span>; Targum of Onkelos, "Written by his right hand, from the midst of the fire, a law gave he to us;" Syriac, "With myriads of his saints at his right hand. He gave to them, and also caused all peoples to love them." The best Hebrew manuscripts have <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5ea;</span> as one word. The Masoretic note is, "The <span class="accented">Chatiph is</span> one word, and the <span class="accented">K'ri</span> two." The word <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5ea;</span> is best explained as a compound of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, fire, and <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d3;&#x5d0;</span>, an Aramaic word signifying to throw or dart; the Syriac , or the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, having the same signification, so that the meaning is "fire-dartings:" from his right hand went rays of fire like arrows shot forth (cf. <a href="/habakkuk/3-4.htm">Habakkuk 3:4</a>; <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To them</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to the Israelites, to whom this manifestation was vouchsafed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He said:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1463;&#1431;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
