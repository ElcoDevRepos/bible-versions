This personal witness is crucial for the transmission of faith and obedience to future generations, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>, where parents are instructed to teach their children diligently.<p><b>that have seen</b><br>The act of seeing here is not just physical sight but also spiritual understanding and recognition of God's power and faithfulness. The Israelites' experiences were meant to solidify their faith and trust in God. This concept of seeing and understanding is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus often speaks of those who have eyes but do not see (<a href="/mark/8-18.htm">Mark 8:18</a>), highlighting the importance of spiritual perception.<p><b>every great work</b><br>The "great work" refers to the miraculous deeds God performed, such as the plagues in Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, and the provision of manna. These acts are not only historical events but also typological foreshadowings of Christ's redemptive work. For instance, the Passover lamb is a type of Christ, the Lamb of God (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>). The great works serve as a testament to God's sovereignty and power, reinforcing the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>that the LORD has done</b><br>This phrase attributes all the miraculous works to the LORD, emphasizing His active role in the history of Israel. The use of the covenant name "LORD" (YHWH) highlights the personal and relational aspect of God's interaction with His people. It is a reminder of His faithfulness to His promises, as seen in the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). The deeds of the LORD are a demonstration of His character and His commitment to His covenant, which is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is the mediator of a new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The speaker of Deuteronomy, Moses is addressing the Israelites, reminding them of their experiences and the works of God they have witnessed.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience of Moses' speech, they are the chosen people of God who have been delivered from Egypt and are on the brink of entering the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who performed mighty works and miracles to deliver His people and guide them through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land from which the Israelites were delivered, representing bondage and oppression.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The place of testing and divine provision where the Israelites wandered for 40 years.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/remember_god's_faithfulness.htm">Remember God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Reflect on the mighty works God has done in your life.
