In the ancient Near Eastern context, a "portion" often referred to a share of land or inheritance. Here, it signifies that among all the nations, God has chosen Israel as His own. This concept is rooted in the covenantal promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, where God set apart their descendants as His chosen people (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>). The idea of being God's portion underscores the unique identity and purpose of Israel as a nation set apart to reflect God's character and to be a light to the nations (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>).<p><b>Jacob His allotted inheritance</b><br>The use of "Jacob" here is significant as it refers to the patriarch whose name was changed to Israel, representing the entire nation. The term "allotted inheritance" suggests a deliberate choice and a legal claim, much like the division of land among tribes. This reflects the fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs, where the descendants of Jacob were to inherit the land of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13-15</a>). Theologically, this inheritance is not just physical but also spiritual, as Israel is called to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament understanding of believers as God's inheritance, with the church being grafted into the promises made to Israel (<a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-24</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is portrayed as the sovereign ruler and protector of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jacob.htm">Jacob</a></b><br>Represents the nation of Israel, as Jacob was renamed Israel and his descendants became the twelve tribes of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/inheritance.htm">Inheritance</a></b><br>In the context of ancient Israel, inheritance refers to the land and blessings promised by God to His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_choice.htm">God's Sovereign Choice</a></b><br>God chose Israel as His portion, not because of their merit, but because of His sovereign will and love.
