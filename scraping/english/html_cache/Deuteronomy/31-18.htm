In the context of Deuteronomy, Moses is addressing the Israelites as they prepare to enter the Promised Land. "That day" signifies a future moment when the consequences of their actions will manifest. It is a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings and curses are contingent upon obedience or disobedience (Deuteronomy 28).<p><b>I will surely hide My face</b><br>The concept of God hiding His face is a metaphor for the withdrawal of His favor and presence. In the ancient Near Eastern context, the face of a deity symbolized attention and blessing. When God hides His face, it indicates a break in the relationship due to sin. This is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>, where sin creates a separation between God and His people.<p><b>because of all the evil they have done</b><br>The evil mentioned here refers to the Israelites' disobedience and idolatry. Historically, the Israelites struggled with maintaining faithfulness to God amidst the polytheistic cultures surrounding them. This phrase underscores the seriousness of their actions and the moral and spiritual decline that results from turning away from God's commandments.<p><b>by turning to other gods</b><br>Idolatry is a recurring issue for the Israelites, as seen throughout the Old Testament. The worship of other gods was not only a violation of the first commandment but also a betrayal of the exclusive covenant relationship with Yahweh. This turning away is often depicted as spiritual adultery, and it leads to severe consequences, as seen in the Babylonian exile (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-23</a>). The call to monotheism is central to Israel's identity and mission, and turning to other gods represents a fundamental breach of their covenant with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is delivering God's message to the people.
