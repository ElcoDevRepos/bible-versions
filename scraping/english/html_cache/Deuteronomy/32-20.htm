It is part of the Song of Moses, a prophetic and poetic declaration given to the Israelites before they enter the Promised Land. The song serves as a witness against them, highlighting God's faithfulness and their potential unfaithfulness.<p><b>&#8220;I will hide My face from them;</b><br>In biblical terms, God hiding His face signifies a withdrawal of His favor and presence. This is a form of divine judgment, indicating that the Israelites will experience the consequences of their disobedience. The concept of God hiding His face is seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a>, where sin creates a separation between God and His people.<p><b>I will see what will be their end.</b><br>This phrase suggests a period of testing or observation. God allows the Israelites to face the results of their actions to reveal their true character and the outcome of their choices. It reflects the principle of sowing and reaping found in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>, where actions have corresponding consequences.<p><b>For they are a perverse generation&#8212;</b><br>The term "perverse" indicates moral corruption and deviation from God's ways. This description echoes the language used in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>, where believers are called to shine as lights in a "crooked and perverse generation." It highlights the contrast between God's holiness and human sinfulness.<p><b>children of unfaithfulness.</b><br>This phrase underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where Israel is often depicted as God's children. Their unfaithfulness is akin to spiritual adultery, breaking the covenant established at Sinai. This theme is prevalent in the prophetic books, such as Hosea, where Israel's unfaithfulness is likened to an unfaithful spouse. The call to faithfulness is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who embodies perfect obedience and faithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The speaker of the song in <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>, Moses is delivering God's message to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience of the song, they are described as a "perverse generation" and "children of unfaithfulness."<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The one who declares He will hide His face from the Israelites due to their unfaithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_song_of_moses.htm">The Song of Moses</a></b><br>A prophetic song given by Moses to the Israelites, warning them of the consequences of their disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land that the Israelites are about to enter, which is contingent upon their faithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequence_of_unfaithfulness.htm">The Consequence of Unfaithfulness</a></b><br>God&#8217;s decision to hide His face is a direct response to the Israelites' unfaithfulness.
