Planting a vineyard required years of labor before it yielded fruit, typically taking about four years to produce a harvest. This phrase reflects the importance of personal investment and the anticipation of future reward. Biblically, vineyards often symbolize God's blessings and the prosperity of the land (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>). The question implies a sense of incompletion and unfulfilled promise, highlighting the personal loss if one were to die before enjoying the fruits of their labor.<p><b>Let him return home,</b><br>This directive underscores the value placed on family and personal fulfillment in the Mosaic Law. It reflects God's compassion and understanding of human needs and desires. The law provided exemptions from military service for those who had not yet enjoyed the fruits of their labor, emphasizing the importance of personal and familial responsibilities over national duties in certain circumstances. This principle is consistent with the broader biblical theme of God caring for the individual needs of His people.<p><b>or he may die in battle and another man enjoy its fruit.</b><br>This phrase highlights the uncertainty and risk of life, especially in the context of war. It serves as a reminder of the transient nature of human endeavors and the potential for others to benefit from one's labor if life is cut short. The concern for justice and fairness is evident, as the law seeks to prevent a situation where someone else reaps the benefits of another's hard work. This concept is echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/2-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:18-21</a>, where the futility of laboring for others to enjoy is lamented. The provision also reflects a deeper spiritual truth about the ultimate fulfillment found in God's promises, which are not subject to the uncertainties of life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom Moses is speaking, preparing them for entering the Promised Land and engaging in battles.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, delivering God's laws and instructions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/vineyard.htm">Vineyard</a></b><br>Represents personal investments and future hopes, a common agricultural endeavor in ancient Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/battle.htm">Battle</a></b><br>The context of the passage, referring to the wars the Israelites would face in claiming the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_care_for_personal_investments.htm">God's Care for Personal Investments</a></b><br>God acknowledges the importance of personal investments and the right to enjoy the fruits of one's labor.

In ancient Israel it took several years before vines produced a full harvest (<a href="/leviticus/19-23.htm">Leviticus 19:23-25</a>). By mentioning vineyards, the Lord recognizes the ordinary responsibilities of family life and the legitimate joy that comes from honest work (<a href="/psalms/128-2.htm">Psalm 128:2</a>; <a href="/1_kings/4-25.htm">1 Kings 4:25</a>). Going to war before tasting that first crop would mean walking away from a God-given stewardship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and not begun to enjoy its fruit?</b><p>The question presses the point: if the planter has not yet shared in the harvest, his labor remains unfinished. The Law often links work with the right to enjoy its reward (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-5.htm">Jeremiah 31:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-21.htm">Isaiah 65:21-22</a>). Here the Lord protects that right, guarding against a scenario in which faithfulness in battle cancels personal fruitfulness at home.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let him return home,</b><p>The command is merciful and practical. Soldiers who are preoccupied with unresolved obligations fight distractedly, endangering themselves and their comrades (compare <a href="/deuteronomy/24-5.htm">Deuteronomy 24:5</a>; <a href="/judges/7-3.htm">Judges 7:3</a>). By sending such a man back, Israel&#8217;s army maintains single-minded resolve while the individual finishes the task God already gave him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or he may die in battle</b><p>The warning is realistic. Warfare carries mortal risk (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:8</a>). If the planter falls, his years of patient care would benefit someone else. The Lord values the sanctity of life and acknowledges that no earthly project is worth more than the person who undertook it (<a href="/psalms/91-7.htm">Psalm 91:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and another man enjoy its fruit.</b><p>Left unfinished, the vineyard would still yield a crop&#8212;but to someone who did not plant it. This echoes both blessing and curse motifs: Israel would one day inherit vineyards they did not plant (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-10.htm">Deuteronomy 6:10-11</a>), yet disobedience would reverse that blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30</a>). Jesus later cites the same principle spiritually: &#8220;One sows and another reaps&#8221; (<a href="/john/4-37.htm">John 4:37-38</a>). God desires each believer to reap the fruit of his own faithful labor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/20-6.htm">Deuteronomy 20:6</a> balances the call to national defense with the Lord&#8217;s compassionate concern for individual households. By excusing the yet-to-harvest vine-dresser from battle, God preserves the dignity of personal stewardship, ensures wholehearted service among those who do fight, and reinforces the biblical pattern that labor and its reward belong together.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/20-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Has any</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;m&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
