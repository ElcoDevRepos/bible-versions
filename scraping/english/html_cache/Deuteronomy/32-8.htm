The term "Most High" emphasizes God's supreme authority over all creation. This event is often linked to the division of nations at the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11-8.htm">Genesis 11:8-9</a>), where God confused the languages and scattered humanity. The concept of inheritance suggests that each nation received its portion of the earth as a divine allotment, reflecting God's plan and purpose for each people group.<p><b>when He divided the sons of man</b><br>This division of humanity is a direct reference to the scattering at Babel. The "sons of man" indicates all of humanity, emphasizing the universality of this event. It highlights God's intervention in human affairs to prevent the consolidation of power that could lead to rebellion against Him. This division was not merely geographical but also cultural and linguistic, shaping the development of distinct civilizations.<p><b>He set the boundaries of the peoples</b><br>God's establishment of boundaries underscores His control over the rise and fall of nations. These boundaries are not arbitrary but are part of His divine order. <a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a> echoes this idea, stating that God determined the times and places for each nation. This setting of boundaries ensured that no single nation would dominate, allowing for a diversity of cultures and the unfolding of God's redemptive history.<p><b>according to the number of the sons of God</b><br>This phrase has been the subject of much debate. "Sons of God" can refer to divine beings or angels, as seen in <a href="/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a> and <a href="/psalms/82.htm">Psalm 82:1</a>. Some interpretations suggest that each nation was assigned a guardian angel or divine being. Alternatively, the Septuagint and some Dead Sea Scrolls manuscripts read "sons of Israel," implying a connection to the 70 descendants of Jacob who went to Egypt (<a href="/genesis/46-27.htm">Genesis 46:27</a>), symbolizing the nations. This reflects God's special relationship with Israel, foreshadowing the coming of Christ, who would fulfill God's promises to Israel and extend salvation to all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_most_high.htm">The Most High</a></b><br>Refers to God, emphasizing His supreme authority and sovereignty over all creation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>Represents the various ethnic groups and peoples of the world, each with their own distinct territories and cultures.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_man.htm">Sons of Man</a></b><br>Refers to humanity in general, highlighting the division and distribution of people across the earth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/boundaries.htm">Boundaries</a></b><br>The geographical and cultural limits set by God for each nation, indicating His control over human history and geography.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sons_of_god.htm">Sons of God</a></b><br>This term can be interpreted in various ways, often understood as divine beings or angels in the context of ancient Near Eastern thought, or as the people of Israel in some interpretations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_over_nations.htm">God's Sovereignty Over Nations</a></b><br>God is in control of the rise and fall of nations, and His plans are executed through His divine wisdom and authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purposeful_boundaries.htm">Purposeful Boundaries</a></b><br>The boundaries set by God are not arbitrary; they serve His greater purpose and plan for humanity, including the spread of the Gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humanity's_unity_and_diversity.htm">Humanity's Unity and Diversity</a></b><br>While humanity is diverse in culture and language, we share a common origin and purpose under God's design.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_order_and_justice.htm">Divine Order and Justice</a></b><br>God's division of nations reflects His justice and order, reminding us to seek His guidance in our own lives and communities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_the_sons_of_god.htm">Role of the Sons of God</a></b><br>Understanding the role of divine beings or Israel in God's plan can deepen our appreciation for His interaction with the world.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_32_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 32:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_32_8_God_s_role_in_dividing_nations.htm">How does Deuteronomy 32:8 highlight God's sovereignty in dividing the nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_set_boundaries_show_about_God.htm">What does "set the boundaries of the peoples" reveal about God's authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Deut_32_8_Acts_17_26_on_nations.htm">How does Deuteronomy 32:8 connect with Acts 17:26 on God's control over nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/God_s_role_in_borders_worldview_impact.htm">How can understanding God's role in nations' boundaries influence our worldview today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Deut_32_8_on_leader_prayers.htm">How should Deuteronomy 32:8 shape our prayers for national and global leaders?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Deut_32_8_and_God_s_rule_over_nations.htm">How does Deuteronomy 32:8 align with the concept of God's sovereignty over nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Deuteronomy_32_8_God_s_role_in_history.htm">What does Deuteronomy 32:8 imply about God's role in human history?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Deut_32_8_s_link_to_divine_justice.htm">How does Deuteronomy 32:8 relate to the idea of divine justice?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_32.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 32?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_deut._32_8_align_with_ancient_texts.htm">In Deuteronomy 32:8, how do we reconcile the phrase &#8220;sons of God&#8221; or &#8220;sons of Israel&#8221; with other ancient texts, and why do historical records not clarify this discrepancy?

The Jews were accustomed to reckon seventy nations and languages in that dispersion. Seventy members of Jacob's household went down into Egypt. And literally they interpret this passage to mean that in dividing the lands to the peoples, Jehovah left room for His own, so that they might inherit the promised land without any undue pressure upon other nations. It is noticeable that the children of Lot and Esau were carefully preserved from disturbance by Israel (Deuteronomy 2). But this is the bare literal interpretation. The true meaning of the passage is given by St. Paul in his speech at Athens: "He determined (for all nations) times before appointed, and the setting of the boundaries of their habitation, <span class= "ital">that they might seek the Lord." </span>The nations were so disposed in the world, and so developed, that each might have its opportunity of seeking Jehovah, in due season, through contact with His people--"if, as was certainly not impossible, they might feel after Him and find Him, who is not far from any one of us. For we are even His offspring." Hence He appoints our inheritance. With some such thought as this, the LXX. translate the latter half of <a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm" title="When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>, "He set the bounds of the peoples according to the number <span class= "ital">of the angels of God" </span>The chosen people were to be His messengers to the nations. He chose Israel for His own portion, that through them He might inherit the world. And yet in the face of this glorious calling and mission, the undutiful behaviour of Israel was their one great blot. They had only to accept the position already prepared for them, and they refused! . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - From the very beginning, when God first allotted to the nations a place and a heritage, he had respect in his arrangements to the sons of Israel, who were his portion, and had as it were kept their interest in view in all that he appointed and ordered. <span class="cmt_word">According to the number of the children of Israel.</span> When the Most High portioned out to the nations the heritage of each, he reserved for Israel, as the people of his choice, an inheritance proportioned to its numbers.
