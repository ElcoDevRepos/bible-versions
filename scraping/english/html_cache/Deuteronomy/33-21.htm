The choice of land reflects the tribe's foresight and desire for prosperity. The "best land" indicates a place rich in resources, suitable for agriculture and livestock, which was crucial for the tribe's sustenance and growth. This decision aligns with the earlier agreement in <a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>, where the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half of Manasseh requested land on the east side of the Jordan due to its suitability for their large herds.<p><b>because a ruler&#8217;s portion was reserved for him there</b><br>The "ruler's portion" suggests a special allotment, indicating a place of honor and leadership. This can be seen as a fulfillment of Jacob's blessing in <a href="/genesis/49-19.htm">Genesis 49:19</a>, where Gad is described as a warrior tribe. The land's strategic location allowed Gad to act as a buffer against eastern invaders, thus playing a crucial role in the defense of Israel. The term "reserved" implies divine providence, suggesting that God had a specific plan for Gad's inheritance.<p><b>He came with the leaders of the people</b><br>This phrase highlights Gad's active participation in the collective leadership of Israel. It underscores the tribe's commitment to unity and cooperation with the other tribes. Gad's leaders were involved in the decision-making processes and military campaigns, as seen in <a href="/joshua/22.htm">Joshua 22</a>, where they join the other tribes in the conquest of Canaan. This involvement reflects the tribe's dedication to the covenant community and their role in fulfilling God's promises to Israel.<p><b>he administered the LORD&#8217;s justice and His ordinances for Israel</b><br>Gad's role in administering justice and ordinances indicates their responsibility in upholding God's law. This reflects the broader theme of Deuteronomy, which emphasizes obedience to God's commandments as a condition for blessing. The administration of justice was crucial for maintaining social order and covenant faithfulness. Gad's involvement in this task demonstrates their commitment to God's standards and their role in ensuring that Israel lived according to divine principles. This phrase also points to the future role of Christ as the ultimate judge and lawgiver, fulfilling the law perfectly and establishing God's justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gad.htm">Gad</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Gad, the seventh son of Jacob and Zilpah.

During Israel&#8217;s journey, Gad noticed that the pasturelands east of the Jordan were &#8220;ideal for livestock&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1-5</a>), so they requested that territory.<p>&#8226; At first Moses questioned their motives, yet Gad pledged to fight beside the other tribes until all inherited their land (<a href="/numbers/32-16.htm">Numbers 32:16-18</a>). Their choice was not mere self-interest; it was a confident embrace of God&#8217;s tangible provision, much like Caleb&#8217;s later request for Hebron (<a href="/joshua/14-12.htm">Joshua 14:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Their settlement in a fertile, strategic area parallels Lot&#8217;s earlier selection of the Jordan Valley (<a href="/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10-11</a>); yet, unlike Lot, Gad committed to covenant obedience. The lesson is that recognizing and receiving God&#8217;s best should always be tied to faithfulness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Because a ruler&#8217;s portion was reserved for him there</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;ruler&#8217;s portion&#8221; points to the size and significance of Gad&#8217;s allotment&#8212;land once ruled by the Amorite kings Sihon and Og (De 3:12-13). A domain strong enough for kings became Gad&#8217;s inheritance.<p>&#8226; Moses himself, as Israel&#8217;s leader, helped designate this area (De 3:18-20). In that sense the allotment bore a &#8220;royal&#8221; stamp.<p>&#8226; God often reserves places of influence for those ready to shoulder responsibility (<a href="/proverbs/3-35.htm">Proverbs 3:35</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>). Gad accepted both the privilege and the weight of protecting Israel&#8217;s frontier (<a href="/1_chronicles/5-18.htm">1 Chronicles 5:18-22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He came with the leaders of the people</b><p>&#8226; True to their vow, the men of Gad crossed the Jordan &#8220;in front of the Israelites, ready for battle&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/4-12.htm">Joshua 4:12-13</a>; 22:1-4).<p>&#8226; They marched alongside &#8220;the heads of the tribes&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/34-18.htm">Numbers 34:18</a>), demonstrating solidarity and leadership.<p>&#8226; Their presence underscores that God-given blessings never exempt believers from serving the wider body (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>). Gad&#8217;s courage encouraged the other tribes during the conquest (<a href="/joshua/10-7.htm">Joshua 10:7</a>; 11:4-5).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He administered the LORD&#8217;s justice and His ordinances for Israel</b><p>&#8226; After the land was secured, Gad returned east yet remained committed to covenant law. Their famous &#8220;altar of witness&#8221; testified to ongoing loyalty to &#8220;the service of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/22-10.htm">Joshua 22:10-34</a>).<p>&#8226; By guarding Israel&#8217;s eastern approaches, they upheld the Lord&#8217;s justice against encroaching enemies (<a href="/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Their example shows that enjoying God&#8217;s material blessing goes hand in hand with upholding His moral standards (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Gad&#8217;s story in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-21.htm">Deuteronomy 33:21</a> highlights four linked truths: God grants excellent gifts, He expects responsible stewardship of those gifts, He calls His people to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with one another, and He delights when recipients of blessing actively promote His justice and commands. Gad embraced all four, leaving an enduring model of faithfulness on the fertile plains east of the Jordan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">The first part.</span>--The first territory conquered by Moses was distributed between Reuben and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasseh.<p><span class= "bld">A portion of the lawgiver</span> is interpreted by Rashi as the field of the "burial-place" of the lawgiver. But this can hardly have been in the mind of Moses.<p><span class= "bld">He came with the heads of the people.</span>--The Gadites with their companion tribes passed over Jordan to the conquest of Canaan by Moses' order.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21</span> refers to Gad's obtaining an inheritance for himself from Moses beyond Jordan. <span class="cmt_word">And he provided the first part for himself</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and he saw for himself</span> (i.e. chose) <span class="accented">the first</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. either the most excellent part or the firstfruits of the conquest. <span class="cmt_word">Because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated</span>; rather, <span class="accented">for there the portion of the leader was reserved</span>. The word rendered t, lawgiver," or "leader" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b9;&#x5e7;&#x5b5;&#x5e7;</span>), signifies primarily one who ordains or appoints, and is used in both the above senses (cf. <a href="/exodus/33-22.htm">Exodus 33:22</a>; <a href="/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a>); it is here applied to Gad, because that tribe displayed such promptitude and energy at the head of the tribes in the conquest of the land, that it might be regarded as their leader. An entirely different view of the passage has been taken by some, who by the <span class="accented">mechokek</span> understand Moses as the lawgiver, and his portion as the place of his grave, which was concealed, but was within the inheritance of Gad. But it is a fatal objection to this view that not only is the word rendered "portion" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span>) nowhere used of a grave, but the grave of Moses on Mount Nebo was in the territory of Reuben, not in that of Gad. Gesenius renders, "The portion of (assigned by) the lawgiver was preserved." But this does not tally with the immediately preceding statement, that Gad <span class="accented">chose</span> his portion for himself; at any rate, it could not be <span class="accented">because</span> of this that he chose it. Gad chose for himself a portion on the east of Jordan, and the portion he had chosen was sacredly kept for him, though he went with his brethren to the conquest of Canaan. <span class="cmt_word">And he came with the heads of the people</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. his place of marching was with the leaders; his place was at the head of the tribes (cf. <a href="/numbers/32-17.htm">Numbers 32:17, 21, 32</a>, and <a href="/joshua/1-14.htm">Joshua 1:14</a>;
