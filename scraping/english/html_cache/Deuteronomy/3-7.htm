It provided food, clothing, and labor. The Israelites, as a nomadic people transitioning to a settled life in the Promised Land, would have found livestock essential for their survival and economic stability. This phrase highlights the practical needs of the Israelites and God's provision for them through the conquest.<p><b>and plunder of the cities</b><br>The term "plunder" refers to the goods and valuables taken from the defeated cities. In the ancient world, plundering was a common practice after a military victory. It served as a reward for the victors and a means to sustain the community. This action was part of God's judgment on the Canaanite nations, fulfilling His promise to give the land to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>we carried off for ourselves.</b><br>This phrase indicates that the Israelites took possession of the goods as their own, signifying God's blessing and provision. It also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to provide for His people as they entered the land He had sworn to give them. This act of taking possession is a precursor to the eventual settlement in the Promised Land, where the Israelites would establish their own society under God's law. The carrying off of plunder can also be seen as a type of the spiritual inheritance believers receive in Christ, who has won the ultimate victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is recounting the events of their journey and conquests as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who are journeying through the wilderness and conquering lands as they approach Canaan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/og,_king_of_bashan.htm">Og, King of Bashan</a></b><br>The king whose territory was conquered by the Israelites, as described in the surrounding context of <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/3.htm">Deuteronomy 3</a>.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bashan.htm">Bashan</a></b><br>A region east of the Jordan River, known for its fertile land and strong cities, which was taken by the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_conquest_of_bashan.htm">The Conquest of Bashan</a></b><br>The event where the Israelites defeated King Og and took possession of his land, including the livestock and plunder.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_provision.htm">God's Faithfulness in Provision</a></b><br>The Israelites' ability to carry off livestock and plunder demonstrates God's provision and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The Israelites' success in battle was contingent upon their obedience to God's commands.
