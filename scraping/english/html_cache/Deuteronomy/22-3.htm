The mention of a donkey highlights the agrarian context of ancient Israel, where animals were vital for transportation and labor. The cloak, a basic garment, was essential for protection against the elements, underscoring the importance of personal property. This commandment aligns with the moral and ethical teachings found throughout the Torah, promoting community responsibility and integrity. The phrase "anything your brother has lost" broadens the scope, indicating that all possessions, regardless of value, should be returned, fostering trust and unity within the community.<p><b>You must not ignore it.</b><br>This directive underscores the moral obligation to act justly and compassionately. Ignoring a neighbor's loss would be contrary to the spirit of the law, which calls for active engagement in the welfare of others. This commandment reflects the heart of the law, which is to love and care for one's neighbor, as seen in the parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-37</a>). The insistence on not ignoring the lost item highlights the importance of vigilance and responsibility, encouraging believers to be proactive in their faith and actions. This principle is echoed in the teachings of Jesus, who emphasized the importance of doing unto others as you would have them do unto you (<a href="/matthew/7-12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience receiving the law, God's chosen people, preparing to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites are about to enter, where these laws will be applied.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/lost_property.htm">Lost Property</a></b><br>The subject of the law, referring to items that belong to a fellow Israelite.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/neighbor/brother.htm">Neighbor/Brother</a></b><br>The fellow Israelite whose lost property is to be returned.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_and_stewardship.htm">Responsibility and Stewardship</a></b><br>As Christians, we are called to be responsible stewards of what God has entrusted to us, including the property of others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/love_in_action.htm">Love in Action</a></b><br>Returning lost property is a practical demonstration of love and respect for our neighbor, reflecting God's love for us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_trust.htm">Community and Trust</a></b><br>Upholding these laws fosters a community of trust and mutual respect, essential for a healthy society.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_and_honesty.htm">Integrity and Honesty</a></b><br>This command encourages us to act with integrity, even when no one is watching, as God sees our actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_law.htm">Obedience to God's Law</a></b><br>Following these commands is an act of obedience to God, showing our commitment to His ways.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_22_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 22:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_22_3_Responsibility_for_others_property.htm">How does Deuteronomy 22:3 encourage responsibility towards others' property in our community?

Verse 3 widens the circle. Whatever you did for the ox or sheep, you repeat for every other item. The Lord is giving a timeless principle of consistent neighbor-love.<p>&#8226; The instruction is personal: you shall do the same. Each believer carries the duty, not merely community leaders.<p>&#8226; It is practical: real action, not good intentions. See <a href="/luke/6-31.htm">Luke 6:31</a>, &#8220;Do to others as you would have them do to you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; It is comprehensive. The standard does not change with the value of the item or the ease of the task. <a href="/matthew/7-12.htm">Matthew 7:12</a> ties this to &#8220;the essence of the Law and the Prophets.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for his donkey</b><p>A donkey was the tractor trailer of ancient Israel, essential for work and income. Returning it protected a neighbor&#8217;s livelihood.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4</a> reinforces the point: &#8220;If you encounter your enemy&#8217;s stray ox or donkey, you must return it to him.&#8221; Even an enemy deserved help.<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a> highlights God&#8217;s care for animals: &#8220;A righteous man regards the life of his animal.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verse shows that genuine righteousness safeguards both man and beast, honoring the Creator who owns them all (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his cloak</b><p>The cloak was a person&#8217;s outer garment, blanket, and symbol of dignity.

Finding a lost item creates a moral obligation to act.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a> states, &#8220;Anyone, then, who knows the right thing to do but fails to do it, is guilty of sin.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_john/3-17.htm">1 John 3:17</a> links love to tangible care: &#8220;If anyone with earthly possessions sees his brother in need but withholds his compassion from him, how can the love of God abide in him?&#8221;<p>&#8226; The Good Samaritan in <a href="/luke/10-33.htm">Luke 10:33-34</a> embodies this verse; he refused to pass by on the other side.<p>God commands active mercy. Seeing a need and turning away violates His character and harms neighborly trust.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/22-3.htm">Deuteronomy 22:3</a> gives a clear, literal directive: whenever you discover something your brother has lost, treat it with the same faithful care you would give your own property, whether it is his donkey, his cloak, or any other possession. The verse upholds a lifestyle of proactive love that refuses to look the other way. In obeying, believers protect livelihoods, preserve dignity, and showcase the faithful heart of God who never ignores His own.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/22-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And you shall do</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#347;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the same</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1461;&#1447;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
