The imagery of growing "fat and kicked" suggests prosperity leading to rebellion. This reflects a common biblical theme where material abundance leads to spiritual complacency and rebellion against God. The metaphor of an animal kicking against its owner highlights Israel's ingratitude and defiance. This theme is echoed in <a href="/hosea/13-6.htm">Hosea 13:6</a>, where Israel's satisfaction leads to forgetfulness of God.<p><b>becoming fat, bloated, and gorged.</b><br>The repetition of "fat, bloated, and gorged" emphasizes the extent of Israel's prosperity and self-indulgence. This physical imagery symbolizes spiritual complacency and pride. In the ancient Near Eastern context, fatness was often associated with wealth and success, but here it is used negatively to illustrate moral and spiritual decline. This serves as a warning against the dangers of allowing material success to lead to spiritual neglect.<p><b>He abandoned the God who made him</b><br>This phrase underscores Israel's apostasy, turning away from the Creator who established and sustained them. The abandonment of God is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often leading to dire consequences. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where faithfulness was expected in response to God's provision and care. The idea of God as the Creator is foundational, seen in <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, and abandoning Him is portrayed as a grave betrayal.<p><b>and scorned the Rock of his salvation.</b><br>"Rock" is a metaphor for God, symbolizing strength, stability, and protection. This imagery is prevalent throughout the Psalms and other biblical texts, such as <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>, where God is described as a rock and fortress. Scorning the Rock of salvation indicates a rejection of the security and deliverance that God provides. This phrase highlights the foolishness of Israel's actions, as they turn away from the very source of their salvation and strength. The concept of God as a rock also points to Christ, who is referred to as the spiritual rock in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>, drawing a typological connection between the Old Testament and the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeshurun.htm">Jeshurun</a></b><br>A poetic name for Israel, used in a context that highlights the nation's favored status and subsequent rebellion against God.

Moses had earlier warned, &#8220;When you have eaten and are satisfied&#8230; be careful that you do not forget the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10-14</a>).<p>&#8226; Prosperity is never evil in itself, yet it tests the heart. <a href="/hosea/13-6.htm">Hosea 13:6</a> echoes the pattern: &#8220;When they had pasture, they became satisfied; when they were satisfied, their hearts became proud; therefore they forgot Me.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And kicked&#8212;becoming fat, bloated, and gorged</b><p>&#8226; Like an overfed animal that snaps at its owner, Israel responded to blessing with self-indulgence and resistance to God&#8217;s authority.<p>&#8226; God had entreated, &#8220;You deserted the Rock who fathered you; you forgot the God who gave you birth&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a>). The kicking pictures deliberate rebellion rather than accidental drift.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/78-56.htm">Psalm 78:56-57</a> records the same behavior generations later: &#8220;They rebelled against the Most High God and did not keep His testimonies.

Either "the child of the upright," or "the beloved Israel." The letters of the diminutive of Israel, if slightly abbreviated, would make "Jeshurun." It is peculiar to Deuteronomy (here and in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-5.htm" title="And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.">Deuteronomy 33:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-26.htm" title="There is none like to the God of Jeshurun, who rides on the heaven in your help, and in his excellency on the sky.">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/44-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD that made you, and formed you from the womb, which will help you; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and you, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.">Isaiah 44:2</a>). Two of the Targums render the word by "Israel here." The third retains the word itself. The LXX. translate it "the beloved one."<p><span class= "bld">Kicked.</span>--Only in <a href="/1_samuel/2-29.htm" title="Why kick you at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the most chief of all the offerings of Israel my people?">1Samuel 2:29</a> : "Wherefore <span class= "ital">kick</span> <span class= "ital">ye </span>at my sacrifice and mine offering . . . <span class= "ital">to make</span> <span class= "ital">yourselves fat?"</span><p><span class= "bld">Grown thick.</span>--As Rehoboam said, "My little finger shall <span class= "ital">be thicker </span>than my father's loins." Both these parallels illustrate the spirit of the verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-18.</span> - Israel's ungrateful return for the Lord's benefits. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jeshurun</span>. This name, formed from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, righteous, designates Israel as chosen to be a righteous nation; and in the use of it here lies the keenest reproach of apostate Israel, as fallen into a state the opposite of that to which it was destined. "By using the name <span class="accented">righteous</span> in place of <span class="accented">Israel</span>, Moses ironically censures those who had swerved from rectitude; by recalling to memory with what dignity they had been endowed, he the more sharply rebukes the perfidy which was their crime" (Calvin). This name appears also in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-5.htm">Deuteronomy 33:5, 26</a>, and in <a href="/isaiah/44-2.htm">Isaiah 44:2</a>; but in these places without any implied censure. By some the word is regarded as a diminutive from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>, the same as <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, in the sense of <span class="accented">rectulus</span>, <span class="accented">justulus</span>, "<span class="accented">the</span> good little people" (Gesenius); others as a diminutive from XXX, Israel, as a sort of term of endearment (Grotius). But the latter of these derivations is impossible; and as to the former, there lacks evidence of the termination <span class="accented">un</span> having a diminutive significance in Hebrew. Besides, neither here nor in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-5.htm">Deuteronomy 33:5</a> would a term of endearment be suitable. <span class="cmt_word">Waxed fat, and kicked</span> (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-11.htm">Deuteronomy 6:11</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-10.htm">Deuteronomy 8:10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/31-20.htm">Deuteronomy 31:20</a>). The allusion is to an ox that had grown fat through good feeding, and had become unmanageable in consequence (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/2-26.htm">1 Samuel 2:26</a>: <a href="/hosea/10-4.htm">Hosea 10:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lightly esteemed</span>.
