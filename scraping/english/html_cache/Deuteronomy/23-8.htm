The Edomites were descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother, and thus had a familial connection to Israel. The Egyptians, despite having enslaved the Israelites, were also to be treated with a degree of respect due to their historical role in providing refuge during Joseph's time. The third generation indicates a period of assimilation and acceptance, suggesting that by this time, these descendants would have adopted the customs and faith of Israel. This reflects a broader biblical principle of redemption and inclusion for those who align themselves with God's people.<p><b>may enter the assembly of the LORD</b><br>The "assembly of the LORD" refers to the congregation of Israel, particularly in a religious and communal context. Entrance into this assembly was significant, as it symbolized full participation in the religious, social, and civic life of Israel. This inclusion was not merely a matter of physical presence but indicated acceptance into the covenant community. Theologically, this points to the inclusive nature of God's covenant, foreshadowing the New Testament teaching that in Christ, there is neither Jew nor Gentile (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).

It seems to have been impossible to prevent some inter-marriages between Edom, Moab, and Israel when the Israelites passed through their land. Such a precept is suitable to the circumstances of Moses' time.
