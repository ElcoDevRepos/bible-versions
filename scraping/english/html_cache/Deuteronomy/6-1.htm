The terms "commandments," "statutes," and "ordinances" reflect different aspects of the law: commandments are direct orders, statutes are decrees meant to be observed, and ordinances are judicial decisions. This triad emphasizes the completeness and authority of God's law. The use of multiple terms underscores the importance of adhering to all aspects of God's instructions, not just selective obedience. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience is a response to God's grace and a means of maintaining fellowship with Him.<p><b>that the LORD your God has instructed me to teach you</b><br>Moses is the mediator of God's law, highlighting his role as a prophet and leader. The phrase "the LORD your God" emphasizes the personal relationship between God and Israel, reminding them of their unique covenant. Moses' role as a teacher is crucial, as he is responsible for ensuring that the people understand and implement God's laws. This reflects the biblical principle that leaders are accountable for guiding their communities in righteousness. The teaching of the law is not merely informational but transformational, intended to shape the character and conduct of the people.<p><b>to follow</b><br>The emphasis on following indicates that the law is not just to be heard but to be actively obeyed. This reflects the biblical theme of faith being demonstrated through action. Obedience to God's law is a sign of faithfulness and love towards Him. The call to follow is a call to discipleship, where the Israelites are to walk in the ways of the LORD, setting them apart from other nations. This obedience is not legalistic but relational, rooted in the covenant and the desire to honor God.<p><b>in the land that you are about to enter and possess</b><br>This phrase situates the giving of the law within the context of the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land. The land is a gift from God, a fulfillment of His promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The laws are given in anticipation of life in the land, where the Israelites are to live as a holy nation. The land is not just a physical territory but a place where God's people are to embody His values and purposes. This anticipates the New Testament theme of the Kingdom of God, where believers are called to live out God's will on earth. The possession of the land is both a privilege and a responsibility, requiring faithfulness to God's covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is delivering God's commandments to the people.

The first part of the application is more general, and concerns <span class= "ital">the relation of Israel to Jehovah, </span>who has brought them from Egypt through the wilderness to the promised land. This portion concludes with Deuteronomy 11. The precepts that follow are particular, and concern the <span class= "ital">land of Israel </span>viewed as the seat of (1) the <span class= "ital">worship </span>and (2) the <span class= "ital">kingdom </span>of Jehovah. But the whole discourse, from <a href="/deuteronomy/4-44.htm" title="And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:">Deuteronomy 4:44</a> to the end of Deuteronomy 26 is presented to us as one unbroken whole. (See Introduction for a complete analysis.)<p><span class= "bld">The commandments.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">this is the commandment, the statutes, and the judgments. </span>The "commandment" is the <span class= "ital">duty </span>imposed on Israel by the covenant of the ten words--its application to their daily lives. This application includes (1) statutes, religious ordinances, or institutions; and (2) judgments, requirements, actual rules of behaviour. The two words "statutes" and "judgments," in the original, may sometimes represent two aspects of the same thing. For example, the Passover is an ordinance, or "statute," or, as we should say, an "institution." The rules for its observance are "judgments," or requirements. The thing itself is permanent; the rules for its observance may vary. It was originally eaten standing, and in haste. But after Israel was at rest, it was eaten by them reclining, and in an attitude of repose. Again, the moral law as a whole was eternal; but its application to the life of Israel was very different from its application to ourselves. The word here rendered "commandments" is now commonly employed by the Jews to signify any religious duty or good work.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - Some connect this with what goes before, and take it as a sort of epilogue to the preceding discourse; but it is rather to be regarded as introductory to what follows.
