This area is part of the coastal plain of ancient Canaan, which is significant in biblical history as a land often contested by various groups. The Avvim's presence in villages suggests a settled, agrarian lifestyle. Gaza, a major city in the region, was a strategic location due to its position on trade routes. The mention of the Avvim highlights the diverse ethnic landscape of Canaan before the Israelite conquest.<p><b>were destroyed by the Caphtorites,</b><br>The Caphtorites are believed to be related to the Philistines, often associated with the island of Crete or the broader Aegean region. Their destruction of the Avvim indicates a period of migration and conquest, common in the ancient Near East. This event reflects the shifting power dynamics and the movement of peoples that characterized the region. The Caphtorites' actions foreshadow the later Philistine presence in the same area, which would become significant in Israel's history.<p><b>who came out of Caphtor</b><br>Caphtor is traditionally identified with Crete, though some scholars suggest it could refer to other locations in the Aegean or eastern Mediterranean. The migration from Caphtor to Canaan aligns with historical patterns of sea peoples moving into the Levant during the late Bronze Age. This movement is part of a larger narrative of divine providence, where God orchestrates the rise and fall of nations to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>and settled in their place.</b><br>The settlement of the Caphtorites in the Avvim's territory signifies a complete takeover, not just a military victory. This replacement of peoples is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, illustrating the transient nature of human power and the fulfillment of divine plans. The Caphtorites' settlement prefigures the later Philistine occupation, setting the stage for future conflicts with Israel. This phrase also underscores the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over the nations, as He allows one group to displace another according to His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/avvites.htm">Avvites</a></b><br>An ancient people who lived in villages extending to Gaza.

A total conquest had already occurred before Israel arrived, just as Seir had been cleared by Edom (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-12.htm">Deuteronomy 2:12</a>) and the land of the Ammonites by the LORD&#8217;s hand (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-21.htm">Deuteronomy 2:21</a>).<p>- <a href="/jeremiah/47-4.htm">Jeremiah 47:4</a> and <a href="/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a> echo this event, linking &#8220;Caphtor&#8221; with incoming seafaring warriors.<p>- God&#8217;s sovereignty over international movements stands out: He allows one nation to rise and another to fall (<a href="/job/12-23.htm">Job 12:23</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who came out of Caphtor</b><p>- <a href="/genesis/10-14.htm">Genesis 10:14</a> lists Caphtor among the early post-Flood territories, tying the Caphtorites to the Table of Nations.<p>- Caphtor is most commonly identified with Crete or the broader Aegean region, a reminder that distant peoples were under God&#8217;s governance long before global exploration (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p>- Their migration fulfills the pattern of divine appointment: &#8220;He determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation&#8221; (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and settled in their place</b><p>- &#8220;Settled&#8221; signals permanent occupation, illustrating God&#8217;s right to allot lands as He chooses (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>).<p>- This precedent prepares Israel to trust the LORD when He later directs them to dispossess the Canaanites (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>).<p>- Similar replacements mentioned earlier in the chapter (Horites replaced by Esau&#8217;s descendants, <a href="/deuteronomy/2-12.htm">Deuteronomy 2:12</a>) reinforce the lesson: the Promised Land transfer is neither unprecedented nor capricious but part of a consistent divine policy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a> records a factual, divinely-ordered transfer of territory from the Avvim to the Caphtorites. The verse showcases God&#8217;s meticulous care for historical detail, His sovereign direction of human migrations, and a pattern of territorial replacement that undergirds Israel&#8217;s upcoming conquest.

These Caphtorim were, like the Israelites, immigrants, who drove out the original occupants of the country; and on this account, probably, are referred to by Moses here. "This is so often repeated, to possess the minds of the Israelites with a sense of God's providence, which rules everywhere; displacing one people, and settling another in their stead, and fixing their bounds, also, which they shall not pass without leave" (Patrick). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the Avvim,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1506;&#1463;&#1493;&#1468;&#1460;&#1435;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;&#8216;aw&#183;w&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
