The Arnon River itself was a significant geographical feature, marking the border between Moab and the Amorite kingdom. This location is important in biblical history as it represents the beginning of the land that Israel conquered under Moses' leadership. The mention of Aroer highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel the land of the Amorites. The Arnon Valley, with its steep cliffs and strategic location, was a natural defense line, emphasizing the military challenges Israel faced and overcame with divine assistance.<p><b>as far as Mount Siyon (that is, Hermon)</b><br>Mount Siyon, identified as Mount Hermon, is a prominent mountain in the northern part of the land. It is often associated with majesty and divine presence due to its height and snow-capped peaks. In biblical literature, Mount Hermon is significant as it marks the northern boundary of the Promised Land. It is also mentioned in <a href="/psalms/133-3.htm">Psalm 133:3</a>, symbolizing unity and blessing. The reference to Mount Hermon in Deuteronomy underscores the vastness of the territory God allotted to Israel, stretching from the southern border at the Arnon Valley to the northern reaches at Hermon.

Calling it the &#8220;rim&#8221; underscores the rugged edge Israel had to cross to claim the land.<p>&#8226; This detail roots the text in verifiable geography, showing that the conquest wasn&#8217;t legend but history (<a href="/numbers/21-14.htm">Numbers 21:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; By placing the boundary on the very rim, the verse highlights how completely God delivered the Amorite strongholds into Israel&#8217;s hands (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As far as Mount Siyon</b><p>&#8226; Moving north, Moses marks the opposite limit: &#8220;as far as Mount Siyon.&#8221; <a href="/deuteronomy/3-8.htm">Deuteronomy 3:8&#8211;9</a> links this mountain with Bashan&#8217;s heights, emphasizing the breadth of Israel&#8217;s new borders.<p>&#8226; The sweep from canyon to mountain pictures the fullness of God&#8217;s provision&#8212;He gave valleys for pasture and highlands for defense.<p>&#8226; It also illustrates progression: beginning with the first victory at Aroer and ending with the climactic defeat of Og, king of Bashan, whose territory reached Mount Siyon (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-3.htm">Deuteronomy 3:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That is, Hermon</b><p>&#8226; The parenthetical &#8220;that is, Hermon&#8221; clarifies the mountain&#8217;s more familiar name.
