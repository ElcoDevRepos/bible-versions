The Israelites are reminded of the importance of obedience to God's commandments, which were given through Moses. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings are contingent upon obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). The commandments include moral, ceremonial, and civil laws that were meant to set Israel apart as a holy nation (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The emphasis on "carefully" suggests diligence and intentionality in following God's laws, which is a recurring theme throughout Deuteronomy.<p><b>loving the LORD your God</b><br>This phrase highlights the central command of the Shema, found in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>, which calls for wholehearted love and devotion to God. Love for God is not merely an emotional response but involves commitment and loyalty, demonstrated through obedience to His commandments (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). This love is foundational to the covenant and is expected to permeate every aspect of life, influencing decisions and actions.<p><b>and walking in His ways at all times</b><br>Walking in God's ways implies living a life that reflects His character and commands. This metaphor of "walking" suggests a continuous, active lifestyle of faithfulness and righteousness (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). It involves imitating God's attributes, such as justice, mercy, and humility. The phrase "at all times" underscores the consistency and perseverance required in the believer's journey, aligning with the New Testament call to live by the Spirit (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>).<p><b>then you are to add three more cities to these three</b><br>This instruction pertains to the cities of refuge, which were established as places of asylum for those who committed unintentional manslaughter (<a href="/numbers/35-9.htm">Numbers 35:9-15</a>). Initially, three cities were designated on the east side of the Jordan River, and three more were to be added in the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/20-7.htm">Joshua 20:7-9</a>). The provision for additional cities reflects God's justice and mercy, ensuring that His people have access to protection and fair trial. It also anticipates the expansion of Israel's territory, contingent upon their faithfulness. The cities of refuge can be seen as a type of Christ, who provides refuge and salvation for sinners (<a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is delivering God's commandments to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving the law as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cities_of_refuge.htm">Cities of Refuge</a></b><br>Designated cities where someone who has killed another unintentionally can flee for safety.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is giving these commandments through Moses.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commandments.htm">Obedience to God's Commandments</a></b><br>The verse emphasizes the importance of carefully observing God's commandments as a condition for receiving His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/love_and_relationship_with_god.htm">Love and Relationship with God</a></b><br>Loving the LORD and walking in His ways is central to the covenant relationship between God and His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/justice_and_mercy.htm">Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>The provision of additional cities of refuge highlights God's concern for justice tempered with mercy, providing protection for those who have unintentionally caused harm.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/expansion_of_god's_provision.htm">Expansion of God's Provision</a></b><br>The command to add more cities as the nation grows reflects God's foresight and care for His people&#8217;s needs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_and_blessing.htm">Faithfulness and Blessing</a></b><br>The promise of additional cities is contingent upon the Israelites' faithfulness, illustrating the principle that obedience leads to blessing.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_19_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 19:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_19_9_Importance_of_obeying_God.htm">How does Deuteronomy 19:9 emphasize the importance of obeying God's commandments today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_does_loving_God_fulfill_Deut_19_9.htm">What role does loving God play in fulfilling Deuteronomy 19:9's requirements?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Deut_19_9_justice_today.htm">How can we apply the principle of justice from Deuteronomy 19:9 in society?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Deut_19_9_to_Jesus_love_teachings.htm">How does Deuteronomy 19:9 connect with Jesus' teachings on love and obedience?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_follow_His_ways.htm">What steps can we take to "walk in His ways" as instructed here?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Deut_19_9_God_s_justice_mercy.htm">How does Deuteronomy 19:9 reflect God's justice and mercy in the Old Testament?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Deuteronomy_19_9_laws.htm">What historical context influenced the laws in Deuteronomy 19:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Deut_19_9_s_link_to_sanctuary_cities.htm">How does Deuteronomy 19:9 relate to the concept of sanctuary cities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_19.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_does_1_kings_19_fit_with_elijah's_story.htm">How does 1 Kings 19 fit with other biblical accounts of Elijah and the broader historical context, considering potential timeline or narrative discrepancies?
