It highlights their dependence on the hospitality of the nations they encountered. In the ancient Near East, providing food to travelers was a common practice, often seen as a duty of hospitality. The Israelites' willingness to purchase food rather than take it by force demonstrates their desire to maintain peaceful relations with the surrounding nations. This request also underscores the importance of community and mutual support, as seen in other biblical passages like <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18:1-8</a>, where Abraham provides for his visitors.<p><b>and water to drink</b><br>Water was a precious resource in the arid regions of the Near East. The Israelites' request for water emphasizes their vulnerability and need for cooperation with the local inhabitants. This request is reminiscent of other biblical accounts where water is a central theme, such as Moses striking the rock to provide water for the people (<a href="/exodus/17-6.htm">Exodus 17:6</a>). Water is often symbolic of life and sustenance in the Bible, pointing to spiritual truths, as seen in <a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, where Jesus speaks of the living water.<p><b>in exchange for silver</b><br>The mention of silver indicates a formal transaction, suggesting that the Israelites were prepared to engage in fair trade rather than rely on charity. Silver was a common medium of exchange in the ancient world, used for trade and commerce. This willingness to pay reflects the Israelites' respect for the property and resources of others, aligning with the broader biblical principle of fairness and justice in economic dealings, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-35.htm">Leviticus 19:35-36</a>.<p><b>Only let us pass through on foot</b><br>This request for passage underscores the Israelites' intention to travel peacefully through the land without causing disruption or conflict. The phrase "on foot" suggests a non-threatening presence, as they were not seeking to settle or conquer but merely to transit. This approach is consistent with God's instructions to the Israelites to avoid conflict with certain nations during their journey (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4-5</a>). The request for peaceful passage can be seen as a type of Christ, who also sought peace and reconciliation, as reflected in <a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, led by Moses, who are journeying through the wilderness towards the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/edomites.htm">Edomites</a></b><br>The descendants of Esau, living in the region of Edom, whom the Israelites are requesting passage from.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is negotiating with the Edomites for safe passage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_journey.htm">Wilderness Journey</a></b><br>The period of 40 years when the Israelites wandered in the desert before entering the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/principle_of_fair_exchange.htm">Principle of Fair Exchange</a></b><br>The Israelites' offer to buy food and water reflects a principle of fairness and respect for others' resources.

Rather than demanding handouts, Israel shows respect for the sovereignty of Sihon&#8217;s land (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-26.htm">Deuteronomy 2:26-27</a>).<p>&#8226; The offer reflects a heart of integrity&#8212;God&#8217;s people refuse to take what is not theirs (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/2-6.htm">Deuteronomy 2:6</a>; <a href="/numbers/20-19.htm">Numbers 20:19</a>).<p>&#8226; It also displays trust: though God had miraculously fed them with manna, they are ready to use ordinary means when available (<a href="/exodus/16-35.htm">Exodus 16:35</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-12.htm">Philippians 4:12</a>).<p>&#8226; By paying, they remove any suspicion of ulterior motives, paving the way for peaceful passage (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and water to drink</b><p>Water is life in the desert.
