It calls the Israelites to be aware and conscious of the lessons from their past. The use of "this day" is a common biblical motif that underscores the importance of the present moment in making a covenantal decision (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p><b>that it is not your children who have known and seen</b><br>The focus here is on the firsthand experience of the current generation. The children did not witness the events of the Exodus and the wilderness journey. This highlights the importance of passing down faith and experiences to future generations, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a>, where parents are instructed to teach their children diligently.<p><b>the discipline of the LORD your God:</b><br>The term "discipline" refers to the corrective and instructive actions of God. This includes the trials and challenges faced during the wilderness period, which were meant to teach reliance on God (<a href="/hebrews/12-5.htm">Hebrews 12:5-11</a>). It reflects God's role as a Father who disciplines those He loves.<p><b>His greatness,</b><br>This phrase points to the majesty and supreme power of God. The Israelites witnessed God's greatness through miraculous events such as the plagues in Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea. This is a reminder of God's sovereignty and His ability to fulfill His promises (<a href="/psalms/145-3.htm">Psalm 145:3</a>).<p><b>His mighty hand,</b><br>The "mighty hand" symbolizes God's power and intervention in human history. It is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, particularly in the context of the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/13-9.htm">Exodus 13:9</a>). This imagery conveys God's strength in delivering His people from bondage.<p><b>and His outstretched arm;</b><br>The "outstretched arm" further emphasizes God's active involvement in the deliverance of Israel. It is a metaphor for God's readiness to save and protect His people. This phrase is often associated with God's acts of salvation and judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/32-21.htm">Jeremiah 32:21</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, whose sacrifice on the cross is seen as the ultimate act of God's outstretched arm to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, Moses is addressing the Israelites, reminding them of their experiences with God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience of Moses' speech, they are the generation that witnessed God's miracles and discipline in the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who demonstrated His power and discipline to the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_wanderings.htm">Wilderness Wanderings</a></b><br>The period when the Israelites traveled through the desert after their exodus from Egypt, experiencing God's provision and discipline.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites are preparing to enter, contingent upon their obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/remembering_god's_works.htm">Remembering God's Works</a></b><br>The importance of recalling and teaching the mighty acts of God to future generations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_discipline.htm">The Role of Discipline</a></b><br>Understanding God's discipline as an expression of His love and a means to guide His people towards righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generational_responsibility.htm">Generational Responsibility</a></b><br>The responsibility of one generation to pass down the knowledge and experiences of God's faithfulness to the next.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_faith.htm">Obedience and Faith</a></b><br>The necessity of obedience to God's commands as a demonstration of faith and trust in His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Trusting in God's unchanging nature and His commitment to fulfill His promises, as demonstrated throughout history.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_11_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 11:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_11_2_Remember_God_s_discipline.htm">How does Deuteronomy 11:2 emphasize the importance of remembering God's discipline today?
