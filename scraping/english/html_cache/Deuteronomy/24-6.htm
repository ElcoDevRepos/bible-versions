The lower millstone was stationary, while the upper millstone was moved to crush the grain. Taking these as security for a debt would deprive a person of their ability to prepare food, directly impacting their survival. This command reflects the broader biblical principle of protecting the vulnerable and ensuring that basic human needs are met, as seen in <a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26-27</a>, where a cloak taken as a pledge must be returned by sunset.<p><b>because that would be taking one&#8217;s livelihood as security</b><br>The livelihood of an individual in ancient agrarian societies was closely tied to their ability to produce food. By prohibiting the taking of millstones as collateral, the law safeguarded a person's means of sustenance. This reflects God's concern for justice and compassion, ensuring that economic transactions do not exploit or harm the debtor. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus emphasizes care for the poor and vulnerable, as in <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>.

Similar concern appears in <a href="/exodus/22-26.htm">Exodus 22:26-27</a>, where a debtor&#8217;s cloak must be returned before nightfall.<p>&#8226; God affirms that debts must not be collected in ways that destroy the debtor&#8217;s ability to survive (<a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35-37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or even an upper millstone</b><p>&#8226; The upper stone is smaller and movable, yet still indispensable.
