The use of "LORD" (YHWH) signifies God's eternal and unchanging nature, highlighting His faithfulness to His promises. The phrase "your God" personalizes this relationship, reminding the Israelites of their unique status as God's chosen people. This covenantal language is consistent throughout Deuteronomy, reinforcing the idea that God is actively involved in the lives of His people.<p><b>will give them over to you</b><br>This promise of divine intervention assures the Israelites of victory over their enemies. The phrase "give them over" suggests a transfer of power, where God actively delivers the enemies into the hands of Israel. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty over nations and His ability to orchestrate events according to His will. It also echoes earlier promises made to the patriarchs, such as in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>, where God promised Abraham the land of Canaan.<p><b>and throw them into great confusion</b><br>The concept of God causing confusion among Israel's enemies is a recurring theme in the Old Testament. This divine action often leads to the self-destruction of Israel's foes, as seen in the battles of Gideon (<a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>) and Jehoshaphat (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-22.htm">2 Chronicles 20:22-23</a>). The confusion serves as a supernatural intervention that ensures victory for God's people, demonstrating His power and the futility of opposing Him.<p><b>until they are destroyed</b><br>The complete destruction of Israel's enemies is both a fulfillment of divine justice and a means of protecting the Israelites from idolatry and moral corruption. This phrase underscores the seriousness of God's commands regarding the conquest of Canaan, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-5</a>. The destruction of these nations is not merely a military objective but a spiritual necessity to maintain the purity and holiness of God's people. This also foreshadows the ultimate victory over sin and evil through Jesus Christ, who destroys the works of the devil (1 <a href="/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who promises to deliver His people from their enemies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being led into the Promised Land and are recipients of God's promises and commands.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanites.htm">Canaanites</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the Promised Land, whom God has commanded the Israelites to drive out due to their idolatry and wickedness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land (Canaan)</a></b><br>The land promised by God to Abraham and his descendants, representing God's faithfulness and provision.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is delivering God's commands and promises to the people before they enter the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_battle.htm">God's Sovereignty in Battle</a></b><br>God is in control of all circumstances, including the battles we face.
