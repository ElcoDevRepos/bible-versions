These tribes had requested to settle on the east side of the Jordan River, in the land of Gilead and Bashan, because it was suitable for their large herds and flocks. The mention of "wives" and "children" highlights the importance of family and the continuation of the Israelite community. The inclusion of "livestock" underscores the agrarian lifestyle of the Israelites and the economic importance of their herds. This phrase reflects the patriarchal structure of ancient Israelite society, where men were often responsible for military duties while women and children maintained the home and livestock.<p><b>I know that you have much livestock&#8212;</b><br>This acknowledgment by Moses indicates an understanding of the tribes' needs and their economic situation. The abundance of livestock suggests prosperity and God's blessing, as livestock were a primary measure of wealth in ancient times. This phrase also implies God's provision and the fulfillment of His promise to bless the descendants of Abraham. The mention of livestock connects to earlier biblical narratives, such as the wealth of Abraham and Job, and foreshadows the prosperity that Israel would experience in the Promised Land.<p><b>may remain in the cities I have given you,</b><br>The cities mentioned here refer to those in the Transjordan region, which had been conquered and allocated to these tribes. This allocation was part of the broader conquest of Canaan, fulfilling God's promise to give the Israelites a land of their own. The phrase "I have given you" emphasizes God's sovereignty and the divine origin of their inheritance. It also reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God provides for His people. The security of these cities allowed the men to join the rest of Israel in the conquest of Canaan, trusting that their families and possessions were safe. This arrangement demonstrates the communal responsibility and unity among the tribes, as they supported each other in fulfilling God's command to take possession of the land.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, delivering God's instructions to the people as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who are on the brink of entering the land promised to their ancestors.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/reubenites,_gadites,_and_the_half-tribe_of_manasseh.htm">Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh</a></b><br>Tribes of Israel who requested to settle on the east side of the Jordan River, where the land was suitable for their livestock.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/cities_of_refuge.htm">Cities of refuge</a></b><br>Cities designated for the safety and protection of those who accidentally committed manslaughter, mentioned in the broader context of the Israelites' settlement.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/family_and_community_priorities.htm">Family and Community Priorities</a></b><br>The passage highlights the importance of caring for one's family and community.
