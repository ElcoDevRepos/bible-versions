In ancient Israel, teaching children about God's acts was crucial for maintaining covenant faithfulness. This aligns with the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>), which stresses the importance of teaching God's commandments to children.<p><b>&#8220;We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt</b><br>This statement serves as a reminder of Israel's past bondage and God's deliverance. It highlights the historical reality of Israel's slavery, which is corroborated by Egyptian records of Semitic peoples in Egypt. Theologically, it underscores human helplessness and the need for divine intervention. This bondage is a type of spiritual slavery to sin, from which Christ delivers believers (<a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34-36</a>).<p><b>but the LORD brought us out of Egypt</b><br>This phrase points to God's direct intervention in history. The Exodus is a foundational event for Israel, symbolizing salvation and liberation. It is frequently referenced throughout the Bible (e.g., Psalms, Prophets) as a demonstration of God's power and faithfulness. The Exodus prefigures Christ's redemptive work, as He brings believers out of the bondage of sin.<p><b>with a mighty hand</b><br>This expression signifies God's power and sovereignty. The "mighty hand" refers to the miraculous signs and wonders performed during the Exodus, such as the plagues and the parting of the Red Sea. It is a testament to God's ability to save and protect His people. This phrase is echoed in other scriptures (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34, 5</a>:15) and is a reminder of God's strength in delivering His people, foreshadowing the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who delivered God's laws and commandments to the people.

Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me." The keeping of the Law of Jehovah by Israel as a nation in the land that He gave them was the final cause of their national existence. This fundamental fact must never be forgotten. This alone would justify what had been done to Egypt.
