In the context of ancient Israel, "holy things" refers to items consecrated for worship and sacrifice. The concept of holiness is central to the Mosaic Law, where certain objects, places, and people are designated as holy, meaning they are set apart for God's purposes. This reflects the broader biblical theme of holiness, where God calls His people to be distinct and dedicated to Him (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>).<p><b>and your vow offerings</b><br>Vow offerings were voluntary commitments made by individuals to God, often in response to a specific blessing or deliverance. These offerings were a way for the Israelites to express gratitude and fulfill promises made to God. The practice of making vows is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in the story of Hannah, who vowed to dedicate her son Samuel to the Lord (<a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>). Vows were taken seriously, and fulfilling them was a matter of integrity and faithfulness to God.<p><b>and go to the place the LORD will choose</b><br>This phrase refers to the centralization of worship in a specific location chosen by God, which would later be identified as Jerusalem. The directive to go to a designated place underscores the importance of unity and communal worship among the Israelites. It also foreshadows the establishment of the Temple in Jerusalem, which becomes the focal point of Jewish worship. This centralization is significant in maintaining the purity of worship and preventing the influence of pagan practices. The concept of a chosen place for worship is fulfilled in the New Testament through Jesus Christ, who becomes the ultimate temple and dwelling place of God among His people (<a
