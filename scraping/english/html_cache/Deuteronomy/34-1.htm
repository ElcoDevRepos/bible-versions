This area was significant as it was the final encampment of the Israelites before entering the Promised Land. Moab was historically a land of the descendants of Lot, and its plains were a place of preparation and reflection for the Israelites. This ascent marks the culmination of Moses' leadership journey.<p><b>to Mount Nebo</b><br>Mount Nebo is a peak in the Abarim range, located in present-day Jordan. It holds great significance as the place where Moses viewed the Promised Land before his death. Archaeological findings suggest that Mount Nebo was a site of religious importance, with remnants of ancient churches and mosaics. This mountain symbolizes the transition from the wilderness wanderings to the fulfillment of God's promise.<p><b>to the top of Pisgah</b><br>Pisgah is often considered a specific peak or ridge on Mount Nebo. The term "Pisgah" can refer to a high place or summit, emphasizing the vantage point Moses had. This location provided a panoramic view of the land God had promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It represents a place of revelation and divine encounter.<p><b>which faces Jericho</b><br>Jericho, one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world, lies directly across the Jordan River from Mount Nebo. Known as the "City of Palms," Jericho was the first city conquered by the Israelites under Joshua's leadership. Its mention here foreshadows the imminent conquest and settlement of the land. Jericho's strategic location made it a key entry point into Canaan.<p><b>And the LORD showed him the whole land</b><br>This divine revelation to Moses was a fulfillment of God's promise, allowing him to see the land he had longed to enter. Although Moses would not physically enter the Promised Land, God graciously granted him a vision of its expanse. This act underscores God's faithfulness and the importance of spiritual sight over physical possession.<p><b>from Gilead as far as Dan</b><br>Gilead, a region east of the Jordan, was known for its balm and fertile land. It represents the northernmost part of the territory visible to Moses. Dan, located in the far north of Israel, marks the extent of the Promised Land's northern boundary. This phrase highlights the vastness of the land promised to the Israelites, from the lush hills of Gilead to the distant reaches of Dan, encompassing the full scope of God's covenant promise.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites who has guided them out of Egypt and through the wilderness.

The verse highlights God&#8217;s faithfulness to His covenant, Moses&#8217; steadfast obedience to the end, and the seamless transition toward Joshua&#8217;s leadership. It assures readers that every detail of God&#8217;s Word is accurate, literal, and certain to be fulfilled.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/34.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XXXIV.<p>DEATH OF MOSES.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Pisgah.</span>--See <a href="/numbers/21-20.htm" title="And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks toward Jeshimon.">Numbers 21:20</a>.

Whether He then showed it to him under the names which are given here or not is a question we cannot answer. Many deeply interesting queries suggest themselves here. Did Moses go up alone? or did Joshua accompany him? Who wrote these particulars of <span class= "ital">what </span>was shown to him, and how were the particulars known? I am disposed to believe that as Elijah and Elisha "still went on and talked," until that chariot of fire appeared which "parted them both asunder," so it was with Moses and Joshua--that Moses' minister attended him until Jehovah withdrew him from his sight. But it speaks well for Joshua's character--in fact, it is altogether characteristic of the man--that in this record of the death of the great lawgiver he should have concealed himself and every other figure from sight except Jehovah and His servant Moses. Rashi, in his comment on this scene, says that the Lord showed Moses not only the land, but what should happen therein, in every part. But of this we know nothing. We know that the spectacle was complete. Probably "the eye that was not dim" was enabled to see farther than human eye ever saw from such a height before. "The utmost sea" is full fifty miles away from that spot.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah</span>;
