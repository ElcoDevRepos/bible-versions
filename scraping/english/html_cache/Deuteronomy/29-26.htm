The act of serving other gods was a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). Historically, the Israelites were surrounded by nations with polytheistic beliefs, such as the Canaanites, whose gods included Baal and Asherah. This cultural influence often led Israel astray. The phrase also reflects the spiritual adultery that God condemned through prophets like Hosea, who used marriage as a metaphor for Israel's relationship with God (Hosea 1-3).<p><b>and they worshiped gods they had not known</b><br>This part emphasizes the foreign nature of these deities to the Israelites. Unlike the God of Israel, who revealed Himself through mighty acts and covenants, these gods were unknown and unproven. The Israelites' worship of these gods was not based on any historical relationship or divine revelation. This ignorance is condemned in <a href="/jeremiah/10-2.htm">Jeremiah 10:2-5</a>, where the prophet warns against adopting the customs of the nations. The phrase also underscores the futility of idolatry, as these gods could not provide the guidance or protection that the true God offered.<p><b>gods that the LORD had not given to them</b><br>This phrase indicates that the true God had not sanctioned or provided these deities for worship. It underscores the exclusivity of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God alone was to be worshiped (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>). The LORD's provision of Himself as the sole deity is a recurring theme, as seen in the Shema. This exclusivity is further reinforced in the New Testament, where Jesus Christ is presented as the fulfillment of God's promises and the only way to the Father (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The phrase also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the futility of seeking spiritual fulfillment outside His provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is delivering the message of Deuteronomy to the people.
