Esau, the brother of Jacob, settled in the region of Seir, which is located in the mountainous area southeast of the Dead Sea. The Edomites are often mentioned in the Bible as relatives of the Israelites, and their land was not to be taken by Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-5.htm">Deuteronomy 2:5</a>). This highlights God's sovereignty and His role in establishing nations and their boundaries. The Edomites' possession of Seir was a fulfillment of God's promise to Esau, showing His faithfulness to His word (<a href="/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8</a>).<p><b>when He destroyed the Horites from before them</b><br>The Horites were the original inhabitants of the land of Seir before the Edomites. They are mentioned in <a href="/genesis/14-6.htm">Genesis 14:6</a> and are considered to be a group of people who lived in the region before being displaced. God's destruction of the Horites to make way for Esau's descendants demonstrates His active role in history and His power to remove and establish peoples according to His divine plan. This act of displacement is similar to what God would later do for Israel in Canaan, showing a pattern of divine intervention in the establishment of His chosen peoples.<p><b>They drove them out and have lived in their place to this day</b><br>This phrase indicates the successful settlement of the Edomites in the land of Seir, which they maintained up to the time of the writing of Deuteronomy. The phrase "to this day" suggests a long-term occupation, emphasizing the stability and permanence of God's provision for Esau's descendants. This enduring settlement serves as a testament to God's promises and His ability to fulfill them over generations. It also serves as a parallel to the Israelites' future conquest and settlement of Canaan, reinforcing the theme of divine providence and faithfulness throughout the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/descendants_of_esau.htm">Descendants of Esau</a></b><br>Also known as the Edomites, they are the descendants of Esau, the brother of Jacob.

Moses pauses to remind the people of God&#8217;s past actions toward other nations. Verse 22 says:<p>&#8220;just as He had done for the descendants of Esau who lived in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them. They drove them out and have lived in their place to this day.&#8221;<p>The statement ties directly to <a href="/deuteronomy/2-5.htm">Deuteronomy 2:5</a>, where God forbids Israel to fight Edom because He already assigned that territory to Esau&#8217;s line (compare <a href="/genesis/36-6.htm">Genesis 36:6-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What God Did for Esau&#8217;s Line</b><p>&#8226; God personally &#8220;destroyed the Horites&#8221; so Esau&#8217;s descendants could settle in Seir (see <a href="/deuteronomy/2-12.htm">Deuteronomy 2:12</a>).<p>&#8226; This mirrors His earlier removal of the Amorites before Israel would later inherit Canaan (compare <a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27-30</a>).<p>&#8226; The permanence of Esau&#8217;s occupation&#8212;&#8220;to this day&#8221;&#8212;emphasizes God&#8217;s faithfulness to keep territorial promises long term.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Fate of the Horites</b><p>&#8226; The Horites, early inhabitants of Seir (<a href="/genesis/14-6.htm">Genesis 14:6</a>), were displaced and judged by God.<p>&#8226; Although Esau&#8217;s men &#8220;drove them out,&#8221; the verse first credits the Lord with their destruction, highlighting divine sovereignty over human conflict (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Their eradication foreshadows how the Canaanite nations would face Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-1.htm">Deuteronomy 9:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why Moses Reminds Israel of This</b><p>&#8226; To reassure: If God secured land for Edom, He will certainly secure Israel&#8217;s promised land (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p>&#8226; To warn: Israel must respect boundaries God set for other peoples (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>).<p>&#8226; To illustrate consistency: The Lord governs all nations&#8217; rises and falls (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>) and keeps every covenant He makes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Lessons for Us Today</b><p>&#8226; God directs history; nations prosper or pass away at His word (<a href="/job/12-23.htm">Job 12:23</a>).<p>&#8226; His promises are reliable across generations.
