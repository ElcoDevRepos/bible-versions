It commemorates the Israelites' 40 years of wandering in the desert after their exodus from Egypt, during which they lived in temporary shelters. This feast is a time of joy and thanksgiving, reflecting God's provision and protection. It is also a prophetic symbol of the future gathering of all nations to worship God, as seen in <a href="/zechariah/14-16.htm">Zechariah 14:16-19</a>.<p><b>for seven days</b><br>The seven-day duration of the feast signifies completeness and perfection in biblical numerology. This period allows for a full cycle of worship and celebration, mirroring the creation week. It also provides ample time for reflection on God's faithfulness and the temporary nature of earthly life, pointing to the eternal rest found in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).<p><b>after you have gathered the produce of your threshing floor and your winepress</b><br>This timing aligns the feast with the agricultural cycle, specifically the harvest of grains and grapes. It is a time of thanksgiving for the bounty provided by God. The threshing floor and winepress symbolize the process of separating and refining, akin to spiritual growth and maturity. The harvest imagery is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus speaks of the harvest as a metaphor for the gathering of believers (<a href="/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37-38</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, who is delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are receiving these instructions as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_tabernacles.htm">Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot)</a></b><br>A Jewish festival lasting seven days, celebrating the harvest and commemorating the Israelites' journey through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/threshing_floor.htm">Threshing Floor</a></b><br>A place where grain is separated from chaff, symbolizing the harvest and God's provision.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/winepress.htm">Winepress</a></b><br>A facility for extracting juice from grapes, representing abundance and joy in God's blessings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/celebration_of_god's_provision.htm">Celebration of God's Provision</a></b><br>The Feast of Tabernacles is a time to celebrate God's provision and faithfulness.

God is not merely permitting but directing His covenant people to rejoice in His presence. Celebration is an act of obedience that recognizes His goodness (<a href="/psalms/100-2.htm">Psalm 100:2</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>). Just as Israel was required to present themselves before the LORD three times a year (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>), this specific feast stands as a reminder that holiness and happiness go together in God&#8217;s design.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the Feast of Tabernacles</b><p>Also called Booths or Sukkot, this feast commemorates Israel&#8217;s wilderness journey, when the LORD sheltered them under makeshift dwellings (<a href="/leviticus/23-42.htm">Leviticus 23:42-43</a>). By living in booths, families visibly recall God&#8217;s faithful provision on their way to the Promised Land (<a href="/nehemiah/8-14.htm">Nehemiah 8:14-17</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus attends this very feast, ultimately declaring Himself the source of living water (<a href="/john/7-2.htm">John 7:2, 37</a>-38), revealing its deeper fulfillment in Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for seven days</b><p>A full week underscores completeness and fullness of joy. The number seven frequently marks God-ordained cycles (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>; <a href="/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34</a>). Seven days allowed entire households to step away from daily routines, rest, and focus on the LORD&#8217;s past salvation and future promises, pointing toward the ultimate rest in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>after you have gathered</b><p>Timing follows the final harvest, anchoring worship in God&#8217;s tangible provision. Celebration comes after work, illustrating a rhythm of labor followed by thanksgiving (<a href="/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>). It guards against self-reliance by redirecting credit to the Giver (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-17.htm">Deuteronomy 8:17-18</a>; <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the produce of your threshing floor</b><p>Grain represents daily bread. By offering from the threshing floor, Israel honored God with staples rather than leftovers (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>). The feast transformed ordinary food into a testimony of covenant faithfulness&#8212;He feeds bodies and souls alike (<a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11, 33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and your winepress</b><p>Wine symbolizes joy and abundance (<a href="/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>). Bringing wine acknowledges that gladness itself is a gift from God, not a product of human ingenuity (<a href="/joel/2-19.htm">Joel 2:19, 24</a>). The pairing of grain and wine anticipates Communion, where Christ offers His body and blood as the true, eternal provision (<a href="/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/16-13.htm">Deuteronomy 16:13</a> calls God&#8217;s people to an annual, week-long celebration of His faithful provision after the harvest. By living in booths, eating grain, and sharing wine, Israel remembers past deliverance, rejoices in present blessings, and looks forward to future fulfillment in Christ. The verse teaches that thanksgiving is not optional but essential, binding together work and worship, memory and hope, daily bread and eternal life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><a href="/context/deuteronomy/16-13.htm" title="You shall observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that you have gathered in your corn and your wine:">Deuteronomy 16:13-15</a>. <span class= "bld">THE FEAST OF TABERNACLES.</span><p>(13) <span class= "bld">Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days.</span>--For details of the observance see the passages already referred to in Exodus, Leviticus and Numbers, but more especially <a href="/context/leviticus/23-33.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Leviticus 23:33-43</a>.<p>(14) <span class= "bld">Thou, and thy son . . .</span>--The rejoicing of the Feast of Tabernacles was proverbial among the Jews. On the persons who are to share the joy, Rashi has an interesting note. "The Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow,--My four (Jehovah's), over against thy four--thy son, thy daughter, thy manservant, thy maidservant. If thou wilt make My four to rejoice, I will rejoice thy four."<p>(15) <span class= "bld">Seven days.</span>--An eighth day is mentioned both in <a href="/leviticus/23-36.htm" title="Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation to you; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:36</a> and <a href="/numbers/29-35.htm" title="On the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly: you shall do no servile work therein:">Numbers 29:35</a>. But the seven days of this feast are also spoken of in both those passages (<a href="/leviticus/23-36.htm" title="Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation to you; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:36</a> and <a href="/numbers/29-12.htm" title="And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month you shall have an holy convocation; you shall do no servile work, and you shall keep a feast to the LORD seven days:">Numbers 29:12</a>). There is, therefore, no contradiction between the two passages. The eighth day is treated apart from the first seven days of the Feast of Tabernacles, somewhat in the same way as the Passover is always distinguished in the Pentateuch from the six days which followed it, and which are called the Feast of Unleavened bread. The reason for the distinction in that case becomes clear in the fulfilment of the feast by our Lord. The Passover is <span class= "ital">His sacrifice and death. We keep </span>the feast of <span class= "ital">unleavened </span>bread by serving Him in "<span class= "ital">sincerity and truth." </span>The Feast of Tabernacles has not yet been fulfilled by our Lord like the two other great feasts of the Jewish calendar. Unfulfilled prophecies regarding it may be pointed out, as in Zechariah 14. Our Lord refused to signalise that feast by any public manifestation (<a href="/context/john/7-2.htm" title="Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.">John 7:2-10</a>). There may, therefore, be some reason for separating the eighth and last day of the Feast of Tabernacles from the former seven, which will appear in its fulfilment in the kingdom of God. It is remarkable that the dedication of Solomon's temple, the commencement of the second temple and the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, all occurred about the time of the Feast of Tabernacles. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-15.</span> - The <span class="accented">Feast of Tabernacles</span>, properly, <span class="accented">Booths</span> (cf. <a href="/leviticus/23-33.htm">Leviticus 23:33-44</a>; <a href="/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12-38</a>). This feast was to be observed at the end of harvest, after the corn had been gathered into granaries, and the produce of the vineyard had been put through the press. Nothing is added here to the instructions already given respecting this festival; only the observance of it at the appointed sanctuary is enforced, and stress is laid on their making not only their sons and daughters and domestics, but also the Levite, the fatherless, the widow, and the stranger participators in their rejoicings.
