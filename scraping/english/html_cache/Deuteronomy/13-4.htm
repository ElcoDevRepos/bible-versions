In the context of Deuteronomy, Moses is reiterating the importance of loyalty to God as the Israelites prepare to enter the Promised Land. The command to "follow" implies a journey or path, suggesting that faithfulness to God is an ongoing process. This echoes the call to discipleship found in the New Testament, where Jesus invites His followers to "take up their cross and follow Me" (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>).<p><b>and fear Him.</b><br>The fear of the LORD is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, signifying reverence, awe, and respect for God's holiness and power. This fear is not about terror but about recognizing God's authority and majesty. <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a> states, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom," indicating that a proper understanding of God leads to wise living. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, fearing God was foundational to maintaining the covenant relationship.<p><b>Keep His commandments</b><br>Obedience to God's commandments is central to the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The commandments, including the Ten Commandments, were given to guide the Israelites in living a life that reflects God's character. This call to obedience is mirrored in the New Testament, where Jesus says, "If you love Me, you will keep My commandments" (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). The commandments serve as a moral compass and a means to demonstrate love for God.<p><b>and listen to His voice;</b><br>Listening to God's voice implies an active engagement with His word and a readiness to respond. In the historical context, God spoke through prophets, leaders like Moses, and through the Law. Today, Christians believe God speaks through Scripture, the Holy Spirit, and the teachings of Jesus. The importance of listening is underscored in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, which urges believers to be "doers of the word, and not hearers only."<p><b>serve Him</b><br>Service to God involves worship, obedience, and dedication. In the ancient Near Eastern context, serving a deity was a common practice, but for Israel, it was unique because it involved a personal relationship with a living God. This service is not just ritualistic but encompasses all aspects of life. Jesus exemplified this service, stating, "The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve" (<a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>).<p><b>and hold fast to Him.</b><br>Holding fast to God suggests a deep, unwavering commitment and trust. This phrase conveys the idea of clinging to God in faith, especially in times of trial or temptation. It reflects the covenant loyalty expected of Israel and is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to "hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering" (<a href="/hebrews/10-23.htm">Hebrews 10:23</a>). This steadfastness is a mark of true faith and devotion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and commandments to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving instructions on how to live faithfully in the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God whom the Israelites are commanded to follow, fear, and serve.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, where the Israelites are to live according to God's laws.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_prophets.htm">False Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals who may lead the Israelites astray, prompting the need for this commandment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/w/walking_with_god.htm">Walking with God</a></b><br>To "walk after the LORD" means to live a life that reflects His character and teachings.
