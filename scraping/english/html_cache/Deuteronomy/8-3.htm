The humbling process was meant to teach reliance on God rather than self-sufficiency. This theme of humility is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>, which emphasizes the importance of humility before God.<p><b>and in your hunger</b><br>The Israelites' hunger in the wilderness was a test of faith and dependence on God. This period of deprivation was a reminder of their need for divine provision, similar to the trials faced by other biblical figures like Elijah, who relied on God's provision during a drought (1 Kings 17).<p><b>He gave you manna to eat</b><br>Manna was a miraculous provision from God, described as bread from heaven (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>). It symbolizes God's ability to provide for His people in unexpected ways. Manna is also seen as a type of Christ, the true bread from heaven, as Jesus explains in <a href="/john/6-31.htm">John 6:31-35</a>.<p><b>which neither you nor your fathers had known</b><br>This highlights the uniqueness of God's provision. Manna was unprecedented, emphasizing that God's ways and means are beyond human understanding. It serves as a reminder of <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>, where God's thoughts and ways are described as higher than ours.<p><b>so that you might understand</b><br>The purpose of the manna and the humbling was educational. God intended to teach the Israelites a deeper spiritual truth, much like the parables of Jesus, which were designed to reveal spiritual truths to those willing to listen (<a href="/matthew/13-10.htm">Matthew 13:10-17</a>).<p><b>that man does not live on bread alone</b><br>This phrase underscores the insufficiency of physical sustenance alone for true life. It is famously quoted by Jesus during His temptation in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>), where He emphasizes reliance on God's word over physical needs.<p><b>but on every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD</b><br>The emphasis here is on the life-giving power of God's word. Just as physical bread sustains the body, God's word sustains the soul. This is a central theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>, where God's word is described as a lamp and light for guidance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who delivered God's message and laws to the people.

The verse calls every generation to embrace total dependence on the Lord, feeding daily on Scripture and trusting His faithful, sometimes surprising, provision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">And he . . . suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee.</span>--A process naturally humbling. He might easily have fed them without "suffering them to hunger." But He did not give them the manna until the sixteenth day of the second month of the journey (see <a href="/exodus/16-1.htm" title="And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.">Exodus 16:1</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/16-6.htm" title="And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, At even, then you shall know that the LORD has brought you out from the land of Egypt:">Exodus 16:6-7</a>); and for one whole month they were left to their own resources.

All the natural things which have been called manna (and Dr. Cunningham Geikie, in "Hours with the Bible," has described several) do not afford the least explanation of the bread which God gave Israel to eat.<p><span class= "bld">That man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord.</span>--Not here alone, but throughout the Law, as in the Gospel, we are taught that life is to do the will of God.

"He that doeth the will of God abideth for ever."<p>But the special interest of these words arises from our Lord's use of them in the hour of temptation. He also was led forty days (each day for a year of the Exodus) in the wilderness, living upon the word of God. At the end of that time it was proposed to Him to create bread for Himself. But He had learnt the lesson which Israel was to learn; and so, even when God suffered Him to hunger, He still refused to live by His own word. He preferred that of His Father. "And the angels came and ministered unto Him." It is noticeable that <span class= "ital">all </span>our Lord's answers to the tempter are taken from this exhortation upon the Decalogue in Deuteronomy 6-10.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - God humbled the Israelites by leaving them to suffer hunger from the want of food, and then supplying them with food in a miraculous manner. They were thus taught that their life depended wholly on God, who could, by his own creative power, without any of the ordinary means, provide for the sustaining of their life. <span class="cmt_word">And fed thee with manna</span> (cf. <a href="/exodus/16-15.htm">Exodus 16:15</a>). It is in vain to seek to identify this with any natural product. It was something entirely new to the Israelites - a thing which neither they nor their fathers knew; truly bread from heaven, and which got from them the name of <span class="accented">manna</span> or <span class="accented">man</span>, because, in their wondering ignorance, they knew not what to call it, and so they said one to another, <span class="accented">Manhoo?</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span>), <span class="accented">What is it?</span> and thenceforward called it <span class="accented">man</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>That he might make thee know</span>, etc. "Bread," which the Jews regarded as "the staff of life," stands here, as in other places, for food generally; and the lesson taught the Israelites was that not in one way or by. one kind of means alone could life be sustained, but in the absence of these God could, by his own fiat, provide for the sustenance of his children. <span class="cmt_word">Every word</span> - literally, <span class="accented">all</span>, everything whatever - <span class="cmt_word">that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord</span>, i.e. all means which God has by his word provided, or by his word can provide, for the sustenance of life. So our Lord cites this passage in replying to the tempter, who had suggested that if he was the Son of God he might relieve himself from the pangs of hunger by commanding the stones which lay around to become bread. Our Lord's reply to this is virtually." I have this power, and could use it, but I will not; for this would imply impatience and distrust of God, who has engaged to sustain the life of his servants, and who can, by the mere word of his mouth, by his creative will, provide in an extraordinary way for the sustenance of life when the ordinary means of life are wanting." "Jesus means to say, ' I leave it with God to care for the sustaining of my life, and I will not arbitrarily and for selfish ends help myself by a miracle'" (De Wette, note on Matthew 4:4; see also Meyer on the place). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He humbled you,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#8216;an&#183;n&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
