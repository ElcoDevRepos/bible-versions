In the context of the ancient Near East, where medical knowledge was limited, divine intervention in health was a significant assurance. This phrase echoes <a href="/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>, where God declares Himself as the healer of Israel. It also foreshadows the New Testament, where Jesus heals the sick, demonstrating God's power over physical ailments (<a href="/matthew/8-16.htm">Matthew 8:16-17</a>).<p><b>He will not lay upon you any of the terrible diseases you knew in Egypt,</b><br>The reference to diseases known in Egypt highlights the plagues that afflicted the Egyptians during the Exodus (Exodus 7-12). These plagues were both physical and symbolic, representing God's judgment against the false gods of Egypt. The Israelites, having witnessed these events, would understand this promise as a reassurance of divine protection. This also serves as a reminder of God's past deliverance and His ability to shield His people from harm, as seen in <a href="/psalms/91-3.htm">Psalm 91:3-6</a>.<p><b>but He will inflict them on all who hate you.</b><br>This phrase underscores the principle of divine retribution, where God promises to protect His people and bring judgment upon their enemies. It reflects the covenantal blessings and curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, where those who oppose God's kingdom face judgment (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-21</a>).
