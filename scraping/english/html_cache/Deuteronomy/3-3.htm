It reflects the recurring theme in Deuteronomy of God as the deliverer of His people, fulfilling His promises to the patriarchs. This divine deliverance is a reminder of God's faithfulness and power, as seen in other instances such as the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>) and the conquest of Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2</a>).<p><b>Og king of Bashan</b><br>Og was one of the last of the Rephaim, a group of ancient giants mentioned in the Bible. Bashan was a fertile region east of the Jordan River, known for its strong cities and mighty warriors. The defeat of Og, a formidable opponent, demonstrated God's ability to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. This victory is also referenced in <a href="/psalms/135-11.htm">Psalm 135:11</a> and <a href="/psalms/136-20.htm">Psalm 136:20</a>, highlighting its significance in Israel's history.<p><b>and his whole army into our hands.</b><br>The phrase underscores the totality of the victory granted by God. The complete defeat of Og's forces signifies the comprehensive nature of God's deliverance. This mirrors other biblical accounts where God grants His people victory over their enemies, such as the defeat of the Midianites by Gideon (<a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a>).<p><b>We struck them down until no survivor was left.</b><br>This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of herem, or the devotion of enemies to destruction, which was often commanded by God to prevent the influence of pagan practices on Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>). The complete annihilation of Og's forces ensured the security of Israel and the purity of their worship. This act also prefigures the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ, who conquers all spiritual enemies (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25-26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who delivers His people and fulfills His promises.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/og,_king_of_bashan.htm">Og, King of Bashan</a></b><br>A formidable Amorite king known for his giant stature and stronghold in Bashan, representing a significant threat to Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bashan.htm">Bashan</a></b><br>A fertile region east of the Jordan River, known for its strong cities and mighty warriors.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, led by Moses, journeying to the Promised Land and relying on God's guidance and strength.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_battle.htm">The Battle</a></b><br>A decisive victory granted by God, demonstrating His power and faithfulness to His promises.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_faithfulness.htm">God's Sovereignty and Faithfulness</a></b><br>God is sovereign over all nations and rulers, and His promises are sure.
