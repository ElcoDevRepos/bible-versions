It served as a major encampment site during their 40 years in the desert. This place is often associated with the Israelites' failure to trust God, as it was from here that the spies were sent to scout the Promised Land (<a href="/numbers/13-26.htm">Numbers 13:26</a>). The name "Kadesh" means "holy," indicating its importance. The sending out from Kadesh-barnea marks a pivotal moment of decision and faith for the Israelites.<p><b>He said, &#8220;Go up and possess the land that I have given you.&#8221;</b><br>This command from God underscores His promise to the Israelites to give them the land of Canaan, a promise first made to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The directive to "go up" implies an ascent into the hill country of Canaan, which was geographically higher than the surrounding desert. The phrase "I have given you" indicates that the land was already theirs by divine decree, emphasizing God's sovereignty and faithfulness to His covenant.<p><b>But you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God.</b><br>The rebellion here refers to the Israelites' refusal to enter the Promised Land after the negative report from the majority of the spies (<a href="/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14:1-4</a>). This act of rebellion is a recurring theme in the wilderness narrative, highlighting the Israelites' lack of trust in God's power and promises. Rebellion against God's command is seen as a serious sin, leading to severe consequences, including the 40 years of wandering in the desert.<p><b>You neither believed Him nor obeyed Him.</b><br>This phrase highlights two key aspects of the Israelites' failure: unbelief and disobedience. Belief in God is foundational to the covenant relationship, as seen in Abraham's faith being credited as righteousness (<a href="/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>). The lack of belief here is a direct affront to God's character and promises. Obedience is the expected response to God's commands, and the Israelites' failure to obey is indicative of their spiritual condition. This dual failure is echoed in the New Testament, where faith and obedience are central to the Christian life (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>, <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who commands and guides His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/kadesh-barnea.htm">Kadesh-barnea</a></b><br>A significant location in the wilderness where the Israelites camped and from where they were instructed to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from Egypt and journeyed through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/rebellion.htm">Rebellion</a></b><br>The act of disobedience and lack of faith by the Israelites when they refused to enter the land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_obedience.htm">Faith and Obedience</a></b><br>The Israelites' failure at Kadesh-barnea highlights the necessity of trusting God's promises and acting in obedience.

underscores that the expedition was not human impulse but divine directive&#8212;much like Abraham&#8217;s call in <a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>.<p>&#8226; This moment follows a pattern: God brings His people to a decisive place, gives clear instructions, and expects trust (<a href="/exodus/14-15.htm">Exodus 14:15-16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The history reminds us that God&#8217;s leadings are grounded in His covenant faithfulness; what He initiates He equips (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He said, &#8220;Go up and possess the land that I have given you.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226;
