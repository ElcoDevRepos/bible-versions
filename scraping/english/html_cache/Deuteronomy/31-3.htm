It reflects God's covenant faithfulness, as He personally leads His people, ensuring their success. This divine leadership is reminiscent of God's guidance during the Exodus, where He led the Israelites with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). The crossing over signifies a transition from the wilderness into a land of promise, echoing the crossing of the Red Sea and foreshadowing the crossing of the Jordan River. It underscores God's sovereignty and His role as the ultimate leader and protector of Israel.<p><b>He will destroy these nations before you,</b><br>This phrase highlights God's promise to defeat the Canaanite nations occupying the Promised Land. It reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham regarding the land (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The destruction of these nations is both a judgment against their iniquity and a means to establish Israel in the land. This action is consistent with God's justice and holiness, as the Canaanites' practices were abominable (<a href="/leviticus/18-24.htm">Leviticus 18:24-25</a>). Theologically, it points to God's power to overcome obstacles and enemies, a theme echoed in the New Testament where believers are assured of victory over spiritual adversaries through Christ (<a href="/romans/8-37.htm">Romans 8:37</a>).<p><b>and you will dispossess them.</b><br>This phrase indicates the Israelites' role in taking possession of the land. While God promises victory, the Israelites must actively participate in the conquest. This partnership between divine sovereignty and human responsibility is a recurring biblical theme. The term "dispossess" implies not just military conquest but also the establishment of a new order under God's law. It serves as a reminder of the importance of obedience and faithfulness to God's commands, as seen in the subsequent warnings against adopting the Canaanites' practices (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-5</a>).<p><b>Joshua will cross ahead of you,</b><br>Joshua's leadership is affirmed here, marking the transition from Moses to Joshua. Joshua, whose name means "The LORD is salvation," is a type of Christ, prefiguring Jesus as the one who leads God's people into their spiritual inheritance. Joshua's role is crucial as he embodies faith and courage, qualities necessary for the conquest. His leadership is a continuation of God's plan, as he was previously commissioned by Moses (<a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18-23</a>). This transition also signifies the importance of godly leadership and the passing of the mantle to a new generation.<p><b>as the LORD has said.</b><br>This phrase underscores the reliability of God's word and His faithfulness to His promises. It refers to God's earlier instructions and assurances regarding the leadership transition and the conquest of Canaan (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-38.htm">Deuteronomy 1:38, 3</a>:28). The fulfillment of God's word in Joshua's leadership and the conquest serves as a testament to His unchanging nature and the certainty of His promises. This assurance is echoed throughout Scripture, reminding believers of the trustworthiness of God's word (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who promises to lead and fight for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of Israel who is preparing to pass leadership to Joshua.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua.htm">Joshua</a></b><br>The appointed successor of Moses, tasked with leading Israel into the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Canaan whom God promises to destroy before Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land (Canaan)</a></b><br>The land promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_leadership_and_sovereignty.htm">God's Leadership and Sovereignty</a></b><br>God Himself leads His people, demonstrating His sovereignty and faithfulness.
