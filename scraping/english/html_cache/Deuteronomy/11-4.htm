The Egyptian army, known for its strength and advanced military technology, including horses and chariots, was a formidable force. This event is a testament to God's sovereignty and His ability to protect His people against overwhelming odds. The destruction of the Egyptian army is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing God's deliverance and judgment (<a href="/exodus/14-17.htm">Exodus 14:17-18</a>).<p><b>when He made the waters of the Red Sea engulf them</b><br>The parting of the Red Sea is one of the most dramatic miracles in the Bible, showcasing God's control over nature. The waters, which had been divided to allow the Israelites to pass through on dry ground, returned to their place, engulfing the pursuing Egyptian forces. This act of divine intervention is a powerful reminder of God's ability to save His people and defeat their enemies. The event is referenced in Psalms and other books as a symbol of God's saving power (<a href="/psalms/136-13.htm">Psalm 136:13-15</a>).<p><b>as they pursued you</b><br>The Egyptians pursued the Israelites with the intent to recapture them and bring them back to slavery. This pursuit highlights the desperation and determination of Pharaoh to maintain control over the Israelites, despite the plagues and signs that had already demonstrated God's power. The pursuit also serves as a test of faith for the Israelites, who were trapped between the sea and the approaching army, illustrating the theme of trust in God's deliverance.<p><b>and how He destroyed them completely</b><br>The complete destruction of the Egyptian army signifies the totality of God's victory over His enemies. This act not only delivered the Israelites but also served as a judgment against Egypt for their oppression and idolatry. The thoroughness of this destruction is emphasized to show that God's deliverance is not partial or temporary but absolute and enduring. This event foreshadows the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ.<p><b>even to this day;</b><br>The phrase "even to this day" underscores the lasting impact of God's deliverance and judgment. It serves as a reminder to the Israelites of God's faithfulness and power, encouraging them to trust and obey Him. This enduring memory of God's intervention is meant to strengthen the faith of future generations. The historical reality of this event is a cornerstone of Israel's identity and relationship with God, often recalled in their worship and teachings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who demonstrates His power and faithfulness by delivering His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptian_army.htm">The Egyptian Army</a></b><br>Represents the oppressive force against the Israelites, showcasing the might of Egypt and its reliance on military strength.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_red_sea.htm">The Red Sea</a></b><br>The site of a miraculous event where God parted the waters to deliver Israel and then used the same waters to destroy the Egyptian army.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_the_israelites.htm">Moses and the Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of God's deliverance, led by Moses, who witnessed God's power and protection firsthand.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pursuit.htm">The Pursuit</a></b><br>The event where the Egyptian army chased the Israelites, leading to their ultimate destruction by God's intervention.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>God is in control of all events and can use His creation to accomplish His purposes.

This was not a random disaster; it was God&#8217;s purposeful act to vindicate His name and rescue His people. Think of how each plague had already dismantled Egyptian confidence (<a href="/bsb/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7&#8211;12</a>), and this final act completed the humiliation of Pharaoh&#8217;s forces (<a href="/psalms/136-15.htm">Psalm 136:15</a>). God personally fought for Israel (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>), proving that no earthly power can stand when He rises to defend His covenant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and horses and chariots</b><p>In the ancient world, horses and chariots were the ultimate symbols of speed, strength, and technological superiority (compare <a href="/1_kings/10-26.htm">1 Kings 10:26</a>; <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>). By singling them out, <a href="/deuteronomy/11-4.htm">Deuteronomy 11:4</a> underlines that the very best Egypt could field was powerless before the Lord. <a href="/exodus/15-4.htm">Exodus 15:4&#8211;5</a> sings, &#8220;Pharaoh&#8217;s chariots and his army He has thrown into the sea&#8230;&#8221;. Israel, marching on foot and carrying infants and livestock, faced a mechanized army&#8212;and still won because God fought for them. The lesson: trust in the Lord, not in human hardware (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when He made the waters of the Red Sea engulf them</b><p>The imagery is unforgettable. All night the Lord drove back the sea with a strong east wind (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>). At dawn, &#8220;Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal depth&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27</a>). The waters that had opened a highway for Israel became a grave for Egypt. <a href="/isaiah/51-10.htm">Isaiah 51:10</a> later recalls, &#8220;Was it not You who dried up the sea&#8230; who made the depths of the sea a road for the redeemed to cross over?&#8221;. God controls creation; He can bend nature to deliver His people or to judge His enemies.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as they pursued you</b><p>Egypt&#8217;s pursuit was deliberate, not accidental. <a href="/exodus/14-23.htm">Exodus 14:23</a> notes, &#8220;The Egyptians chased after them&#8212;all Pharaoh&#8217;s horses, chariots, and horsemen&#8221;. God allowed the enemy to enter the pathway through the sea, then closed it. The chase highlights two truths:<p>&#8226; Human opposition to God&#8217;s plan can be zealous and persistent.<p>&#8226; God times His deliverance perfectly&#8212;allowing the enemy enough rope to display their rebellion, then cutting them off (<a href="/nehemiah/9-9.htm">Nehemiah 9:9&#8211;11</a>).<p>Israel could do nothing to stop the chariots behind them or the sea before them. Their only hope was the Lord, and He proved entirely sufficient (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and how He destroyed them completely, even to this day</b><p>The Hebrew expression behind &#8220;destroyed&#8230; completely&#8221; (see <a href="/exodus/14-28.htm">Exodus 14:28</a>) speaks of total annihilation. No soldier, horse, or chariot survived (<a href="/psalms/78-53.htm">Psalm 78:53</a>). &#8220;Even to this day&#8221; in Moses&#8217; generation meant the defeat remained uncontested decades later. Egypt never re-invaded Israel in the wilderness; the memory of God&#8217;s power stood as a deterrent (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9&#8211;10</a>). The ongoing effect reminds believers that when God saves, He saves thoroughly (Jude 24), and His past acts of deliverance provide present confidence for obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-8.htm">Deuteronomy 11:8&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/11-4.htm">Deuteronomy 11:4</a> calls Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;to remember a specific, historic intervention: God shattered Egypt&#8217;s finest army, horses, and chariots by commanding the Red Sea to return upon them while they chased His people. The episode proves His unrivaled power, exposes the folly of trusting human strength, and assures believers that the God who once drowned chariots will still defend those who love and obey Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/11-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
