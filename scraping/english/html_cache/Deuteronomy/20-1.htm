In the ancient Near East, warfare was a common occurrence, and nations often engaged in battles to defend their territory or expand their influence. The Israelites, as God's chosen people, were often called to engage in battles against surrounding nations. This directive implies a proactive stance, indicating that the Israelites would face opposition and must be prepared to confront it.<p><b>and see horses, chariots, and an army larger than yours</b><br>Horses and chariots were symbols of military strength and technological advancement in ancient warfare. The mention of an army larger than theirs highlights the daunting nature of the opposition. The Israelites, primarily foot soldiers, would naturally feel intimidated by such formidable forces. This scenario emphasizes the human tendency to rely on visible strength and numbers, contrasting with the call to trust in divine power.<p><b>do not be afraid of them</b><br>This command addresses the natural human reaction of fear when faced with overwhelming odds. The Bible frequently encourages believers to overcome fear through faith. This directive is a call to trust in God's sovereignty and protection, reminding the Israelites that their success does not depend on their own strength but on God's power and presence.<p><b>for the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt</b><br>This phrase serves as a reminder of God's past faithfulness and mighty acts. The exodus from Egypt is a central event in Israel's history, symbolizing God's deliverance and covenant faithfulness. By recalling this event, the Israelites are encouraged to trust in God's continued presence and power. It underscores the theme of God as a deliverer and protector, reinforcing the idea that He is capable of overcoming any obstacle.<p><b>is with you</b><br>The assurance of God's presence is a recurring theme throughout Scripture. It provides comfort and confidence to believers, affirming that they are not alone in their struggles. This promise of divine presence is foundational to the covenant relationship between God and His people. It foreshadows the New Testament revelation of "Emmanuel," meaning "God with us," in the person of Jesus Christ, who embodies God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being instructed on how to conduct themselves in warfare.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>The opposing forces that the Israelites would face in battle, often representing larger and more powerful nations.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/horses_and_chariots.htm">Horses and Chariots</a></b><br>Symbols of military strength and power in ancient warfare, often used by Israel's enemies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who promises His presence and support in battle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land from which God delivered the Israelites, serving as a reminder of His past faithfulness and power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_presence.htm">Trust in God's Presence</a></b><br>Just as God was with the Israelites, He is with us in our battles today.
