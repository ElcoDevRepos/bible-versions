These officers were responsible for communicating God's laws and instructions to the soldiers, ensuring that the army was spiritually and mentally prepared. This practice highlights the importance of leadership and communication in maintaining order and morale. The officers' address would have included exemptions for those who were newly married, had built a new house, or planted a vineyard, as outlined earlier in <a href="/deuteronomy/20.htm">Deuteronomy 20</a>. This reflects a compassionate approach to warfare, acknowledging personal circumstances and prioritizing the well-being of individuals.<p><b>they are to appoint commanders to lead it</b><br>The appointment of commanders was a strategic move to ensure effective leadership and organization within the army. These commanders were likely chosen based on their experience, wisdom, and ability to lead men in battle. This structure of leadership is seen throughout the Old Testament, where God often appointed leaders to guide His people, such as Moses, Joshua, and the judges. The appointment of commanders also reflects a hierarchical system that mirrors God's order and authority. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate leader and commander of God's people, guiding them with wisdom and authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/o/officers.htm">Officers</a></b><br>These are the leaders responsible for addressing the army, providing instructions, and ensuring that the soldiers are prepared for battle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/army.htm">Army</a></b><br>The collective group of Israelite soldiers who are being prepared for battle.

Israel&#8217;s battles were never fought by raw mobs; they were covenant people responding to divine instruction (<a href="/joshua/1-10.htm">Joshua 1:10-11</a>).<p>- Speaking to the whole assembly fosters unity, reminding each soldier of both privilege and responsibility (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-1.htm">Deuteronomy 5:1</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1-3</a>).<p>- The speech sets spiritual tone as well as tactical direction, much like King Jehoshaphat&#8217;s charge that the battle belongs to the Lord (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they are to appoint commanders</b><p>- After spiritual readiness comes structural readiness; leadership slots are filled on the spot (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-15.htm">Deuteronomy 1:15</a>).<p>- &#8220;Appoint&#8221; highlights deliberate choice, not popularity or self-promotion (<a href="/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3-6</a>).<p>- Commanders provide tactical oversight, accountability, and discipline (<a href="/2_samuel/18-1.htm">2 Samuel 18:1-2</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/17-12.htm">2 Chronicles 17:12-14</a>).<p>- The step mirrors Moses&#8217; earlier delegation of judges to handle civil disputes (<a href="/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21-22</a>), showing that both civic and military life follow the same pattern of delegated authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to lead it</b><p>- Leadership is functional&#8212;commanders are placed &#8220;over&#8221; troops in order to &#8220;lead,&#8221; not merely hold titles (<a href="/1_samuel/8-20.htm">1 Samuel 8:20</a>).<p>- Biblical leadership moves ahead of the people, modeling courage; think of Jonathan climbing the Philistine outpost with his armor-bearer following (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6-13</a>).<p>- Ultimately, every earthly commander points to the greater Captain of our salvation, Jesus Christ, who goes before His people (<a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/20-9.htm">Deuteronomy 20:9</a> teaches that once the officers have settled every personal exemption and stirred the army with God&#8217;s word, the next step is to install commanders who will guide the now-purified force into battle.

If, as is also possible, the word "thousand" in military language signifies the contingent furnished by a "thousand" in Israel, irrespective of its number, it would remove many difficulties; for the whole thousand would very rarely be in the field together, and the contingent sent by a given "thousand" might consist of a very few men. If, therefore, the contingent of sixty "thousands" were to be described as 60,000, and the sixty companies were all cut up or annihilated, it might be reported as a slaughter of 60,000 men, while the lives actually lost would be nothing like so many.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - The next thing the <span class="accented">shoterim</span> had to do was to appoint captains to head the people who were going to war.
