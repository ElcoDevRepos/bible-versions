The nations referred to are the Canaanite tribes, known for their strength and fortified cities (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>). Historically, these nations were advanced in military and culture, making Israel's conquest seem impossible without divine intervention. This act of driving out the nations is a fulfillment of God's covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). It also serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the importance of relying on His strength rather than human might (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p><b>and to bring you into their land</b><br>The land of Canaan was a central element of God's promise to the patriarchs (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). This phrase underscores the transition from wandering in the wilderness to settling in a land flowing with milk and honey (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). Theologically, it represents a shift from a nomadic existence to a settled life under God's law. The land is not just a physical territory but a place where Israel would live out its covenant relationship with God, serving as a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>).<p><b>and give it to you for your inheritance</b><br>Inheritance in biblical terms often signifies a gift from God, not earned by human effort but granted by divine grace. The land of Canaan is described as an inheritance, emphasizing that it is a gift from God to His chosen people (<a href="/psalms/105-11.htm">Psalm 105:11</a>). This concept of inheritance is later expanded in the New Testament, where believers are described as heirs with Christ (<a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>), pointing to a spiritual inheritance in the Kingdom of God.<p><b>as it is this day</b><br>This phrase serves as a confirmation of the fulfillment of God's promises. It indicates the present reality of Israel's possession of the land, a tangible proof of God's faithfulness. Historically, this would have been a powerful affirmation for the Israelites, who had witnessed God's miraculous acts from Egypt to Canaan. It also serves as a reminder of the ongoing need for obedience and faithfulness to maintain the blessings of the covenant (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is delivering God's message to the people.

href="/bsb/deuteronomy/4.htm">Deuteronomy 4</a> is Moses&#8217; closing appeal before Israel crosses the Jordan. Verse 38 sits in a sentence that begins, &#8220;Because He loved your fathers, He chose their descendants after them and brought you out of Egypt by His Presence and great power&#8221; (v. 37). The flow reminds the people that everything God is about to do rests on His covenant love and sovereign initiative.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;to drive out before you nations greater and mightier than you&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; God is the active subject&#8212;Israel is not conquering by its own brilliance.<p>&#8226; The target nations are &#8220;greater and mightier,&#8221; making victory impossible apart from the LORD. Cross references underline this theme: <a href="/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a> &#8220;I will send My terror before you,&#8221; and <a href="/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a> &#8220;the LORD your God will bring you into the land&#8230; and He will drive out many nations before you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The phrase assures Israel that divine power precedes human obedience. They still must march, but the decisive blow is the LORD&#8217;s.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and to bring you into their land&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The exodus was not an end in itself; it pointed toward a place of settled blessing.<p>&#8226; God personally &#8220;brings&#8221; His people&#8212;language echoing <a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a> &#8220;I have come down to rescue them&#8230; and to bring them up out of that land to a good and spacious land.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This relocates Israel from wandering to belonging, fulfilling the promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and give it to you for your inheritance&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Give&#8221; stresses grace; the land is a gift, not wages for services rendered. <a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43</a> later confirms, &#8220;So the LORD gave Israel all the land He had sworn to give their fathers.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Inheritance&#8221; ties the land to family permanence (<a href="/numbers/26-52.htm">Numbers 26:52-56</a>). It&#8217;s not a temporary lease but a covenant allotment passed through generations.<p>&#8226; For believers today, the motif foreshadows the &#8220;inheritance that can never perish&#8221; kept for us in heaven (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>), showing continuity in God&#8217;s redemptive pattern.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;as it is this day&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Moses points to present evidence: standing on Moab&#8217;s plains, Israel already sees Sihon&#8217;s and Og&#8217;s former kingdoms under their control (<a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/2.htm">Deuteronomy 2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase anchors theology in observable history. God&#8217;s faithfulness is not abstract; it is measurable &#8220;this day.&#8221;<p>&#8226; That historical reliability invites continued trust as Israel faces Jericho and beyond (<a href="/bsb/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Living Implications</b><p>&#8226; Victory over forces &#8220;greater and mightier&#8221; encourages believers facing overwhelming odds (<a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>).<p>&#8226; The move from slavery to inheritance models our own journey from sin&#8217;s bondage to Kingdom citizenship (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Recognizing grace guards against pride; the land&#8212;and every blessing&#8212;is a gift (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/4-38.htm">Deuteronomy 4:38</a> proclaims that God Himself dislodges stronger nations, escorts His people into their promised territory, and bestows that land as a lasting inheritance, a reality already partially visible in Moses&#8217; day.
