It underscores the importance of witnessing God's power directly, which serves to strengthen faith and ensure the transmission of these events to future generations. The personal witness of God's acts is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1-3</a>, where the apostles testify to what they have seen and heard.<p><b>the LORD inflicted</b><br>The use of "the LORD" (YHWH) highlights the covenantal relationship between God and Israel. It is a reminder of God's sovereignty and His active role in the history of His people. The term "inflicted" suggests deliberate action, emphasizing God's control over the events that transpired. This aligns with the portrayal of God as a warrior in <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>, who fights for His people.<p><b>great and devastating signs and wonders</b><br>The "signs and wonders" refer to the ten plagues that God sent upon Egypt, as recorded in <a href="/exodus/7.htm">Exodus 7-12</a>. These acts were both miraculous and catastrophic, designed to demonstrate God's supremacy over the Egyptian gods and to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites. The plagues served as a form of divine judgment and a means of deliverance, prefiguring the ultimate deliverance through Christ, as seen in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<p><b>on Egypt</b><br>Egypt, a powerful and influential nation in the ancient world, is often symbolic of oppression and sin in the Bible. The plagues were a direct challenge to the Egyptian pantheon and demonstrated God's power over all creation. Archaeological evidence supports the historical existence of a powerful Egyptian empire during the time traditionally associated with the Exodus.<p><b>on Pharaoh</b><br>Pharaoh, as the ruler of Egypt, is a central figure in the Exodus narrative. He is often seen as a type of antichrist, opposing God's will and oppressing His people. The hardening of Pharaoh's heart (<a href="/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>) serves as a theological point about human resistance to God and divine sovereignty. Pharaoh's eventual downfall is a testament to God's justice and power.<p><b>and on all his household</b><br>This phrase indicates that the plagues affected not just Pharaoh but his entire administration and family. It underscores the comprehensive nature of God's judgment. The inclusion of Pharaoh's household highlights the communal aspect of sin and judgment, as seen in other biblical narratives like the story of Achan in <a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>. The plagues' impact on Pharaoh's household also foreshadows the broader deliverance of God's people from sin through Christ, who liberates not just individuals but entire communities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who demonstrates His power and faithfulness through signs and wonders.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved, representing oppression and bondage.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharaoh.htm">Pharaoh</a></b><br>The ruler of Egypt, whose heart was hardened against God, leading to the plagues.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/signs_and_wonders.htm">Signs and Wonders</a></b><br>Miraculous acts performed by God to demonstrate His power and to deliver His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, witnesses to His mighty acts and recipients of His deliverance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>The signs and wonders in Egypt demonstrate God's supreme authority over all creation and human rulers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_deliverance.htm">Faithfulness in Deliverance</a></b><br>God's actions in Egypt are a testament to His faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_miracles.htm">The Purpose of Miracles</a></b><br>Miracles serve to reveal God's glory and to affirm His covenant relationship with His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/remembering_god's_works.htm">Remembering God's Works</a></b><br>Believers are called to remember and recount God's mighty works as a foundation for faith and obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>The deliverance from Egypt teaches us to trust in God's perfect timing and His plan for our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_6_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 6:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_do_Deut_6_22_signs_show_God_s_power.htm">How do "signs and wonders" in Deuteronomy 6:22 demonstrate God's power today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_miracles_in_faith_Deut_6_22.htm">What role do miracles play in affirming faith according to Deuteronomy 6:22?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Recall_God_s_acts_daily_great_terrible.htm">How can we remember God's "great and terrible" acts in our daily lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Deut_6_22_to_Exodus_Red_Sea_miracle.htm">Connect Deuteronomy 6:22 with another biblical instance of God's miraculous deliverance.  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Deut_6_22_on_trusting_God.htm">How should Deuteronomy 6:22 influence our trust in God's promises and actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/How_do_Deut_6_22_signs_show_God_s_power_2.htm">How do the signs and wonders in Deuteronomy 6:22 affirm God's power and presence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Deuteronomy_6_22_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in Deuteronomy 6:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Deut_6_22_on_God-Israel_bond.htm">How does Deuteronomy 6:22 influence the understanding of God's relationship with Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_6.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_are_moses_and_jesus_similar.htm">What similarities exist between Moses and Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_are_the_ten_plagues_in_the_bible.htm">What were the Ten Plagues of Egypt in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_does_psalm_82_1_fit_with_deut._6_4.htm">How can a 'divine council' (Psalm 82:1) fit with passages claiming there is only one God (Deuteronomy 6:4)?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/who_believed_in_the_old_testament.htm">Who were the believers in the Old Testament?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Deuteronomy 6:22 Mean</div><b>Before our eyes</b><p>&#8226;
