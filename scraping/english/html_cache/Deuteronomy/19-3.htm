The roads to the cities of refuge were to be well-maintained to ensure that those seeking asylum could reach them quickly. This reflects God's provision and care for justice and mercy, ensuring that even those who accidentally caused harm had a clear path to safety. The emphasis on "for yourselves" indicates communal responsibility, highlighting the importance of collective action in maintaining justice.<p><b>and divide into three regions the land</b><br>The division of the land into three regions for the cities of refuge was a strategic measure to ensure accessibility. This division reflects the organizational structure of the Israelite society and their understanding of equitable distribution. It also underscores the importance of justice being accessible to all, regardless of their location within the Promised Land. The number three often symbolizes completeness and divine order in biblical numerology.<p><b>that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance</b><br>The land is described as an inheritance from God, emphasizing the divine gift and covenant relationship between God and Israel. This inheritance is not just a physical possession but a spiritual legacy, reminding the Israelites of their identity as God's chosen people. The concept of inheritance also points to the future hope and fulfillment of God's promises, which is a recurring theme throughout the Bible.<p><b>so that any manslayer can flee to these cities</b><br>The provision for a manslayer to flee to a city of refuge highlights God's justice and mercy. It distinguishes between intentional murder and accidental killing, providing protection for those who committed manslaughter. This system prefigures the grace found in Christ, who offers refuge and forgiveness to sinners. The cities of refuge are a type of Christ, who is our ultimate refuge and advocate before God. The emphasis on "any manslayer" underscores the inclusivity of God's mercy, available to all who seek it.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is delivering God's laws and instructions to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are receiving the laws and preparing to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who is giving the land as an inheritance and establishing laws for justice and mercy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cities_of_refuge.htm">Cities of Refuge</a></b><br>Designated cities where someone who has accidentally killed another person can flee for safety and await a fair trial.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land that God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which the Israelites are about to enter and possess.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_for_justice_and_mercy.htm">God's Provision for Justice and Mercy</a></b><br>The cities of refuge illustrate God's balance of justice and mercy, providing a way for the innocent to be protected while awaiting trial.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_and_responsibility.htm">Preparation and Responsibility</a></b><br>The command to build roads and divide the land shows the importance of preparation and responsibility in ensuring justice is accessible to all.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_safety.htm">Community and Safety</a></b><br>The establishment of these cities emphasizes the role of community in protecting individuals and maintaining societal order.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_refuge_in_christ.htm">Spiritual Refuge in Christ</a></b><br>Just as the cities provided physical refuge, Christ offers spiritual refuge and salvation for those who seek Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' obedience in setting up these cities reflects our call to obey God's commands in our lives, ensuring His principles of justice and mercy are upheld.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_19_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 19:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_19_3_Justice_mercy_s_role.htm">How does Deuteronomy 19:3 emphasize the importance of justice and mercy in society?
