Eating it while in mourning would be inappropriate, as mourning was a time of ritual impurity and personal grief, not celebration or worship. This reflects the importance of approaching God&#8217;s commands with a heart of reverence and purity, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/10-19.htm">Leviticus 10:19</a>, where Aaron refrains from eating the sin offering due to his mourning.<p><b>or removed any of it while unclean</b><br>Being ceremonially unclean, as outlined in Leviticus, could result from various conditions, such as touching a dead body or having a skin disease. Handling sacred offerings while unclean would defile them, violating God&#8217;s holiness. This underscores the need for spiritual cleanliness and integrity in worship, paralleling the New Testament call for believers to be pure in heart (<a href="/matthew/5-8.htm">Matthew 5:8</a>).<p><b>or offered any of it for the dead</b><br>Offering sacrifices to the dead was a pagan practice, forbidden in Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>). This phrase highlights the Israelites' commitment to worship God alone, avoiding syncretism with surrounding cultures. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching against idolatry and the worship of anything other than God (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-14.htm">1 Corinthians 10:14</a>).<p><b>I have obeyed the LORD my God</b><br>This declaration of obedience reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where blessings were contingent upon adherence to His commands (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>). It emphasizes the importance of faithfulness and obedience, themes echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus states, "If you love Me, you will keep My commandments" (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p><b>I have done everything You commanded me</b><br>This statement of comprehensive obedience is reminiscent of the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>), calling for wholehearted devotion to God. It points to the ideal of living a life fully aligned with God&#8217;s will, a standard ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who perfectly obeyed the Father (<a href="/john/8-29.htm">John 8:29</a>) and calls His followers to do likewise (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the law, preparing to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacred_portion.htm">Sacred Portion</a></b><br>Refers to the tithe or offering set apart for God, which the Israelites were to handle with reverence.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who commands obedience and worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_commands.htm">Reverence for God's Commands</a></b><br>The sacred portion is to be treated with utmost respect, reflecting our reverence for God's instructions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purity_and_holiness.htm">Purity and Holiness</a></b><br>Handling offerings requires a state of purity, symbolizing the holiness God desires in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god.htm">Obedience to God</a></b><br>The declaration of obedience in this verse serves as a model for our commitment to follow God's commands fully.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_worship.htm">Integrity in Worship</a></b><br>Offering to the dead or using sacred portions improperly reflects a lack of integrity, which God calls us to avoid.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_stewardship.htm">Faithfulness in Stewardship</a></b><br>Managing what is set apart for God with faithfulness is a testament to our trust in His provision.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_26_14_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 26:14?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_26_14_Importance_of_vows_to_God.htm">How does Deuteronomy 26:14 emphasize the importance of keeping vows to God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lesson_from_not_eaten_sacred_portion.htm">What does "I have not eaten any of the sacred portion" teach us?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Deut_26_14_integrity_today.htm">How can we apply the principle of integrity from Deuteronomy 26:14 today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/NT_teachings_on_purity_honesty_links.htm">Which New Testament teachings align with Deuteronomy 26:14's focus on purity and honesty?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Deut_26_14_s_guidance_on_God_s_resources.htm">How does Deuteronomy 26:14 guide us in handling resources dedicated to God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Deut_26_14_Purity_s_role_in_offerings.htm">What does Deuteronomy 26:14 reveal about the importance of purity in offerings to God?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Deut_26_14_s_role_in_worship_obedience.htm">How does Deuteronomy 26:14 emphasize the significance of obedience in worship practices?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_prohibit_mourning_in_Deut_26_14.htm">Why is the prohibition against mourning during offerings important in Deuteronomy 26:14?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_26.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/which_animals_are_clean_or_unclean.htm">Which animals are considered clean or unclean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_amos_teach_about_justice.htm">What does 'ceremonially unclean' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_do_num._18_15-19_and_deut._differ.htm">Why does Numbers 18:15-19 differ in certain details from parallel instructions in Deuteronomy regarding firstborn offerings, and how can these discrepancies be reconciled?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_does_deut._14_21_align_with_bible_ethics.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21 allows selling meat that dies of itself to foreigners.

By declaring he has not eaten it &#8220;while in mourning,&#8221; the worshiper affirms that he treated the offering as an act of joyful worship, not a meal tainted by grief. The LORD calls His people to rejoice in His presence when they bring their gifts (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7</a>; 16:11).

The statement underlines reverence: God&#8217;s portion must not be treated casually. Today, while Christ has fulfilled the ceremonial law (<a href="/hebrews/10-1.htm">Hebrews 10:1-10</a>), the principle endures: approach God&#8217;s gifts with a pure heart (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>; <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or offered any of it for the dead</b><p>Pagan cultures used food offerings in funerary rites, hoping to placate spirits or assist the deceased.

By refusing to divert the tithe toward occult customs, the worshiper rejects syncretism and affirms exclusive loyalty to the living God (<a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19-20</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-21.htm">1 Corinthians 10:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have obeyed the LORD my God</b><p>After detailing specific negatives, the speaker turns positive: wholehearted obedience.

True worship is more than ritual correctness; it is a life aligned with God&#8217;s revealed will (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have done everything You commanded me</b><p>The worshiper&#8217;s confession wraps up with comprehensive compliance&#8212;no intentional gaps, no selective obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32-33</a>; <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>). For believers today, Christ&#8217;s enabling grace makes such integrity possible (<a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>).

Or the reference may be here to the expenses incurred by the death of one for whose funeral the individual had to provide. This view is adopted by Dr. Thomson, who, remarking on this passage, says, "This was the strongest possible protestation that he had dealt faithfully in the matter of tithing and consecrated things and in charities to the poor. He had not allowed himself to divert anything to other uses, not even by the most pressing and unforeseen emergencies. It is here assumed, or rather implied, that times of mourning for the dead were expensive, and also that the stern law of custom obliged the bereaved to defray those expenses, however onerous.... The temptation, therefore, to devote a part of the tithes, hallowed things, and charities to defray these enormous, unforeseen, and providential expenses would be very urgent, and he who stood faithful at such times might safely be trusted on all other occasions" ('Land and the Book,' 1:149). The LXX. rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, "to the dead," has led some to suppose that the reference here is to the placing of articles of food in the tomb along with the corpse; but though this custom prevailed among the Jews in later times, as well as among other peoples, there is no ground for supposing it to be referred to here.
