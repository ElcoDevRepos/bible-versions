This reliance on manna emphasized their dependence on God for sustenance. The absence of bread symbolizes a break from their past life and a reliance on divine provision, highlighting God's ability to provide in unexpected ways.<p><b>and drank no wine or strong drink,</b><br>The lack of wine or strong drink during their journey underscores a period of consecration and reliance on God rather than earthly pleasures or comforts. Wine often symbolizes joy and celebration in the Bible, but its absence here points to a focus on spiritual readiness and purity. This abstention can be seen as a preparation for entering the Promised Land, where they would later enjoy the fruits of the land.<p><b>so that you might know</b><br>This phrase indicates the purpose behind God's actions: to teach the Israelites a lesson about His nature and their relationship with Him. The experiences in the wilderness were designed to deepen their understanding and trust in God. It reflects a pedagogical approach where God uses life circumstances to reveal His character and faithfulness.<p><b>that I am the LORD your God.</b><br>This declaration reaffirms the covenant relationship between God and Israel. It echoes the central theme of the Pentateuch, where God consistently reveals Himself as the sovereign, covenant-keeping deity. The phrase emphasizes God's identity and authority, reminding the Israelites of His unique role as their deliverer and sustainer.
