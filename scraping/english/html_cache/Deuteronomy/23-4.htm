In the ancient Near Eastern culture, providing food and water to travelers was a basic expectation of hospitality. The failure to do so was seen as a significant breach of social norms. This act of neglect is highlighted in contrast to the kindness shown by others, such as Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, who provided support and guidance (Exodus 18). The Israelites' journey from Egypt was a pivotal moment in their history, marking their transition from slavery to becoming a nation under God's covenant. The refusal of the Ammonites and Moabites to assist them is seen as an act of hostility against God's chosen people.<p><b>and they hired Balaam son of Beor from Pethor in Aram-naharaim to curse you</b><br>This part of the verse references the story found in <a href="/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22-24</a>, where Balak, the king of Moab, hires Balaam to curse the Israelites. Balaam, a prophet from Pethor in Aram-naharaim (likely in the region of Mesopotamia), is a complex figure who is known for his ability to bless and curse. Despite being hired to curse Israel, God intervenes, and Balaam ends up blessing them instead. This incident underscores the theme of divine protection over Israel, as God turns intended curses into blessings. The geographical reference to Aram-naharaim, which means "Aram of the Two Rivers," situates Balaam in a region known for its ancient wisdom and divination practices. This story also foreshadows the ultimate blessing and protection found in Jesus Christ, who transforms curses into blessings for those who follow Him (<a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13-14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and were journeying to the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moabites.htm">Moabites</a></b><br>A nation descended from Lot, who refused to provide hospitality to the Israelites during their exodus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/balaam_son_of_beor.htm">Balaam son of Beor</a></b><br>A prophet hired by the Moabites to curse the Israelites, but God intervened.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/pethor.htm">Pethor</a></b><br>The city in Aram-naharaim where Balaam resided.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/aram-naharaim.htm">Aram-naharaim</a></b><br>A region in Mesopotamia, often associated with the area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_hospitality.htm">The Importance of Hospitality</a></b><br>The Moabites' refusal to offer bread and water to the Israelites is a lesson on the significance of hospitality.
