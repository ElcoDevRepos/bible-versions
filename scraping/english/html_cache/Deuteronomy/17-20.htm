The king of Israel was to remain humble, recognizing that his authority was granted by God and not due to personal merit. This humility is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus teaches that "whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted" (<a href="/matthew/23-12.htm">Matthew 23:12</a>). The cultural context of ancient Israel placed great importance on community and equality before God, contrasting with the often autocratic rule seen in surrounding nations. The king's heart not being exalted above his countrymen reflects the ideal of servant leadership, a type of Christ who, though King of Kings, came to serve and not to be served (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><b>and he will not turn aside from the commandment, to the right or to the left</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of obedience to God's law. The king was to adhere strictly to the commandments, symbolizing unwavering faithfulness. The imagery of not turning "to the right or to the left" is a common biblical metaphor for staying on the path of righteousness (<a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>). This steadfastness is crucial for maintaining a covenant relationship with God. The historical context shows that deviation from God's commandments often led to Israel's downfall, as seen in the narratives of kings who strayed from God's laws, such as Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/11.htm">1 Kings 11:1-11</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the perfect obedience of Jesus Christ, who fulfilled the law completely (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p><b>in order that he and his sons may reign many years over his kingdom in Israel</b><br>This phrase highlights the conditional nature of the Davidic covenant, where obedience to God's commandments would result in a lasting dynasty. The promise of a long reign is contingent upon the king's faithfulness, reflecting the broader Deuteronomic theme of blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience (Deuteronomy 28). Historically, the reigns of David and Solomon exemplify the blessings of obedience, while the divided kingdom and subsequent exiles illustrate the consequences of turning away from God. This promise also points to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, the eternal King from David's line, whose kingdom is everlasting (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom the laws are given, specifically addressing the future kings of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/future_kings_of_israel.htm">Future Kings of Israel</a></b><br>The primary audience of this verse, providing guidelines for their conduct and governance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_in_leadership.htm">Humility in Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders are called to maintain humility, recognizing their role as servants rather than rulers over their people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/adherence_to_god's_commandments.htm">Adherence to God's Commandments</a></b><br>The importance of unwavering commitment to God's laws is emphasized, ensuring that leaders do not deviate from His path.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generational_impact.htm">Generational Impact</a></b><br>The obedience of leaders has long-term effects, influencing not only their reign but also the future of their descendants.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_pride.htm">Avoiding Pride</a></b><br>Pride can lead to downfall; leaders must guard their hearts against being exalted above others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/longevity_of_leadership.htm">Longevity of Leadership</a></b><br>Faithfulness to God's commandments is linked to the stability and longevity of leadership and governance.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_17_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 17:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_17_20_Humility_s_role_in_leadership.htm">How does Deuteronomy 17:20 emphasize the importance of humility in leadership?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Obedience_s_role_in_leader_s_longevity.htm">What role does obedience play in maintaining a leader's longevity according to Deuteronomy 17:20?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_can_leaders_stay_true_to_commands.htm">How can leaders today avoid turning "aside from the commandment"?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_do_Deut_17_20_Prov_16_18_link_on_pride.htm">In what ways does Deuteronomy 17:20 connect with Proverbs 16:18 on pride?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Deut_17_20_to_spiritual_growth.htm">How can we apply Deuteronomy 17:20's principles to personal spiritual growth?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Deut_17_20_on_humility_in_leadership.htm">How does Deuteronomy 17:20 emphasize the importance of humility in leadership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Deut_17_20_s_writing.htm">What historical context influenced the writing of Deuteronomy 17:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Deut_17_20_s_link_to_divine_authority.htm">How does Deuteronomy 17:20 relate to the concept of divine authority?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_17.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_do_old_and_new_covenants_differ.htm">How do the Old and New Covenants differ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_do_words_show_kindness_and_truth.htm">How should we treat the poor among us?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_is_ahaz's_idolatry_less_condemned.htm">Why doesn't 2 Kings 16 emphasize divine judgment on Ahaz's actions as clearly as other Old Testament passages condemn idolatry?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_are_common_pagan_practices.htm">What are common pagan practices?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Deuteronomy 17:20 Mean</div><b>Then his heart will not be exalted above his countrymen</b><p>&#8211; God knows how easily power breeds pride.
