This location is significant as it represents a pivotal moment in Israel's history when God established His covenant with them. The mountain is traditionally identified with Jebel Musa in the Sinai Peninsula. Horeb is a place of divine revelation and law-giving, underscoring the gravity of the Israelites' actions there.<p><b>you provoked the LORD</b><br>The Israelites' provocation refers to their idolatry with the golden calf, as recorded in <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>. This act of rebellion occurred shortly after they had pledged to obey God's commandments. Provoking the LORD indicates a deliberate act of disobedience and lack of faith, highlighting the Israelites' tendency to stray from God's commands despite witnessing His miracles.<p><b>and He was angry enough to destroy you</b><br>God's anger reflects His holiness and justice in response to sin. The severity of His anger underscores the seriousness of idolatry and covenant-breaking. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of God's righteous judgment against sin, as seen in other instances such as the flood in <a href="/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6-9</a> and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in <a href="/genesis/19.htm">Genesis 19</a>. However, God's mercy is also evident, as He ultimately spares the Israelites through Moses' intercession, foreshadowing Christ's role as the ultimate mediator between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/horeb.htm">Horeb</a></b><br>Also known as Mount Sinai, this is the mountain where Moses received the Ten Commandments from God.

It is the very mountain where Moses first encountered the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1-4</a>). By pointing back to Horeb, Moses reminds the people that their rebellion took place at the same spot where they had received the covenant and heard God&#8217;s voice (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-10.htm">Deuteronomy 4:10</a>). The setting underscores how quickly they violated the holiness they had just witnessed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You provoked the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The provocation centers on the golden calf incident recorded in <a href="/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1-8</a>.<p>&#8226; After promising, &#8220;All that the LORD has spoken we will do&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/24-3.htm">Exodus 24:3</a>), the people impatiently demanded an idol when Moses delayed on the mountain.<p>&#8226; Their actions broke the first and second commandments moments after receiving them (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture portrays this as outright apostasy: &#8220;They quickly turned from the way I commanded them&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-12.htm">Deuteronomy 9:12</a>). Paul later cites the event as a warning to believers against idolatry (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; The word provoked stresses deliberate offense, not accidental misstep; they knew better, yet chose rebellion (<a href="/psalms/106-19.htm">Psalm 106:19-20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He was angry enough</b><p>God&#8217;s anger is righteous, measured, and just (<a href="/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2-3</a>). At Horeb His wrath blazed because:<p>&#8226; Idolatry attacked His unique glory (<a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel sinned against clear revelation, heightening guilt (<a href="/luke/12-47.htm">Luke 12:47-48</a>).<p>&#8226; The sin threatened the very purpose of the covenant&#8212;forming a holy nation to reveal God to the world (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>).<p>Moses later recalls, &#8220;I feared the anger and wrath of the LORD, for He was angry enough to destroy you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-19.htm">Deuteronomy 9:19</a>). Divine anger here is not capricious; it is the appropriate response of a holy God to covenant treachery.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To destroy you</b><p>&#8226; The LORD told Moses, &#8220;Now leave Me, so that My anger may burn against them and consume them&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Total destruction was the just penalty, paralleling judgments on other nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet God&#8217;s threat contained a purpose: to highlight both justice and mercy. Moses&#8217; intercession (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>) and his appeal to God&#8217;s promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-27.htm">Deuteronomy 9:27</a>) resulted in divine forgiveness.<p>&#8226; The episode reveals that while sin warrants annihilation, God provides a mediator&#8212;first Moses, ultimately Christ (<a href="/hebrews/3-5.htm">Hebrews 3:5-6</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/9-8.htm">Deuteronomy 9:8</a> recalls the golden calf to expose Israel&#8217;s deep-rooted sin and God&#8217;s righteous response. At the very mountain of covenant glory, the people provoked the LORD through blatant idolatry, inciting wrath so intense it could have ended their national existence. Yet the verse also prepares us to see grace: God relented because a mediator pleaded on their behalf. The passage stands as a sobering reminder of God&#8217;s holiness, the seriousness of sin, and the mercy available through intercession.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Also.</span>--<span class= "ital">Even in Horeb. </span>In the very sight of the mountain of the Law, the Law was flagrantly violated.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/9-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">At Horeb</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;&#1461;&#1445;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;r&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2722.htm">Strong's 2722: </a> </span><span class="str2">Horeb -- 'waste', a mountain in Sinai</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you provoked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1510;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1462;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hiq&#183;&#7779;ap&#772;&#183;tem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7107.htm">Strong's 7107: </a> </span><span class="str2">To crack off, burst out in rage</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and He</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was angry enough</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1456;&#1488;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1463;&#1447;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#7791;&#183;&#8217;an&#183;nap&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hitpael - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_599.htm">Strong's 599: </a> </span><span class="str2">To breathe hard, be enraged</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to destroy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;ha&#353;&#183;m&#238;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Verb - Hifil - Infinitive construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8045.htm">Strong's 8045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be exterminated or destroyed</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1514;&#1456;&#1499;&#1462;&#1469;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#7791;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Direct object marker &#124; second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_853.htm">Strong's 853: </a> </span><span class="str2">Untranslatable mark of the accusative case</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/deuteronomy/9-8.htm">Deuteronomy 9:8 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/deuteronomy/9-8.htm">Deuteronomy 9:8 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/deuteronomy/9-8.htm">Deuteronomy 9:8 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/deuteronomy/9-8.htm">Deuteronomy 9:8 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/deuteronomy/9-8.htm">Deuteronomy 9:8 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/deuteronomy/9-8.htm">Deuteronomy 9:8  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/deuteronomy/9-8.htm">Deuteronomy 9:8 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/deuteronomy/9-8.htm">Deuteronomy 9:8 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/deuteronomy/9-8.htm">Deuteronomy 9:8 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/deuteronomy/9-8.htm">Deuteronomy 9:8 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/deuteronomy/9-8.htm">OT Law: Deuteronomy 9:8 Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh (Deut.
