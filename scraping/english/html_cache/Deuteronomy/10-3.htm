Acacia wood was chosen for its durability and resistance to decay, symbolizing the enduring nature of God's covenant. This wood was abundant in the Sinai region, making it a practical choice. The construction of the ark signifies obedience to God's instructions and the importance of preserving His commandments. The ark is a type of Christ, representing God's presence among His people.<p><b>chiseled out two stone tablets like the originals</b><br>The two stone tablets are central to the covenant between God and Israel, containing the Ten Commandments. The act of chiseling new tablets signifies restoration and renewal after the original tablets were broken due to Israel's sin with the golden calf. This reflects God's mercy and willingness to renew His covenant despite human failure. The tablets are a precursor to the New Covenant, where God's laws are written on the hearts of believers (<a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>).<p><b>and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hands</b><br>Moses ascending the mountain symbolizes approaching God in reverence and obedience. The mountain, likely Mount Sinai, is a place of divine revelation and covenant-making. Moses acts as a mediator between God and Israel, prefiguring Christ as the ultimate mediator. The physical act of carrying the tablets emphasizes the responsibility of upholding God's law.

Obedience follows repentance.<p>- Acacia is hardy and resistant to decay. The choice underlines the enduring nature of God&#8217;s covenant.<p>- The ark will house the testimony, symbolizing God&#8217;s holy presence among His people (<a href="/numbers/10-33.htm">Numbers 10:33</a>; <a href="/hebrews/9-4.htm">Hebrews 9:4</a>).<p>- Building begins with what God told Moses first: create a place for His word before receiving it again.

Moses copies the original shape, showing the law itself has not changed though Israel has sinned.<p>- The fresh tablets testify to both continuity and mercy: same commands, renewed relationship (<a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8&#8211;10</a>; <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>- Stone speaks of permanence (<a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>). God&#8217;s moral law is not negotiable or time-bound.<p>- Moses does the chiseling; only God will write. Human effort prepares the heart, but divine revelation supplies the words (<a href="/2_corinthians/3-3.htm">2 Corinthians 3:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hands</b><p>- Moses ascends Sinai again at God&#8217;s call (<a href="/exodus/34-2.htm">Exodus 34:2</a>).
