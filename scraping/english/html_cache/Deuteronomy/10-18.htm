In ancient Israel, the fatherless and widows were among the most marginalized, lacking the protection and provision typically provided by a male head of household. The Mosaic Law repeatedly emphasizes care for these groups (<a href="/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22-24</a>, <a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>), reflecting God's justice and compassion. This divine concern is echoed in the New Testament, where <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a> describes pure religion as caring for orphans and widows. The execution of justice implies active intervention, suggesting that God not only cares but also acts on behalf of the oppressed, a theme seen throughout the prophetic literature (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3</a>).<p><b>and He loves the foreigner</b><br>The inclusion of the foreigner, or "sojourner," underscores the universality of God's love and justice. In the ancient Near East, foreigners often had no legal rights or social standing, making them vulnerable to exploitation. God's love for the foreigner is a recurring theme in the Old Testament (<a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a>), where Israel is reminded of their own history as foreigners in Egypt. This love is not merely emotional but is demonstrated through tangible actions, setting a precedent for the inclusion of Gentiles in the New Testament (<a href="/ephesians/2-12.htm">Ephesians 2:12-19</a>). The love for the foreigner foreshadows the breaking down of ethnic barriers in Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>).<p><b>giving him food and clothing</b><br>Providing food and clothing signifies meeting basic human needs, reflecting God's provision and care. In the context of Deuteronomy, this provision is part of the covenantal relationship between God and His people, where obedience to His commands includes caring for the needy (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-28.htm">Deuteronomy 14:28-29</a>). This act of giving is a practical expression of love and justice, aligning with Jesus' teachings in the New Testament, where He emphasizes caring for the "least of these" (<a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-36</a>). The provision of food and clothing also symbolizes God's sufficiency and faithfulness, themes that resonate throughout Scripture (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, who is delivering God's laws and commandments to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving the laws and commandments as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/fatherless_and_widow.htm">Fatherless and Widow</a></b><br>Represent vulnerable groups in society who are often marginalized and in need of protection and justice.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreigner.htm">Foreigner (Sojourner)</a></b><br>Non-Israelites living among the Israelites, often without the same rights and protections as native-born citizens.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites are about to enter, where they are to live according to God's laws.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_heart_for_justice.htm">God's Heart for Justice</a></b><br>God is deeply concerned with justice, especially for those who are marginalized.

In every generation, believers are called to do the same&#8212;seeing social justice not as a trend but as obedience to the God who literally executes justice for the powerless.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He loves the foreigner</b><p>The verse continues, &#8220;and He loves the foreigner.&#8221; God&#8217;s love is not restricted by national borders or ethnic lines.<p>&#8226; Earlier legislation warned, &#8220;You must not mistreat or oppress a foreigner, for you were foreigners in Egypt&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a> raises the bar: &#8220;The foreigner living among you must be treated as your native-born.
