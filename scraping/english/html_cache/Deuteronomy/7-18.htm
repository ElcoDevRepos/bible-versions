The "them" refers to the nations inhabiting Canaan, which were known for their strength and fortified cities. The command not to fear is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing trust in God's power rather than human strength (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>). Fear is often a barrier to faith, and God reassures His people that He is with them, echoing His promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<p><b>Be sure to remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and all Egypt:</b><br>This phrase calls the Israelites to recall God's past deliverance during the Exodus. The plagues and the parting of the Red Sea were demonstrations of God's sovereignty and power over the mightiest empire of the time. Remembering these acts serves to strengthen faith and trust in God's ability to deliver them again. The Exodus is a foundational event in Israel's history, often referenced throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30-31</a>). It also prefigures the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who frees believers from the bondage of sin (<a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is delivering God's message to the people.
