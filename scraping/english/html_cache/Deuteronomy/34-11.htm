These acts were not merely displays of power but served as divine authentication of his mission and message. The signs and wonders included the ten plagues, which demonstrated God's supremacy over the Egyptian gods. This phrase underscores the unparalleled nature of Moses' ministry, setting a standard for future prophets. The miracles foreshadow the greater works of Jesus Christ, who performed signs and wonders to confirm His divine authority and mission (<a href="/john/14-11.htm">John 14:11</a>).<p><b>that the LORD sent Moses to do</b><br>Moses acted under divine commission, emphasizing that the miracles were not of his own power but were acts of God through him. This divine sending is crucial, as it highlights the role of a prophet as a mediator between God and His people. The LORD's sending of Moses parallels the sending of Jesus, who was sent by the Father to accomplish the ultimate deliverance (<a href="/john/3-17.htm">John 3:17</a>).<p><b>in the land of Egypt</b><br>Egypt serves as a significant backdrop for the narrative of deliverance. It was a place of bondage for the Israelites, symbolizing sin and oppression. The land of Egypt is historically and archaeologically rich, with evidence of a powerful civilization that aligns with the biblical account of a formidable empire. The deliverance from Egypt is a type of the greater spiritual deliverance from sin through Christ (<a href="/1_corinthians/10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1-4</a>).<p><b>to Pharaoh</b><br>Pharaoh represents the epitome of earthly power and opposition to God's will. The confrontation between Moses and Pharaoh is a classic example of divine power overcoming human obstinacy. Pharaoh's hardened heart serves as a warning against resisting God's commands. This encounter prefigures the ultimate victory of Christ over the powers of darkness (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<p><b>and to all his officials</b><br>The officials of Pharaoh's court were witnesses to the signs and wonders, highlighting the public nature of God's acts. Their presence underscores the comprehensive scope of God's judgment and the opportunity for all to recognize His sovereignty. This mirrors the public ministry of Jesus, whose miracles were witnessed by many, including religious and political leaders (<a href="/john/11-47.htm">John 11:47</a>).<p><b>and all his land</b><br>The plagues affected the entirety of Egypt, demonstrating that God's power extends over all creation. The land, often associated with the prosperity and stability of a nation, was brought to ruin, signifying the futility of opposing God's will. This comprehensive impact foreshadows the ultimate renewal of creation through Christ, who will restore all things (<a href="/revelation/21-5.htm">Revelation 21:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the prophet and leader chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.
