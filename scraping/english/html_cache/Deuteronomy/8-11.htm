In the context of Deuteronomy, Moses is addressing the Israelites as they prepare to enter the Promised Land. Forgetting God often leads to idolatry and disobedience, as seen in the history of Israel (<a href="/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a>). The call to remember is a recurring theme in Deuteronomy, highlighting the covenant relationship between God and His people.<p><b>by failing to keep His commandments and ordinances and statutes</b><br>The commandments, ordinances, and statutes refer to the comprehensive body of laws given to Israel. These laws were meant to set Israel apart as a holy nation (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>). Obedience to these laws was a sign of faithfulness to God. The structure of the law reflects God's character and His desire for justice, mercy, and humility (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). The New Testament reiterates the importance of obedience, not as a means of salvation, but as evidence of faith (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><b>which I am giving you this day</b><br>This phrase underscores the immediacy and relevance of God's commandments. Moses is speaking to a new generation of Israelites, reminding them of the covenant made at Sinai. The phrase "this day" emphasizes the present and ongoing nature of God's expectations. It also points to the continuity of God's law, which is fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). The giving of the law is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, marking them as God's chosen people and foreshadowing the coming of Christ, who perfectly embodies and fulfills the law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is delivering God's message to the people.
