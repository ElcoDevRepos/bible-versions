These festivals were times of communal worship and celebration, reflecting the agricultural calendar and God's provision.<p><b>all your men are to appear before the LORD your God</b><br>This command emphasizes the importance of male Israelites participating in these festivals, symbolizing the collective responsibility of the community to worship and honor God. It underscores the patriarchal structure of ancient Israelite society, where men represented their families in religious duties.<p><b>in the place He will choose</b><br>This refers to the centralization of worship in a specific location, which would later be identified as Jerusalem. The choice of a single place for worship was intended to unify the nation and prevent idolatry. It foreshadows the establishment of the Temple in Jerusalem as the focal point of Jewish worship.<p><b>at the Feast of Unleavened Bread</b><br>This feast, also known as Passover, commemorates the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt. It involves the removal of leaven from homes, symbolizing purity and separation from sin. The Passover lamb is a type of Christ, who is referred to as the Lamb of God in the New Testament.<p><b>the Feast of Weeks</b><br>Also known as Pentecost, this feast occurs seven weeks after Passover and celebrates the wheat harvest. It is associated with the giving of the Law at Sinai. In the New Testament, Pentecost marks the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, signifying the birth of the Church.<p><b>and the Feast of Tabernacles</b><br>This feast, also called Sukkot, commemorates the Israelites' wilderness wanderings and God's provision. It involves dwelling in temporary shelters, reminding the people of their dependence on God. It points to the future messianic age when God will dwell with His people.<p><b>No one should appear before the LORD empty-handed.</b><br>This command highlights the principle of giving back to God from what He has provided. It reflects the attitude of gratitude and acknowledgment of God's blessings. Offerings were a tangible expression of worship and devotion, and they prefigure the ultimate sacrifice of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who commands the observance of these feasts.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_men.htm">Israelite Men</a></b><br>The male members of the Israelite community who are required to appear before the LORD.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_place_he_will_choose.htm">The Place He Will Choose</a></b><br>Refers to the central place of worship, which later becomes Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_unleavened_bread.htm">Feast of Unleavened Bread</a></b><br>A festival commemorating the Exodus from Egypt, beginning with Passover.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_weeks.htm">Feast of Weeks (Shavuot)</a></b><br>Celebrates the giving of the Torah at Sinai and the wheat harvest.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/f/feast_of_tabernacles.htm">Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot)</a></b><br>A festival of thanksgiving for the harvest and remembrance of the Israelites' wilderness journey.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The requirement for all men to appear before the LORD emphasizes the importance of obedience in worship.

Israel brings sacrifices proportionate to God&#8217;s blessing (<a href="/exodus/23-15.htm">Exodus 23:15</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a>). The principle persists: generosity flows from gratitude (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7-8</a>). Empty hands would deny both God&#8217;s provision and the worshiper&#8217;s dependence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a> commands Israel to gather three times a year at God&#8217;s chosen place, remember His saving acts, rejoice in His ongoing provision, and give back from what He supplied. The verse calls God&#8217;s people&#8212;then and now&#8212;to regular, unified, wholehearted worship marked by gratitude and giving, all of which point ultimately to Jesus Christ, the true Passover Lamb, the Lord of Pentecost, and the Fountain of Tabernacles joy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Three times in a year.</span>--So <a href="/exodus/23-17.htm" title="Three items in the year all your males shall appear before the LORD God.">Exodus 23:17</a>.
