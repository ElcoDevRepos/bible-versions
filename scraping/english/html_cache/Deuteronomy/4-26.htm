Here, Moses invokes heaven and earth as witnesses, emphasizing the gravity and universality of the covenant between God and Israel. This phrase underscores the idea that all of creation is aware of and testifies to the covenant, highlighting the accountability of the Israelites. Similar language is found in <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>, where God calls upon heaven and earth to witness Israel's rebellion.<p><b>that you will quickly perish from the land</b><br>This phrase serves as a warning of the consequences of disobedience to God's commandments. The land, promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, is conditional upon Israel's faithfulness. The warning of perishing quickly is a reminder of the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to exile and destruction. Historically, this prophecy was fulfilled during the Assyrian and Babylonian exiles, when Israel and Judah were removed from the land due to their unfaithfulness.<p><b>that you are crossing the Jordan to possess</b><br>The Jordan River represents a significant geographical and spiritual boundary for the Israelites. Crossing the Jordan symbolizes entering into the fulfillment of God's promises, a transition from the wilderness wanderings to the inheritance of the Promised Land. This event is a type of baptism, representing a new beginning and a step of faith. The crossing of the Jordan is also a foreshadowing of Jesus' baptism in the Jordan River, marking the beginning of His public ministry.<p><b>You will not live long upon it</b><br>This phrase reiterates the conditional nature of the Israelites' tenure in the Promised Land. Longevity in the land is directly tied to obedience to God's laws. The warning reflects the blessings and curses of the covenant, where obedience results in prosperity and long life, while disobedience leads to expulsion. This concept is echoed in <a href="/psalms/37-29.htm">Psalm 37:29</a>, which speaks of the righteous inheriting the land and dwelling in it forever.<p><b>but will be utterly destroyed</b><br>The ultimate consequence of Israel's disobedience is total destruction, a theme consistent with the covenant curses. This destruction is not only physical but also spiritual, as it represents a severing of the relationship with God. The phrase foreshadows the eventual destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, events that are seen as both historical realities and prophetic warnings. The destruction serves as a type of the final judgment, where those who reject God's covenant face eternal separation from Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is delivering this message as part of his farewell speeches.

Their presence underscores the absolute truthfulness and seriousness of God&#8217;s covenant warning (see <a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; In Scripture, creation itself testifies for or against human conduct (<a href="/psalms/19-1.htm">Psalm 19:1-4</a>; <a href="/romans/1-20.htm">Romans 1:20</a>). By invoking the cosmos, Moses anchors the coming judgment in something more enduring than any human court.<p>&#8226; This witness motif reminds Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;that every act of obedience or rebellion takes place before God&#8217;s all-knowing gaze (<a href="/psalms/33-13.htm">Psalm 33:13-15</a>). Nothing is hidden; therefore, the people cannot plead ignorance or claim injustice when discipline comes (<a href="/job/16-19.htm">Job 16:19-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the Jordan to possess</b><p>&#8226; The warning is not theoretical. Israel is on the verge of entering Canaan (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-5.htm">Deuteronomy 4:5-6</a>; <a href="/joshua/1-2.htm">Joshua 1:2</a>). The promised land is a gift, yet keeping it depends on covenant faithfulness.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Quickly perish&#8221; points to the speed with which judgment can fall once the nation chooses idolatry (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-25.htm">Deuteronomy 4:25</a>; 9:3-5). History confirms this: the Northern Kingdom fell within a few generations after Solomon (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6-18</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s covenant contains both blessings and curses (<a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>). Blessing brings security and fruitfulness (28:1-14); curse brings defeat and exile (28:15-68). Possession of the land is conditional, not automatic.<p>&#8226; Crossing the Jordan was an act of faith (<a href="/bsb/joshua/3.htm">Joshua 3&#8211;4</a>), and remaining in the land would require ongoing faith&#8212;daily allegiance to the Lord who brought them out of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You will not live long upon it, but will be utterly destroyed</b><p>&#8226; Long life in the land was the positive promise attached to obedience (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>). Therefore, the phrase &#8220;you will not live long&#8221; highlights that sin reverses covenant blessings.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Utterly destroyed&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-26.htm">Deuteronomy 4:26</a>) forecasts the ultimate sanction: exile and scattering among the nations (<a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33-39</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>). This was fulfilled in 722 BC (Assyrian captivity) and 586 BC (Babylonian captivity).<p>&#8226; The severity serves a redemptive purpose. When judgment comes, the remnant is meant to seek the Lord afresh (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29-31</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1-3</a>). Even destruction is tempered by God&#8217;s desire to restore.<p>&#8226; The verse underscores God&#8217;s justice and faithfulness: He keeps His word both in blessing and in discipline (<a href="/joshua/23-15.htm">Joshua 23:15-16</a>; <a href="/psalms/145-17.htm">Psalm 145:17</a>). The land promise is secure, yet individual generations must align with God to enjoy it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/4-26.htm">Deuteronomy 4:26</a> is Moses&#8217; solemn warning that the unchanging heavens and earth stand as divine witnesses: if Israel abandons the Lord, they will swiftly lose the land they are about to inherit and face complete devastation. The verse teaches that covenant privileges carry covenant responsibilities, that God&#8217;s judgment is as certain as His promises, and that lasting enjoyment of God&#8217;s gifts depends on steadfast obedience to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I call heaven and earth to witness</span>. Moses speaks in the name of the Lord of all, and so calls to witness the whole created universe to attest his words; the heavens and earth are witnesses for God, and when evil comes on those who transgress his Law, they declare his righteousness (<a href="/psalms/50-4.htm">Psalm 50:4, 6</a>), in that what has befallen the sinner is only what was announced beforehand as the penalty of transgression. <span class="cmt_word">Soon</span>; hastily (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span>), without delay (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/7-4.htm">Deuteronomy 7:4, 22</a> ["at once," Authorized Vers.]; 9:3 ["quickly"], 12, 16). <span class="cmt_word">Prolong days</span>; usually equal to have a long life (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/5-16.htm">Deuteronomy 5:16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-2.htm">Deuteronomy 6:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-9.htm">Deuteronomy 11:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-20.htm">Deuteronomy 17:20</a>, etc.); here it means "continue long to occupy." Only as they continued faithful to Jehovah could they continue as a people to possess the land; severed from him, they lost their title to occupy Canaan, and ceased to be his special people; as a nation they would be destroyed by being scattered among other nations. From <a href="/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a>, etc., and <a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>, it is evident that the author had in view "all the dispersions which would come upon the rebellious nation in future times, even down to the dispersion under the Romans, which continues still;
