His awareness of Israel's future disobedience is rooted in his intimate relationship with God and his understanding of human nature. This foreknowledge is consistent with the biblical theme of leaders preparing their people for future challenges, as seen with Joshua succeeding Moses.<p><b>you will become utterly corrupt</b><br>The phrase indicates a complete moral and spiritual decline. This corruption is a recurring theme in Israel's history, as seen in the Book of Judges, where the cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance is evident. The warning serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's commandments.<p><b>and turn from the path I have commanded you.</b><br>The "path" refers to the covenantal laws and decrees given by God through Moses. This deviation from God's commands is a central issue throughout the Old Testament, highlighting the importance of obedience and the dangers of idolatry and assimilation into pagan cultures.<p><b>And in the days to come, disaster will befall you</b><br>This prophecy of disaster is fulfilled in various instances, such as the Babylonian exile. The consequences of disobedience are a consistent biblical theme, emphasizing the justice and holiness of God. The disasters serve as both punishment and a call to repentance.<p><b>because you will do evil in the sight of the LORD</b><br>The phrase underscores the omniscience of God, who sees all actions. The "evil" refers to idolatry and moral decay, which are abominations to God. This concept is echoed in the prophetic books, where prophets call Israel to account for their sins.<p><b>to provoke Him to anger</b><br>Provoking God to anger is a serious offense, reflecting the covenant relationship between God and Israel. This anger is not capricious but a righteous response to covenant unfaithfulness. The prophets often speak of God's anger as a catalyst for repentance and restoration.<p><b>by the work of your hands.</b><br>This phrase often refers to idolatry, where the Israelites create and worship idols. The "work of your hands" contrasts with the work of God, who created the universe. This idolatry is condemned throughout scripture, as seen in the Ten Commandments and the prophetic writings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is delivering his final words to the people before his death.
