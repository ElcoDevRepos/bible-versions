The "fathers" refers to the patriarchs and the previous generation that perished in the wilderness due to disobedience (<a href="/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29-35</a>). This highlights the continuity and renewal of God's promises, underscoring that each generation must personally embrace the covenant. It also reflects the transition from the Abrahamic covenant to the Mosaic covenant, which was more detailed and included the Law.<p><b>but with all of us who are alive here today</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the immediacy and personal nature of the covenant. It was not just a historical agreement but a living commitment that required the active participation of the current generation. This reflects the communal aspect of Israel's relationship with God, where the covenant was not just with individuals but with the entire nation. It also foreshadows the New Covenant in Christ, where believers are called to a personal and communal relationship with God (<a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, <a href="/hebrews/8-8.htm">Hebrews 8:8-12</a>).

By stressing &#8220;He did not make&#8221; in the past tense, Moses reminds the people that the covenant was a deliberate, historical act by God Himself&#8212;an act still binding. The emphasis on God&#8217;s personal initiation mirrors other covenant moments, such as <a href="/bsb/genesis/15.htm">Genesis 15</a> with Abraham and <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>&#8217;s promise of a new covenant, all showing the LORD as the covenant-maker who keeps His word without fail (<a href="/psalms/105-8.htm">Psalm 105:8&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with our fathers</b><p>The expression &#8220;our fathers&#8221; refers to the patriarchs who preceded the generation standing before Moses&#8212;Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and even the parents who died in the wilderness. Though those earlier generations enjoyed God&#8217;s promises (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-31.htm">Deuteronomy 4:31</a>), the formal, written covenant with its Ten Commandments and stipulations was given at Sinai to this current nation. This clarifies that covenant relationship is not merely hereditary or nostalgic; it is concrete and must be personally received and obeyed (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-25.htm">Deuteronomy 29:25&#8211;26</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/20-18.htm">Ezekiel 20:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but with all of us</b><p>&#8220;Us&#8221; throws the door wide open, including every Israelite&#8212;from leaders to servants, men to women, young to old (<a href="/deuteronomy/29-10.htm">Deuteronomy 29:10&#8211;13</a>). Nobody is left on the sidelines. Such inclusiveness anticipates later declarations that God&#8217;s promises are &#8220;for you and your children and all who are far off&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-39.htm">Acts 2:39</a>) and that He desires &#8220;all people to be saved&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>). Covenant life is communal; love for God is expressed together (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4&#8211;9</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24&#8211;25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who are alive here today</b><p>Moses brings the truth into the present tense: the covenant applies right now, to those breathing and listening.

This urgency echoes throughout Scripture&#8212;&#8220;Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12&#8211;15</a>). Obedience cannot be postponed to future generations or left to memory; it demands present-day faith and action (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22&#8211;25</a>; <a href="/luke/11-28.htm">Luke 11:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/5-3.htm">Deuteronomy 5:3</a> underlines that God&#8217;s covenant at Sinai was not an abstract tradition but a living, binding agreement for the people standing before Moses&#8212;and, by extension, for every generation that enters into relationship with the LORD. It reminds believers that God personally initiates covenant, expects personal commitment, includes every member of the community, and calls for immediate, wholehearted obedience today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Not . . . with our fathers, but with us.</span>--That is, according to the usage of the Hebrew language in drawing contrasts, not <span class= "ital">only </span>with our fathers (who actually heard it), but <span class= "ital">with us also, </span>who were in the loins of our fathers, and for whom the covenant was intended no less than for them;
