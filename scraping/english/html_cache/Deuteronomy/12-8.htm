During their time in the wilderness, worship practices were more flexible due to the lack of a permanent place of worship. The phrase underscores the need for a shift from temporary practices to a more structured and centralized form of worship, which would be established in the land God was giving them. This transition reflects the broader biblical theme of moving from chaos to order, as seen in the creation narrative in Genesis.<p><b>where everyone does what seems right in his own eyes</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the individualistic approach to worship and moral decision-making that was prevalent during the time of the Judges, as echoed in <a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>: "In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes." This period was marked by moral and spiritual anarchy, which often led to idolatry and disobedience to God's commands. The call in Deuteronomy is for a return to covenant faithfulness and obedience to God's laws, which would be facilitated by a centralized place of worship. This phrase also foreshadows the need for a righteous king, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who perfectly embodies and enforces God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being prepared to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The place where the Israelites wandered for 40 years before entering the Promised Land.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land that the Israelites are about to enter, where they are to establish a society based on God's laws.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_law.htm">Obedience to God's Law</a></b><br>The Israelites are instructed to follow God's commands rather than their own inclinations.

It was the <span class= "ital">law of the land </span>which God would give them. In many ways its observance depended on the completion of the conquest of the land, and upon the quietness of the times in which they lived. This prophetic aspect was certainly not unrecognised by the Jews, or they would not (for example) have neglected to dwell in booths at the Feast of Tabernacles from the time of Joshua to Nehemiah. (See <a href="/nehemiah/8-17.htm" title="And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day had not the children of Israel done so.

But after they were settled in Canaan it should no longer be so; a certain order and fixed locality should be determined for their worship and service; when they had passed over Jordan the Lord would give them rest from all their enemies, and then all irregularity and arbitrariness in the matter of worship must cease, and all their gifts arid offerings must be brought to the place which Jehovah their God should choose. <span class="cmt_word">Ye dwell in safety</span>;
