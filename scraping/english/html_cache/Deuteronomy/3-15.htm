The tribe of Manasseh was one of the half-tribes of Israel, and Machir's descendants were known for their strength and valor. In biblical context, Machir represents the leadership and military prowess of the tribe of Manasseh. The allocation of land to Machir signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to the descendants of Joseph, ensuring their inheritance in the Promised Land. This allocation also highlights the importance of family lineage and the continuation of God's covenant with the patriarchs.<p><b>I gave</b><br>The act of giving here is significant as it demonstrates the authority of Moses as the leader of Israel, acting under God's command. It reflects the divine distribution of the land, which was not based on human merit but on God's sovereign will and promise. This giving is a fulfillment of the covenant promises made to the patriarchs, showing God's faithfulness to His word. It also prefigures the ultimate inheritance believers receive through Christ, who gives eternal life to His followers.<p><b>Gilead</b><br>Gilead is a region east of the Jordan River, known for its fertile land and balm, a valuable resin used for healing. Geographically, it was a strategic location, providing a natural defense and resources for the tribes settling there. Historically, Gilead was a contested area due to its richness and strategic importance. The allocation of Gilead to Machir's descendants underscores the fulfillment of God's promise to provide for His people. In a broader biblical context, Gilead is often associated with healing and restoration, symbolizing the spiritual healing found in Christ. The balm of Gilead is a type of Christ, who is the ultimate healer of spiritual wounds.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilead.htm">Gilead</a></b><br>A region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm and fertile land.
