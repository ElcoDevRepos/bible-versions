Throughout the Pentateuch, God frequently speaks to Moses, guiding the Israelites on their journey. This direct communication underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God leads and Israel follows.<p><b>See, I have begun to deliver Sihon and his land over to you</b><br>The mention of Sihon, king of the Amorites, situates this event in a specific historical and geographical context. Sihon's territory was east of the Jordan River, a strategic area for the Israelites as they prepared to enter the Promised Land. The phrase "I have begun to deliver" indicates that God is actively involved in the process, ensuring victory for Israel. This reflects the theme of divine intervention and fulfillment of promises, as God had assured the patriarchs of the land for their descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><b>Now begin to conquer and possess his land</b><br>This command to "conquer and possess" highlights the transition from divine promise to human action. The Israelites are called to participate in God's plan by taking physical possession of the land. This reflects the broader biblical theme of faith and works, where God's promises require human response and obedience. The conquest of Sihon's land is a precursor to the larger conquest of Canaan, symbolizing the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory and inheritance believers have in Christ, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is actively guiding and delivering His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is receiving instructions from God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sihon.htm">Sihon</a></b><br>The king of the Amorites, whose land God is giving to the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_amorites.htm">The Amorites</a></b><br>A group of people living in the land east of the Jordan River, known for their opposition to Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land_of_sihon.htm">The Land of Sihon</a></b><br>The territory that God is instructing the Israelites to conquer and possess.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_deliverance.htm">God's Sovereignty in Deliverance</a></b><br>God initiates the deliverance of His people, demonstrating His control over nations and history.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_command.htm">Obedience to God's Command</a></b><br>The Israelites are called to act on God's promise by beginning the conquest, highlighting the importance of obedience in faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>God&#8217;s timing is perfect;
