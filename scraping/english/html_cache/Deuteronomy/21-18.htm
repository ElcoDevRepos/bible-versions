A "stubborn and rebellious son" would disrupt the family order, which was crucial for maintaining societal stability. The Hebrew terms used here imply a persistent refusal to submit to authority, reflecting a heart hardened against parental guidance. This phrase highlights the importance of obedience and respect within the family unit, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture (<a href="/ephesians/6.htm">Ephesians 6:1-3</a>).<p><b>who does not obey his father and mother</b><br>The command to honor one's parents is foundational in the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). Disobedience to parents was seen as a serious offense, not just against the family but against God's ordained order. In the cultural context, this disobedience could threaten the community's well-being, as the family was the primary unit of social and religious life. The emphasis on both "father and mother" underscores the equal authority of both parents in the upbringing of children.<p><b>and does not listen to them when disciplined</b><br>Discipline in the biblical sense is not merely punitive but corrective, aimed at guiding the child back to the right path (<a href="/proverbs/13-24.htm">Proverbs 13:24</a>). The failure to heed discipline indicates a deeper issue of the heart, a rejection of wisdom and instruction (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>).

First Samuel 15:23 equates rebellion with &#8220;the sin of divination,&#8221; showing how seriously the Lord views it.<p>- The phrase reminds us that sin begins in the heart; outward behavior only reveals what is already entrenched (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>; <a href="/mark/7-21.htm">Mark 7:21-23</a>).<p>- By mentioning &#8220;a man,&#8221; the Law underscores parental responsibility.

Disobedience toward parents is thus disobedience toward God Himself.<p>- Scripture consistently ties long life and blessing to honoring parents (<a href="/proverbs/30-17.htm">Proverbs 30:17</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-1.htm">Ephesians 6:1-3</a>). The converse&#8212;death or loss&#8212;underscores the literal truth of God&#8217;s promises and warnings.<p>- Both parents are named, showing equal dignity and authority in the home (<a href="/leviticus/19-3.htm">Leviticus 19:3</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-20.htm">Colossians 3:20</a>).<p>- The clause teaches that obedience is not optional or negotiable; it is a covenant duty.

It describes a son who repeatedly rejects parental authority and spurns correction. By affirming the literalness of this command, we see:<p>&#8226; God views family authority as a divine trust.<p>&#8226; Ongoing rebellion against parents is rebellion against God.<p>&#8226; Discipline is an act of love meant to restore, but persistent refusal demands decisive action to protect the community&#8217;s purity.<p>The verse reminds every generation that honoring parents and embracing correction are non-negotiable marks of a heart aligned with the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><a href="/context/deuteronomy/21-18.htm" title="If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not listen to them:">Deuteronomy 21:18-21</a>. <span class= "bld">THE INCORRIGIBLE SON.</span><p>(18) <span class= "bld">If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son.</span>--Here we are again reminded that the Law of Jehovah was also the civil and criminal law of Israel.
