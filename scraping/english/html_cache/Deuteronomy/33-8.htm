Levi, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, was set apart for religious duties. The Levites were responsible for the tabernacle and later the temple services, emphasizing their unique role in Israel's spiritual life. This blessing is part of Moses' final words to the tribes of Israel before his death, similar to Jacob's blessings in <a href="/genesis/49.htm">Genesis 49</a>.<p><b>Give Your Thummim to Levi:</b><br>The Thummim, along with the Urim, were sacred lots used by the high priest to discern God's will. They were kept in the breastplate of judgment worn by the high priest (<a href="/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>). This phrase signifies the Levites' role in seeking divine guidance for the nation, highlighting their spiritual leadership and responsibility in maintaining the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>and Your Urim to Your godly one:</b><br>The Urim, like the Thummim, was used for divine decision-making. "Your godly one" refers to the Levites, who were set apart for holy service. This phrase underscores the Levites' dedication to God and their role as intermediaries between God and the people. The use of Urim and Thummim is seen in various biblical accounts, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>, where Saul seeks guidance.<p><b>whom You tested at Massah:</b><br>Massah, meaning "testing," refers to an event in <a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a> where the Israelites quarreled and tested the Lord by demanding water. This testing is a reminder of the Israelites' lack of faith and the challenges faced by Moses and the Levites in leading a rebellious people. It highlights the Levites' endurance and faithfulness under pressure.<p><b>and contested at the waters of Meribah:</b><br>Meribah, meaning "quarreling," is another location where the Israelites complained about the lack of water (<a href="/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20:1-13</a>). This event is significant because Moses struck the rock to bring forth water, an act that led to his being barred from entering the Promised Land. The Levites' involvement in these events underscores their role in mediating between God and the people, as well as the challenges of leadership. The rock at Meribah is also seen as a type of Christ, who provides living water (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-4.htm">1 Corinthians 10:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/levi.htm">Levi</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, set apart for priestly duties and service to God.

The verse explains why Levi, though landless, receives the priceless calling to mediate God&#8217;s word and presence to Israel. For us, it spotlights the pattern: tested faithfulness leads to greater responsibility, and spiritual leadership demands holiness, dependence on divine guidance, and perseverance under trial.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/33.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And of Levi.</span>--Next to Joseph, this tribe has the largest share in Moses' last words, as we might naturally expect, it being his own tribe. The <span class= "ital">character of the priest </span>is the principal subject. The blessing may be thus paraphrased: "Let thy Thummim and thy Urim (the chief high-priestly ornaments) be ever with some saintly man of thine, like him whom thou (Israel) didst tempt in Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah (Moses' own departed brother Aaron is alluded to, for the people murmured against them both in both places), like him (Eleazar or Phinehas) who said to his father and to his mother, 'I have not seen him,' &c. These are the priests that shall teach Jacob thy judgments and Israel thy law." The conduct of the tribe of Levi at Sinai is alluded to, when they stood by Moses and slew the idolaters. Who headed them on that occasion we are not told. Eleazar or Phinehas may be intended. The conduct of Phinehas (in Numbers 25) is also a case in point. As Rashi observes, "his father and his mother, his brethren and children" cannot be taken literally, because the tribe of Levi on the whole was faithful. The fathers, mothers, brethren, and children chiefly belonged to the other tribes.<p><span class= "bld">Let thy Thummim and thy Urim.</span>--See <a href="/exodus/28-30.htm" title="And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his heart before the LORD continually.">Exodus 28:30</a>.

It is not at all easy to distribute the pronouns with certainty in this speech.<p>If the writer of Deuteronomy was unconscious of any difference between priest and Levite, how is the mention of Urim and Thummim to be explained?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/33.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-11.</span> - The blessing on Levi is also in the form of a prayer. In Jacob's blessing, Simeon is joined with Levi, but Moses passes him over altogether, probably because, as Jacob foretold, he was to be scattered among his brethren (<a href="/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>), and so lose his tribal individuality. Simeon, however, is included in the general blessing pronounced on Israel; and as this tribe received a number of towns within the territory of Judah (<a href="/joshua/19-2.htm">Joshua 19:2-9</a>), it was probably regarded as included in the blessing on that tribe. <span class="cmt_word">Thy Thummim and thy Urim</span>; <span class="accented">thy Right and thy Light</span> (cf. <a href="/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>). The high priest wore the breast-plate on which these were placed when he went in before the Lord; and this is here represented as the prerogative of the whole tribe. Thy holy one; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Levi, the tribe-father, representing the whole tribe to which the blessing applies; hence in the following verses the verb passes into the plural. For "holy one," it would be better to read "pious" or "godly one;" literally, <span class="accented">the man thy pious one</span>. Some would render "the man thy favored one," or "the man of thy friendship;" but this is wholly arbitrary, the word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>) has no such meaning. To explain this more particularly, reference is made to the trials at <span class="cmt_word">Massah</span> <span class="cmt_word">and the waters of Meribah</span> (strife), when the people rebelled and murmured against Moses and Aaron, whereby the piety of these men was put to the test, and in them, the heads of the tribe of Levi, the whole tribe was proved. (On Massah, see <a href="/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>; and on the waters of strife, see <a href="/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1-13</a>.) In these trials, Levi had proved himself faithful and godly, having risen up in defense of the honor of Jehovah, and in support of his covenant, though in the latter case both Moses and Aaron stumbled. <span class="cmt_word">Who said unto his father and to his mother</span>, etc. This refers to what is narrated in <a href="/exodus/32-26.htm">Exodus 32:26-29</a>, when the Levites drew their swords against their brethren at the command of Moses, to execute judgment without respect of person, because of the sin of the people in the matter of the golden calf (cf. also <a href="/numbers/25-8.htm">Numbers 25:8</a>, and, for the principle here implicitly commended, see <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-29.htm">Matthew 19:29</a>; <a href="/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>). Because of their zealous devotion to the claims and service of the Lord, the dignity of the priesthood had been conferred on this tribe; and to them belonged the high office of being instructors of the people in Divine things, and of presenting the sacrifices of the people to the Lord. For those entrusted with such an office, nothing was more to be desired than that they should be blessed with power rightly to discharge the duties of their office, that their service should be accepted with favor, and that their enemies and haters should be foiled and rendered impotent; and for this Moses prays on their behalf. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Concerning Levi</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1456;&#1500;&#1461;&#1493;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;l&#601;&#183;l&#234;&#183;w&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124;
