Their words were filled with doubt and fear, as recorded in <a href="/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14:1-4</a>, where they expressed a desire to return to Egypt rather than face the challenges ahead. This reflects a recurring theme in the wilderness journey, where the Israelites frequently questioned God's provision and plan. The LORD's hearing signifies His omniscience and His attentiveness to the attitudes and expressions of His people.<p><b>He grew angry</b><br>God's anger here is a response to the Israelites' persistent unbelief and rebellion. This is not a capricious anger but a righteous indignation against sin and disobedience. Throughout the Old Testament, God's anger is often depicted as a reaction to covenant unfaithfulness (e.g., <a href="/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>, <a href="/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11:1</a>). It serves as a reminder of God's holiness and the seriousness of turning away from His commands. The anger of God is also a precursor to His judgment, which is both just and corrective.<p><b>and swore an oath, saying</b><br>The swearing of an oath by God underscores the certainty and seriousness of His pronouncement. In biblical times, an oath was a solemn promise, often invoking God as a witness to its truthfulness. Here, God Himself makes an oath, highlighting the irrevocable nature of His decision. This is reminiscent of other divine oaths in Scripture, such as God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16-18</a>. Theologically, it points to the unchangeable nature of God's word and His commitment to justice. This oath would result in the decree that the current generation would not enter the Promised Land, as further detailed in <a href="/numbers/14-28.htm">Numbers 14:28-30</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is holy, just, and righteous.
