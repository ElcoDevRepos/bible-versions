They are often associated with the Rephaim, a term used in the Old Testament to describe ancient giants or mighty warriors. The mention of the Emites provides historical context, indicating that the land had been occupied by formidable peoples before the Israelites' conquest. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God displacing powerful nations to fulfill His promises to Israel.<p><b>a people great and many</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the size and strength of the Emites, suggesting they were a populous and powerful group. The description aligns with other biblical accounts of large and intimidating nations that Israel encountered. It serves to highlight the miraculous nature of Israel's victories, as they were able to overcome such formidable foes through divine intervention. This theme is echoed in other parts of the Old Testament, where God delivers Israel from seemingly insurmountable odds.<p><b>as tall as the Anakites</b><br>The Anakites were another group of giants mentioned in the Bible, known for their impressive stature. The comparison to the Anakites underscores the physical might of the Emites, further emphasizing the challenge they posed. The Anakites are also linked to the Nephilim, mentioned in <a href="/genesis/6-4.htm">Genesis 6:4</a>, and are part of the narrative of giants in the land that the Israelites feared.

In Moab dwelt, in the earlier times, the Emim, a giant race, potent and numerous, like the 'Anakim. They were also, like the 'Anakim reckoned among the Rephaim, but were by the Moabites called Emim. The word <span class="cmt_word">Emim</span> means frightful, and was given to these men probably because of their huge stature and fierce aspect. <span class="cmt_word">Anakims</span> (see <a href="/deuteronomy/1-28.htm">Deuteronomy 1:28</a>). <span class="accented">Rephaim</span> seems to have been a generic name of these gigantic Canaanitish tribes (see <a href="/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>; <a href="/genesis/15-20.htm">Genesis 15:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Horim</span> appear from the name (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span>, a cave) to have been a Troglodyte race, inhabiting the caves which abound in the Edomite range, and with whom, perhaps, originated the conception which was at a later period carried out in the marvelous rock city of Petra.
