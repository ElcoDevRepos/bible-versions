This period is crucial in understanding the formation of Israel's identity as a nation. The experience of slavery and subsequent deliverance by God through Moses is foundational to their faith and covenant relationship with God. The memory of Egypt serves as a reminder of God's power and faithfulness in delivering His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/12-41.htm">Exodus 12:41-42</a>. It also underscores the importance of obedience and trust in God, who brought them out of bondage.<p><b>and how we passed through the nations on the way here.</b><br>This part of the verse refers to the Israelites' journey through the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt. During this time, they encountered various nations, such as the Amalekites, Moabites, and Edomites, each presenting challenges and opportunities for the Israelites to rely on God's guidance and provision. The journey is documented in the books of Exodus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy, highlighting God's miraculous interventions, such as providing manna and water, and victories over enemies. This passage through the nations also serves as a test of faith and obedience, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2-3</a>, where God humbles and tests the Israelites to know what is in their hearts.
