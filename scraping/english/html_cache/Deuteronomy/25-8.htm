They were respected leaders, often chosen for their wisdom and experience. The city gate was a common place for legal matters to be addressed, as seen in <a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1-11</a>. This setting underscores the communal nature of justice in Israelite society, where personal matters were also community concerns. The elders' involvement highlights the importance of accountability and the communal responsibility to uphold God's laws, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>, where judges and officials are appointed to ensure justice.<p><b>If he persists and says,</b><br>The persistence of the man in refusing to marry the widow indicates a deliberate choice, despite the societal and familial expectations. This reflects the tension between personal desires and communal obligations. The law of levirate marriage, as outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>, was designed to protect the widow and preserve the family line. The man's refusal could be seen as a failure to fulfill his duty, which was not only a personal decision but also a public matter, affecting the community's perception of justice and righteousness.<p><b>&#8220;I do not want to marry her,&#8221;</b><br>This statement of refusal is significant in the context of levirate marriage, where the brother-in-law was expected to marry the widow to produce offspring for the deceased brother. The refusal could be motivated by various factors, such as financial concerns, personal dislike, or the desire to avoid additional responsibilities. This act of refusal was not without consequence, as it led to a public ceremony of shame, described in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-9.htm">Deuteronomy 25:9-10</a>, where the widow would remove his sandal and spit in his face. This public act served as a deterrent and a reminder of the importance of familial duty. The refusal also contrasts with the selfless love and sacrifice exemplified by Christ, who is often seen as the ultimate kinsman-redeemer, fulfilling the law and offering redemption to humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders_of_the_city.htm">Elders of the City</a></b><br>These are the respected leaders or judges within the community who are responsible for maintaining justice and order.

In ancient Israel the city elders served as judges at the gate, safeguarding covenant faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-1.htm">Ruth 4:1-2</a>). Their involvement shows that the levirate duty was not merely a private family matter; it affected the whole covenant community. The elders embody God&#8217;s concern that justice and mercy be upheld locally (<a href="/numbers/35-24.htm">Numbers 35:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>shall summon him</b><p>Accountability is immediate and personal&#8212;he is &#8220;summoned.&#8221; As in <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15-17</a>, unwillingness to obey God&#8217;s revealed will must be faced, not ignored. By calling him publicly, the elders cut off evasions and make sure the widow&#8217;s rights are protected (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and speak with him</b><p>The first aim is persuasion, not punishment. The elders &#8220;speak&#8221; to urge obedience to the levirate command (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-6</a>). Scripture regularly places corrective conversation before discipline (<a href="/proverbs/15-22.htm">Proverbs 15:22</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>). The man is given a gracious opportunity to reconsider, reflecting God&#8217;s own patience toward the stubborn (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If he persists</b><p>Persistence exposes a settled refusal, not a momentary hesitation. Willful disobedience hardens the heart (<a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7-8</a>). Once persuasion fails, the law proceeds to protect the widow and uphold the family line. This mirrors the progression Jesus outlines: private appeal, then witnesses, then the wider assembly (<a href="/matthew/18-16.htm">Matthew 18:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and says, &#8220;I do not want to marry her,&#8221;</b><p>The explicit verbal refusal removes doubt. Like the unnamed kinsman in <a href="/ruth/4-6.htm">Ruth 4:6</a>, he chooses personal convenience over covenant duty. His words trigger the next steps&#8212;public shaming and removal of his sandal (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-9.htm">Deuteronomy 25:9-10</a>). The verse therefore sets the threshold where mercy ends and discipline begins, underscoring that God honors the vulnerable and expects His people to do the same (<a href="/psalms/68-5.htm">Psalm 68:5</a>; <a href="/james/1-27.htm">James 1:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/25-8.htm">Deuteronomy 25:8</a> describes a measured, communal process: elders intervene, summon, persuade, and only then allow formal refusal. The verse highlights God&#8217;s concern for justice, family legacy, and the protection of widows. It teaches that obedience is both personal and communal, that mercy precedes discipline, and that stubborn refusal carries consequences within God&#8217;s covenant order.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/25-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the elders</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ziq&#183;n&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2205.htm">Strong's 2205: </a> </span><span class="str2">Old</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of his city</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#238;&#183;r&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
