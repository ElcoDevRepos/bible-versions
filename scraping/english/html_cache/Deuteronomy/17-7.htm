This phrase emphasizes the responsibility and accountability of the witnesses. By being the first to act, witnesses were required to be certain of their testimony, knowing they would initiate the execution. This practice served as a deterrent against false accusations, as seen in the story of Naboth's vineyard (1 Kings 21). It also reflects the seriousness of bearing false witness, a violation of the Ten Commandments (<a href="/exodus/20-16.htm">Exodus 20:16</a>). Theologically, this prefigures the role of Christ as the faithful and true witness (<a href="/revelation/3-14.htm">Revelation 3:14</a>), who bears witness to the truth.<p><b>and after that, the hands of all the people</b><br>This communal involvement underscores the collective responsibility of the community to uphold justice and maintain holiness. It reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where the community is called to be holy as God is holy (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). The participation of all the people in the execution process also served to reinforce the seriousness of sin and the need for communal purity. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where church discipline involves the community (<a href="/matthew/18-17.htm">Matthew 18:17</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment where all will stand before God (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>).<p><b>So you must purge the evil from among you</b><br>This command highlights the necessity of removing sin to maintain the sanctity of the community. The phrase "purge the evil" is repeated throughout Deuteronomy (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5, 19</a>:19) and emphasizes the need for Israel to be distinct from surrounding nations. It reflects the holiness code found in Leviticus and the call to be a kingdom of priests (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>). In the New Testament, this concept is spiritualized as believers are called to put to death the deeds of the body (<a href="/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>) and to cleanse themselves from all defilement (<a href="/2_corinthians/7.htm">2 Corinthians 7:1</a>). This purging is ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who purifies His people (<a href="/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>) and will one day eradicate all evil (<a href="/revelation/21-27.htm">Revelation 21:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/w/witnesses.htm">Witnesses</a></b><br>Individuals who have firsthand knowledge of a crime or wrongdoing.
