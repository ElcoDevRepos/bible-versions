Hatred in the heart is a significant theme in Scripture, often equated with murder (1 <a href="/john/3-15.htm">John 3:15</a>). The commandment "You shall not murder" (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>) is rooted in the sanctity of life, and harboring hatred violates this principle.<p><b>and lies in wait</b><br>This indicates premeditation and intent, distinguishing it from crimes of passion or accidental harm. The act of lying in wait suggests a calculated plan, reflecting the deceitfulness of sin (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>). It echoes the behavior of Cain, who premeditated the murder of Abel (<a href="/genesis/4-8.htm">Genesis 4:8</a>).<p><b>attacks him and kills him</b><br>The act of murder is the culmination of hatred and deceit. This phrase underscores the severity of taking a life, which is an affront to God, the giver of life (<a href="/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>). The law provided for capital punishment in such cases (<a href="/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16-21</a>), emphasizing justice and the value of human life.<p><b>and then flees to one of these cities</b><br>Referring to the cities of refuge established in <a href="/deuteronomy/19.htm">Deuteronomy 19:1-10</a>, these cities were meant to protect those who committed unintentional manslaughter. However, a murderer seeking refuge there would be abusing the system. The cities symbolize God's provision of mercy and justice, but they also highlight the need for discernment in applying the law. This foreshadows Christ as our ultimate refuge, offering protection and justice (<a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hater.htm">The Hater</a></b><br>This refers to an individual who harbors malice against another person, leading to premeditated murder.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_neighbor.htm">The Neighbor</a></b><br>The victim in this scenario, who is targeted by the hater.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cities_of_refuge.htm">Cities of Refuge</a></b><br>These were designated places where someone who committed unintentional manslaughter could seek asylum.
