In the context of Deuteronomy, this is a warning against idolatry and covenant unfaithfulness. The irrevocable nature of this statement highlights the gravity of sin and rebellion against God. It reflects the holiness and justice of God, who cannot tolerate sin. This echoes the warnings found in <a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26-27</a> about the consequences of willful sin after receiving the knowledge of the truth.<p><b>Instead, His anger and jealousy will burn against that man,</b><br>God's anger and jealousy are often mentioned in the context of idolatry, as seen in <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>. Jealousy here is not envy but a protective zeal for His people and His covenant. The imagery of burning suggests intense and consuming wrath, similar to the descriptions in <a href="/isaiah/30-27.htm">Isaiah 30:27-30</a>. This reflects God's passionate commitment to His covenant and His intolerance for infidelity.<p><b>and every curse written in this book will fall upon him.</b><br>The curses referred to are detailed in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, which outlines the consequences of disobedience to God's law. These curses include various forms of suffering and calamity, serving as a deterrent against breaking the covenant. The specificity of these curses underscores the comprehensive nature of God's law and the seriousness of covenantal obligations. This is reminiscent of the blessings and curses found in ancient Near Eastern treaties, where loyalty was rewarded, and betrayal was severely punished.<p><b>The LORD will blot out his name from under heaven.</b><br>To have one's name blotted out signifies complete removal from the community and memory, akin to erasure from the Book of Life mentioned in <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>. This phrase indicates total separation from God's people and His promises. In ancient Israel, one's name was tied to identity and legacy, so this represents a profound loss. It serves as a stark warning of the ultimate consequence of unrepentant sin and rebellion against God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is just and righteous, and who demands faithfulness from His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, delivering God's message and covenant terms to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are receiving the covenant renewal and warnings from Moses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_covenant.htm">The Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between God and Israel, which includes blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites are about to enter, contingent upon their faithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>Sin is not a trivial matter to God.
