In ancient Israel, the requirement for multiple witnesses was a safeguard against false accusations and miscarriages of justice. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus and Paul both reference the necessity of two or three witnesses (<a href="/matthew/18-16.htm">Matthew 18:16</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/13.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>). It underscores the importance of truth and fairness in legal proceedings, reflecting God's justice.<p><b>a man shall be put to death</b><br>The context here is the administration of capital punishment under the Mosaic Law. The death penalty was prescribed for certain offenses, such as murder, idolatry, and blasphemy, reflecting the seriousness with which these transgressions were viewed. This phrase highlights the gravity of the judicial process and the need for certainty before such an irreversible sentence is carried out. It also points to the holiness and justice of God, who demands that sin be dealt with severely.<p><b>but he shall not be executed on the testimony of a lone witness</b><br>This clause reinforces the protection against wrongful execution by prohibiting the death penalty based on the testimony of a single individual. It reflects a deep concern for justice and the value of human life, ensuring that no one is condemned without sufficient evidence. This principle is consistent with the broader biblical theme of justice and mercy, and it serves as a reminder of the fallibility of human judgment. It also foreshadows the ultimate justice and mercy found in Jesus Christ, who bore the penalty for sin on behalf of humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, Moses is delivering God's laws to the Israelites as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving the law as a guide for living in covenant with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/witnesses.htm">Witnesses</a></b><br>Individuals who provide testimony in legal matters, crucial for establishing truth and justice in the community.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judicial_system.htm">Judicial System</a></b><br>The system of laws and procedures established by God for the governance of Israel, emphasizing justice and fairness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_justice.htm">The Importance of Justice</a></b><br>God's law emphasizes fairness and justice, ensuring that no one is condemned without sufficient evidence.

Spiritual discipline and public reputation both demand careful verification.<p>&#8226; Practically, the verse warns believers to resist snap judgments.
