This centralization was intended to unify worship practices and prevent idolatry. The phrase underscores the importance of God's chosen location, which was a significant aspect of Israelite identity and religious practice. The distance mentioned acknowledges the practical challenges faced by Israelites living far from the central sanctuary.<p><b>then you may slaughter any of the herd or flock He has given you</b><br>This provision allows for the slaughter of animals for food outside of the central sanctuary, which was a practical necessity for those living far from the designated place of worship. It highlights God's provision and understanding of the people's needs. The phrase also emphasizes that the animals are a gift from God, reminding the Israelites of His continual provision and blessing.<p><b>as I have commanded you</b><br>This refers to the specific instructions given by God regarding the proper way to slaughter animals, ensuring that the Israelites maintained ritual purity and obedience to God's laws. It reflects the broader theme of obedience to divine commandments, which is a central tenet of the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The phrase underscores the importance of following God's instructions in all aspects of life.<p><b>and you may eat it within your gates whenever you want</b><br>This phrase grants the Israelites the freedom to consume meat within their own towns and homes, rather than having to travel to the central sanctuary. "Within your gates" refers to the local communities or cities where the Israelites lived. This provision reflects God's understanding of the practicalities of daily life and His desire for His people to enjoy His blessings. It also signifies a shift from earlier practices where all slaughtering was associated with sacrificial offerings, allowing for a more personal and communal enjoyment of God's provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who chooses a specific place for His Name to dwell.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people receiving the commandments through Moses, preparing to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_place_of_god's_name.htm">The Place of God's Name</a></b><br>Refers to the central sanctuary where God chooses to dwell among His people, initially the Tabernacle and later the Temple in Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/herd_or_flock.htm">Herd or Flock</a></b><br>Represents the livestock that the Israelites were permitted to slaughter and eat.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gates.htm">Gates</a></b><br>Symbolizes the cities or towns where the Israelites lived, indicating local consumption of meat.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_worship.htm">God's Sovereignty in Worship</a></b><br>God chooses the place of worship, emphasizing His authority and the importance of obedience to His commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/flexibility_in_worship_practices.htm">Flexibility in Worship Practices</a></b><br>The allowance for local slaughter shows God's understanding of practical needs and His provision for His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/centrality_of_god's_presence.htm">Centrality of God's Presence</a></b><br>While the physical location of worship was significant, the ultimate focus is on God's presence and His relationship with His people.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_sacrifices_today.htm">Spiritual Sacrifices Today</a></b><br>In the New Covenant, believers are called to offer spiritual sacrifices, such as praise and good deeds, as acts of worship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_fellowship.htm">Community and Fellowship</a></b><br>Eating within the gates signifies community life and fellowship, which are vital aspects of worship and living out faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_12_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 12:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deuteronomy_12_21_s_relevance_today.htm">How does Deuteronomy 12:21 guide us in following God's commands today?

By this word the Hebrews designated the animal life-principle in men and in beasts; and as without this the body was a mere inert mass, the word came to be used for "life" generally. Of this life the blood was believed to be the seat, and was regarded as the symbol, so that to shed blood was tantamount to the taking away of life. As the blood, moreover, was the life, in it was supposed to lie the propitiatory power - the power, when shed, of atoning for sin, as the giving of life for life. The prohibition of eating it doubtless had respect to this. It was not merely to prevent ferocity in men towards the lower animals (as Rosenm&uuml;ller suggests) that the eating of blood was interdicted, but specially because there was in this a sort of profanation, a putting to a common use of what appertained to a sacred rite. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/12-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the place</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1431;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;m&#257;&#183;q&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
