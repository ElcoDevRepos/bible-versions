Stoning was a common method of capital punishment in the ancient Near East, symbolizing the community's collective judgment against sin. The involvement of "all the men of his city" underscores the seriousness of the offense and the necessity for communal participation in upholding the law. This practice is rooted in the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where the community is responsible for maintaining holiness. The act of stoning is also seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a> and <a href="/numbers/15-35.htm">Numbers 15:35</a>, where it serves as a deterrent against sin and a means to maintain purity within the community.<p><b>So you must purge the evil from among you,</b><br>The command to "purge the evil" highlights the need for the community to remove sin to maintain its covenant relationship with God. This phrase is repeated throughout Deuteronomy (e.g., <a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5, 17</a>:7, 19:19) and emphasizes the importance of holiness and obedience to God's laws. The concept of purging evil is not only about punishment but also about restoration and protection of the community's spiritual integrity. It reflects the seriousness with which God views sin and the necessity for His people to live according to His statutes.<p><b>and all Israel will hear and be afraid.</b><br>The purpose of the punishment is not only retributive but also preventative. By ensuring that "all Israel will hear and be afraid," the law serves as a deterrent against future disobedience. This reflects the broader biblical principle that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The fear mentioned here is not merely terror but a reverent acknowledgment of God's holiness and justice. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where the early church's handling of sin, as seen in <a href="/acts/5-11.htm">Acts 5:11</a> with Ananias and Sapphira, also resulted in great fear and reverence among the people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rebellious_son.htm">The Rebellious Son</a></b><br>The subject of the law in this passage, a son who is stubborn and rebellious, refusing to obey his parents.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_parents.htm">The Parents</a></b><br>The father and mother who bring their son to the elders of the city due to his rebellious behavior.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_elders_of_the_city.htm">The Elders of the City</a></b><br>The leaders who are responsible for upholding the law and ensuring justice is served.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_men_of_the_city.htm">The Men of the City</a></b><br>The community members who carry out the sentence of stoning.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation as a whole, which is to learn from this act and be deterred from similar behavior.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_rebellion.htm">The Seriousness of Rebellion</a></b><br>The passage underscores the severity of rebellion against parental authority, reflecting the broader theme of rebellion against God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The involvement of the entire community in the execution of justice highlights the collective responsibility to uphold God's standards.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_discipline.htm">The Purpose of Discipline</a></b><br>Discipline serves to correct and deter sinful behavior, aiming to restore order and righteousness within the community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_as_a_deterrent.htm">Fear as a Deterrent</a></b><br>The fear of consequences is intended to prevent others from engaging in similar rebellious acts, promoting societal harmony.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_and_purity.htm">Holiness and Purity</a></b><br>The command to purge evil emphasizes the need for holiness and purity within the community of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_21_21_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 21:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_21_21_Community_s_role_in_sin.htm">How does Deuteronomy 21:21 emphasize the importance of community accountability in sin?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/How_to_address_sin_biblically.htm">What does "purge the evil from among you" teach about dealing with sin?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_this_verse_to_NT_church_discipline.htm">How does this verse connect with New Testament teachings on church discipline?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_use_communal_responsibility.htm">In what ways can we apply the principle of communal responsibility today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Deut_21_21_on_justice_mercy.htm">How does understanding Deuteronomy 21:21 influence our view of justice and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_stone_a_rebellious_son_in_Deut_21_21.htm">Why does Deuteronomy 21:21 prescribe stoning for a rebellious son?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Modern_view_on_Deut_21_21_harshness.htm">How should modern Christians interpret the harshness of Deuteronomy 21:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_harsh_punishment_in_Deut_21_21.htm">What historical context explains the severe punishment in Deuteronomy 21:21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/bible's_stance_on_stoning_rebels.htm">What does the Bible say about stoning rebellious children?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_capital_punishment_for_minor_sins.htm">Why does the Old Testament prescribe capital punishment for minor offenses?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_stoning_a_son_conflict_with_'do_not_murder'.htm">Deuteronomy 21:18&#8211;21: Does the mandate to stone a rebellious son conflict with the commandment against murder (Exodus 20:13)?
