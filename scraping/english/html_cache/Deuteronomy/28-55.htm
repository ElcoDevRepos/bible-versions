The enemies are not just political adversaries but are used by God to discipline His people, as seen in the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem (2 Kings 25).<p><b>within all your gates</b><br>The phrase "within all your gates" signifies that the calamity will affect the entire nation, not just isolated areas.
