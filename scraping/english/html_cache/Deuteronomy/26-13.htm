The presence of the LORD signifies a sacred space, reminding the Israelites of God's omnipresence and their covenant relationship with Him. This act of declaration is a form of worship and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty.<p><b>I have removed from my house the sacred portion</b><br>The "sacred portion" refers to the tithe, a tenth of one's produce, which was set apart for holy purposes. This practice was a tangible expression of faith and obedience, acknowledging God's provision and ownership of all resources. Removing it from one's house signifies a deliberate act of dedication and separation for God's use, reflecting the principle of firstfruits found throughout Scripture.<p><b>and have given it to the Levite, the foreigner, the fatherless, and the widow</b><br>This distribution underscores the social justice aspect of the Law, ensuring provision for those without land or means of support.

The giver speaks &#8220;in the presence of the LORD,&#8221; acknowledging that the Lord Himself witnesses every act of obedience (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>). This moment ties worship to everyday stewardship. Earlier instructions show the worshiper physically bringing firstfruits and tithes to the place God chose for His name (<a href="/deuteronomy/26-1.htm">Deuteronomy 26:1-2</a>; 12:5-7). Standing before God&#8217;s altar, the believer verbally affirms what has already been carried out, echoing David&#8217;s heart: &#8220;Everything comes from You, and we have given You only what comes from Your hand&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/29-14.htm">1 Chronicles 29:14-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have removed from my house the sacred portion</b><p>&#8220;Removed&#8221; stresses deliberate separation.

Partial obedience was not enough (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-17.htm">Deuteronomy 6:17</a>). The worshiper affirms that he followed the instruction down to the details&#8212;timing (every third year), place (the sanctuary), amount (the full tenth), and purpose (meeting genuine needs). Jesus later echoes this comprehensive obedience when He says, &#8220;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-23.htm">John 14:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have not transgressed or forgotten Your commandments</b><p>The speaker testifies to inward integrity as well as outward action.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Not transgressed&#8221; points to avoiding overt violation (<a href="/psalms/19-13.htm">Psalm 19:13</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Not forgotten&#8221; guards against negligent omission (<a href="/psalms/119-93.htm">Psalm 119:93</a>).<p>Both matter. Paul would later echo the same conscience check: &#8220;My conscience is clear, but that does not vindicate me; it is the Lord who judges&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-4.htm">1 Corinthians 4:4</a>). True obedience keeps memory alive and behavior clean.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/26-13.htm">Deuteronomy 26:13</a> portrays a worshiper joyfully declaring that he has treated God&#8217;s tithe as holy, moved it out of personal possession, and distributed it precisely as God commanded for the care of Levites and society&#8217;s most vulnerable. The confession affirms wholehearted obedience&#8212;no shortcuts, no forgetfulness, no hidden transgression&#8212;lived openly before the Lord. The verse calls every believer to view possessions as God&#8217;s, to give deliberately and compassionately, and to walk in integrity that can confidently stand &#8220;in the presence of the LORD.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say before the Lord</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. address him as present and ready to hear.
