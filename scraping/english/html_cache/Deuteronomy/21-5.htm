Their role as priests is rooted in their selection by God to serve in the tabernacle and later the temple. This phrase emphasizes their unique position among the tribes of Israel. The Levites did not receive a territorial inheritance like the other tribes, as their inheritance was the Lord Himself (<a href="/numbers/18-20.htm">Numbers 18:20-24</a>). Their coming forward signifies their active role in religious and judicial matters, highlighting their authority and responsibility in the community.<p><b>for the LORD your God has chosen them to serve Him</b><br>This choice by God underscores the divine selection and sanctification of the Levites for His service. It reflects the broader biblical theme of God choosing individuals or groups for specific purposes, as seen with figures like Abraham and David. The Levites' service included maintaining the sanctuary, offering sacrifices, and teaching the law (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>). This divine election is a reminder of God's sovereignty and His plans for His people.<p><b>and pronounce blessings in His name</b><br>The act of pronouncing blessings was a significant priestly function, symbolizing the mediation between God and His people. The Aaronic blessing in <a href="/numbers/6-24.htm">Numbers 6:24-26</a> is a prime example of this role. Blessings were not mere words but carried the power and authority of God when spoken by His chosen representatives. This function points to the priests as conduits of divine favor and grace, foreshadowing the ultimate blessing brought through Jesus Christ, our High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>and to give a ruling in every dispute and case of assault</b><br>The priests also served as judges, providing rulings in legal matters. This judicial role is seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8-13</a>, where difficult cases were brought to the priests and judges for resolution. Their involvement in legal disputes ensured that decisions were made according to God's law, maintaining justice and order within the community.

God placed them at the center of Israel&#8217;s worship and civic life. Whenever a matter was too weighty for ordinary judges, the priests literally &#8220;came forward&#8221; as visible representatives of God&#8217;s authority (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-9.htm">Deuteronomy 17:9</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/19-8.htm">2 Chronicles 19:8</a>). Their presence reminded the community that every issue&#8212;even a messy crime scene&#8212;belonged first to the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the LORD your God has chosen them</b><p>Their authority was never self-appointed. From the moment Aaron was set apart (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>), God Himself selected this tribe for sacred duties. Choice implies ownership: the priests were God&#8217;s possession, not Israel&#8217;s employees (<a href="/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>). This divine election underlines the reliability of their ministry; when they spoke in line with God&#8217;s word, Israel could trust the ruling as God&#8217;s own verdict.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to serve Him</b><p>Service was practical and continual: caring for the tabernacle, handling sacrifices, guarding holiness (<a href="/numbers/3-7.htm">Numbers 3:7-8</a>; 18:5). Every task&#8212;whether carrying the ark or teaching the law&#8212;was done &#8220;unto the LORD,&#8221; not for personal prestige. Their model of consecrated service foreshadows the believer&#8217;s calling today (<a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and pronounce blessings in His name</b><p>Priests did more than solve problems; they conveyed God&#8217;s favor. The Aaronic Benediction&#8212;&#8220;The LORD bless you and keep you&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/6-22.htm">Numbers 6:22-27</a>)&#8212;illustrates how spoken blessing transmitted real covenant benefits. After David brought the ark to Jerusalem, he &#8220;blessed the people in the name of the LORD of Hosts&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/6-18.htm">2 Samuel 6:18</a>). When priests lifted their hands and voiced blessing, heaven&#8217;s peace and protection rested on the hearers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and to give a ruling in every dispute and case of assault</b><p>Life in a fallen world breeds conflict. God assigned priests to render final judgments in complicated lawsuits, especially those involving bloodshed (<a href="/exodus/22-8.htm">Exodus 22:8-9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8-13</a>). Because they stood before Him daily, they were equipped to weigh evidence with spiritual discernment. Malachi later rebuked unfaithful priests, reminding them, &#8220;the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge, and men should seek instruction from his mouth&#8221; (<a href="/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>). Upholding justice was therefore an act of worship, protecting the community and reflecting God&#8217;s character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a> reveals a God-designed process for blending worship and justice. The Levitical priests&#8212;chosen by the Lord&#8212;step forward to serve Him, bless the people, and deliver righteous judgments. Their ministry safeguarded holiness, ensured fair decisions, and poured God&#8217;s favor on Israel. In every generation, God calls His servants to the same pattern: stand in His presence, speak His blessings, and apply His truth to real-world conflicts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near.</span> The presence of the priests at this ceremony was due to their position as the servants of Jehovah the King of Israel, on whom it devolved to see that all was done in any matter as his Law prescribed.
