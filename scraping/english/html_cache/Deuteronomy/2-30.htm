The refusal to allow passage reflects the common practice of ancient Near Eastern kings to protect their territories from foreign encroachment. This incident is part of Israel's journey to the Promised Land, highlighting the challenges they faced. The refusal also sets the stage for a divinely orchestrated confrontation, emphasizing God's sovereignty over nations.<p><b>for the LORD your God had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate</b><br>This phrase indicates divine intervention in the affairs of nations, similar to God's hardening of Pharaoh's heart in Exodus. It underscores the belief that God can influence the decisions of rulers to fulfill His purposes. The hardening of Sihon's heart serves to demonstrate God's power and the inevitability of His plans for Israel. This action is not arbitrary but part of a larger divine strategy to give Israel victory and possession of the land.<p><b>that He might deliver him into your hand</b><br>The deliverance of Sihon into Israel's hands is a fulfillment of God's promise to give the Israelites the land of Canaan. It illustrates the theme of divine justice and retribution against those who oppose God's people. This victory is a testament to God's faithfulness and His role as a warrior on behalf of Israel. It also prefigures the ultimate victory of Christ over spiritual enemies, as seen in the New Testament.<p><b>as is the case this day</b><br>This phrase serves as a historical marker, affirming the reality of the events described. It emphasizes the fulfillment of God's promises in real time and space, providing a tangible example of His faithfulness.

It is not to be supposed that any influence was <span class="accented">directly</span> exerted on him, to make him obdurate and persistent in his hostility to the people of God; the expression "he would not" indicates that it was of his own will that Sihon acted; but it was the will and purpose of God that Sihon should be destroyed, and his country taken by the Israelites, and so he was placed in circumstances by which, "given over to a reprobate mind," he was confirmed and strengthened m his determination to pursue a course which led to his destruction; like Pharaoh, by the circumstances in which God placed him, he found scope for the display and for the confirmation of a stubborn, pertinacious pride of spirit, which led ultimately to his ruin.
