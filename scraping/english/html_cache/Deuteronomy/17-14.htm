It reflects God's covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>) and the continuation of His faithfulness to the descendants of Israel. The land is a gift from God, underscoring His sovereignty and the Israelites' role as stewards rather than owners. This promise is central to the identity and mission of Israel as God's chosen people.<p><b>and have taken possession of it and settled in it</b><br>This indicates a future time when the Israelites will have fully occupied the Promised Land. It suggests a period of peace and stability, contrasting with the wilderness wanderings. The process of taking possession involves both divine assistance and human responsibility, as seen in the conquest narratives of Joshua. Settlement implies a transition from a nomadic lifestyle to a more established society, which would bring new challenges and temptations.<p><b>and you say, &#8220;Let us set a king over us like all the nations around us,&#8221;</b><br>This anticipates Israel's desire for a monarchy, which is later fulfilled in <a href="/1_samuel/8.htm">1 Samuel 8</a>. The request for a king reflects a tension between God's ideal theocracy and the people's desire to conform to surrounding nations. It highlights the human tendency to seek security in human leadership rather than divine guidance. This request is seen as a rejection of God's kingship (<a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>).

It is noticeable that Moses in this place says nothing in disapproval of the design. In fact his words might easily have been cited by the people in support of their proposal. Moses said we should need a king; why should we not ask for on? Looked at this way, the citation of the words of Deuteronomy in Samuel is perfectly natural. The people confirm their request by presenting it in the very words of Moses. But if we suppose (with some modern writers) that the passage in Deuteronomy was constructed from that in Samuel, there are several difficulties--(1) Why is there no disapproval here of the plan, which Samuel so strongly disapproved? (2) How does the writer in Deuteronomy contrive to be so wholly unconscious either of the royal tribe, or of the royal family? Precisely the same unconsciousness of the locality of the place which Jehovah should choose in Palestine appears in every reference to it in this book. In Moses this is perfectly natural. But that any later writer should be so totally regardless of the claims of Judah, David, and Jerusalem, and say nothing either for or against them, is inconceivable. Samuel could hardly have written about the king without betraying disapproval of Israel's desire for him. No later writer could have avoided some allusion to the choice of David's family, and the promises to David's son.<p>(15) <span class= "bld">Whom the Lord thy God shall choose . . . from among thy brethren.</span>--This precept seems almost needless from the standpoint of later history. As years passed by, the Israelites were less and less tempted to accept the supremacy of foreign princes.<span class= "note">[4]</span> But Moses can never have forgotten that for two-thirds of his own lifetime the Israelites had been subject to the kings of Egypt; and that even since the exodus they had proposed to make a captain to return thither; <span class= "ital">whom </span>we know not, but very possibly an Egyptian. The chief thing dreaded by Moses was a return to Egypt, as appears by the next verse.<p><span class= "note">[4] But see note on </span><a href="/deuteronomy/31-11.htm" title="When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD your God in the place which he shall choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.">Deuteronomy 31:11</a><span class= "note"> for an incident that illustrates the feeling.</span><p>(16,17) <span class= "bld">He shall not multiply horses . . . wives . . . neither shall he greatly multiply . . . silver and gold.</span>--It is not a little remarkable that these are the very things which Solomon did multiply; and that under him the monarchy attained its greatest glory. But the prophecy avenged itself by its literal fulfilment: "When Solomon was old . . . <span class= "ital">his wives turned away his heart" </span>(<a href="/1_kings/11-4.htm" title="For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.">1Kings 11:4</a>). Yet it is easier to read the words as prophecy than as later history. What Israelite could have written this sentence after the time of Solomon without some passing allusion to the glories of his reign? Compare the recorded allusion in <a href="/nehemiah/13-26.htm" title="Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.">Nehemiah 13:26</a> : "Did not Solomon, king of Israel, sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel; nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-20.</span> - Israel, being under a theocracy, did not <span class="accented">need</span> an earthly king; but neither was this thereby precluded, provided the king chosen by the people were one whom Jehovah would approve as his vicegerent. In case, then, of their coming to desire to have a king over them like the nations around them, Moses gives instructions here as to the choice of a king, and as to the duties and obligations resting upon those who might be elevated to that office. The form in which these are conveyed clearly indicates that, at the time this was uttered, the existence of a king in Israel was contemplated as only a distant possibility. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When thou art come unto the land</span>, etc. This phraseology, which is common to the laws which respect the affairs of the Hebrews after they should be settled in Canaan, implies that this law was given whilst they were yet outside the Promised Land. It is plain also, from the tenor of the whole statement in this verse, that the legislator in this case is providing for what he supposes may happen, is likely to happen, but which he by no means desires should happen. Moses foresaw that the people would wish to be as the nations around them - governed by a king - and he legislates accordingly, without approving of that wish. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you enter</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the land</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1431;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
