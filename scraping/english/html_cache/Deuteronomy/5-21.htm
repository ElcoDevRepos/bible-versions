In the ancient Near Eastern context, a wife was considered part of a man's household and property, but this commandment elevates the moral standard by focusing on the heart's intentions. The prohibition against coveting a neighbor's wife underscores the sanctity of marriage and the importance of fidelity. It aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>, where He expands on the concept of adultery to include lustful thoughts, emphasizing the need for purity in heart and mind.<p><b>You shall not covet your neighbor&#8217;s house or field,</b><br>In ancient Israel, land was a significant part of one's inheritance and identity, often passed down through generations. Coveting a neighbor's house or field could lead to actions that disrupt community harmony and violate God's distribution of land among the tribes of Israel. This commandment highlights the importance of contentment and trust in God's provision. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of stewardship, where individuals are called to manage their resources responsibly and respect others' possessions.<p><b>or his manservant or maidservant,</b><br>Servants were considered part of a household's assets in ancient times, and coveting them could lead to social and economic instability. This commandment calls for respect for the social order and the dignity of individuals, regardless of their status. It also points to the broader biblical principle of treating others with fairness and justice, as seen in passages like <a href="/colossians/4.htm">Colossians 4:1</a>, which instructs masters to treat their servants justly and fairly.<p><b>or his ox or donkey,</b><br>Oxen and donkeys were valuable assets in an agrarian society, essential for farming and transportation. Coveting these animals could lead to theft or other unethical actions. This commandment encourages individuals to appreciate what they have and to avoid the destructive nature of envy. It also connects to the biblical theme of God's provision, as seen in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>, where the Lord is described as a shepherd who provides for all needs.<p><b>or anything that belongs to your neighbor.</b><br>This phrase serves as a comprehensive summary, covering all aspects of a neighbor's possessions. It emphasizes the importance of respecting others' property and the dangers of unchecked desire. The commandment against coveting is unique among the Ten Commandments because it addresses internal attitudes rather than external actions. It calls believers to cultivate a heart of gratitude and contentment, aligning with Paul's teaching in <a href="/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11-13</a> about being content in all circumstances. This principle is foundational for maintaining healthy relationships and a just society.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who delivered God's commandments to the people.
