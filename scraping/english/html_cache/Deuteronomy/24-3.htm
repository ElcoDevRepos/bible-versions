This reflects the seriousness of marital commitment and the gravity of divorce. The cultural context of the time allowed for divorce, but it was not encouraged. The use of "hates" may also indicate a breach of the covenant, similar to how God describes His relationship with Israel when they turn away from Him (<a href="/malachi/2-16.htm">Malachi 2:16</a>).<p><b>writes her a certificate of divorce</b><br>The certificate of divorce was a legal document that formally ended the marriage, providing the woman with the freedom to remarry. This practice was a protection for the woman, ensuring her rights and status in society. The requirement for a written document highlights the importance of legal and formal processes in ancient Israelite society. Jesus references this practice in <a href="/matthew/19-7.htm">Matthew 19:7-8</a>, explaining that Moses permitted divorce due to the hardness of people's hearts, but it was not God's original intention for marriage.<p><b>hands it to her</b><br>The act of handing the certificate directly to the woman signifies the formal and personal nature of the divorce process. It underscores the woman's agency in receiving the document, which was crucial for her future security and ability to remarry. This action also reflects the legal customs of the time, where transactions and agreements were often made in person and required direct acknowledgment.<p><b>and sends her away from his house</b><br>This phrase indicates the finality of the divorce, as the woman is no longer part of the household. In ancient Israel, the household was the center of social and economic life, and being sent away meant a significant change in status and security. This reflects the patriarchal structure of society, where the husband had authority over the household. The sending away also parallels the spiritual theme of separation from God due to sin, as seen in the exile narratives.<p><b>or if he dies</b><br>The mention of the husband's death introduces another scenario where the woman is free to remarry. In the cultural and legal context of ancient Israel, a widow had specific rights and protections, such as the levirate marriage law (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-10</a>), which ensured her continued provision and the preservation of her deceased husband's lineage. This provision reflects God's care for the vulnerable and His desire for justice and mercy within the community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>Central to the verse, she is subject to the actions of her husbands, reflecting the societal norms of the time.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_first_husband.htm">The First Husband</a></b><br>He initially divorces the woman, setting the stage for the events described.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_second_husband.htm">The Second Husband</a></b><br>He either divorces the woman or dies, further impacting her status and future.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Deuteronomy, providing laws and guidelines for the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_society.htm">Israelite Society</a></b><br>The cultural and legal backdrop against which these laws were given, reflecting the norms and values of ancient Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_context.htm">Understanding the Context</a></b><br>Recognize the historical and cultural context of ancient Israel, where laws were given to maintain social order and protect individuals, especially women, in a patriarchal society.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_marriage.htm">The Sanctity of Marriage</a></b><br>Reflect on the biblical view of marriage as a covenant, intended to be a lifelong commitment, and the implications of divorce as a last resort.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_compassion_and_justice.htm">God's Compassion and Justice</a></b><br>Consider how these laws, while seemingly harsh, were designed to protect the vulnerable and ensure justice within the community.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_heart.htm">The Role of the Heart</a></b><br>Jesus' teachings in the New Testament emphasize the heart's condition over legalistic adherence, urging believers to pursue righteousness and love in relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/application_in_modern_context.htm">Application in Modern Context</a></b><br>Evaluate how these principles apply today, encouraging believers to uphold the sanctity of marriage while showing grace and understanding in complex situations.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_24_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 24:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deuteronomy_24_3_on_divorce_remarriage.htm">How does Deuteronomy 24:3 address the issue of divorce and remarriage?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Deut_24_3_on_God_s_view_of_marriage.htm">What does Deuteronomy 24:3 reveal about God's view on marital commitment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Deut_24_3_vs_Jesus_on_divorce_Matt_19.htm">How does Deuteronomy 24:3 connect with Jesus' teachings on divorce in Matthew 19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Deuteronomy_24_3_s_role_in_marriage_vows.htm">How can Deuteronomy 24:3 guide us in upholding marriage vows today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Deut_24_3_lessons_for_modern_marriages.htm">What lessons from Deuteronomy 24:3 apply to modern Christian relationships and marriages?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Deuteronomy_24_3_on_biblical_divorce.htm">How does Deuteronomy 24:3 address the issue of divorce in biblical times?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_shaped_Deut_24_3_s_legal_context.htm">What cultural context influenced the laws in Deuteronomy 24:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Deut_24_3_on_God_s_view_of_marriage_divorce.htm">How does Deuteronomy 24:3 reflect God's view on marriage and divorce?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_24.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_does_deut._24_favor_male_authority.htm">Why does Deuteronomy 24 include provisions that appear to privilege male authority over women, with no reciprocal rights for wives?

Now this second husband rejects her as well.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Hate&#8221; here speaks of active rejection, echoing the earlier phrase in v. 1 where the first husband found &#8220;some indecency&#8221; in her.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently treats such hard-heartedness toward one&#8217;s spouse as sin (<a href="/malachi/2-16.htm">Malachi 2:16</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8</a>).<p>&#8226; By recording the possibility of a second rejection, Moses highlights how divorce can spiral, wounding everyone involved.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>writes her a certificate of divorce</b><p>&#8220;[He] writes her a certificate of divorce.&#8221; The written document served several purposes:<p>&#8226; It confirmed the marriage was legally dissolved, protecting the woman from charges of adultery (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-7.htm">Matthew 19:7</a>).<p>&#8226; It showed divorce was not to be impulsive. A formal writing implied deliberation and accountability (<a href="/jeremiah/3-8.htm">Jeremiah 3:8</a>).<p>&#8226; It underscored the seriousness of ending what God designed to be lifelong (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-6.htm">Matthew 19:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>hands it to her</b><p>The husband &#8220;hands it to her,&#8221; physically transferring the certificate.<p>&#8226; Until she received that paper, she was still his wife; the act finalized the break (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>).<p>&#8226; In practical terms, the document allowed her to prove her single status if she ever remarried or defended herself in court (compare <a href="/john/4-18.htm">John 4:18</a> where marital history is publicly known).<p>&#8226; The step protected her dignity by giving her clear legal standing, even amid a tragic event.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>sends her away from his house</b><p>Next, he &#8220;sends her away from his house.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Marriage joined two lives in one household; divorce dissolves that unity (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> vs. <a href="/deuteronomy/24-2.htm">Deuteronomy 24:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The law prevents a husband from putting away his wife yet still controlling her. Once she is sent away, his authority ends (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-14.htm">Deuteronomy 21:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Repetition of this clause in v. 3 underlines that the divorce is complete and irreversible from his side.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or if he dies</b><p>Finally, Moses adds, &#8220;or if he dies.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Whether divorced or widowed, the woman is once again without a husband (<a href="/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/7-39.htm">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>).<p>&#8226; Including death clarifies that the coming restriction (v. 4, barring remarriage to the first husband) applies in both scenarios.<p>&#8226; God is guarding marriage from becoming a casual, transactional arrangement&#8212;divorce, remarriage, and return&#8212;by closing the door to re-entering the first union (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-4.htm">Deuteronomy 24:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/24-3.htm">Deuteronomy 24:3</a> traces the formal, legal steps by which a second husband might end&#8212;or abruptly be removed from&#8212;his marriage to the woman already divorced once. Each clause reinforces that:<p>&#8226; Divorce is a grievous reality stemming from human hard-heartedness, never God&#8217;s design.<p>&#8226; Written documentation and formal dismissal protected the woman, limiting a man&#8217;s power to abandon her informally.<p>&#8226; By detailing both divorce and death scenarios, the law establishes the permanence of each marital decision, warning all Israel that marriage vows carry lifelong weight.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/24-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and the second</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1493;&#1465;&#1503;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#333;&#183;wn)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
