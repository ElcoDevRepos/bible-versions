In the context of ancient Israel, this command was part of the broader Mosaic Law, which aimed to create a just and compassionate society. The "open hand" symbolizes readiness and eagerness to assist, contrasting with a closed fist, which would represent selfishness or reluctance. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to give generously (<a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a>). The open hand can also be seen as a type of Christ, who freely gives grace and salvation to all who come to Him.<p><b>and freely loan him</b><br>The concept of lending freely without expecting repayment was radical in the ancient Near Eastern context, where loans often came with high interest rates and could lead to debt slavery. This command reflects God's desire for His people to act with mercy and compassion, ensuring that the poor are not further oppressed. The idea of lending freely is also seen in the teachings of Jesus, who instructed His followers to lend without expecting anything in return (<a href="/luke/6-34.htm">Luke 6:34-35</a>). This reflects the character of God, who gives generously and without partiality.<p><b>whatever he needs</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of meeting the specific needs of the individual, rather than offering a generic or insufficient response. It highlights the personal responsibility to assess and address the actual requirements of those in need. This aligns with the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor as oneself (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>; <a href="/matthew/22-39.htm">Matthew 22:39</a>). The focus on "needs" rather than "wants" ensures that the assistance provided is both practical and beneficial, reflecting God's provision for His people, as seen in the manna provided in the wilderness (Exodus 16).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites before they enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving the law as they prepare to settle in Canaan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The Promised Land where the Israelites are headed, a place where they are to live out God's commandments.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_needy.htm">The Needy</a></b><br>Individuals within the Israelite community who require assistance, representing those in need of support and generosity.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sabbatical_year.htm">The Sabbatical Year</a></b><br>The context of <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/15.htm">Deuteronomy 15</a>, where debts are to be forgiven every seven years, emphasizing God's provision and care for the community.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/generosity_as_a_command.htm">Generosity as a Command</a></b><br>God commands His people to be generous, reflecting His own nature.
