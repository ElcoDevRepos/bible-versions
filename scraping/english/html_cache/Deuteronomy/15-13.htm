This practice is rooted in the concept of the Sabbatical year, a time of rest and liberation, reflecting God's deliverance of Israel from Egypt. The release symbolizes freedom and a new beginning, echoing the broader biblical theme of redemption and liberation found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2</a> and <a href="/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39-41</a>.<p><b>do not send him away empty-handed</b><br>This instruction emphasizes the importance of generosity and provision for those who have served.
