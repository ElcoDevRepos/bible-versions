The mention of "ships" suggests a forced and humiliating return, contrasting with the miraculous crossing of the Red Sea. Historically, Egypt was a symbol of bondage and oppression for the Israelites. The use of ships implies a long and arduous journey, possibly indicating the severity of the punishment for disobedience. This imagery also foreshadows future exiles and captivities, such as the Babylonian exile, where the Israelites faced similar fates.<p><b>by a route that I said you should never see again</b><br>This refers to God's promise in <a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13</a> that the Israelites would never again see the Egyptians they were fleeing. The return to Egypt symbolizes a complete undoing of God's deliverance due to Israel's disobedience. It highlights the seriousness of breaking the covenant with God, as it leads to a loss of the blessings and protection once assured. This phrase underscores the consequences of turning away from God's commands and the resulting loss of divine favor.<p><b>There you will sell yourselves to your enemies as male and female slaves</b><br>This part of the verse indicates a desperate situation where the Israelites, once freed from slavery, would find themselves in such dire straits that they would attempt to sell themselves into servitude. This reflects the ultimate degradation and loss of identity as God's chosen people. The act of selling oneself into slavery was a last resort for survival, showing the depth of the curse for disobedience. It also serves as a stark warning of the consequences of forsaking God's laws.<p><b>but no one will buy you.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the complete rejection and hopelessness that would befall the Israelites. Even in their desperation, they would find no relief or redemption. It signifies utter abandonment and the futility of seeking refuge outside of God's provision. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual desolation, where turning away from God leads to a state of being unwanted and unredeemed. It serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of faithfulness to God's covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is speaking through Moses to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A place of former bondage for the Israelites, symbolizing a return to slavery and oppression.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being warned of the consequences of disobedience.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/ships.htm">Ships</a></b><br>A mode of transportation indicating a forced and humiliating return to slavery.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies.htm">Enemies</a></b><br>Those who would oppress and enslave the Israelites, representing the consequences of turning away from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Disobedience to God's commands leads to severe consequences, including a return to bondage and oppression.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_egypt.htm">Symbolism of Egypt</a></b><br>Egypt represents a place of spiritual and physical bondage.

But the same word is used in the following passage by Nehemiah, "We after our ability have <span class= "ital">redeemed </span>our brethren the Jews, which were sold to the heathen" (<a href="/nehemiah/5-8.htm" title="And I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our brothers the Jews, which were sold to the heathen; and will you even sell your brothers? or shall they be sold to us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.">Nehemiah 5:8</a>). Probably the meaning in Deuteronomy is similar: "Ye shall be sold as slaves to your enemies, and there will <span class= "ital">be no one to redeem you."</span><p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 68.</span> - Worst of all, they should be again reduced to bondage, carried back to Egypt, put up for sale as slaves, and be so utterly despicable that no one would purchase them. <span class="cmt_word">Bring thee into Egypt again.</span> "If the Exodus was the birth of the nation of God as such, the return would be its death" (Schultz; cf. <a href="/hosea/8-13.htm">Hosea 8:13</a>; <a href="/hosea/9-3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With ships.</span> They came out of Egypt by land, as free men; they should be carried back imprisoned and cooped up in slave-ships. <span class="cmt_word">By the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no mere again.</span> This does not refer to their being carried to Egypt in ships as different from the way by which they had come out from it, but simply to the fact that they should be carried back thither, contrary to what was expected when they so triumphantly came forth from it. <span class="cmt_word">There ye shall be sold</span>; literally, <span class="accented">shall sell yourselves</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. give yourselves up to be sold as slaves. Egypt may be here, as Hengstenberg suggests, "the type of future oppressors;" but there seems no reason why the passage should not be taken literally. It is a fact that, after the capture of Jerusalem by Titus, the Jews were in large numbers carried into Egypt, and there subjected to most ignominious bondage; and in the time of Hadrian, multitudes of Jews were sold into slavery (Josephus, 'De Bell. Jud.,' 6:09, 2; cf. Philo, 'Flacc.' and 'Leg. ad Caium.'). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/28-68.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;
