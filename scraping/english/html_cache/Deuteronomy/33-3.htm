The Hebrew word for "love" here conveys a deep, affectionate bond. This love is rooted in the promises made to the patriarchs, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It reflects the unconditional nature of God's commitment to His people, despite their frequent disobedience. This love is also a precursor to the New Testament revelation of God's love for all humanity through Jesus Christ (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>).<p><b>all the holy ones are in Your hand,</b><br>The "holy ones" likely refer to the Israelites, set apart by God as His chosen nation. Being "in Your hand" signifies protection and care, akin to a shepherd safeguarding his flock. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where God's hand represents His power and provision (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). It also foreshadows the security believers find in Christ, who holds His followers securely (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28-29</a>).<p><b>and they sit down at Your feet;</b><br>Sitting at someone's feet is a posture of learning and submission, often associated with discipleship. In ancient Near Eastern culture, this was a common way for students to learn from their teachers. This phrase suggests that the Israelites are in a position to receive instruction and wisdom from God. It parallels the New Testament scene of Mary sitting at Jesus' feet, choosing the "better part" of learning from Him (<a href="/luke/10-39.htm">Luke 10:39-42</a>).<p><b>each receives Your words&#8212;</b><br>Receiving God's words implies acceptance and obedience to His commandments. In the context of Deuteronomy, this is particularly significant as Moses is reiterating the Law to the Israelites before they enter the Promised Land. The importance of God's word is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, highlighting its role in guiding, correcting, and sustaining His people (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus is identified as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), embodying the ultimate revelation of God's will and character.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering blessings to the tribes of Israel before his death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_israel.htm">The People of Israel</a></b><br>Referred to as "the people" whom God loves, representing the nation chosen by God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_ones.htm">The Holy Ones</a></b><br>Likely referring to the leaders or the people of Israel who are set apart for God's purposes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The central figure who loves, protects, and instructs His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>While not directly mentioned in this verse, it is the place where God gave the Law to Moses, symbolizing God's communication with His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_love_for_his_people.htm">God's Love for His People</a></b><br>God&#8217;s love is foundational and unchanging.

This is generally understood of the tribes of Israel; but some would understand it of nations in general, on the ground that such is the proper meaning of the word, as in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a> and other places. A reference to nations at large, however, would seem incongruous here; and the use of the word in relation to Israel in such passages as <a href="/genesis/28-3.htm">Genesis 28:3</a>; <a href="/judges/5-14.htm">Judges 5:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/3-13.htm">Isaiah 3:13</a>; Hoe. 10:14; <a href="/zechariah/11-10.htm">Zechariah 11:10</a>, justifies the taking it so here. <span class="cmt_word">All his saints are in thy hand.</span> The people of Israel are here called God's saints, or holy ones, because they were chosen by and consecrated to him. It is not probable, as some suggest, that the angels are here intended.

Kimchi explains it as "<span class="accented">they</span> <span class="accented">united</span> or <span class="accented">assembled together to follow thy steps</span>;" Knobel makes it "they <span class="accented">wandered at thy feet</span>," and understands it of Israel's following the lead of Jehovah in the wilderness, when the ark of the covenant preceded them in their march; Gesenius and Furst, "they <span class="accented">lie down at thy feet</span>." This last is accepted by Keil, and seems to have most in its favor. <span class="cmt_word">Every one shall receive of thy words.</span> Some render here, <span class="accented">they rise up at thy words</span>; but though the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;</span> is sometimes used intransitively, it is properly an active verb, and there seems no reason why it should not be so regarded here: <span class="accented">every one receives</span> [the singular, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5d0;</span>, used distributively] <span class="accented">thy words</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/33-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Surely</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1434;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ap&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_637.htm">Strong's 637: </a> </span><span class="str2">Meaning accession, yea, adversatively though</span><br /><br /><span class="word">You love</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1465;&#1489;&#1461;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#333;&#183;&#7687;&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2245.htm">Strong's 2245: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hide, to cherish</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the people;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;am&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><br /><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the holy ones [are]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1456;&#1491;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1430;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;&#353;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural construct &#124;
