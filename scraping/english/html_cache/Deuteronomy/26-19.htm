The idea of being "set high" indicates a position of distinction and favor. In the ancient Near Eastern context, nations often sought to elevate their status through military conquest or alliances, but Israel's elevation is attributed to divine favor. This promise is reminiscent of God's covenant with Abraham, where He promised to make Abraham's descendants a great nation (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). The elevation in "praise and name and honor" suggests a reputation that would be recognized by other nations, as seen in the reign of Solomon when Israel's wisdom and prosperity were renowned (<a href="/1_kings/10.htm">1 Kings 10:1-9</a>). This also foreshadows the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who is exalted above all (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>).<p><b>above all the nations He has made</b><br>This phrase underscores God's sovereignty over all creation, including every nation. It highlights the special relationship between God and Israel, chosen not because of their size or power, but because of His love and promises (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7-8</a>). The distinction "above all the nations" implies a calling to be a light to the Gentiles, a theme that runs throughout the Old Testament and is fulfilled in the New Testament with the inclusion of Gentiles into the people of God (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>, <a href="/romans/11-11.htm">Romans 11:11-12</a>). This also points to the eschatological hope where all nations will recognize the Lordship of Christ (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9-10</a>).<p><b>and that you will be a holy people to the LORD your God</b><br>Holiness in this context refers to being set apart for God's purposes. Israel's call to be a "holy people" involves both privilege and responsibility, requiring adherence to God's laws and commands (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). This holiness is not just ritualistic but encompasses moral and ethical living, reflecting God's character to the world. The concept of holiness is central to the identity of God's people and is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to be holy as God is holy (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15-16</a>). This anticipates the work of Christ, who sanctifies His people through His sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>).<p><b>as He has promised</b><br>This phrase reaffirms the faithfulness of God to His covenant promises. Throughout the Pentateuch, God repeatedly assures Israel of His commitment to the promises made to their forefathers (<a href="/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>, <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>). The fulfillment of these promises is contingent upon Israel's obedience, yet God's faithfulness remains steadfast despite their failures. This assurance of promise is a recurring theme in Scripture, culminating in the New Covenant through Jesus Christ, where God's promises are fully realized (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>). The reliability of God's word is a cornerstone of faith, providing hope and assurance to believers throughout history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and promises to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving the covenant and laws from Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who promises to elevate His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>The surrounding peoples and nations that Israel is set to be distinguished from.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_promise_of_elevation.htm">God's Promise of Elevation</a></b><br>God promises to elevate His people above all nations, which is a call to live in a way that reflects His glory and holiness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holiness_as_a_distinctive_mark.htm">Holiness as a Distinctive Mark</a></b><br>Being "holy to the LORD" means being set apart for His purposes.
