Historically, Israel is at the brink of entering the Promised Land, and Moses is reiterating God's expectations. The phrase "O Israel" serves as a call to attention, highlighting the importance of the message that follows.<p><b>what does the LORD your God ask of you</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the simplicity and clarity of God's requirements. It reflects the covenantal relationship where God, as the sovereign, sets forth stipulations for His people. This echoes <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, where God outlines what He requires: to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with Him.<p><b>but to fear the LORD your God</b><br>The fear of the LORD is a foundational theme in Scripture, signifying reverence, awe, and respect. It is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>) and is essential for a proper relationship with God. This fear is not terror but a recognition of God's holiness and authority.<p><b>by walking in all His ways,</b><br>Walking in God's ways implies living a life in accordance with His commandments and statutes. It suggests a continuous, active lifestyle of obedience and faithfulness. This concept is echoed in <a href="/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119:1</a>, which speaks of the blessedness of those who walk in the law of the LORD.<p><b>to love Him,</b><br>Love for God is central to the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>), which Jesus cites as the greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37</a>). This love is not merely emotional but involves commitment and devotion, reflecting God's covenantal love for His people.<p><b>to serve the LORD your God</b><br>Service to God involves worship, obedience, and dedication. It is a response to His grace and mercy, as seen in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, where believers are urged to offer their bodies as living sacrifices. This service is holistic, encompassing all aspects of life.<p><b>with all your heart and with all your soul,</b><br>This phrase emphasizes total devotion and commitment. The heart and soul represent the entirety of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. It calls for wholehearted dedication, as seen in the greatest commandment (<a href="/mark/12-30.htm">Mark 12:30</a>), and reflects the depth of relationship God desires with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of Israel who delivered God's laws and commandments to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, consisting of the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to whom the laws and commandments were given.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who delivered them from Egypt and gave them the law through Moses.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_the_lord.htm">Fear of the LORD</a></b><br>Understanding the biblical concept of "fear" as reverence and awe towards God, recognizing His holiness and authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/walking_in_his_ways.htm">Walking in His Ways</a></b><br>Emphasizing the importance of living a life that reflects God's character and commandments, not just in actions but in attitudes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/wholehearted_love_and_service.htm">Wholehearted Love and Service</a></b><br>Encouraging believers to love and serve God with complete devotion, involving both heart and soul, which implies sincerity and depth in our relationship with Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_relationship.htm">Covenant Relationship</a></b><br>Recognizing that these commands are part of a covenant relationship with God, where He is our God, and we are His people, called to live distinctively.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/holistic_worship.htm">Holistic Worship</a></b><br>Understanding that worship is not confined to rituals but is expressed through our daily lives as we align our actions and hearts with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_10_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 10:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_fear_the_LORD_daily_today_2.htm">How can we "fear the LORD" in our daily lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_is_it_to_live_by_His_ways.htm">What does it mean to "walk in all His ways" practically?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Deut_10_12_to_Jesus_teachings.htm">How does Deuteronomy 10:12 connect with Jesus' teachings in the New Testament?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_fully_serve_the_LORD_your_God.htm">In what ways can we "serve the LORD your God" wholeheartedly?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_loving_God_transform_relationships.htm">How can loving God with "all your heart" transform our relationships with others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Deuteronomy_10_12_God_s_expectations.htm">What does Deuteronomy 10:12 reveal about God's expectations for His followers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Deuteronomy_10_12_God-people_bond.htm">How does Deuteronomy 10:12 define the relationship between God and His people?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_emphasize_fearing_God_in_Deut_10_12.htm">Why does Deuteronomy 10:12 emphasize fearing the LORD and walking in His ways?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_10.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'piety'_mean.htm">What does "piety" mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'walk_in_god's_ways'_mean.htm">What does "Walk in God's Ways" mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_witchcraft.htm">How does faith lead to prosperity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_does_fearing_god_entail.htm">What does fearing God entail?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Deuteronomy 10:12 Mean</div><b>And now, O Israel</b><p>Moses has just recounted God&#8217;s mercy after the golden-calf rebellion (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-1.htm">Deuteronomy 10:1-11</a>). &#8220;And now&#8221;

But it is written elsewhere, "I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me." (Comp. also <a href="/micah/6-8.htm" title="He has showed you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-23.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone.">Matthew 23:23</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - God had showed great favor to Israel; what return did he require? Only what, without any prescription, they were bound to render - fear, love, and obedience (comp. <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To fear the Lord thy God</span> (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-2.htm">Deuteronomy 6:2, 13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To walk in all his ways</span>; to receive his truth, accept his law, and follow the course of conduct which he prescribes (cf. <a href="/genesis/18-19.htm">Genesis 18:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/25-4.htm">Psalm 25:4, 5</a>; <a href="/psalms/67-2.htm">Psalm 67:2</a>; <a href="/acts/18-25.htm">Acts 18:25, 26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To love him</span> (cf. <a href="/exodus/20-6.htm">Exodus 20:6</a>). "Fear <span class="accented">with</span> love! Love without fear relaxes; fear without love enslaves, and leads to despair" (J. Gerhard). There is a fear with which love cannot coexist - a fear which hath torment, and which love casts out as its antagonist (<a href="/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>); but the fear of God which he requires is that pious reverence which not only can coexist with love to him, but is not where love is not. <span class="cmt_word">And to serve the</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul.</span> Love prompts to service. Wherever love fills the heart, it seeks expression in acts of service to its object; and where no such expression comes forth, the evidence is wanting of the existence of the emotion in the bosom (cf. <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15, 23</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-13.htm">Galatians 5:13</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-18.htm">1 John 3:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For thy good</span> (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/5-29.htm">Deuteronomy 5:29</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-24.htm">Deuteronomy 6:24</a>). "In serving the Lord the glory redoundeth unto him, the benefit to ourselves; for them that honor him he will honor (<a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>), and 'godliness hath the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come' (<a href="/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>)" (Ainsworth). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;And now,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
