The context is a command to completely destroy the pagan nations inhabiting Canaan. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, emphasizing holiness and separation from idolatry. The command underscores the importance of obedience to God&#8217;s laws and the rejection of pagan practices.<p><b>tear down their altars,</b><br>Altars in ancient Canaan were used for sacrifices to various deities. By tearing them down, the Israelites were to eliminate the means of worship for these false gods. This act symbolizes the rejection of idolatry and the exclusive worship of Yahweh. It also serves as a physical demonstration of the spiritual cleansing required to maintain purity in worship.<p><b>smash their sacred pillars,</b><br>Sacred pillars, or standing stones, were often erected as symbols of the presence or power of a deity. Smashing these pillars was a direct attack on the religious symbols of the Canaanites, demonstrating the superiority of the God of Israel. This action is a reminder of the first commandment, which prohibits the worship of other gods.<p><b>cut down their Asherah poles,</b><br>Asherah poles were wooden symbols associated with the goddess Asherah, a prominent figure in Canaanite religion. Cutting them down was a way to dismantle the infrastructure of pagan worship. This act signifies the removal of temptations that could lead the Israelites away from their covenant with God. It also prefigures the New Testament call to remove anything that hinders one's relationship with Christ.<p><b>and burn their idols in the fire.</b><br>Burning idols was a method of complete destruction, ensuring that no remnant of the false gods remained. This act of burning signifies purification and the total eradication of idolatry from the land. It reflects the biblical theme of God as a consuming fire, purifying His people and eliminating sin. This also foreshadows the ultimate victory over sin and idolatry through Jesus Christ, who purifies believers and calls them to worship in spirit and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being instructed by Moses on how to deal with the pagan nations in the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanites.htm">Canaanites</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the land that God promised to the Israelites, known for their idolatrous practices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, delivering God's commandments and instructions to the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/asherah_poles.htm">Asherah Poles</a></b><br>Wooden symbols associated with the worship of the Canaanite goddess Asherah, representing idolatry and false worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_purity_in_worship.htm">The Importance of Purity in Worship</a></b><br>God commands the Israelites to destroy all forms of idolatry to maintain purity in their worship.

The command is not a suggestion but a settled directive for God&#8217;s covenant people. As <a href="/exodus/34-12.htm">Exodus 34:12-15</a> reminds, any alliance with pagan worship risks spiritual infidelity. The verse&#8217;s four imperatives spell out a complete, uncompromising purge of false religion&#8212;nothing less will protect Israel&#8217;s worship of the one true God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Tear down their altars</b><p>&#8226; Altars were the centerpieces of sacrificing to Baal, Molech, and other local gods. By dismantling them, Israel would remove the very platforms that sustained those cults (<a href="/judges/6-25.htm">Judges 6:25-26</a>; <a href="/1_kings/18-30.htm">1 Kings 18:30-32</a>).<p>&#8226; In our lives, altars show up whenever something other than the Lord receives our highest devotion&#8212;careers, relationships, possessions. Like Gideon, we are called to identify and &#8220;tear down&#8221; whatever vies for God&#8217;s rightful place.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Smash their sacred pillars</b><p>&#8226; Stone pillars (sometimes called &#8220;standing stones&#8221;) marked sacred sites and commemorated the perceived power of foreign deities (<a href="/exodus/23-24.htm">Exodus 23:24</a>; <a href="/2_kings/10-26.htm">2 Kings 10:26-27</a>). Smashing them signaled that those gods were powerless before the Lord.<p>&#8226; Modern equivalents might be symbols, media, or ideologies that subtly normalize sin. God still calls His people to break the influence of anything that legitimizes idolatry.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Cut down their Asherah poles</b><p>&#8226; Asherah poles honored the fertility goddess Asherah and often stood beside Canaanite altars (<a href="/deuteronomy/16-21.htm">Deuteronomy 16:21</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4-6</a>). Cutting them down uprooted immorality at its source.<p>&#8226; Moral compromise thrives where God&#8217;s standards are lowered. Removing &#8220;Asherah poles&#8221; today means confronting entertainment, teaching, or relationships that glamorize impurity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Burn their idols in the fire</b><p>&#8226; Final disposal prevented Israel from reusing pagan objects or profiting from them (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>; 12:3). Complete destruction proved wholehearted loyalty.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/19-19.htm">Acts 19:19</a> models the same spirit when new believers burned occult scrolls rather than reselling them. When repentance is genuine, we don&#8217;t market our old sins&#8212;we incinerate them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/7-5.htm">Deuteronomy 7:5</a> calls for decisive, total rejection of anything that competes with God. Altars, pillars, poles, and idols each represent a different facet of false worship, and the Lord leaves no room for negotiation: dismantle, destroy, remove, and burn. The same uncompromising obedience guards believers today, ensuring that worship remains pure and undivided.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Ye shall destroy their altars. . . .--</span>This course, if adopted in a conquered territory, would be certain to bring matters to a crisis.
