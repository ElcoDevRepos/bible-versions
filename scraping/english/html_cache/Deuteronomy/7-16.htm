The destruction of these peoples was not an act of unwarranted aggression but a divine judgment against nations that had reached the fullness of their iniquity (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>). The Canaanites were known for practices such as child sacrifice and idolatry, which were abominations to God. This command also served to protect Israel from being led astray by the pagan practices of these nations. Theologically, this reflects God's holiness and justice, as well as His desire for His people to remain pure and devoted to Him alone.<p><b>Do not look on them with pity.</b><br>This phrase underscores the seriousness of the command. Pity could lead to disobedience, which would result in Israel adopting the detestable practices of the Canaanites. The Israelites were to be instruments of God's judgment, and any deviation from this command could compromise their mission and relationship with God. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the necessity of obedience to God's commands, as seen in the story of Saul's incomplete obedience in <a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>.<p><b>Do not worship their gods,</b><br>The prohibition against worshiping the gods of the conquered peoples is a recurring theme in the Old Testament. The Israelites were to worship Yahweh alone, as stated in the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). The worship of other gods would lead to spiritual adultery and a breach of the covenant relationship with God. This warning is echoed throughout the history of Israel, as seen in the repeated cycles of idolatry and repentance in the Book of Judges.<p><b>for that will be a snare to you.</b><br>The term "snare" indicates a trap or a source of entanglement. Idolatry would ensnare the Israelites, leading them away from God and into spiritual bondage. This warning is prophetic, as Israel's history shows that they often fell into the trap of idolatry, leading to their eventual exile. The New Testament also warns believers to avoid being ensnared by the world (<a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>), emphasizing the need for vigilance in maintaining spiritual purity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being instructed by Moses in this passage as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who commands the Israelites to destroy the nations in the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_canaanite_nations.htm">The Canaanite Nations</a></b><br>The peoples inhabiting the Promised Land, whom God commands the Israelites to destroy to prevent idolatry.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, delivering God's commandments to the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites are called to complete obedience, which includes difficult tasks.
