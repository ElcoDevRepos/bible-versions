It allows for the consumption of meat outside of the sacrificial context, reflecting a practical approach to daily life in the Promised Land. The "gates" refer to the cities or towns where the Israelites lived, suggesting that this permission was for personal consumption rather than religious sacrifice. This provision acknowledges the logistical challenges of bringing every animal to the central sanctuary and highlights God's blessing in providing for His people's needs.<p><b>according to the blessing the LORD your God has given you</b><br>This phrase emphasizes that the ability to eat meat is a result of God's blessing. It reflects the abundance and provision that God promised to the Israelites in the land flowing with milk and honey (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). The blessing is not just material but also spiritual, as it is a reminder of God's covenant faithfulness. This provision is a foretaste of the ultimate blessing found in Christ, who provides spiritual sustenance and life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>Both the ceremonially clean and unclean may eat it</b><br>This part of the verse highlights a distinction between the consumption of meat for daily sustenance and the requirements for sacrificial offerings. While sacrificial meat had to be consumed by those who were ceremonially clean, this provision allows for broader participation, reflecting God's grace and inclusivity. It underscores the difference between ritual purity required for worship and the practical needs of daily life. This inclusivity foreshadows the New Testament teaching that in Christ, the barriers between clean and unclean are broken down (<a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>).<p><b>as they would a gazelle or deer</b><br>Gazelles and deer were not typically used in sacrificial offerings, as they were not domesticated animals like sheep or cattle. This comparison indicates that the meat being discussed is for ordinary consumption, similar to hunting game. It reflects the everyday life of the Israelites and their reliance on both domesticated and wild animals for food. This phrase also points to the freedom and abundance in the land, where God's people could enjoy His creation. The mention of these animals highlights the distinction between sacred and secular, a theme that is fulfilled in Christ, who sanctifies all aspects of life (<a href="/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving instructions on how to live in the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, where the Israelites are to settle and live according to God's laws.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gates.htm">Gates</a></b><br>Refers to the cities or towns where the Israelites reside, indicating local communities.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gazelle_and_deer.htm">Gazelle and Deer</a></b><br>Examples of clean animals that could be eaten, illustrating the freedom to consume meat outside of sacrificial contexts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/freedom_in_provision.htm">Freedom in Provision</a></b><br>God provides for His people and allows them freedom in enjoying His blessings.

The word "kill," though often used sacrificially, cannot be limited to sacrifice in that place, although the animals mentioned are all sacrificial animals. It would seem that the practice of sacrificing those animals elsewhere, very possibly for the sake of the feast which followed, had become so common that it was necessary to forbid the killing of them anywhere but at the door of the tabernacle. But the continuance of this precept in Canaan would stop the eating of flesh altogether.
