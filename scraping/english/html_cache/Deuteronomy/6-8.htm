In ancient Israel, the hand symbolized action and work. By tying the commandments on their hands, the Israelites were reminded to let God's laws guide their actions. This practice is reflected in the Jewish tradition of wearing tefillin, small leather boxes containing scripture passages, during prayer. The concept of having God's word influence one's actions is echoed in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, which encourages believers to be doers of the word, not just hearers.<p><b>and bind them on your foreheads</b><br>Binding the commandments on the forehead signifies keeping God's laws in one's thoughts and decisions. The forehead represents the mind and intellect, suggesting that God's word should guide one's thoughts and intentions. This practice is also part of the Jewish tradition of wearing tefillin, where one box is placed on the forehead. The idea of having God's word in one's mind is paralleled in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, which speaks of the renewal of the mind to discern God's will.

The purport of this is that they were constantly and everywhere to have these commandments of the Lord in view and in mind, so as to undeviatingly observe them. It seems, however, to have been a custom widely prevalent among the ancient Eastern peoples to carry about their persons slips of parchment or some other material, on which were written sentences of moral or religious import; and such sentences they were also wont to inscribe on conspicuous places of their dwellings; usages still to be found among the Moslems (see Wilkinson, 'Ancient Egyptians,' 3:364; Lane, 'Modern Egypt,' 1:358; Russell, 'Nat. Hist. of Aleppo;' Thomson, 'Land and the Book,' 1:216), and the latter of which was not altogether unknown among Western nations (cf. Virgil, 'Georg.' lit. 26, etc.), of which traces may still be seen in Switzerland, Germany, and on old houses in both England and Scotland. This custom originated, probably, in a desire to have the sentiments inscribed always in mind; but for the most part these inscriptions came to be regarded as amulets or charms, the presence of which on the person or the house was a safeguard against evil influences, especially such as were supernatural. By the Jews this custom was followed; and they regarded it as authorized by the injunction of Moses in this passage. Taking his words literally, they had their t&ocirc;t&acirc;photh and their mezuzah, the former of which - the phylacteries of the New Testament - were strips of parchment, on which passages of the Law (<a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2-10, 11-17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-10, 13-22</a>) were written, and these, enclosed in a box, were bound on the forehead and left wrist, and worn at prayers by the worshippers; the latter a slip of parchment, on which were written certain passages of Scripture (vers. 4-9; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-21</a>), and which, enclosed in a reed or cylinder, was fixed on the right-hand doorpost of every room in the house (see arts.
