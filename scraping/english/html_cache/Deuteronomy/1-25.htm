The act of taking fruit symbolizes the tangible evidence of the land's fertility and abundance. The fruit, likely grapes, pomegranates, and figs, represents God's promise of a land flowing with milk and honey (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). This act of bringing back fruit serves as a physical testament to the land's potential and God's faithfulness to His covenant with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>).<p><b>carried it down to us</b><br>The phrase indicates the return journey of the spies from the hill country of Canaan back to the Israelite camp in the wilderness of Paran. This journey underscores the geographical transition from the promised land to the current location of the Israelites, emphasizing the proximity and accessibility of God's promise. The act of carrying the fruit down also highlights the responsibility of the spies to report accurately and faithfully to the people.<p><b>and brought us word</b><br>This phrase highlights the role of the spies as messengers and witnesses. Their report was crucial in shaping the Israelites' perception of the land and their willingness to trust in God's promise. The word they brought was not just a factual report but a test of faith for the Israelites. This moment parallels the importance of testimony and witness in the New Testament, where believers are called to share the good news of Christ (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><b>It is a good land</b><br>The declaration of the land as "good" aligns with God's original promise of a prosperous and bountiful land. This affirmation echoes the creation narrative where God saw that His creation was good (Genesis 1). The goodness of the land is a reflection of God's character and His intentions for His people. It also foreshadows the ultimate goodness found in the Kingdom of God, which believers are called to inherit through faith in Christ.<p><b>that the LORD our God is giving us</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine initiative and generosity in the gift of the land. The use of "LORD our God" underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, highlighting His sovereignty and faithfulness. The present tense "is giving" suggests the immediacy and certainty of God's promise, despite the Israelites' current circumstances. This promise is a type of the greater inheritance believers receive through Jesus Christ, who secures for them an eternal promised land (<a href="/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spies.htm">The Spies</a></b><br>A group of twelve men, one from each tribe of Israel, sent by Moses to scout the Promised Land (Canaan) and report back on its conditions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who sent the spies into Canaan to gather information about the land God promised to give them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land (Canaan)</a></b><br>The land promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, described as a land flowing with milk and honey.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, descendants of the twelve tribes of Israel, who were on the brink of entering the Promised Land after their exodus from Egypt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who promised to give the land of Canaan to the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>The report of the spies highlights the goodness of God's promises.
