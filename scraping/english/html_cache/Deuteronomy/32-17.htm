In the ancient Near East, sacrifices were a central part of worship, and offering sacrifices to other deities was seen as a betrayal of the covenant with God. The term "demons" here can be understood as malevolent spiritual beings that are opposed to God, reflecting the belief that idols were not just lifeless objects but had spiritual entities behind them. This aligns with <a href="/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>, where Paul warns that sacrifices to idols are sacrifices to demons.<p><b>to gods they had not known</b><br>The Israelites were introduced to foreign deities through interactions with surrounding nations. These gods were unfamiliar to them, contrasting with the God who had revealed Himself to them through the Law and the prophets. This phrase underscores the folly of abandoning a known, faithful God for unknown entities. It echoes the warning in <a href="/jeremiah/19-4.htm">Jeremiah 19:4-5</a>, where God condemns the people for worshiping gods they and their ancestors did not know.<p><b>to newly arrived gods</b><br>This suggests the introduction of new deities into Israelite worship, possibly through cultural assimilation or conquest. The "newly arrived" gods could refer to those of the Canaanites or other neighboring peoples. This reflects a recurring theme in the Old Testament, where Israel is warned against adopting the religious practices of other nations (<a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15-16</a>). The introduction of new gods often led to syncretism, diluting the worship of Yahweh.<p><b>which your fathers did not fear</b><br>The patriarchs and earlier generations of Israelites had a reverent fear of Yahweh, recognizing His power and authority. This phrase indicates a departure from the faithfulness of their ancestors, who did not acknowledge or fear these foreign gods. It serves as a reminder of the importance of maintaining the faith and traditions passed down through generations, as seen in <a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14-15</a>, where Joshua calls the people to serve the Lord in sincerity and truth, rejecting the gods their ancestors did not serve.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering a song to the Israelites as a warning and reminder of their covenant with God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being warned against idolatry and turning away from the true God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/demons.htm">Demons</a></b><br>Spiritual entities that the Israelites mistakenly worshipped, representing false gods and idols.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The one true God, Yahweh, whom the Israelites are called to worship and obey.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaan.htm">Canaan</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites are headed, filled with pagan nations and their gods, posing a temptation to Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_idolatry.htm">The Danger of Idolatry</a></b><br>Idolatry is not just the worship of physical idols but includes anything that takes the place of God in our lives.

Scripture treats demons as literal beings, not mere symbols (<a href="/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/106-37.htm">Psalm 106:37</a> echoes the charge: &#8220;They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons,&#8221; highlighting how idolatry damages the most vulnerable.<p>&#8226; Paul draws the same line in <a href="/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>, warning believers that pagan sacrifices are &#8220;offered to demons, not to God,&#8221; emphasizing that any worship not directed to the LORD inevitably allies the worshiper with spiritual darkness.<p>The lesson is plain: worship always reaches an unseen recipient. When we turn from God, we do not enter neutral ground; we step onto territory occupied by real spiritual adversaries.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>not to God</b><p>Idolatry is not a lesser form of worship; it is a complete rejection of the covenant LORD. By stating &#8220;not to God,&#8221; Moses contrasts the living God&#8212;Yahweh&#8212;with every counterfeit.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>: &#8220;I am the LORD; that is My name! I will not give My glory to another or My praise to idols.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3&#8211;5</a> sets the foundation&#8212;no other gods, no carved images&#8212;underscoring that exclusive devotion is a non-negotiable of the covenant.<p>Whenever hearts drift, God refuses to share His rightful place. The verse confronts us with a clear either/or: worship the LORD alone or stand in opposition to Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to gods they had not known</b><p>Israel&#8217;s fathers walked with the true God who revealed Himself through mighty acts&#8212;plagues in Egypt, the Red Sea crossing, Sinai&#8217;s thunder. These &#8220;new&#8221; gods had given no such revelation, performed no saving deeds, and made no covenant promises.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/10-2.htm">Jeremiah 10:2&#8211;5</a> contrasts the living God with man-made idols &#8220;that cannot speak.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-2.htm">Deuteronomy 11:2</a> reminds the people that their own eyes saw the LORD&#8217;s discipline and greatness, making flirtation with unknown gods particularly irrational.<p>The point: abandoning a God you know for one you don&#8217;t is spiritual amnesia and ingratitude rolled into one.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to newly arrived gods</b><p>The phrase pictures trendy deities&#8212;&#8220;the latest thing&#8221; on the religious scene. Canaanite culture offered a menu of options, and Israel was tempted to sample them.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/17-21.htm">Acts 17:21</a> shows the Athenians&#8217; similar obsession with &#8220;something new,&#8221; revealing a timeless human itch for novelty.<p>&#8226; <a href="/galatians/1-6.htm">Galatians 1:6</a> rebukes believers for &#8220;so quickly deserting&#8221; the gospel for a different message, proving the danger persists even in New Testament times.<p>Chasing novelty in worship ignores the proven faithfulness of the LORD. The same God who delivered yesterday stands ready to help today; no update is required.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which your fathers did not fear</b><p>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob never trembled before these pretend gods. Their reverent awe was fixed on the LORD alone. Forgetting that legacy severs the generational chain of faith.<p>&#8226; <a href="/joshua/24-14.htm">Joshua 24:14</a> urges Israel to &#8220;fear the LORD and serve Him with all faithfulness,&#8221; connecting holy fear with loyal service.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a> calls believers to &#8220;serve God acceptably with reverence and awe,&#8221; showing that proper fear of God remains essential for every generation.<p>When we lose holy fear of the true God, lesser fears rush in to fill the vacuum&#8212;status, success, cultural approval&#8212;yet none can anchor the soul like the fear of the LORD.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/32-17.htm">Deuteronomy 32:17</a> unmasks idolatry in five sharp strokes: Israel&#8217;s sacrifices were directed to real demons, not to the covenant God; they traded a known Deliverer for untested, freshly minted deities their ancestors never feared. The verse warns that all worship has a spiritual destination, novelty is no substitute for faithfulness, and generational memory matters. Our calling is clear: reject every rival, honor the LORD alone, and pass on a legacy of wholehearted, undivided worship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/32.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">They sacrificed unto devils, not to God.</span>--St. Paul repeats this expression in <a href="/1_corinthians/11-20.htm" title="When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.">1Corinthians 11:20</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Gods that came newly up.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">that came from close at hand. </span>Compare the description of the idol in <a href="/isaiah/44-15.htm" title="Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yes, he kindles it, and bakes bread; yes, he makes a god, and worships it; he makes it a graven image, and falls down thereto.">Isaiah 44:15</a>, easily made from the firewood; and see also <a href="//apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/13-13.htm" title="And taking the very refuse among those which served to no use, being a crooked piece of wood, and full of knots, hath carved it diligently, when he had nothing else to do, and formed it by the skill of his understanding, and fashioned it to the image of a man;">Wisdom Of Solomon 13:13</a>, "A carpenter taking a crooked piece of wood, and full of knots, hath carved it diligently, <span class= "ital">when he had nothing else to do</span>"--a comment on the passage in Isaiah 44<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/32.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Devils</span>; <span class="accented">shedim</span>, a word which occurs only here and <a href="/psalms/106-37.htm">Psalm 106:37</a>.
