Horses were a symbol of military might in ancient times, particularly in Egypt, known for its chariots and cavalry. The command reflects a broader biblical theme of trusting in God rather than in military resources (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>). It also serves as a reminder of the humility and dependence expected of Israel's leaders, contrasting with the practices of surrounding nations.<p><b>or send the people back to Egypt to acquire more horses</b><br>This phrase underscores the prohibition against returning to Egypt, a place of former bondage. Egypt represents a return to past sins and reliance on worldly powers. The Israelites were delivered from Egypt by God's mighty hand, and returning there would symbolize a rejection of God's deliverance and provision. This command is a call to trust in God's future promises rather than seeking security in past alliances or resources. It also foreshadows the New Testament theme of not returning to a life of sin after being set free by Christ (<a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>).<p><b>for the LORD has said, &#8216;You are never to go back that way again.&#8217;</b><br>This statement is a direct reminder of God's command and covenant with Israel. It emphasizes the finality of their deliverance from Egypt and the call to a new identity as God's chosen people. Theologically, it points to the concept of repentance and moving forward in faith, leaving behind the old life of slavery to sin. This command also prefigures the Christian journey, where believers are called to leave their past life and not return to it, living instead in the freedom and new life offered through Jesus Christ

slavery. The verse teaches that true security lies in trusting the Lord, not in military might or political maneuvering. Leaders and people alike must move forward in obedience, never returning to the old ways from which God has already delivered them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - Certain rules are prescribed for the king. It is forbidden to him to multiply horses, to multiply wives, and to amass large treasures of silver and gold, and he must have a copy of the Law written out for him from that kept by the priests, that he might have it by him, and read it all the days of his life. The multiplying of horses is prohibited, because this would bring Israel into intercourse and friendly relations with Egypt, and might tend to their going back to that country from which they had been so marvelously delivered; a prohibition which could only have been given at an early stage in the history of the people, for at a later period, after they had been well established in Canaan, such a prohibition for such a reason would have been simply ridiculous. The prohibition to multiply wives and to amass large treasures has respect to the usage common from the earliest period with Oriental monarchs to have vast harems and huge accumulations of the precious metals, as much for ostentation as for either luxury or use; and as there was no small danger of the King of Israel being seduced to follow this usage, and so to have his heart turned away from the Lord, it was fitting that such a prohibition should be prospectively enacted for his guidance. Both these prohibitions were neglected by Solomon, and probably by others of the Jewish kings; but this only indicates that the law was so ancient that it had come in their time to be regarded as obsolete. The rule that the king was to write him a copy of the Law for his own constant use does not necessarily imply that he was to write this with his own hand; he might cause it to be written by some qualified scribe for him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1463;&#1511;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(raq)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7535.htm">Strong's 7535: </a> </span><span class="str2">But, even, except, howbeit howsoever, at the least, nevertheless</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the king] must not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">acquire many</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(yar&#183;beh-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7235.htm">Strong's 7235: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be or become much, many or great</span><br /><br /><span class="word">horses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#363;&#183;s&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5483.htm">Strong's 5483: </a> </span><span class="str2">A swallow, swift (type of bird)</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for himself</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
