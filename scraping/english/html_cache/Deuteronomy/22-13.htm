It was not only a personal commitment but also a social contract with legal implications. The marriage process involved a betrothal period, which was as binding as marriage itself. This phrase sets the stage for a legal case concerning marital fidelity and the responsibilities of a husband.<p><b>has relations with her</b><br>This phrase indicates the consummation of the marriage, which was a significant event in establishing the marital bond. In biblical times, sexual relations were intended to be exclusive within marriage, symbolizing unity and commitment. The consummation was also a legal confirmation of the marriage covenant.<p><b>and comes to hate her</b><br>The term "hate" here suggests a strong aversion or rejection, which could arise from various reasons, including personal dissatisfaction or unfounded accusations. In the cultural context, such a change in attitude could lead to serious legal and social consequences. This phrase introduces the potential for a legal dispute, as the husband's feelings could lead to accusations against the wife, impacting her reputation and status. This situation is addressed in the subsequent verses, which provide legal procedures to protect the rights of the woman and ensure justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/man.htm">Man</a></b><br>The husband in the scenario who marries a woman and later claims to hate her.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/woman.htm">Woman</a></b><br>The wife who is the subject of the husband's claim.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage.htm">Marriage</a></b><br>The covenantal relationship between the man and the woman.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/hate.htm">Hate</a></b><br>The emotional response of the man towards his wife, leading to the subsequent legal and social actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelite_society.htm">Israelite Society</a></b><br>The cultural and legal context in which these laws were given, reflecting the values and norms of ancient Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_marriage.htm">The Sanctity of Marriage</a></b><br>Marriage is a sacred covenant that should be entered with reverence and commitment.

From the very beginning, God joins a husband and wife as &#8220;one flesh&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>; <a href="/mark/10-6.htm">Mark 10:6-9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/22-13.htm">Deuteronomy 22:13</a> opens with a hypothetical case that Israel&#8217;s judges might be asked to adjudicate. It reminds us that real people, with real sins, live inside God&#8217;s holy institutions.<p>&#8226; The law is protective: a bride enters marriage under her father&#8217;s care and is now entrusted to her husband (<a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14</a>). This verse immediately signals that God holds the husband responsible for treating that covenant with honor (<a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>has relations with her</b><p>&#8226; Consummation seals the covenant physically and publicly. Scripture celebrates this intimacy as good and undefiled (<a href="/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a>), while also warning that it carries serious covenant obligations (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-3.htm">1 Corinthians 7:3-5</a>).<p>&#8226; In the narrative that follows (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-14.htm">Deuteronomy 22:14-19</a>), the husband&#8217;s physical knowledge of his wife becomes the basis for either confirming or slandering her purity. God folds sexual ethics into public justice; private sin has public consequences (<a href="/numbers/5-12.htm">Numbers 5:12-15</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse underscores that covenant love is more than physical union; it must be matched by faithfulness of heart (Song of Songs 8:6-7).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and comes to hate her</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Hate&#8221; shows a grievous change of heart&#8212;a repudiation of the wife after enjoying the covenant benefits. Scripture repeatedly condemns this treachery (<a href="/malachi/2-16.htm">Malachi 2:16</a>; <a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16-19</a>).<p>&#8226; In the larger context, the husband&#8217;s hatred expresses itself in a false accusation meant to disgrace and possibly divorce her (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-14.htm">Deuteronomy 22:14</a>). God&#8217;s law exposes that tactic and protects the innocent bride with fines, public rebuke, and lifelong responsibility placed back on the husband (22:18-19).<p>&#8226; The pattern anticipates Christ, who never turns against His bride, the church (<a href="/ephesians/5-29.htm">Ephesians 5:29-32</a>). Human husbands are warned: covenant-breaking hatred is sin, and God stands on the side of the wronged spouse (<a href="/psalms/146-9.htm">Psalm 146:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/22-13.htm">Deuteronomy 22:13</a> sets the stage for laws that defend marital faithfulness and safeguard a woman&#8217;s honor. A man who enjoys the privileges of marriage yet turns to hatred is held accountable by God and community.
