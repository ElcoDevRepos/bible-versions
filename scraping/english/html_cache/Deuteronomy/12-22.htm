In the context of Deuteronomy, Moses is addressing the Israelites as they prepare to enter the Promised Land. The comparison to eating a gazelle or deer highlights that this meat is considered common and not sacred, unlike the meat from sacrifices which had specific regulations. Gazelles and deer were common game animals in ancient Israel, and their consumption was not restricted by ceremonial laws. This reflects a shift from the earlier requirement to bring all meat to the tabernacle for sacrifice, allowing for more practical living in the land.<p><b>both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it.</b><br>This part of the verse indicates a relaxation of the strict purity laws concerning who may eat certain foods. In the wilderness, the Israelites had to adhere to strict purity laws, but here, the distinction between ceremonially clean and unclean individuals is set aside for the consumption of non-sacrificial meat. This provision underscores the practical aspects of daily life in the Promised Land, where maintaining ceremonial purity at all times would be challenging. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching found in <a href="/acts/10-15.htm">Acts 10:15</a>, where Peter is told, "Do not call anything impure that God has made clean," indicating a broader application of God's grace and the breaking down of barriers between clean and unclean.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving instructions on how to live in the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/gazelle_and_deer.htm">Gazelle and Deer</a></b><br>Clean animals that the Israelites were permitted to eat, symbolizing God's provision.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/ceremonially_unclean_and_clean.htm">Ceremonially Unclean and Clean</a></b><br>Categories of people based on their ritual purity according to the Mosaic Law.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_god's_provision.htm">Understanding God's Provision</a></b><br>God provides for His people, allowing them to eat freely within the guidelines He sets.

God is not tentative about His permission; He is emphatic.<p>&#8226; Earlier in the chapter, the Lord had set strict limits on where Israel was to offer sacrifices (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-13.htm">Deuteronomy 12:13&#8211;14</a>), yet He balances that restriction with generous freedom in daily meals (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-20.htm">Deuteronomy 12:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The same pattern&#8212;God giving clear commands and then backing them with a firm &#8220;indeed&#8221; of grace&#8212;appears in <a href="/genesis/9-3.htm">Genesis 9:3</a> (&#8220;Everything that lives and moves will be food for you&#8221;) and <a href="/psalms/84-11.htm">Psalm 84:11</a> (&#8220;No good thing does He withhold from those who walk uprightly,&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you may eat it</b><p>&#8226; The verb here is permissive, not merely descriptive. Israel is released from the idea that every animal must be brought to the altar.<p>&#8226; This frees families to enjoy God&#8217;s provision in their own towns, echoing <a href="/ecclesiastes/3-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:13</a>: &#8220;Every man should eat and drink and find satisfaction in all his labor&#8212;this is the gift of God,&#8221;.<p>&#8226; It anticipates the New-Covenant liberty proclaimed in <a href="/romans/14-3.htm">Romans 14:3</a>&#8212;&#8220;Let him who eats not despise him who abstains, and let him who abstains not judge him who eats, for God has accepted him,&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as you would eat a gazelle or deer</b><p>&#8226; Gazelles and deer were clean yet wild animals that could never be offered on the altar (<a href="/deuteronomy/14-5.htm">Deuteronomy 14:5</a>).<p>&#8226; By comparing domestic livestock to these wild creatures, the Lord clarifies that a non-sacrificial meal does not require priestly mediation.<p>&#8226; This mirrors <a href="/deuteronomy/15-22.htm">Deuteronomy 15:22</a>, where an unblemished firstborn that developed a defect could still be eaten at home &#8220;like the gazelle or deer.&#8221; God distinguishes worship from ordinary life without diminishing either.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>both the ceremonially unclean and the clean</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Unclean&#8221; here refers to temporary ritual states, such as touching a corpse (<a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11</a>) or a woman&#8217;s monthly cycle (<a href="/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19</a>).<p>&#8226; In sacrificial settings, such people were barred, yet at the family table they were welcome.<p>&#8226; The verse thus guards community cohesion: no Israelite goes hungry or feels ostracized at mealtime. Compare <a href="/1_samuel/21-4.htm">1 Samuel 21:4</a>, where the priest offers holy bread only to those ritually clean&#8212;highlighting how unique this everyday permission is.<p>&#8226; Jesus amplifies the principle in <a href="/mark/2-16.htm">Mark 2:16&#8211;17</a>, dining with &#8220;tax collectors and sinners,&#8221; affirming that fellowship is not restricted to the ceremonially elite.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>may eat it</b><p>&#8226; The sentence closes as it began&#8212;with permission. God&#8217;s gifts are to be received with gratitude, not anxiety.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_timothy/4-4.htm">1 Timothy 4:4&#8211;5</a> echoes the thought: &#8220;For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The repetition underscores God&#8217;s heart: He delights when His people enjoy what He provides, recognizing Him as the ultimate Host (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/12-22.htm">Deuteronomy 12:22</a> reassures Israel that while sacrificial meat is restricted to the sanctuary, ordinary meat is freely theirs. The Lord&#8217;s emphatic &#8220;indeed&#8221; lays to rest any doubt; their everyday meals need no priestly oversight. By likening domestic animals to gazelles and deer, He separates worship from daily nourishment, allowing both the ritually clean and unclean to share the same table. The verse showcases God&#8217;s balance of holiness and generosity, urging His people&#8212;and us&#8212;to receive His provisions with confident gratitude.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/12-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Indeed,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1431;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_389.htm">Strong's 389: </a> </span><span class="str2">A particle of affirmation, surely</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you may eat</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1461;&#1488;&#1464;&#1499;&#1461;&#1444;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#234;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_398.htm">Strong's 398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To eat</span><br /><br /><span class="word">it as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1448;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
