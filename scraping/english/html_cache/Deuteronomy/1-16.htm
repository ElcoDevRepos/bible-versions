This occurred during the Israelites' journey from Egypt to the Promised Land, as recorded in <a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13-26</a>. Moses' father-in-law, Jethro, advised him to delegate authority to capable men to ease his burden. This delegation reflects the importance of shared leadership and accountability within a community.<p><b>Hear the disputes between your brothers:</b><br>The term "brothers" here signifies fellow Israelites, emphasizing the familial bond among the people of Israel. Disputes were common in a large community, and the judges were tasked with listening carefully to both sides. This reflects the biblical principle of justice and fairness, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>, which warns against answering a matter before hearing it fully.<p><b>and judge fairly between a man and his brother:</b><br>The call to judge fairly underscores the biblical mandate for justice, a recurring theme throughout Scripture. <a href="/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a> instructs judges not to show partiality, whether to the poor or the great, but to judge righteously.

The Israelites were reminded of their own status as foreigners in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/22-21.htm">Exodus 22:21</a>) and were commanded to treat foreigners with fairness and compassion.
