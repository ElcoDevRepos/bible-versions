In ancient times, many cultures worshiped the sun, moon, and stars as deities. The Israelites, living among such cultures, were warned against adopting these practices. The heavens declare the glory of God (<a href="/psalms/19.htm">Psalm 19:1</a>), but they are not to be objects of worship. The celestial bodies are part of God's creation, meant to serve humanity by marking times and seasons (<a href="/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14</a>).<p><b>all the host of heaven</b><br>The "host of heaven" refers to the multitude of celestial bodies. In the ancient Near East, these were often personified and worshiped as gods. The term "host" can also imply an organized array, suggesting the orderliness of God's creation. This phrase underscores the distinction between the Creator and His creation, a central theme in biblical theology. The host of heaven is under God's command, as seen in the battle narratives where God uses celestial phenomena to aid Israel (<a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12-14</a>).<p><b>do not be enticed to bow down and worship</b><br>This command is a direct prohibition against idolatry, a recurring issue for Israel. The temptation to worship created things rather than the Creator is a fundamental human failing (<a href="/romans/1-25.htm">Romans 1:25</a>). The act of bowing down signifies submission and reverence, which should be directed only to God. The warning reflects the first two commandments, emphasizing exclusive worship of Yahweh (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-5</a>).<p><b>what the LORD your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven</b><br>This phrase indicates that the celestial bodies are given by God for the benefit of all humanity, not for worship. The term "apportioned" suggests a distribution of resources, highlighting God's sovereignty and provision. It also implies that while other nations may misuse these gifts, Israel is called to a higher standard of worship. This distinction sets Israel apart as God's chosen people, tasked with being a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The speaker of Deuteronomy, Moses is delivering God's laws and commandments to the Israelites before they enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience of Moses' address, the chosen people of God, who are being warned against idolatry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_heavens.htm">The Heavens</a></b><br>Refers to the celestial bodies&#8212;sun, moon, and stars&#8212;that were often objects of worship in ancient cultures.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The one true God of Israel, who commands exclusive worship and devotion from His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/nations.htm">Nations</a></b><br>The surrounding peoples who often worshipped celestial bodies, contrasting with the Israelites' call to worship Yahweh alone.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_idolatry.htm">Avoiding Idolatry</a></b><br>The passage warns against the temptation to worship created things.

But Jehovah was pledged to be the God of Israel. This appears to be the argument of <a href="/context/deuteronomy/4-19.htm" title="And lest you lift up your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, should be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD your God has divided to all nations under the whole heaven.">Deuteronomy 4:19-20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven</span>, etc. The worship of the heavenly bodies, especially star-worship, prevailed among the Canaanites and many of the Semitic tribes, but was not confined to them; the Egyptians also reverenced the sun as Re, the moon as Isis, and the stars as the symbols of deities. The Israelites were thus, both from past associations and from what they might encounter in Canaan, exposed to the danger of being seduced into idolatry. <span class="cmt_word">Shouldest be driven</span>: <span class="accented">shouldest be urged on</span>, <span class="accented">drawn</span>, or <span class="accented">constrained</span> (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/13-13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven</span>, God had allotted (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5e7;</span>) to all mankind the heavenly bodies for their advantage (<a href="/genesis/1-14.htm">Genesis 1:14-18</a>; <a href="/psalms/104-19.htm">Psalm 104:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>); it was, therefore, not competent for any one nation to seek to appropriate them as specially theirs, and it was absurd for any to offer religious service to objects intended for the service of man. Targum: <span class="accented">Which the Lord thy God prepared for all peoples under heaven</span>; Vulgate: <span class="accented">Quae creavit Dominus Deus tuus in ministerium cunctis gentibus</span>. This seems better than the interpretation that God had "allotted them for worship, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. had permitted them [the nations] to choose them as the objects of their worship" (Keil, etc.); for: <p><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> There is no distinction here between the Hebrews and the other nations of the earth; "all nations" includes them as well as the heathen. <p><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> Though God permitted the heathen to worship the heavenly bodies, he never allotted these to men in order that they might worship them. "It noteth God's bounty in giving all people the use of those creatures, and the base mind of man to worship such things as are given for servants unto men" (Ainsworth). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When you look</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ti&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5375.htm">Strong's 5375: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lift, carry, take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the heavens</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1431;&#1497;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;may&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
