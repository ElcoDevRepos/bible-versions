The Mosaic Law provided a framework for resolving such conflicts, emphasizing justice and fairness. This reflects the broader biblical principle of seeking peace and reconciliation, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>, where peacemakers are called blessed.<p><b>they are to go to court</b><br>The court system in ancient Israel was established to ensure that disputes were resolved according to God's laws.

This principle is echoed in <a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>, where governing authorities are described as God's servants to execute wrath on wrongdoers.

The number was fixed at forty, probably because of the symbolical significance of that number as a measure of completeness. The rabbins fixed the number at thirty-nine, apparently in order that the danger of exceeding the number prescribed by the Law should be diminished (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-24.htm">2 Corinthians 11:24</a>); but another reason is assigned by Maimonides, viz. that, as the instrument of punishment was a scourge with three tails, each stroke counted for three, and thus they could not give forty, but only thirty-nine, unless they exceeded the forty (Maimon., 'In Sanhedrin,' 17:2). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/25-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">there is</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1492;&#1456;&#1497;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(yih&#183;yeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a dispute</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1489;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#238;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7379.htm">Strong's 7379: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strife, dispute</span><br /><br /><span class="word">between</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_996.htm">Strong's 996: </a> </span><span class="str2">An interval, space between</span><br /><br /><span class="word">men,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_582.htm">Strong's 582: </a> </span><span class="str2">Man, mankind</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they are to go</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;nig&#183;g&#601;&#183;&#353;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
