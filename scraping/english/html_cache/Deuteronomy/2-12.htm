Seir is a mountainous region located in what is now southern Jordan. The Horites are mentioned in <a href="/genesis/14-6.htm">Genesis 14:6</a> and <a href="/genesis/36-20.htm">Genesis 36:20-30</a>, where they are listed as the original inhabitants of the land. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Horites were a group of cave-dwellers, as the name "Horite" is derived from a word meaning "cave." This phrase sets the historical context for the displacement of the Horites by the Edomites, the descendants of Esau.<p><b>but the descendants of Esau drove them out.</b><br>Esau, the brother of Jacob, is the progenitor of the Edomites. The descendants of Esau, also known as Edomites, took over the land of Seir by driving out the Horites. This act of displacement is significant as it mirrors the later actions of the Israelites in Canaan. The Edomites' conquest of Seir is seen as a fulfillment of the promise given to Esau in <a href="/genesis/27-39.htm">Genesis 27:39-40</a>, where he is told he will live by the sword. This phrase highlights the theme of divine providence and the fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs.<p><b>They destroyed the Horites from before them and settled in their place,</b><br>The destruction of the Horites by the Edomites is indicative of the common ancient Near Eastern practice of conquest and settlement. This phrase emphasizes the complete removal of the Horites, allowing the Edomites to establish themselves in the region. The act of settling in the place of the conquered people is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, reflecting the idea of divine judgment and the transfer of land as part of God's sovereign plan. This mirrors the later conquest of Canaan by the Israelites, as seen in the book of Joshua.<p><b>just as Israel did in the land that the LORD gave them as their possession.)</b><br>This comparison between the Edomites' conquest of Seir and Israel's conquest of Canaan underscores the parallel between the two peoples. The phrase "the land that the LORD gave them" highlights the theological perspective that the land is a divine gift, a central theme in the Deuteronomic history. The Israelites' conquest of Canaan is seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>. This phrase also serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the importance of obedience to His commands, as Israel's possession of the land is contingent upon their covenant relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/horites.htm">Horites</a></b><br>An ancient people who originally inhabited the region of Seir.

The Horites were an established, cave-dwelling people (see <a href="/genesis/14-6.htm">Genesis 14:6</a>; 36:20). Moses&#8217; reminder accomplishes at least two things:<p>&#8226; It affirms the historical reality that specific peoples were rooted in specific territories.<p>&#8226; It sets the stage for demonstrating that land changes hands under God&#8217;s watchful governance (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But the descendants of Esau drove them out</b><p>The text moves immediately to Esau&#8217;s line&#8212;Edom&#8212;who &#8220;drove&#8221; the Horites from Seir (<a href="/genesis/36-6.htm">Genesis 36:6-8</a>). This is not mythic embellishment; Scripture records the event as a literal military displacement overseen by the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-5.htm">Deuteronomy 2:5</a>). Key observations:<p>&#8226; God had already told Israel not to seize Edom&#8217;s land because He had &#8220;given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-5.htm">Deuteronomy 2:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Edom&#8217;s success illustrates God&#8217;s faithfulness to Abraham&#8217;s wider family line, even outside the covenant nation (<a href="/genesis/17-20.htm">Genesis 17:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They destroyed the Horites and settled in their place</b><p>The verse underscores permanence: Esau&#8217;s descendants didn&#8217;t merely pass through; they &#8220;settled&#8221; after &#8220;destroying&#8221; the Horites (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-22.htm">Deuteronomy 2:22</a>). Similar language appears when God later commissions Israel against the Canaanites (<a href="/numbers/33-50.htm">Numbers 33:50-53</a>). The lesson for Israel hearing Moses:<p>&#8226; God fulfills His promises through decisive action, sometimes by judging resident peoples (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Possession follows obedience to God&#8217;s timing and boundaries (<a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Just as Israel did in the land that the LORD gave them as their possession</b><p>Moses draws a parallel to the generation about to enter Canaan. What Edom experienced on a smaller scale foreshadows Israel&#8217;s larger conquest (<a href="/joshua/21-43.htm">Joshua 21:43-45</a>). Takeaways:<p>&#8226; The same Sovereign Lord grants, withholds, or reassigns territories (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel can move forward confidently; God&#8217;s past dealings with Edom show His pattern of keeping land promises (<a href="/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>).<p>&#8226; The comparison also cautions Israel: failure to trust or obey could forfeit blessing, just as Edom later faced judgment for betrayal (Obadiah).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/2-12.htm">Deuteronomy 2:12</a> reminds Israel that the Lord controls history, territory, and victory. He had already reassigned Seir from the Horites to Esau&#8217;s line, proving He honors promises and sets national boundaries. That same faithful God now prepares to give Canaan to Israel. Trust in His word and obedience to His direction remain the sure path to enjoying His granted inheritance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/2-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The Horites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1495;&#1465;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;&#7717;&#333;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
