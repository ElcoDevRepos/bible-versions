It acknowledges that not all legal matters can be resolved at the local level due to their complexity. This reflects the need for a higher authority in judicial matters, emphasizing the importance of wisdom and discernment in leadership. The principle of seeking higher counsel is echoed in <a href="/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13-26</a>, where Moses appoints leaders to judge smaller matters while reserving the more difficult cases for himself.<p><b>whether the controversy within your gates</b><br>The term "within your gates" refers to the local communities or towns in Israel. Each town had its own set of elders and judges who were responsible for maintaining justice. This phrase highlights the communal aspect of justice, where local leaders were expected to handle disputes. The gates of a city were often the place where legal matters were discussed and resolved, as seen in <a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1-11</a>.<p><b>is regarding bloodshed, lawsuits, or assaults</b><br>These categories cover a range of legal issues that could arise in a community. Bloodshed refers to cases of murder or manslaughter, lawsuits involve civil disputes, and assaults pertain to physical violence. The inclusion of these specific categories underscores the comprehensive nature of the law in addressing both criminal and civil matters. The Mosaic Law provided detailed instructions for handling such cases, as seen in <a href="/exodus/21.htm">Exodus 21-23</a>.<p><b>you must go up to the place the LORD your God will choose</b><br>This phrase indicates the centralization of difficult legal cases to a divinely appointed location, which would later be identified as Jerusalem. The phrase "the place the LORD your God will choose" is significant in Deuteronomy, pointing to the future establishment of a central place of worship and governance. This centralization ensured consistency in legal decisions and maintained the unity of the nation.

The word "stroke" is the common word for "plague" in the Pentateuch and elsewhere. It may possibly refer to cases of ceremonial purity or impurity, especially in reference to disease. There is an evident allusion to this law in the history of King Jehoshaphat (<a href="/context/2_chronicles/19-8.htm" title="Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they returned to Jerusalem.">2Chronicles 19:8-10</a>). There the words are "between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments." The questions are (1) between two contending parties; (2) between the law as a general rule and its application to particular duties, institutions and requirements. Other passages in the same chapter recall <a href="/context/deuteronomy/16-18.htm" title="Judges and officers shall you make you in all your gates, which the LORD your God gives you, throughout your tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment.">Deuteronomy 16:18-20</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Matters of controversy within thy gates</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in the local courts of their several cities. The "gate" was the place of judgment. In <a href="/2_chronicles/19-10.htm" title="And what cause soever shall come to you of your brothers that dwell in your cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and judgments, you shall even warn them that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come on you, and on your brothers: this do, and you shall not trespass.">2Chronicles 19:10</a>, the phrase is more clearly expressed, thus, "what cause soever shall come unto you of your brethren that dwell <span class= "ital">in their cities."</span><p><span class= "bld">Into the place which the Lord thy God shall choose.</span>--This implies what was afterwards ordered before Moses' death, that the standard copy of the Law would be kept beside the Ark of the Covenant, in the sacred place (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-26.htm" title="Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against you.">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8-13.</span> - So long as Moses was with the people, they had in him one to whom, in the last resort, cases might be brought for decision which were found too difficult for the ordinary judges (<a href="/exodus/18-19.htm">Exodus 18:19-26</a>). But, as he was not to be always with them, it was needful to provide a supreme court, to which such cases might be carried when they could no longer be decided by him; and such a court is here appointed to be held at the sanctuary. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A matter too hard for thee</span>; literally, too <span class="accented">marvelous</span>; something extraordinary, and which could not be decided by the ordinary rules of the judicature. <span class="cmt_word">Between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in cases where blood had been shed and death had ensued, either accidentally or from murderous intent (cf. <a href="/exodus/21-13.htm">Exodus 21:13</a>, etc.; <a href="/numbers/35-9.htm">Numbers 35:9</a>, etc.); in cases of disputed rights and claims (cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/19-10.htm">2 Chronicles 19:10</a>); and in cases where corporeal injury had been suffered, whether in strife or from assault (<a href="/exodus/21-18.htm">Exodus 21:18</a>, etc.); and, in general, wherever <span class="cmt_word">matters of controversy</span> - disputes as to what was lawful and right, might arise in their towns and villages. In all such cases recourse was to be had to the court at the sanctuary - "to the priests the Levites," <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the priests who were of the tribe of Levi, and to the judge presiding there - the lay judge associated with the high priest as president (see Oehler, in Herzog's 'Encyclop.,' vol. 5. p. 58). It is not intended by this that an appeal was to lie from the lower court to the higher, or that the parties in a suit might carry it at once to the supreme judge; the meaning rather is that, when the ordinary judges found a case too difficult for them to deal with, they were themselves to transmit it to the supreme court for decision. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a case</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1436;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is too difficult</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1488;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(yip&#183;p&#257;&#183;l&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6381.htm">Strong's 6381: </a> </span><span class="str2">To separate, distinguish, to be, great, difficult, wonderful</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1502;&#1468;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1448;</span> <span class="translit">(mim&#183;m&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
