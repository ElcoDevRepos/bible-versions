They were known for their fortified cities and warrior culture. The hills refer to the mountainous regions of Canaan, which were strategically advantageous for defense. This phrase highlights the Amorites' territorial dominance and their readiness to defend their land against the Israelites.<p><b>came out against you</b><br>This indicates a proactive and aggressive response from the Amorites. The Israelites, having disobeyed God's command to enter the Promised Land earlier, now faced the consequences of their actions. The Amorites' attack serves as a divine judgment for Israel's lack of faith and disobedience.<p><b>and chased you like a swarm of bees</b><br>The imagery of a swarm of bees suggests a relentless and overwhelming pursuit. Bees are known for their aggressive defense of their hives, and this metaphor emphasizes the intensity and ferocity of the Amorite attack. This simile is also used in other biblical contexts to describe overwhelming forces (e.g., <a href="/psalms/118-12.htm">Psalm 118:12</a>).<p><b>They routed you from Seir</b><br>Seir is a mountainous region associated with Edom, located southeast of the Dead Sea.

This retreat symbolizes the Israelites' failure to trust in God's promise and protection.<p><b>all the way to Hormah</b><br>Hormah, meaning "destruction," is a city in the Negev region. The name itself signifies the outcome of the battle&#8212;a complete and utter defeat. This location marks the southern boundary of the Israelites' retreat, underscoring the severity of their loss.

The situation of Hormah is unknown.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Amorites</span>, for the Canaanites generally; in Numbers, the Amalekites are specially mentioned as joining with the Amorites in chastising the Israelites. These tribes came down from the higher mountain range to the lower height which the Israelites had gained, and drove them with great slaughter as far as Hormah, in Seir, chasing them as bees do, which pursue with keen ferocity those who disturb them. Hormah (Ban-place), the earlier name of which was Zephath (<a href="/judges/1-17.htm">Judges 1:17</a>), was a royal city of the Canaanites, taken by the Israelites towards the close of their wanderings, and placed by them under a ban (<a href="/numbers/21-1.htm">Numbers 21:1</a>, etc.), which ban was fully executed only in the time of the Judges. It is here and elsewhere called Hormah by anticipation. The old name Zephath seems to have survived that given to it by the Israelites in the name Sebaita or Sepata, the Arabic form of Zephath, the name of a heap of ruins on the western slope of the rocky mountain-plateau Rakhmah, about two hours and a half south-west of Khalasa (Ritter, 'Geography of Palestine,' 1:431; Palmer, 'Desert of Et-Tih,' p. 289, etc.). This is a more probable identification than that of Robinson ('Res.,' 2:18), who finds Hormah in the rocky defile of Es-Sufah, an unlikely place for a city of the importance of Zephath to be in. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the Amorites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1465;&#1512;&#1460;&#1436;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#277;&#183;m&#333;&#183;r&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
