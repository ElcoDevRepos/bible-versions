The mention of a bird's nest highlights the importance of observing and respecting God's creation. In biblical times, birds were seen as part of God's provision and care for His people, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/6-26.htm">Matthew 6:26</a>, where Jesus speaks of God's care for the birds of the air.<p><b>either in a tree or on the ground along the road</b><br>The specification of the nest's location, whether in a tree or on the ground, indicates the comprehensive nature of the law. It reflects the understanding that God's commandments cover all aspects of life, whether in the heights or the low places. This can be seen as a metaphor for God's omnipresence and His concern for all creation, as echoed in <a href="/psalms/139-8.htm">Psalm 139:8-10</a>.<p><b>and the mother is sitting on the chicks or eggs</b><br>The image of the mother bird sitting on her young emphasizes the natural order and the protective instincts placed by God in His creatures. This can be seen as a reflection of God's nurturing nature, as He is often depicted as a protective parent in scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/66-13.htm">Isaiah 66:13</a>. The mother bird's role is crucial for the survival of her offspring, symbolizing the importance of preserving life and the family unit.<p><b>you must not take the mother along with the young</b><br>This commandment underscores the principle of mercy and sustainability. By prohibiting the taking of both the mother and her young, the law ensures the continuation of the species and teaches compassion. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of stewardship over creation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>. It also reflects the value of mercy, a key attribute of God, as highlighted in <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>. The commandment can be seen as a type of Christ's teaching on mercy and compassion, as He often emphasized caring for the vulnerable and preserving life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bird's_nest.htm">Bird's Nest</a></b><br>Represents a natural setting where birds reproduce and nurture their young.

In <a href="/exodus/23-4.htm">Exodus 23:4&#8211;5</a> God likewise directs Israel on what to do &#8220;if you come across&#8221; an enemy&#8217;s stray animal, showing that chance encounters are opportunities to live out His character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with chicks or eggs</b><p>The focus shifts to the most vulnerable lives in the nest. Scripture consistently highlights care for the weak: <a href="/psalms/145-9.htm">Psalm 145:9</a> says, &#8220;The LORD is good to all; His compassion rests on all He has made.&#8221; By singling out chicks and eggs, God teaches sensitivity toward defenseless creatures, echoing <a href="/proverbs/12-10.htm">Proverbs 12:10</a>, &#8220;A righteous man regards the life of his animal.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>either in a tree or on the ground along the road</b><p>Whether lofty or low, public or private, the command covers every setting. This breadth parallels <a href="/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9&#8211;10</a>, where gleaning laws applied &#8220;to your field&#8221; and &#8220;your vineyard,&#8221; ensuring the poor could find provision anywhere harvest occurred. God&#8217;s concern permeates every corner of daily life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the mother is sitting on the chicks or eggs</b><p>The picture is of a mother bird protecting her young. Jesus later used similar imagery: &#8220;How often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>). God&#8217;s own protective heart underlies this ordinance; He wants His people to mirror that tenderness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you must not take the mother along with the young</b><p>The directive is clear: do not seize both generations at once. <a href="/deuteronomy/22-7.htm">Deuteronomy 22:7</a> adds, &#8220;You are free to take the young, but be sure to let the mother go, so that it may go well with you and you may prolong your days&#8221;. The promise of blessing shows God&#8217;s pleasure when mercy guides our actions. Similar safeguards appear in <a href="/leviticus/22-28.htm">Leviticus 22:28</a> (prohibiting slaughter of a mother and offspring on the same day) and <a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a> (forbidding boiling a young goat in its mother&#8217;s milk). Together these laws teach:<p>&#8226; Preserve life for future flourishing.<p>&#8226; Avoid needless cruelty.<p>&#8226; Recognize God as the true Owner of all creatures (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/22-6.htm">Deuteronomy 22:6</a> calls believers to reflect God&#8217;s compassionate stewardship in spontaneous moments.

In the command to honour thy father and mother, it is written (Deuteronomy 5) 'that thy days may be prolonged and that it may go well with thee.' In the liberty of the nest it is written (here), 'that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days.' Suppose a man's father says to him, Climb up the tower and bring me the young birds. He ascends the tower, lets the dam go, and takes the young. But on his way back, he falls and is killed. Where is the 'going well 'in his case, and where is the prolonging of his days?
