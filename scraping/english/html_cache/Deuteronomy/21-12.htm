In the ancient Near Eastern context, warfare often resulted in the capture of women. The instruction to bring her into the house signifies a transition from captivity to a more protected and potentially honorable status. This act can be seen as a form of integration into the Israelite community, providing her with a new identity and family. The house represents a place of safety and belonging, contrasting with her previous status as a captive. This practice reflects the broader biblical theme of redemption and transformation, where individuals are brought from a state of alienation into a covenant community.<p><b>She must shave her head,</b><br>Shaving the head was a common mourning practice in the ancient Near East, symbolizing a break from the past and the beginning of a new life. This act could also signify purification and the removal of her former identity as a foreigner. In biblical terms, it represents a cleansing process, similar to the purification rituals found in Leviticus. The shaving of the head can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, in His sacrifice, removes the old self and offers a new identity in Him. This act of shaving is a physical manifestation of an inward transformation, aligning with the biblical theme of renewal.<p><b>trim her nails,</b><br>Trimming the nails, like shaving the head, is part of the purification process. It symbolizes the removal of impurities and the preparation for a new beginning. In the cultural context, this act may have been associated with personal hygiene and readiness for integration into a new community. Biblically, it can be seen as a metaphor for sanctification, the process by which believers are made holy and set apart for God's purposes. This act of trimming is a small but significant step in the transformation of the captive woman, reflecting the broader biblical narrative of cleansing and preparation for a new life in God's covenant community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people receiving the law, God's chosen nation, tasked with living according to His commandments.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/captive_woman.htm">Captive Woman</a></b><br>A woman taken as a captive during warfare, whom an Israelite man desires to marry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/household.htm">Household</a></b><br>The setting where the captive woman is brought, symbolizing a transition into a new life and community.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shaving_of_head_and_trimming_of_nails.htm">Shaving of Head and Trimming of Nails</a></b><br>Ritual acts symbolizing purification, mourning, and the transition from her previous life to a new one.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader and prophet who delivered God's laws to the Israelites, including this instruction.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/cultural_sensitivity_and_respect.htm">Cultural Sensitivity and Respect</a></b><br>The law reflects a concern for the dignity and humanity of the captive woman, emphasizing the importance of treating others with respect, even in difficult circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_transformation.htm">Symbolism of Transformation</a></b><br>The acts of shaving and trimming symbolize a break from the past and a new beginning, reminding us of the transformative power of God's grace in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/marriage_as_a_covenant.htm">Marriage as a Covenant</a></b><br>The process outlined in the law underscores the seriousness of marriage as a covenant, not to be entered into lightly or without consideration of the other person's well-being.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_concern_for_the_vulnerable.htm">God's Concern for the Vulnerable</a></b><br>This law highlights God's care for the vulnerable and marginalized, encouraging us to advocate for and protect those who are powerless.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/integration_into_community.htm">Integration into Community</a></b><br>The captive woman's transition into the household signifies the importance of community and belonging, urging us to welcome and integrate newcomers into our faith communities.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_21_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 21:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_21_12_God_s_war_captive_laws.htm">How does Deuteronomy 21:12 reflect God's laws on war and captives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Deuteronomy_21_12_Captive_women_customs.htm">What cultural practices are addressed in Deuteronomy 21:12 regarding captive women?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Deut_21_12_NT_compassion_link.htm">How does Deuteronomy 21:12 connect with New Testament teachings on compassion?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Deuteronomy_21_12_s_modern_guidance.htm">What principles from Deuteronomy 21:12 can guide our treatment of others today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Deut_21_12_s_lesson_on_justice_mercy.htm">How can Deuteronomy 21:12 inform our understanding of justice and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Deut_21_12_vs_modern_women_s_rights.htm">How does Deuteronomy 21:12 align with modern views on women's rights and autonomy?

The Targum of Onkelos takes this in quite an opposite sense, rendering, as in the margin of the Authorized Version, "suffer to grow," and the rabbins who adopt this meaning suppose that the design of the prescription was that the woman, being rendered unlovely, the man might be deterred from taking her to be his wife. But this is altogether alien from the spirit and scope of the passage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/21-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">then you shall bring</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1489;&#1461;&#1488;&#1514;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;ha&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Conjunctive perfect - second person masculine singular &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_935.htm">Strong's 935: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come in, come, go in, go</span><br /><br /><span class="word">her into</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your house.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1462;&#1425;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#234;&#183;&#7791;e&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">She must shave</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1490;&#1460;&#1500;&#1468;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7713;il&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Conjunctive perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1548.htm">Strong's 1548: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be bald, to shave, to lay waste</span><br /><br /><span class="word">her head,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1465;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1428;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#333;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7218.htm">Strong's 7218: </a> </span><span class="str2">The head</span><br /><br /><span class="word">trim</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">her nails,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1512;&#1456;&#1504;&#1462;&#1469;&#1497;&#1492;&#1464;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;ip&#183;p&#257;&#183;r&#601;&#183;ne&#183;h&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6856.htm">Strong's 6856: </a> </span><span class="str2">A claw, nail, the point of a, style</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/deuteronomy/21-12.htm">Deuteronomy 21:12 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/deuteronomy/21-12.htm">Deuteronomy 21:12 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/deuteronomy/21-12.htm">Deuteronomy 21:12 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/deuteronomy/21-12.htm">Deuteronomy 21:12 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/deuteronomy/21-12.htm">Deuteronomy 21:12 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/deuteronomy/21-12.htm">Deuteronomy 21:12  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/deuteronomy/21-12.htm">Deuteronomy 21:12 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/deuteronomy/21-12.htm">Deuteronomy 21:12 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/deuteronomy/21-12.htm">Deuteronomy 21:12 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/deuteronomy/21-12.htm">Deuteronomy 21:12 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/deuteronomy/21-12.htm">OT Law: Deuteronomy 21:12 Then you shall bring her home (Deut.
