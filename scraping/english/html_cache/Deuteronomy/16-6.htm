It was a reminder of God's salvation and covenant with His people. The exclusivity of the location underscores the importance of unity in worship and obedience to God's commands.<p><b>at the place the LORD your God will choose</b><br>This phrase refers to the centralization of worship in a specific location, which would later be identified as Jerusalem (<a href="/2_chronicles/6-6.htm">2 Chronicles 6:6</a>). It emphasizes God's sovereignty in designating a holy place for His Name, foreshadowing the establishment of the Temple.<p><b>as a dwelling for His Name</b><br>The concept of God's Name dwelling in a place signifies His presence and authority. This is a precursor to the Temple in Jerusalem, where God's presence was uniquely manifest (<a href="/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>).

The evening sacrifice symbolizes the transition from slavery to freedom, and the setting sun marks the beginning of a new day, reflecting the new life given through God's deliverance.<p><b>at the same time you departed from Egypt</b><br>This phrase connects the ritual to the historical event of the Exodus, grounding the Passover in God's redemptive history.
