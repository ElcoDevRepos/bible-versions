The Israelites' slavery in Egypt is a central theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing oppression and the need for divine intervention. This historical context underscores God's power and faithfulness in liberating His people. The command to remember is not just about recalling facts but internalizing the lessons of humility and gratitude. This remembrance is a call to empathy and justice, urging the Israelites to treat others with compassion, as they once experienced suffering. The theme of remembering past deliverance is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/5-15.htm">Deuteronomy 5:15</a>, reinforcing the importance of gratitude and obedience to God.<p><b>Therefore I am commanding you to do this.</b><br>The command here is rooted in the authority of God, who delivered the Israelites from slavery. It emphasizes obedience as a response to God's grace and mercy. The "this" refers to the preceding instructions in <a href="/deuteronomy/24.htm">Deuteronomy 24</a>, which include laws about justice, fairness, and care for the marginalized, such as the poor, widows, orphans, and foreigners. These laws reflect God's character and His desire for a just society. The command is not merely a legal obligation but a moral imperative, reflecting the covenant relationship between God and His people. This principle of obedience out of gratitude is mirrored in the New Testament, where believers are called to live righteously in response to Christ's sacrifice, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1-2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were once slaves in Egypt and are now being instructed by God through Moses.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land where the Israelites were enslaved for 400 years before God delivered them through Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader of the Israelites, who is delivering God's laws and commandments to the people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who delivered the Israelites from slavery and is now giving them laws to live by in the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/m/memory_as_motivation.htm">Memory as Motivation</a></b><br>Remembering past hardships can motivate us to act justly and compassionately towards others.
