This migration was part of God's providential plan to preserve the family line through which the Messiah would come. Egypt served as a place of refuge and growth for the Israelites, but it also became a place of bondage, setting the stage for God's deliverance through the Exodus.<p><b>seventy in all</b><br>The number seventy is significant in biblical numerology, often symbolizing completeness or perfection. The seventy individuals who went to Egypt included Jacob, his sons, and their families (<a href="/genesis/46-27.htm">Genesis 46:27</a>). This small group would grow into a great nation, fulfilling God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>).<p><b>and now the LORD your God</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and Israel. The use of "LORD" (YHWH) highlights God's personal name, signifying His eternal presence and faithfulness. The phrase "your God" underscores the unique bond and commitment God has with His chosen people, a theme that runs throughout Deuteronomy.<p><b>has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky</b><br>This statement reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham (<a href="/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5, 22</a>:17). The metaphor of stars signifies not only the vast number of Israelites but also their role as a light to the nations. This imagery is echoed in the New Testament, where believers in Christ are called to shine like stars in the world (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>).

If the marvellous increase of Israel in the time allowed by the sacred narrative presents a difficulty, we must remember that the Bible consistently represents the multiplication as the <span class= "ital">fulfilment of a Divine promise, </span>and not purely natural. But the testimony of the First Book of Chronicles must not be overlooked. The genealogy of Judah, given in the second and fourth chapters of that book, discloses a very extensive multiplication, a good deal of which must lie within the period of the sojourning in Egypt. The family of Hezron is particularly to be noticed. Of a certain descendant of Simeon it is written (<a href="/1_chronicles/4-27.htm" title="And Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters: but his brothers had not many children, neither did all their family multiply, like to the children of Judah.">1Chronicles 4:27</a>), "And Shimei had <span class= "ital">sixteen sons and six daughters; </span>but his brethren had not many children, <span class= "ital">neither did all their family multiply like to the children of Judah." </span>(!) Modern calculations are perhaps not quite adequate to deal with such a rate of increase as this.
