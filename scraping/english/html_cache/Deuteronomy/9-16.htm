The sin against the LORD is a direct violation of the covenant established at Sinai. The Israelites' actions are a breach of the first two commandments, which prohibit idolatry and the worship of other gods. This sin is not just a personal failing but a communal one, affecting the entire nation. The phrase underscores the seriousness of sin in the eyes of God, who is holy and just.<p><b>you had made for yourselves a molten calf.</b><br>The molten calf represents a return to Egyptian idolatry, as the Israelites had been exposed to such practices during their time in Egypt. The calf is a symbol of strength and fertility, often associated with the Egyptian god Apis. This act of creating a physical representation of God is a direct violation of the commandment against making graven images. The making of the calf signifies a lack of faith and patience, as the people sought a tangible god while Moses was on Mount Sinai. This incident foreshadows future struggles with idolatry throughout Israel's history.<p><b>You had turned aside quickly from the way that the LORD had commanded you.</b><br>The phrase "turned aside quickly" indicates the rapidity with which the Israelites abandoned their commitment to God's commandments. This reflects the human tendency to stray from God's path when faced with uncertainty or delay. The "way" that the LORD commanded refers to the laws and statutes given to guide the Israelites in righteousness and holiness. This deviation from God's way is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, illustrating the need for constant vigilance and obedience. The phrase also serves as a warning to future generations about the dangers of turning away from God's instructions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is recounting the events of the golden calf incident.
