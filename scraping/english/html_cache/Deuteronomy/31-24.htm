This phrase indicates the completion of his role in documenting the law. The act of writing was significant in ancient times, as it was a means of preserving and transmitting God's commandments to future generations. This also underscores the importance of literacy and record-keeping in Israelite culture.<p><b>in a book</b><br>The term "book" here refers to a scroll, as the codex form of books was not yet in use. Scrolls were made from papyrus or parchment and were the primary medium for recording texts. This highlights the meticulous care taken to ensure the law was preserved accurately. The use of a book signifies the permanence and authority of the written word in conveying divine instruction.<p><b>the words of this law</b><br>This refers to the legal and covenantal instructions given to the Israelites, encompassing moral, ceremonial, and civil laws. The law served as a guide for the Israelites' relationship with God and with each other. It is foundational to understanding the covenant between God and His people, emphasizing obedience and holiness.<p><b>from beginning to end</b><br>This phrase indicates the comprehensive nature of the law, covering all aspects necessary for the life and governance of the Israelite community. It suggests completeness and thoroughness, ensuring that nothing was omitted. This mirrors the biblical theme of God&#8217;s word being complete and sufficient for guidance, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Moses is the leader of the Israelites and the one who received the Law from God.

This was the finishing of the writing of the Book of the Law, and the committing it finally to the priests, to be by them placed by the ark of the covenant, that it might be kept for all future generations as a witness against the people, whose apostasy and rebellion were foreseen. Whether this section is to be regarded as wholly written by Moses himself, or as an appendix to his writing added by some other writer, has been made matter of question. It is quite possible, however, that Moses himself, ere he laid down the pen, may have recorded what he said when delivering the Book of the Law to the priests, and there is nothing in the manner or style of the record to render it probable that it was added by another. What follows from ver. 30 to the end of the book was probably added to the writing of Moses by some one after his death, though, of course, both the song in <a href="/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>, and the blessing in <a href="/deuteronomy/33.htm">Deuteronomy 33</a>, are the composition of Moses (see Introduction, &sect;
