It was where elders and judges sat to hear cases and render decisions (<a href="/ruth/4.htm">Ruth 4:1-2</a>, <a href="/proverbs/31-23.htm">Proverbs 31:23</a>). Taking the accused to the city gate signifies a public trial and execution, emphasizing the communal aspect of justice and the importance of maintaining societal order.<p><b>and stone them to death</b><br>Stoning was a common form of capital punishment in ancient Israel, prescribed for various offenses (<a href="/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>, <a href="/numbers/15-35.htm">Numbers 15:35</a>). It was a communal act, involving the participation of the community, which served as both a deterrent and a means of purging evil. This method of execution underscores the seriousness of the crime and the collective responsibility of the community to uphold God's laws.<p><b>the young woman because she did not cry out in the city</b><br>The expectation for the young woman to cry out implies that the incident occurred in a populated area where help could be sought. This reflects the cultural context where a lack of protest was interpreted as complicity. The assumption is that if she did not cry out, she was consenting to the act, thus sharing in the guilt. This highlights the importance of personal responsibility and the expectation of moral behavior in the community.<p><b>and the man because he has violated his neighbor&#8217;s wife</b><br>The phrase "violated his neighbor&#8217;s wife" indicates the gravity of adultery, which was considered a severe breach of trust and covenant (<a href="/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>). In biblical terms, marriage is a sacred institution, and adultery is seen as not only a sin against the individuals involved but also against God (<a href="/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14-16</a>). This reflects the high value placed on marital fidelity and the protection of family integrity.<p><b>So you must purge the evil from among you</b><br>This command to "purge the evil" is a recurring theme in Deuteronomy (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5, 17</a>:7). It emphasizes the need for the community to actively remove sin to maintain holiness and prevent the spread of corruption. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where obedience to God's laws is essential for the community's well-being and continued blessing. The concept of purging evil can also be seen as a type of Christ, who ultimately purges sin through His sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_young_woman.htm">The Young Woman</a></b><br>In this context, she is engaged to be married, and her actions are under scrutiny for not crying out for help, which implies consent in the cultural context of the time.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man</a></b><br>He is accused of violating the young woman, which is considered an act of adultery since she is pledged to another man.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city_gate.htm">The City Gate</a></b><br>This is the place of judgment and public assembly in ancient Israelite society, where legal matters were often addressed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_act_of_stoning.htm">The Act of Stoning</a></b><br>A form of capital punishment used in ancient Israel to purge evil from the community, emphasizing the seriousness of the offense.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_community.htm">The Community</a></b><br>The broader society is involved in maintaining moral and legal order, highlighting communal responsibility in upholding God's laws.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_context.htm">Understanding Context</a></b><br>Recognize the cultural and historical context of ancient Israelite law, which aimed to maintain social order and purity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>This passage underscores the gravity of sexual immorality and the importance of faithfulness in relationships.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_responsibility.htm">Community Responsibility</a></b><br>The involvement of the community in executing judgment highlights the collective responsibility to uphold God's standards.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_mercy.htm">The Role of Mercy</a></b><br>While the law is strict, the New Testament introduces the concept of grace and forgiveness, encouraging believers to seek a balance between justice and mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_integrity.htm">Personal Integrity</a></b><br>Reflect on personal actions and thoughts, striving for purity and faithfulness in all relationships, as taught by Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_22_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 22:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_22_24_Communal_role_in_justice.htm">How does Deuteronomy 22:24 emphasize the importance of communal responsibility in justice?

Points to note:<p>&#8226; Marriage is covenantal, not merely contractual. Violating it attacks God&#8217;s design (<a href="/matthew/19-4.htm">Matthew 19:4&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Male responsibility is emphasized: his greater physical power could be misused; the law makes him equally accountable (<a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So you must purge the evil from among you</b><p>This refrain appears throughout Deuteronomy (e.g., 13:5; 19:19) and is later applied to church discipline (<a href="/1_corinthians/5-13.htm">1 Corinthians 5:13</a>). God&#8217;s purposes:<p>&#8226; Preserve holiness&#8212;Israel was called to be distinct (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Protect the vulnerable&#8212;removing offenders shields others from harm.<p>&#8226; Promote fear of sin&#8212;healthy reverence curbs rebellion (<a href="/acts/5-11.htm">Acts 5:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/22-24.htm">Deuteronomy 22:24</a> shows God&#8217;s unwavering commitment to marital faithfulness, personal responsibility, and communal purity. By demanding public, decisive judgment, the Lord protected victims, deterred sin, and upheld the sanctity of marriage. Though believers today are not under Israel&#8217;s civil code, the passage still calls us to honor marriage, flee sexual immorality, and maintain holiness within the covenant community.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/22-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">you must take both</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1436;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;n&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - mdc &#124;
