In the ancient Near Eastern context, servitude was often a means of survival for the impoverished. The law in Deuteronomy reflects God's concern for justice and compassion, ensuring that servitude does not become a permanent state. The command to not view this release as a hardship emphasizes the importance of generosity and trust in God's provision. This principle echoes the broader biblical theme of liberation, as seen in the Exodus narrative, where God freed the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.<p><b>because his six years of service were worth twice the wages of a hired hand</b><br>This phrase highlights the economic value of the servant's labor, which was significant and beneficial to the master. The comparison to a hired hand suggests that the servant's work was more dedicated and valuable, possibly due to the longer-term relationship and commitment. This underscores the fairness and justice in compensating the servant adequately, reflecting God's equitable standards. The six-year period also aligns with the sabbatical cycle, a time of rest and release, pointing to God's rhythm of work and rest for His people.<p><b>And the LORD your God will bless you in all you do</b><br>This promise of blessing is contingent upon obedience to God's commands, a recurring theme in Deuteronomy. The assurance of divine blessing for releasing servants reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience leads to prosperity and well-being. This principle is consistent with the broader biblical narrative, where God's blessings are often linked to faithfulness and righteousness. The promise also foreshadows the ultimate blessing found in Jesus Christ, who came to set captives free and offer abundant life to those who follow Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>- The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>- The chosen people of God, receiving the laws and commandments as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants.htm">Servants</a></b><br>- Individuals who served their masters for six years and were to be set free in the seventh year.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>- The covenant God of Israel, who promises blessings for obedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>- The land of Canaan, which the Israelites are preparing to enter and settle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_service.htm">Value of Service</a></b><br>Recognize the worth and dignity of every individual's labor.
