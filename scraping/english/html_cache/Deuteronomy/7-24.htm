The handing over of kings signifies a complete transfer of power and authority, which is a recurring theme in the conquest narratives of the Old Testament. This divine intervention is reminiscent of God's promise to Abraham in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>, where He assures the land to his descendants. The kings represent the leadership and strength of the Canaanite nations, and their defeat symbolizes the dismantling of opposition to God's plan. Historically, the defeat of kings was a significant event, as it often led to the collapse of entire cities or regions.<p><b>and you will wipe out their names from under heaven</b><br>The phrase "wipe out their names" indicates a total obliteration of memory and legacy, which was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern warfare. This was not merely a physical destruction but also a cultural and historical erasure, ensuring that the defeated nations would not rise again. This concept is echoed in <a href="/psalms/9-5.htm">Psalm 9:5-6</a>, where God is praised for rebuking nations and blotting out their names forever. Theologically, this reflects the judgment of God against idolatry and sin, as the Canaanite nations were known for practices that were abominable to the Lord.<p><b>No one will be able to stand against you</b><br>This assurance of victory is a promise of divine protection and empowerment. It echoes the earlier assurances given to Joshua in <a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>, where God promises that no man will be able to stand before him all the days of his life. This phrase underscores the theme of God's faithfulness to His covenant people, providing them with the strength and courage needed to fulfill His commands. It also serves as a reminder of the spiritual battles believers face, where reliance on God's power is essential for overcoming opposition.<p><b>you will annihilate them</b><br>The term "annihilate" conveys the completeness of the destruction that the Israelites were to bring upon the Canaanite nations. This was part of the divine mandate to purify the land from idolatry and moral corruption, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16-18</a>. Theologically, this can be seen as a type of final judgment, prefiguring the ultimate defeat of evil. It also points to the seriousness with which God views sin and the lengths to which He will go to establish His holiness among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being prepared to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanite_kings.htm">Canaanite Kings</a></b><br>The rulers of the nations inhabiting the Promised Land, who are to be defeated by the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, delivering God's commands and promises to the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who promises victory and deliverance to His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_victory.htm">God's Sovereignty in Victory</a></b><br>Recognize that ultimate victory comes from God, not human strength or strategy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>Trust in the promises of God, even when facing seemingly insurmountable challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Understand that the battles we face are not just physical but spiritual, requiring reliance on God's power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eradicating_sin.htm">Eradicating Sin</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites were to remove the Canaanites, we are called to remove sin from our lives completely.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Reflect on God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises, encouraging us to remain faithful in our walk with Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_7_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 7:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_7_24_God_s_victory_promise.htm">How does Deuteronomy 7:24 demonstrate God's promise of victory over enemies?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lesson_on_God_s_judgment_on_idolatry.htm">What does "wipe out their names" teach about God's judgment on idolatry?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_complete_victory_in_spirit.htm">How can we apply the principle of complete victory in spiritual battles today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Deut_7_24_to_God_s_promises_in_Joshua.htm">What connections exist between Deuteronomy 7:24 and God's promises in Joshua?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_this_verse_inspire_trust_in_God_4.htm">How does this verse encourage trust in God's power and faithfulness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Deuteronomy_7_24_and_a_loving_God.htm">How does Deuteronomy 7:24 align with the concept of a loving God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_Deuteronomy_7_24_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in Deuteronomy 7:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Interpret_Deut_7_24_s_command_to_destroy.htm">How should Christians interpret the command to destroy nations in Deuteronomy 7:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_7.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_good_things_should_you_cling_to.htm">Who was Agag in the Bible's narrative?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_about_eunuchs.htm">What does the Bible say about eunuchs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_does_hosea_1_6-9_align_with_deut._24_16.htm">How does Hosea 1:6-9 align with a just God punishing children for their parents' actions, contrary to Deuteronomy 24:16?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/bible_books'_order.htm">What is the order of the Bible's books?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Deuteronomy 7:24 Mean</div><b>He will hand their kings over to you</b><p>&#8226; The promise begins with God&#8217;s active role. Israel is not left to its own devices; victory is granted by the Lord Himself, much like Joshua later experienced when &#8220;the Lord gave all their enemies into their hands&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/21-44.htm">Joshua 21:44</a>).<p>&#8226; Kings symbolize the highest earthly authority of the nations in Canaan. By handing them over, God shows His supremacy over every human power (<a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>).<p>&#8226; This assurance echoes earlier deliverances&#8212;Pharaoh in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>) and Sihon and Og east of the Jordan (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-2.htm">Deuteronomy 3:2&#8211;3</a>). Each prior triumph builds confidence that the same God will keep this word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you will wipe out their names from under heaven</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Wipe out&#8221; speaks of complete removal, not partial defeat. In ancient culture a name represented identity, legacy, and influence. Erasing it meant total extinction of a nation&#8217;s memory (<a href="/psalms/9-5.htm">Psalm 9:5</a>; 109:13).<p>&#8226; God had already pledged to blot out Amalek&#8217;s remembrance (<a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14</a>). Here He broadens the scope to all Canaanite kings, ensuring that pagan idolatry could not re-establish itself among His people.<p>&#8226; For believers today, the principle carries forward in Christ&#8217;s victory over sin and death&#8212;our old record is wiped clean (<a href="/colossians/2-14.htm">Colossians 2:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>No one will be able to stand against you</b><p>&#8226; The promise of invincibility echoes God&#8217;s word to Joshua: &#8220;No one shall be able to stand against you all the days of your life&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; It confirms that the outcome does not depend on Israel&#8217;s size or skill; it rests on covenant faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-12.htm">Deuteronomy 7:12&#8211;15</a>). When they obeyed, even fortified cities fell (<a href="/bsb/joshua/6.htm">Joshua 6</a>), but when they sinned, tiny Ai prevailed (<a href="/bsb/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, this foreshadows the believer&#8217;s security: &#8220;If God is for us, who can be against us?&#8221; (<a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>; cf. <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you will annihilate them</b><p>&#8226; The final phrase reiterates total conquest (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Deuteronomy 20:16&#8211;18</a>). God is safeguarding Israel from the corrupting practices of Canaan&#8212;child sacrifice, cult prostitution, and idolatry&#8212;which would otherwise lure the nation away (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-29.htm">Deuteronomy 12:29&#8211;31</a>).<p>&#8226; Annihilation was judicial, not capricious. God had given the Amorites centuries to repent (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>); judgment now fell.<p>&#8226; In the New Covenant the warfare is spiritual, yet the language of total defeat applies: &#8220;The weapons of our warfare&#8230; demolish strongholds&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/10-4.htm">2 Corinthians 10:4&#8211;5</a>). Complete obedience still matters.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/7-24.htm">Deuteronomy 7:24</a> underscores God&#8217;s absolute commitment to deliver His people, erase hostile powers, guarantee victory, and secure a holy future for Israel. Each phrase layers certainty on certainty: God grants the triumph, ensures the enemy&#8217;s memory is erased, removes any possibility of resistance, and commands total conquest. For believers, the verse magnifies divine faithfulness and invites wholehearted trust in the God who still overcomes every foe that threatens His redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">He shall deliver their kings into thine hand.</span>--In the summary of Joshua's conquest (Joshua 12) the kings are reckoned for the cities.
