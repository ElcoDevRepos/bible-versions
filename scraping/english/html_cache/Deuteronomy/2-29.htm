This area is characterized by its rugged terrain and was historically significant as a trade route. The Edomites were related to the Israelites, as Esau was Jacob's brother. Despite their kinship, the relationship between Israel and Edom was often strained. In this context, the Israelites were allowed passage through Edom, which reflects a temporary cooperation between the two nations. This cooperation is significant as it demonstrates a moment of peace and mutual respect, despite their historical conflicts.<p><b>and the Moabites who live in Ar</b><br>The Moabites, descendants of Lot, lived in the region of Moab, east of the Dead Sea. Ar was a significant city within Moab. The Moabites, like the Edomites, were related to the Israelites, as Lot was Abraham's nephew. The Israelites' passage through Moabite territory without conflict indicates a diplomatic relationship at this time. This cooperation is noteworthy given the later hostilities between Israel and Moab, as seen in other biblical accounts. The Moabites' willingness to allow passage may have been influenced by their recognition of Israel's divine mandate and the power of their God.<p><b>did for us,</b><br>This phrase highlights the assistance or at least the non-hostility shown by the Edomites and Moabites. It underscores the importance of peaceful passage for the Israelites on their journey to the Promised Land. This cooperation can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would be blessed and would be a blessing to others. It also reflects the broader theme of God's providence and guidance in the Israelites' journey.<p><b>until we cross the Jordan</b><br>The crossing of the Jordan River represents a significant transition for the Israelites, marking the end of their wilderness wanderings and the beginning of their conquest of Canaan. The Jordan River served as a natural boundary and a symbolic barrier between the wilderness and the Promised Land. This crossing is later detailed in the book of Joshua, where it is marked by a miraculous event, reminiscent of the crossing of the Red Sea. The Jordan River thus becomes a symbol of God's faithfulness and the fulfillment of His promises.<p><b>into the land that the LORD our God is giving us.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine origin of the Israelites' claim to the land of Canaan. It is not merely a territorial acquisition but a fulfillment of God's covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The land is described as a gift from God, underscoring the idea of divine grace and favor. This promise is central to the identity and mission of Israel as God's chosen people. The land is not just a physical inheritance but also a place where Israel is to live out its covenant relationship with God, serving as a light to the nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/descendants_of_esau.htm">Descendants of Esau</a></b><br>Also known as the Edomites, they were the descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother.

Moses recalls that when Israel skirted Edom, the territory of Esau&#8217;s descendants, they were granted peaceful passage and even traded for provisions (<a href="/numbers/20-17.htm">Numbers 20:17&#8211;19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; This sets a precedent: if blood relatives who do not share Israel&#8217;s covenant could show courtesy, surely Sihon the Amorite (vv. 26&#8211;30) should do the same.<p>&#8226; The reference reinforces God&#8217;s earlier promise to Jacob&#8217;s brother Esau that he, too, would become a nation with land of his own (<a href="/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8</a>). Israel honors that divine allotment by not seizing Seir (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-5.htm">Deuteronomy 2:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the Moabites who live in Ar did for us</b><p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s journey next brushed the border of Moab, and again God forbade aggression (<a href="/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The Moabites &#8220;did for us&#8221; what Edom had done: allowed safe passage and commerce (<a href="/numbers/21-13.htm">Numbers 21:13, 26</a>).<p>&#8226; These examples highlight God&#8217;s orderly distribution of territories: Edom for Esau, Ar for Moab, Canaan for Israel. Respecting those borders underscores obedience and trust in God&#8217;s timetable (<a href="/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Until we cross the Jordan</b><p>&#8226; The phrase puts a firm time limit on Israel&#8217;s dependence on foreign hospitality. Their wilderness detours were temporary; God&#8217;s goal always pointed east-to-west across the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/1-2.htm">Joshua 1:2</a>).<p>&#8226; It also reminds the listeners&#8212;now poised at the Jordan&#8212;that God&#8217;s promises outlast delays (<a href="/hebrews/10-36.htm">Hebrews 10:36</a>). The same Lord who provided passage through Edom and Moab will open the river itself (<a href="/joshua/3-14.htm">Joshua 3:14-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Into the land that the LORD our God is giving us</b><p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;is giving&#8221; is present tense, stressing certainty.

Their obedience in respecting others&#8217; allotments is a prerequisite for enjoying their own (<a href="/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/2-29.htm">Deuteronomy 2:29</a> reminds Israel that just as Edom and Moab honored God&#8217;s territorial assignments and gave Israel safe passage, so the Amorites should have done.
