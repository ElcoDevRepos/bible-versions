In the ancient Near Eastern context, a woman's identity and security were closely tied to her husband's household. The act of leaving signifies a formal separation, which was legally recognized in Israelite society. The Mosaic Law provided regulations for divorce, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/24.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>, to protect the rights of the woman and ensure she was not treated unjustly.<p><b>she goes and becomes another man&#8217;s wife,</b><br>This indicates the woman's remarriage to another man after her divorce. In the cultural and historical context of ancient Israel, remarriage was a common practice for divorced women, as it provided them with social and economic stability. The law acknowledged the reality of remarriage and sought to regulate it to prevent exploitation or abuse. This provision also highlights the importance of marriage as a covenant relationship, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture. In the New Testament, Jesus addresses the issue of divorce and remarriage, emphasizing the sanctity and permanence of marriage (<a href="/matthew/19-3.htm">Matthew 19:3-9</a>). The concept of remarriage can also be seen as a type of the Church, the bride of Christ, being united with Him after being separated from the bondage of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The audience receiving the law, God's chosen people, preparing to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/divorce.htm">Divorce</a></b><br>The event or situation being addressed, specifically the remarriage of a divorced woman.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The destination of the Israelites, where they are to live according to God's laws.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage.htm">Marriage</a></b><br>The covenant relationship being regulated by the law, emphasizing its sanctity and order.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_context_of_the_law.htm">Understanding the Context of the Law</a></b><br>The law in <a href="/deuteronomy/24-2.htm">Deuteronomy 24:2</a> was given to regulate and manage the social implications of divorce, not to endorse it.

Jesus later points to this concession and explains it was &#8220;because of your hardness of heart&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8</a>), showing that even lawful steps may expose human sinfulness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> reminds us that God&#8217;s original design was lifelong union; every &#8220;if&#8221; about divorce is therefore an accommodation, not the ideal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>after leaving his house</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Leaving&#8221; underscores that the marriage bond has truly been severed&#8212;she is no longer under her first husband&#8217;s roof, name, or protection (<a href="/jeremiah/3-8.htm">Jeremiah 3:8</a> pictures God giving faithless Israel &#8220;her certificate of divorce&#8221; and sending her away).<p>&#8226; The law protects the woman from being treated as property that can be reclaimed at will; once she departs with her certificate, her first husband no longer has authority over her (compare <a href="/1_corinthians/7-10.htm">1 Corinthians 7:10&#8211;11</a>, which acknowledges separation but calls believers to honor God in every circumstance).<p>&#8226; This clause also warns the husband that divorce has irreversible consequences. He cannot later change his mind without harming her new life or God&#8217;s order.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>she goes and becomes</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Goes&#8221; highlights personal agency&#8212;she is not kidnapped or sold; she chooses a new household. &#8220;Becomes&#8221; signals a full covenant change, not a casual relationship (<a href="/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2&#8211;3</a> notes that a married woman is &#8220;bound by law to her husband while he lives,&#8221; but if he dies&#8212;or, by extension here, if the bond is legitimately broken&#8212;she is &#8220;released from the law of marriage&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The wording guards against any idea that remarriage after a legitimate divorce is adulterous in itself; sin enters only when God&#8217;s boundaries are ignored (<a href="/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a> warns that illegitimate divorce &#8220;makes her commit adultery,&#8221; implying that a lawful certificate changes the moral calculus).<p>&#8226; Practically, the law assumes remarriage will occur. God therefore regulates it so that all parties&#8212;first husband, woman, and new husband&#8212;know where they stand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>another man&#8217;s wife</b><p>&#8226; Once she remarries, she is entirely &#8220;another man&#8217;s wife.&#8221; That covenant is now exclusive and must be honored (<a href="/mark/10-11.htm">Mark 10:11&#8211;12</a> affirms that remarriage forms a new one-flesh union).<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/24-3.htm">Deuteronomy 24:3&#8211;4</a> immediately adds that the first husband may never take her back, calling such a return &#8220;detestable before the LORD.&#8221; The new marriage is not a lesser bond; breaking it would multiply wrongs.<p>&#8226; This protects the woman from being bounced between men and guards the sanctity of every subsequent marriage (<a href="/malachi/2-16.htm">Malachi 2:16</a>, &#8220;For I hate divorce,&#8221; reminds us why God sets firm boundaries).<p>&#8226; The verse therefore elevates marriage, discourages hasty divorce, and upholds societal order by making every covenant accountable before God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/24-2.htm">Deuteronomy 24:2</a> teaches that when a properly divorced woman remarries, her new union is real, binding, and protected by God&#8217;s law. The first marriage is over; her status, responsibilities, and loyalties now belong wholly to her second husband. By spelling this out, Scripture underscores the permanence God intends for every covenant and warns against treating marriage casually. The verse highlights both God&#8217;s mercy&#8212;providing orderly guidelines in a fallen world&#8212;and His unwavering commitment to the sanctity of marriage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/24-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">If, after leaving</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1510;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3318.htm">Strong's 3318: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, bring, out, direct and proxim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his house,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1461;&#1497;&#1514;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(mib&#183;b&#234;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1004.htm">Strong's 1004: </a> </span><span class="str2">A house</span><br /><br /><span class="word">she goes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and becomes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1456;&#1514;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#601;&#183;&#7791;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive perfect - third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">another</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1461;&#1469;&#1512;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_312.htm">Strong's 312: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hinder, next, other</span><br /><br /><span class="word">man&#8217;s wife,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#353;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/deuteronomy/24-2.htm">Deuteronomy 24:2 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/deuteronomy/24-2.htm">Deuteronomy 24:2 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/deuteronomy/24-2.htm">Deuteronomy 24:2 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/deuteronomy/24-2.htm">Deuteronomy 24:2 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/deuteronomy/24-2.htm">Deuteronomy 24:2 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/deuteronomy/24-2.htm">Deuteronomy 24:2  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/deuteronomy/24-2.htm">Deuteronomy 24:2 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/deuteronomy/24-2.htm">Deuteronomy 24:2 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/deuteronomy/24-2.htm">Deuteronomy 24:2 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/deuteronomy/24-2.htm">Deuteronomy 24:2 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/deuteronomy/24-2.htm">OT Law: Deuteronomy 24:2 When she is departed out of his (Deut.
