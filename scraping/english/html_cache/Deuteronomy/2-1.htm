After their initial refusal to enter the Promised Land due to fear and lack of faith, God commanded them to turn back into the wilderness. This turning back symbolizes a period of discipline and preparation, as God was not yet ready to lead them into Canaan due to their disobedience.<p><b>and headed for the wilderness by way of the Red Sea</b><br>The wilderness journey by the way of the Red Sea refers to the Israelites' movement southward, away from the Promised Land. The Red Sea, or Yam Suph, is significant as it was the site of God's miraculous deliverance of Israel from Egypt. This journey back into the wilderness represents a return to a place of testing and reliance on God, echoing their earlier experiences of God's provision and guidance.<p><b>as the LORD had instructed me</b><br>This highlights Moses' obedience to God's command. Despite the people's rebellion, Moses remained faithful to God's instructions. It underscores the importance of leadership that adheres to divine guidance, even when the path is difficult or seems regressive. This obedience is a recurring theme in Moses' leadership and is a model for faithfulness.<p><b>and for many days we wandered around Mount Seir</b><br>Mount Seir is the mountainous region inhabited by the Edomites, descendants of Esau. The wandering around Mount Seir signifies a prolonged period of waiting and testing. This time was necessary for the older generation to pass away and for a new generation to rise, one that would trust in God's promises. The wandering also serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the patience required in God's timing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is recounting their journey and the instructions given by God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who are journeying through the wilderness after their exodus from Egypt.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert area where the Israelites wandered for 40 years due to their disobedience and lack of faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/red_sea.htm">Red Sea</a></b><br>The body of water that the Israelites crossed miraculously during their exodus from Egypt.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hill_country_of_seir.htm">Hill Country of Seir</a></b><br>The region associated with the descendants of Esau, where the Israelites wandered.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_instructions.htm">Obedience to God's Instructions</a></b><br>The Israelites' journey was directed by God, emphasizing the importance of following His guidance even when the path seems difficult or unclear.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disobedience.htm">Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The wandering in the wilderness serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and lack of faith in God's promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness_in_difficult_times.htm">God's Faithfulness in Difficult Times</a></b><br>Despite the Israelites' failures, God remained faithful, providing for their needs and guiding them toward the Promised Land.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_journey_and_growth.htm">Spiritual Journey and Growth</a></b><br>The physical journey of the Israelites mirrors our spiritual journey, where challenges and detours can lead to growth and deeper reliance on God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>The extended period in the wilderness teaches us to trust in God's timing and His plans, which are often beyond our understanding.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_2_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 2:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_2_1_God_s_guidance_in_life.htm">How does Deuteronomy 2:1 illustrate God's guidance in our life's journey?

At this point the language of address is exchanged for that of narrative. The change of subject from "ye abode" to "we turned," became necessary when Moses passed from exhorting and warning the people to narrating what happened after they resumed their journeyings; and gives no support to the notion of some recent German critics, that Moses left Kadesh with only a portion of the people, while the rest remained there, so that no entire departure of Israel from Kadesh ever took place - a notion which the whole tenor of the subsequent narrative contradicts. In obedience to the Divine command (<a href="/deuteronomy/1-40.htm">Deuteronomy 1:40</a>), the people, after tarrying for a while at Kadesh, took their departure and marched in the direction of the Yam-suph (<a href="/numbers/14-25.htm">Numbers 14:25</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And we compassed mount Seir many days.</span> These "many days" are the thirty-eight years during which the people wandered in the wilderness before they camped the second time at Kadesh; their going round Mount Seir, which was in Edom (<a href="/genesis/36-8.htm">Genesis 36:8, 9, 20</a>), is descriptive of their nomadic wanderings in various directions, west, south, and south-east of that mountain (<a href="/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>). "Crossing the long, lofty mountain chain to the eastward of Ezion-geber (<a href="/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4, 5</a>), the Israelites issued into the great and elevated plains which are still traversed by the Syrian pilgrims on their way to Mecca; and appear to have followed <span class="accented">northward</span> nearly the same route which is now taken by the Syrian Hadgi along the western skirts of this great desert near the mountains of Edom" (Robinson, 'Bib. Res.,' 1:253, 559). Mount Seir is now <span class="accented">Jebal</span> and <span class="accented">esh-Sherah</span>. This mountain range is a continuation of that which surrounds the eastern side of the Dead Sea. The details of this protracted wandering are passed over by Moses as not required by his purpose here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/2-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then we turned back</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1436;&#1508;&#1462;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(wan&#183;n&#234;&#183;p&#772;en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
