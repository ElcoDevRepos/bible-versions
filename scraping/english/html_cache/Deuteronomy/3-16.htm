These tribes requested land on the east side of the Jordan River because it was suitable for their large herds and flocks. This request is detailed in <a href="/numbers/32.htm">Numbers 32</a>, where Moses initially hesitated but later agreed after they promised to help the other tribes conquer the land west of the Jordan.<p><b>I gave the territory from Gilead</b><br>Gilead is a mountainous region east of the Jordan River, known for its balm, a healing ointment mentioned in <a href="/jeremiah/8-22.htm">Jeremiah 8:22</a>. It was a fertile area, ideal for grazing, which made it attractive to the Reubenites and Gadites. Gilead's strategic location also served as a buffer zone against eastern invaders.<p><b>to the Arnon Valley (the middle of the valley was the border)</b><br>The Arnon Valley, or Wadi Mujib, is a significant geographical feature that served as a natural boundary. It separated the territory of the Amorites from Moab, as noted in <a href="/numbers/21-13.htm">Numbers 21:13</a>. The middle of the valley being the border indicates a clear demarcation line, which was important for maintaining peace and order between neighboring tribes and nations.<p><b>and up to the Jabbok River</b><br>The Jabbok River, now known as the Zarqa River, was another important boundary marker. It flows into the Jordan River and was the site where Jacob wrestled with God in <a href="/genesis/32-22.htm">Genesis 32:22-32</a>, a pivotal moment in biblical history. This river marked the northern boundary of the land given to the Reubenites and Gadites.<p><b>the border of the Ammonites</b><br>The Ammonites were descendants of Lot, Abraham's nephew, and often in conflict with Israel. The border with the Ammonites was significant because it marked the extent of Israelite territory and served as a point of tension and conflict, as seen in <a href="/judges/11.htm">Judges 11</a> when Jephthah negotiated with the Ammonites. This border also highlights the fulfillment of God's promise to give Israel a land of their own, despite the presence of other nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/reubenites_and_gadites.htm">Reubenites and Gadites</a></b><br>These are two of the twelve tribes of Israel.
