The tithe was an acknowledgment of God's provision and ownership over all things. Grain, wine, and oil were staples of the ancient Near Eastern diet, symbolizing sustenance and blessing. The firstborn of herds and flocks were considered especially significant, representing the best and the first of what God had provided. This practice reinforced the principle of giving God the first and best of one's resources, a theme echoed in <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9-10</a>.<p><b>in the presence of the LORD your God</b><br>This indicates that the act of consuming the tithe was not merely a physical act but a spiritual one, performed in the presence of God. It was a communal and sacred event, emphasizing the relationship between the Israelites and their God. The presence of the LORD signifies His holiness and the importance of worship being directed towards Him. This concept is further developed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to do all things as unto the Lord (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23</a>).<p><b>at the place He will choose as a dwelling for His Name</b><br>This phrase refers to the centralization of worship, which would later be established in Jerusalem with the building of the Temple. The "place He will choose" underscores God's sovereignty in determining where He would be worshiped. This central place of worship was a unifying factor for the nation of Israel and a precursor to the idea of the Church as the dwelling place of God (<a href="/ephesians/2-19.htm">Ephesians 2:19-22</a>). The concept of God's name dwelling in a specific place highlights His desire to be intimately involved with His people.<p><b>so that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always</b><br>The purpose of the tithe and the act of worship was to instill a reverent fear of the LORD. This fear is not about being afraid but about having a deep respect and awe for God's holiness and authority. It is a foundational principle for wisdom and obedience (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The continual practice of tithing and worship was meant to cultivate a lifestyle of dependence on and reverence for God, ensuring that the Israelites remained faithful to Him. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are called to live in reverence and awe of God (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28-29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving the law as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who commands the tithe and prescribes the place of worship.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_place_he_will_choose.htm">The Place He Will Choose</a></b><br>Refers to the future central place of worship, which would later be Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tithing.htm">Tithing</a></b><br>The act of giving a tenth of one's produce and livestock as an offering to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_purpose_of_tithing.htm">The Purpose of Tithing</a></b><br>Tithing is an act of worship and obedience, acknowledging God's provision and sovereignty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/learning_to_fear_the_lord.htm">Learning to Fear the LORD</a></b><br>The practice of tithing and communal worship cultivates a reverent fear of God, reminding believers of His holiness and authority.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_centrality_of_worship.htm">The Centrality of Worship</a></b><br>Worship is not just a personal act but a communal one, centered around God's chosen place and presence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_and_blessing.htm">God's Provision and Blessing</a></b><br>Trusting God with our resources leads to spiritual growth and blessings, as we rely on His provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_heart_of_worship.htm">The Heart of Worship</a></b><br>True worship involves the heart and attitude, not just the act of giving.
