This command is part of his final address before his death and the entry of the Israelites into the Promised Land. Moses' role as a mediator of God's law is crucial, as he is seen as a type of Christ, who also mediates a new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/3.htm">Hebrews 3:1-6</a>).<p><b>At the end of every seven years</b><br>This refers to the sabbatical year, a cycle of seven years established in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25:1-7</a>). Every seventh year was a time of rest for the land and a release from debts, symbolizing God's provision and the importance of trust in His sovereignty. This cycle points to the ultimate rest found in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>).<p><b>At the appointed time in the year of remission of debt</b><br>The year of remission, or "Shemitah," was a time when debts were forgiven, reflecting God's mercy and grace. This practice ensured economic balance and social justice within the community. It foreshadows the spiritual forgiveness and release from the debt of sin through Jesus Christ (<a href="/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13-14</a>).<p><b>During the Feast of Tabernacles</b><br>The Feast of Tabernacles, or Sukkot, was one of the three major pilgrimage festivals in Israel (<a href="/leviticus/23-33.htm">Leviticus 23:33-43</a>). It commemorated the Israelites' journey through the wilderness and God's provision. This feast is prophetic of the future gathering of God's people and the establishment of His kingdom, as seen in <a href="/zechariah/14-16.htm">Zechariah 14:16-19</a>. It also symbolizes the believer's journey and reliance on God's provision, ultimately fulfilled in Christ, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the Law from God and delivered it to the people.

Believers are encouraged to trust God in their financial and personal lives, knowing He will provide for their needs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/community_and_accountability.htm">Community and Accountability</a></b><br>The public reading of the Law fosters a sense of community and accountability among the Israelites. Similarly, Christians are called to gather together, study Scripture, and hold each other accountable in their walk with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/freedom_and_release.htm">Freedom and Release</a></b><br>The year of debt cancellation symbolizes spiritual freedom and release.
