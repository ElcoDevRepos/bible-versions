The woman is characterized by her gentleness and refinement, suggesting a person of high social standing and delicate nature. In ancient Israelite society, women of such status were often shielded from harsh labor and the roughness of daily life. This description underscores the severity of the curses that would come upon Israel for disobedience, as even those who are most delicate and protected would be affected.<p><b>so gentle and refined she would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground</b><br>This hyperbolic expression emphasizes the woman's delicacy and privilege. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, walking barefoot was common, especially among the lower classes. The imagery of a woman so refined that she avoids even touching the ground with her feet paints a picture of extreme luxury and protection. This serves to heighten the contrast with the dire circumstances she will face, illustrating the total reversal of fortune that disobedience to God's covenant would bring.<p><b>will begrudge the husband she embraces</b><br>The transformation from a loving and nurturing figure to one who begrudges her husband indicates a breakdown of familial relationships due to extreme distress and desperation. In the context of the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, this reflects the societal collapse and personal turmoil that would result from Israel's disobedience. The use of the word "embraces" suggests a previous intimacy and affection, now turned to animosity, highlighting the depth of the curse's impact.<p><b>and her son and daughter</b><br>The inclusion of her children in this phrase underscores the comprehensive nature of the curse. In ancient Israelite culture, children were considered blessings and the continuation of one's lineage. The fact that a mother would begrudge her own children indicates a situation of extreme famine or siege, where survival instincts override natural affections. This is consistent with the broader context of <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, which warns of the dire consequences of turning away from God's commandments, including the breakdown of the most fundamental human relationships.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gentle_and_refined_woman.htm">Gentle and Refined Woman</a></b><br>This refers to a woman of high status and delicacy, who is typically characterized by her gentleness and sensitivity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/husband.htm">Husband</a></b><br>The man to whom the woman is married, representing familial relationships and love.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/son_or_daughter.htm">Son or Daughter</a></b><br>The children of the woman, symbolizing the next generation and familial bonds.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation to whom this warning is given, representing the collective people of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/curses_of_disobedience.htm">Curses of Disobedience</a></b><br>The broader context of <a href="/bsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's obedience or disobedience to God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The verse highlights the severe consequences of turning away from God's commandments.
