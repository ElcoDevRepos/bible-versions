The act of God writing the commandments signifies their authority and permanence. In biblical context, this underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, as seen in <a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>, where God gives Moses the tablets inscribed by His own finger. This divine authorship sets these laws apart from human legislation.<p><b>what had been written previously,</b><br>This refers to the first set of tablets that Moses broke in anger (<a href="/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19</a>) after witnessing the Israelites worshiping the golden calf. The repetition of the commandments signifies God's willingness to renew the covenant despite Israel's transgressions. It highlights God's mercy and the importance of repentance and restoration.<p><b>the Ten Commandments</b><br>These commandments are foundational to Israelite law and ethics, serving as a summary of God's expectations for His people. They are divided into duties toward God and duties toward others, reflecting the two greatest commandments Jesus mentions in <a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>. The Decalogue is central to both Jewish and Christian moral teaching.<p><b>that He had spoken to you on the mountain</b><br>This phrase recalls the theophany at Mount Sinai (Exodus 19-20), where God audibly delivered the commandments to the Israelites. The mountain is a place of divine revelation, and this event marks a pivotal moment in Israel's history, establishing them as God's chosen people with a unique covenant.<p><b>out of the fire</b><br>The fire symbolizes God's presence and holiness, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>, where Mount Sinai is enveloped in smoke because the LORD descended on it in fire. Fire often represents purification and judgment in scripture, indicating the seriousness and sanctity of the commandments.<p><b>on the day of the assembly.</b><br>This refers to the gathering of the Israelites at Mount Sinai to receive the law. The term "assembly" underscores the communal aspect of the covenant, where the entire nation is called to witness and accept God's law. It foreshadows the New Testament concept of the church as the assembly of believers.<p><b>The LORD gave them to me,</b><br>Moses acts as the mediator between God and the people, a role that prefigures Christ as the ultimate mediator of the new covenant (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>). Moses' reception of the tablets signifies the transmission of divine law to humanity, a theme that resonates throughout scripture as God continually reveals His will to His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who received the Ten Commandments from God on Mount Sinai.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The God of Israel who gave the Ten Commandments to Moses.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tablets.htm">The Tablets</a></b><br>Stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were inscribed by God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mountain.htm">The Mountain (Mount Sinai)</a></b><br>The place where God revealed Himself to Moses and gave the Law.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly.htm">The Assembly</a></b><br>Refers to the gathering of the Israelites at the base of Mount Sinai when God delivered the Ten Commandments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_permanence_of_god's_law.htm">The Permanence of God's Law</a></b><br>The fact that God wrote the commandments on stone signifies their enduring nature and importance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_initiative_in_revelation.htm">God's Initiative in Revelation</a></b><br>God Himself inscribed the commandments, showing His active role in revealing His will to humanity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_mediators.htm">The Role of Mediators</a></b><br>Moses acted as a mediator between God and the people, prefiguring Christ as the ultimate mediator.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>The giving of the Law underscores the necessity of obedience to God's commands as a response to His covenant love.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_assembly_as_a_community_of_faith.htm">The Assembly as a Community of Faith</a></b><br>The gathering of the Israelites at Sinai reflects the communal aspect of faith, where God's people are called to live out His commandments together.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_10_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 10:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deuteronomy_10_4_s_commandment_focus.htm">How does Deuteronomy 10:4 emphasize the importance of God's commandments in our lives?
