This phrase emphasizes the importance of recognizing the rights of the firstborn, regardless of the father's personal feelings towards the child's mother. The context here is a polygamous society where a man might have multiple wives, and favoritism could lead to disputes over inheritance. This law ensures justice and fairness, reflecting God's impartiality and the importance of upholding covenantal responsibilities. The situation mirrors the story of Jacob, Leah, and Rachel, where personal affections complicated family dynamics.<p><b>by giving him a double portion of all that he has.</b><br>The double portion signifies the inheritance rights of the firstborn, which included a larger share of the father's estate. This was not only a material benefit but also a symbolic gesture of leadership and responsibility within the family. The double portion is a theme seen elsewhere in Scripture, such as in the story of Elisha receiving a double portion of Elijah's spirit (<a href="/2_kings/2-9.htm">2 Kings 2:9</a>). It underscores the idea of blessing and the passing on of spiritual and material legacy.<p><b>For that son is the firstfruits of his father&#8217;s strength;</b><br>The term "firstfruits" is significant in biblical language, often used to describe the first and best of the harvest offered to God (<a href="/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a>). Here, it symbolizes the first and best of a man's offspring, representing his vigor and the continuation of his lineage. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where Christ is referred to as the "firstfruits" of those who have fallen asleep (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>), indicating His preeminence and the promise of resurrection for believers.<p><b>the right of the firstborn belongs to him.</b><br>This phrase reaffirms the legal and cultural rights of the firstborn son, which were deeply embedded in the societal structure of ancient Israel. The firstborn's rights were protected by law to prevent favoritism and ensure the orderly transfer of family leadership and property. This principle is seen in the story of Esau and Jacob, where the birthright and blessing were central themes (<a href="/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29-34</a>). The concept of the firstborn also points to Christ, who is described as the "firstborn over all creation" (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>), highlighting His authority and
