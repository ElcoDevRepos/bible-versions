In the context of ancient warfare, such a feat would be impossible without divine intervention. The imagery recalls the blessings promised in <a href="/leviticus/26-8.htm">Leviticus 26:8</a>, where God assures Israel that five of them will chase a hundred, and a hundred will chase ten thousand. This hyperbolic language emphasizes God's power working through His people.<p><b>or two put ten thousand to flight,</b><br>The escalation from one to two men suggests exponential divine empowerment. This reflects the principle found in <a href="/ecclesiastes/4-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a>, where two are stronger than one. The phrase underscores the idea that when God is with His people, their strength is multiplied beyond natural capabilities. It also serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience leads to divine favor and protection.<p><b>unless their Rock had sold them,</b><br>The term "Rock" is a metaphor for God, symbolizing strength, stability, and faithfulness. In <a href="/deuteronomy/32.htm">Deuteronomy 32</a>, God is contrasted with the false gods of the nations. The idea of God "selling" His people implies a judicial act of giving them over to their enemies due to their disobedience, as seen in <a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>. This reflects the covenant curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where turning away from God results in defeat and subjugation.<p><b>unless the LORD had given them up?</b><br>This phrase indicates God's sovereign control over the fate of nations. The LORD's decision to "give them up" is a response to Israel's unfaithfulness, as seen throughout the book of Judges. It serves as a warning that security and victory are contingent upon faithfulness to God. This concept is echoed in <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>, where God gives people over to their desires as a consequence of their rejection of Him. The passage ultimately points to the necessity of reliance on God for true success and protection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering his final song to the Israelites before his death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, to whom Moses is speaking, reminding them of God's power and their dependence on Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rock.htm">The Rock</a></b><br>A metaphor for God, symbolizing strength, stability, and protection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemies_of_israel.htm">Enemies of Israel</a></b><br>The nations that opposed Israel, whom God allowed to overpower them due to their disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is sovereign over the fate of nations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>The verse highlights the futility of human strength without God's support.

Israel&#8217;s true danger is never the enemy&#8217;s power but the forfeiture of God&#8217;s shelter through persistent rebellion.<p>&#8226; Yet even here, the verse affirms God&#8217;s active governance; nothing happens by accident or by mere human strength.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>unless the LORD had given them up</b><p>&#8226; The parallel phrase reinforces that Israel&#8217;s defeat is a deliberate divine act, not random fate. <a href="/2_kings/17-20.htm">2 Kings 17:20</a> notes, &#8220;The LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel&#8230; and gave them into the hands of plunderers.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/81-12.htm">Psalm 81:12</a> laments, &#8220;So I gave them up to their stubborn hearts.&#8221; The New Testament applies the same concept morally in <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Given them up&#8221; shows God&#8217;s patience has limits; persistent refusal of His Word leads to judicial abandonment&#8212;He lifts His protective hand, and consequences rush in.<p>&#8226; Even then, His purpose remains corrective, calling the nation to repentance and return (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-1.htm">Deuteronomy 30:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a> teaches that military impossibilities&#8212;one chasing a thousand, two chasing ten thousand&#8212;become reality when the covenant-keeping God withdraws His favor. Israel&#8217;s foes succeed only because the Rock who once guaranteed victory now &#8220;sells&#8221; and &#8220;gives up&#8221; His people in response to their rebellion.
