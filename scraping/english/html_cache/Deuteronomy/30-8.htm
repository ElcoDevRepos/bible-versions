In the context of Deuteronomy, Moses is addressing the Israelites before they enter the Promised Land, reminding them of the covenant relationship with God. The "voice of the LORD" signifies divine guidance and authority, which the Israelites are called to heed. This obedience is not just a legalistic adherence but a heartfelt return to God's ways, reflecting repentance and renewal. The concept of returning to God is echoed in prophetic books like Hosea and Jeremiah, where Israel is called to return to the LORD after periods of rebellion.<p><b>and follow all His commandments</b><br>The commandments refer to the laws given by God through Moses, encompassing moral, ceremonial, and civil laws. These laws were designed to set Israel apart as a holy nation and to guide them in righteous living. The call to follow "all" His commandments underscores the comprehensive nature of God's law and the expectation of complete obedience. This reflects the covenantal relationship where blessings are contingent upon obedience. In the New Testament, Jesus summarizes the law in the commandments to love God and love one's neighbor, showing the heart of the law.<p><b>I am giving you today</b><br>This phrase highlights the immediacy and relevance of God's commandments. Moses, as the mediator of the covenant, is delivering God's law to the people at a specific moment in their history. The use of "today" emphasizes the urgency and present application of the law, urging the Israelites to commit to God's ways as they prepare to enter the land. This moment is pivotal, as it marks a transition from the wilderness wanderings to establishing a nation under God's rule. The concept of "today" is also seen in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to respond to God's call without delay, as in <a href="/hebrews/3-15.htm">Hebrews 3:15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is delivering God's commandments to the people.

The word &#8220;again&#8221; signals restoration. Earlier he wrote, &#8220;then the LORD your God will restore you from captivity and have compassion on you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3</a>). The promise is not hypothetical but certain&#8212;God will gather, forgive, and bring His people back.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Again&#8221; underscores that failure is not final (see <a href="/hosea/6-1.htm">Hosea 6:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; It anticipates a future, literal return from exile (fulfilled in part after Babylon, and ultimately in Christ; <a href="/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19-21</a>).<p>&#8226; It highlights the covenant faithfulness of God, who always leaves a path back for repentant hearts (<a href="/jeremiah/24-7.htm">Jeremiah 24:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>obey the voice of the LORD</b><p>Obedience begins with listening. Scripture consistently links hearing God&#8217;s voice with loving submission: &#8220;Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and keep My covenant&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5</a>). Abraham was blessed &#8220;because you have obeyed My voice&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/22-18.htm">Genesis 22:18</a>). Centuries later Jesus affirmed the same pattern: &#8220;My sheep listen to My voice; I know them, and they follow Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>).<p>&#8226; God speaks; His people respond.<p>&#8226; The relationship is personal&#8212;&#8220;voice,&#8221; not merely rules.<p>&#8226; True hearing produces concrete action, turning revelation into lifestyle choices (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and follow all His commandments</b><p>Restored hearts are not content with partial compliance. Moses says &#8220;all,&#8221; echoing the greatest command to love God with &#8220;all your heart&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>). Selective obedience is disobedience (<a href="/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>). Joshua later charged the tribes, &#8220;Be very careful to keep the commandment&#8230;to walk in all His ways&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/22-5.htm">Joshua 22:5</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s standard is comprehensive, covering worship, ethics, community, and personal life.<p>&#8226; The Spirit-empowered believer can joyfully pursue full obedience (<a href="/ezekiel/36-27.htm">Ezekiel 36:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Wholehearted devotion safeguards against drifting back into idolatry (<a href="/1_john/5-21.htm">1 John 5:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am giving you today</b><p>&#8220;Today&#8221; roots the command in the present moment. God&#8217;s Word is never theoretical; it calls for immediate response. Moses repeats this phrase throughout Deuteronomy (e.g., 30:11) to remind Israel that obedience is always a current obligation. The New Testament carries the same urgency: &#8220;Now is the favorable time; now is the day of salvation&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>; cf. <a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a>).<p>&#8226; God speaks into the &#8220;now,&#8221; not merely the &#8220;someday.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Delayed obedience is just disobedience postponed.<p>&#8226; Each generation hears the same living Word and must choose to act on it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/30-8.htm">Deuteronomy 30:8</a> promises that God will graciously bring His people back to a place where they once more hear Him clearly and walk in full obedience. Restoration (&#8220;again&#8221;) leads to renewed listening (&#8220;obey the voice&#8221;), which overflows into comprehensive faithfulness (&#8220;follow all His commandments&#8221;), and it all starts in the immediacy of the present (&#8220;today&#8221;). The verse is a beacon of hope and a call to present-tense, wholehearted obedience grounded in the unchanging faithfulness of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And thou shalt return and . . . do all his commandments.</span>--It is as certain as anything can be in this world that the laws of Deuteronomy have never been kept perfectly. The minute observances of the Talmudical system took the heart and spirit out of the law of Moses. Christians do not profess to obey any commandments but those which are called moral. If the Law itself is to be fulfilled, a restoration of Israel would seem to be necessary.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt return and obey</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. thou shalt again hearken (see ver. 9, where the same expression is thus rendered).
