The loud voice signifies God's power and the seriousness of the covenant being established. This event is reminiscent of other instances where God speaks directly, such as at the baptism of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>).<p><b>to your whole assembly</b><br>The entire nation of Israel was present, underscoring the communal nature of the covenant. This collective experience was meant to unify the people under God's law.

This act of writing by God Himself highlights the divine origin and authority of the commandments. The tablets are a type of Christ, who is the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>), embodying the law perfectly.<p><b>and gave them to me</b><br>Moses, as the mediator of the Old Covenant, receives the tablets, prefiguring Christ as the mediator of the New Covenant (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>).
