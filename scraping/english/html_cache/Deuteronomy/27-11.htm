It refers to the time when the Israelites were preparing to enter the Promised Land. This moment is significant as it marks a transition from the wilderness wanderings to the establishment of a nation under God's law. The phrase underscores the immediacy and urgency of the instructions that follow.<p><b>Moses commanded the people:</b><br>Moses, as the leader and prophet of Israel, acts as God's spokesperson. His role is crucial in conveying God's laws and commands to the Israelites. This command is part of a larger set of instructions given to the people as they prepare to enter Canaan. Moses' authority is rooted in his unique relationship with God, as seen throughout the Pentateuch. The act of commanding reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where obedience to God's law is paramount. Moses' leadership is a type of Christ, who also delivers God's commands and leads His people into the promised rest.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His people from Egypt and guide them through the wilderness.

For this purpose six tribes were to station themselves on Mount Gerizim, and six on Mount Ebal, the former to pronounce the blessing, the latter the curse. (On the situation of these two mountains, see at ch. Deuteronomy 11:29.) The six tribes by whom the blessing was to be pronounced were Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin, all descended from the two wives of Jacob - Leah and Rachel. The tribes by whom the curse was to be uttered were those descended from Zilpah, Leah's maid, viz. Gad and Asher; those descended from Bilhah, Rachel's maid, viz. Dan and Naphtali; with Zebulun and Reuben, both descended from Leah. As, in order to obtain a division of the tribes into two equal portions, two of the sons of Leah must be assigned to the second half, Zebulun and Reuben were chosen, probably because the former was the youngest of Leah's sons, and the latter had by his sin forfeited his birthright (<a href="/genesis/49-4.htm">Genesis 49:4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/27-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(bay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Moses</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;&#353;eh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4872.htm">Strong's 4872: </a> </span><span class="str2">Moses -- a great Israelite leader, prophet and lawgiver</span><br /><br /><span class="word">commanded</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1510;&#1463;&#1444;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#7779;aw)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Piel - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6680.htm">Strong's 6680: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lay charge (upon), give charge (to), command, order</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the people:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5971.htm">Strong's 5971: </a> </span><span class="str2">A people, a tribe, troops, attendants, a flock</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/deuteronomy/27-11.htm">Deuteronomy 27:11 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/deuteronomy/27-11.htm">Deuteronomy 27:11 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/deuteronomy/27-11.htm">Deuteronomy 27:11 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/deuteronomy/27-11.htm">Deuteronomy 27:11 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/deuteronomy/27-11.htm">Deuteronomy 27:11 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/deuteronomy/27-11.htm">Deuteronomy 27:11  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/deuteronomy/27-11.htm">Deuteronomy 27:11 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/deuteronomy/27-11.htm">Deuteronomy 27:11 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/deuteronomy/27-11.htm">Deuteronomy 27:11 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/deuteronomy/27-11.htm">Deuteronomy 27:11 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/deuteronomy/27-11.htm">OT Law: Deuteronomy 27:11 Moses commanded the people the same day (Deut.
