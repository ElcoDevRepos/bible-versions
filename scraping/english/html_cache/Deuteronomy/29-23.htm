The mention of "sulfur and salt" is reminiscent of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, where sulfur rained down from heaven (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>). The reference to salt suggests a land that is inhospitable to life, as salt can render soil infertile. This imagery serves as a warning of the consequences of disobedience to God's covenant, emphasizing the severity of divine judgment.<p><b>unsown and unproductive, with no plant growing on it</b><br>The description of the land as "unsown and unproductive" highlights the absence of agricultural activity, which was central to the livelihood of ancient Israel. The inability to grow plants signifies a curse, as fertility of the land was often seen as a blessing from God (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>). This barrenness is a direct result of the people's unfaithfulness, contrasting with the promised land "flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>).<p><b>just like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim</b><br>The comparison to Sodom and Gomorrah, along with Admah and Zeboiim, underscores the totality of the destruction. These cities were known for their wickedness and were obliterated by divine judgment (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>; <a href="/hosea/11-8.htm">Hosea 11:8</a>). The mention of these cities serves as a historical reminder of God's righteous wrath against sin and a warning to Israel to remain faithful to avoid similar destruction.<p><b>which the LORD overthrew in His fierce anger</b><br>This phrase attributes the destruction directly to the LORD, emphasizing His sovereignty and justice. The "fierce anger" of God reflects His holiness and intolerance of sin. The use of "overthrew" is significant, as it conveys a complete and decisive action, leaving no room for recovery. This serves as a sobering reminder of the seriousness of covenantal disobedience and the need for repentance and obedience to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sodom_and_gomorrah.htm">Sodom and Gomorrah</a></b><br>Ancient cities known for their wickedness and subsequent destruction by God as a demonstration of His judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/admah_and_zeboiim.htm">Admah and Zeboiim</a></b><br>Lesser-known cities that were also destroyed alongside Sodom and Gomorrah, emphasizing the completeness of God's judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_fierce_anger.htm">The LORD's Fierce Anger</a></b><br>Represents God's righteous indignation against sin and disobedience, leading to the destruction of these cities.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sulfur_and_salt.htm">Sulfur and Salt</a></b><br>Symbols of desolation and barrenness, used to describe the aftermath of divine judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Promised Land, which would suffer similar desolation if the Israelites turned away from God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Just as the land becomes barren due to sin, our lives can become spiritually barren when we turn away from God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_righteous_judgment.htm">God's Righteous Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is just and serves as a warning to remain faithful and obedient to His commands.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_repentance.htm">The Call to Repentance</a></b><br>The destruction of these cities serves as a call to repentance, urging us to turn from sin and seek God's mercy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_holiness.htm">The Importance of Holiness</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to live holy lives, set apart from the sinful practices that lead to destruction.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hope_in_restoration.htm">Hope in Restoration</a></b><br>While judgment is severe, God's ultimate desire is for restoration and redemption for those who turn back to Him.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_29_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 29:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_29_23_Disobedience_consequences.htm">How does Deuteronomy 29:23 illustrate consequences of disobedience to God's covenant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Sodom_and_Gomorrah.htm">What lessons can we learn from the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Deut_29_23_warnings_today.htm">How can we apply the warnings in Deuteronomy 29:23 to our lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Other_scriptures_on_obeying_God_4.htm">What other scriptures emphasize the importance of obeying God's commands and covenant?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Deut_29_23_Stay_faithful_to_God_s_word.htm">How does Deuteronomy 29:23 encourage us to remain faithful to God's teachings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Deuteronomy_29_23_Sodom_Gomorrah_events.htm">What historical events does Deuteronomy 29:23 reference regarding the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Deut_29_23_God_s_judgment_and_mercy.htm">How does Deuteronomy 29:23 illustrate God's judgment and mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Archaeological_proof_for_Deut_29_23.htm">What archaeological evidence supports the events described in Deuteronomy 29:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_29.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 29?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_were_admah_and_zeboiim.htm">What were Admah and Zeboiim in biblical history?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/does_brimstone_align_with_historical_records.htm">Job 18:15: Does the image of brimstone on a dwelling align with any archaeological or historical records of sulfur-based punishment?

The verse calls every generation to cling to the covenant-keeping God, knowing He alone can either bless the ground beneath our feet or leave it forever silent.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass groweth therein.</span>--Can this be a description of the same country of which it was written in <a href="/context/deuteronomy/8-7.htm" title="For the LORD your God brings you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</a>, "A good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; a land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey; a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness;" and (<a href="/deuteronomy/11-12.htm" title="A land which the LORD your God cares for: the eyes of the LORD your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>) "a land which the Lord thy God careth for"?

The description here is taken from the country around the Dead Sea, to which there is an express allusion in the close of the verse (cf. <a href="/genesis/19-23.htm">Genesis 19:23</a>, etc.). As this country, which before had been as the garden of the Lord, became, when the wrath of God was poured upon it, utterly desolate and waste; so should it be with the land of Israel when the plagues and sicknesses threatened were laid on it by the Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">All</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">its soil</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1510;&#1464;&#1492;&#1468;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;&#7779;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
