It reflects the Shema (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>), a central declaration of faith in Judaism. The proclamation signifies a public acknowledgment of God's sovereignty, akin to a formal declaration of allegiance. Historically, this moment is pivotal as it reaffirms the covenant made at Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). Theologically, it underscores the exclusivity of worship due to Yahweh, rejecting idolatry and affirming monotheism.<p><b>and that you will walk in His ways</b><br>Walking in God's ways implies living a life that reflects His character and commands. This phrase suggests a lifestyle of obedience and holiness, aligning with the call to be holy as God is holy (<a href="/leviticus/19-2.htm">Leviticus 19:2</a>). It involves ethical and moral conduct, reflecting God's justice, mercy, and love. The imagery of walking suggests a continuous, active relationship with God, reminiscent of Enoch and Noah, who "walked with God" (<a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>; 6:9).<p><b>keep His statutes and commandments and ordinances</b><br>This phrase highlights the comprehensive nature of the law given to Israel. Statutes, commandments, and ordinances cover moral, ceremonial, and civil aspects of the law. Keeping them is a sign of faithfulness and devotion. The law serves as a tutor leading to Christ (<a href="/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>), pointing to the need for a savior and the fulfillment of the law in Jesus (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). The historical context involves the covenantal relationship where obedience brings blessings, and disobedience brings curses (Deuteronomy 28).<p><b>and listen to His voice</b><br>Listening to God's voice implies attentiveness and responsiveness to divine guidance. It suggests a relationship where God communicates His will, and His people respond in obedience. This phrase connects to the prophetic tradition where God speaks through prophets (e.g., Isaiah, Jeremiah) and ultimately through His Son, Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>). Culturally, it contrasts with the surrounding nations' practices of following false gods and diviners. Listening to God involves discernment and commitment to His revealed word.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving the covenant and laws as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai</a></b><br>The place where God initially gave the Law to Moses, establishing the covenant with Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which the Israelites are about to enter, representing God's promise and faithfulness.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_renewal.htm">Covenant Renewal</a></b><br>The event of reaffirming the Israelites' commitment to God and His commandments.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/commitment_to_god.htm">Commitment to God</a></b><br>The verse emphasizes a public declaration of allegiance to God, which is foundational for a believer's life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/walking_in_his_ways.htm">Walking in His Ways</a></b><br>This involves a lifestyle that reflects God's character and commands, requiring daily choices aligned with His will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>Obedience is not just about following rules but is an expression of love and devotion to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/listening_to_his_voice.htm">Listening to His Voice</a></b><br>Actively listening to God through prayer, Scripture, and the Holy Spirit is crucial for guidance and growth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_relationship.htm">Covenant Relationship</a></b><br>Understanding our relationship with God as a covenant helps us grasp the seriousness and joy of being His people.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_26_17_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 26:17?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_26_17_Importance_of_obeying_God.htm">How does Deuteronomy 26:17 emphasize the importance of obeying God's commandments today?

Paul echoes, &#8220;For us there is but one God, the Father, from whom all things came and for whom we live&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/8-6.htm">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter reminds believers that belonging to the LORD makes us &#8220;a people for His own possession&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And that you will walk in His ways</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Walk&#8221; pictures daily lifestyle aligned with God&#8217;s character. <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a> sums it up: &#8220;He has shown you, O man, what is good&#8230;to act justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The New Testament keeps the imagery: &#8220;Be imitators of God&#8230;walk in love, just as Christ loved us&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/5-1.htm">Ephesians 5:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience is not sporadic duty but steady direction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Keep His statutes and commandments and ordinances</b><p>&#8226; Three words pile up to stress comprehensive obedience&#8212;moral, civil, ceremonial.
