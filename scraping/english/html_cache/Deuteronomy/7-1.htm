The land refers to Canaan, promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The entry into the land signifies a new chapter for Israel, transitioning from a nomadic life to settling in a land of their own. This act of God bringing them into the land underscores His role as the divine leader and provider, fulfilling the covenant made with the patriarchs.<p><b>and He drives out before you many nations</b><br>The driving out of nations is a divine act, indicating that the conquest of Canaan is not merely a military campaign but a fulfillment of divine justice and promise. This reflects God's judgment on the Canaanite nations for their iniquity (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>) and His commitment to establishing Israel as a holy nation. The emphasis on God as the one who drives out these nations highlights the Israelites' dependence on divine power rather than their own strength.<p><b>the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites</b><br>These seven nations represent the inhabitants of Canaan, each with distinct cultures and practices often contrary to the worship of Yahweh. Archaeological findings have provided insights into these groups, revealing advanced societies with fortified cities. The mention of these specific nations serves as a historical record and a reminder of the spiritual and physical challenges Israel would face. The number seven often symbolizes completeness in the Bible, indicating the totality of the opposition Israel would encounter.<p><b>seven nations larger and stronger than you</b><br>This phrase highlights the formidable nature of the task ahead for the Israelites, emphasizing their reliance on God's power rather than their own capabilities. The description of these nations as larger and stronger serves to magnify the miraculous nature of Israel's eventual conquest. It also serves as a test of faith, challenging the Israelites to trust in God's promises despite overwhelming odds. This theme of divine strength in the face of human weakness is echoed throughout Scripture, notably in the story of David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17) and in the New Testament teaching that God's power is made perfect in weakness (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who promises to deliver the land to His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, led by Moses, preparing to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seven_nations.htm">The Seven Nations</a></b><br>Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites&#8212;nations inhabiting Canaan, described as larger and stronger than Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, delivering God's commands and promises to the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_faithfulness.htm">God's Sovereignty and Faithfulness</a></b><br>God is faithful to His promises, as seen in His commitment to give Israel the land He promised to their forefathers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>Despite the strength and size of the nations, Israel's victory depends on God's power, not their own might.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Just as Israel faced physical enemies, Christians face spiritual battles and must rely on God's strength.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_and_trust.htm">Obedience and Trust</a></b><br>Israel is called to trust and obey God's commands as they enter the land, a principle applicable to believers today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/separation_from_sin.htm">Separation from Sin</a></b><br>The command to drive out the nations reflects the need for believers to separate from sin and worldly influences.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_7_1_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 7:1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Role_of_God_in_spiritual_battles.htm">How does Deuteronomy 7:1 emphasize God's role in overcoming our spiritual battles?

The exhortation in this chapter concerns the treatment of idolaters in the conquest of Canaan, and the avoidance of all such intercourse or union with them as might tend to turn Israel from Jehovah. Obviously, this may be connected both with the first and with the second commandment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - (Cf. <a href="/genesis/15-19.htm">Genesis 15:19-21</a>.) Of the ten nations named by God in his promise to Abraham, only six are mentioned here, those omitted being the Kenites, the Kennizites, the Kadmonites, and the Rephaim. The Rephaim were by this time extinct as a tribe, Og, "the last of the Rephaim," having been conquered, and he and his people destroyed by the Israelites. The three other tribes lay probably beyond the confines of Canaan, in that region promised to Abraham, but which was not included in the territory conquered by the people under Joshua. This may account for their not being mentioned here. One nation, the Hivites, appears here which is not in the enumeration in Genesis. This name seems to have been borne by more tribes than one, or by a tribe existing in divisions widely scattered, for we find the Hivite in the center of Palestine (<a href="/genesis/34-2.htm">Genesis 34:2</a>), in the Shephelah (<a href="/joshua/9-7.htm">Joshua 9:7</a>; <a href="/joshua/11-19.htm">Joshua 11:19</a>), in the laud of Mizpeh under Hermon (<a href="/joshua/11-3.htm">Joshua 11:3</a>), "in Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon to the entering in of Hamath" (<a href="/judges/3-3.htm">Judges 3:3</a>), and among tribes in the north of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/10-17.htm">Genesis 10:17</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/1-15.htm">1 Chronicles 1:15</a>). Their principal settlement was probably in that part of the country where the Antilibanus range terminates in Mount Hermon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your God</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1462;&#1428;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;he&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
