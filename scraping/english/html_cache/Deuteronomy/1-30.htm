It highlights God's covenantal nature, as He is not just any deity but specifically their God, who has chosen them as His people. This reflects the covenant made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and is a reminder of God's faithfulness and commitment to His promises.<p><b>who goes before you</b><br>This indicates God's leadership and guidance. In the wilderness, God led the Israelites with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21-22</a>). It signifies His role as a shepherd leading His flock, ensuring they are on the right path. This also prefigures Christ, who is described as the Good Shepherd in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, leading His people.<p><b>will fight for you</b><br>This phrase reassures the Israelites of God's protection and power. It is a promise of divine intervention in battles, as seen in the conquest of Canaan. This reflects the theme of God as a warrior, a motif found throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ, who fights on behalf of humanity.<p><b>just as you saw Him do for you in Egypt</b><br>This refers to the miraculous events of the Exodus, where God delivered the Israelites from slavery through a series of plagues and the parting of the Red Sea (Exodus 7-14). It serves as a reminder of God's past faithfulness and power, encouraging trust in His future actions. The Exodus is a foundational event in Israel's history and is often seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, delivering believers from the bondage of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is faithful to His promises and acts on behalf of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being reminded of God's past faithfulness as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The place of Israel's bondage and the site of God's mighty acts of deliverance, including the plagues and the parting of the Red Sea.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is recounting God's promises and past actions to encourage the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land (Canaan)</a></b><br>The land promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which the Israelites are about to enter.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>Remembering God's past actions strengthens our faith for present challenges.
