The term "ensnared" suggests a trap or a subtle enticement that could lead to spiritual downfall. Historically, the Canaanites were known for their idolatrous practices, which included child sacrifice and ritual prostitution. The Israelites were called to be a holy people, set apart for God (<a href="/leviticus/20-26.htm">Leviticus 20:26</a>), and adopting pagan practices would compromise their distinct identity and covenant relationship with God.<p><b>after they have been destroyed before you</b><br>This refers to the divine mandate given to the Israelites to conquer the land of Canaan. The destruction of these nations was not merely a military conquest but a divine judgment against their abominable practices (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-4.htm">Deuteronomy 9:4-5</a>). The phrase underscores God's sovereignty and justice, as well as His promise to give the land to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). It also serves as a reminder that the victory was due to God's power, not Israel's might.<p><b>Do not inquire about their gods</b><br>This command prohibits the Israelites from seeking knowledge about the Canaanite deities. In the ancient Near East, polytheism was prevalent, and each nation had its pantheon of gods. The inquiry into these gods could lead to syncretism, where elements of pagan worship might be incorporated into the worship of Yahweh. This was a direct violation of the first commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) and could lead to spiritual adultery, as seen in the later history of Israel (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-23</a>).<p><b>asking, &#8220;How do these nations serve their gods?</b><br>The curiosity about the worship practices of other nations could lead to imitation. The Canaanite religious rituals were often sensual and morally corrupt, designed to appease their gods and ensure fertility and prosperity. This phrase highlights the danger of being drawn into practices that are contrary to the worship of the one true God. The Israelites were to worship God according to His revealed will, not by adopting the methods of pagan nations (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-4.htm">Deuteronomy 12:4</a>).<p><b>I will do likewise.&#8221;</b><br>This final phrase warns against the temptation to emulate the worship practices of other nations. The Israelites were called to worship God in spirit and truth, as later emphasized by Jesus (<a href="/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>). The desire to "do likewise" reflects a heart that is not fully devoted to God and is susceptible to idolatry. This serves as a timeless warning for believers to guard against conforming to the patterns of the world (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>) and to remain faithful to God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and instructions to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving instructions on how to live in the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanite_nations.htm">Canaanite Nations</a></b><br>The nations residing in the Promised Land, whose practices and gods the Israelites are warned against.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_of_israel.htm">God of Israel</a></b><br>The one true God, who commands exclusive worship and obedience from the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_syncretism.htm">Avoiding Syncretism</a></b><br>The Israelites were warned not to adopt the religious practices of the Canaanites.
