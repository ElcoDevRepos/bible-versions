Throughout the Pentateuch, God frequently speaks to Moses, providing guidance and commandments for the Israelites. This direct communication underscores Moses' role as a mediator between God and the people, a type of Christ who mediates the New Covenant (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>).<p><b>I have seen this people</b><br>God's omniscience is evident here, as He observes the actions and attitudes of the Israelites. This phrase reflects God's intimate knowledge of His creation, similar to His awareness of humanity's wickedness before the flood (<a href="/genesis/6-5.htm">Genesis 6:5</a>). It emphasizes that nothing is hidden from God, aligning with passages like <a href="/psalms/139.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>, which speak of God's comprehensive understanding of human thoughts and actions.<p><b>and they are indeed a stiff-necked people</b><br>The term "stiff-necked" is a metaphor derived from the behavior of oxen that resist the yoke, symbolizing stubbornness and rebellion. This characterization of the Israelites is recurrent in the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9, 33</a>:3, 33:5), illustrating their frequent disobedience and resistance to God's commands. It serves as a warning against pride and self-will, which are contrary to the humility and submission God desires. This stubbornness foreshadows the need for a new heart and spirit, as prophesied in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>, ultimately fulfilled through the transformative work of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who speaks to Moses about the Israelites' rebellious nature.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader and prophet of Israel, who intercedes on behalf of the people and receives God's commandments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are described as "stiff-necked" due to their repeated disobedience and rebellion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_sinai.htm">Mount Sinai (Horeb)</a></b><br>The place where Moses received the Ten Commandments and where the Israelites committed the sin of the golden calf.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_golden_calf_incident.htm">The Golden Calf Incident</a></b><br>A significant event of idolatry and rebellion against God, which prompted God's declaration of the Israelites as "stiff-necked."<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_stiff-necked_rebellion.htm">Understanding Stiff-necked Rebellion</a></b><br>The term "stiff-necked" (Hebrew: qesheh-oref) implies stubbornness and an unwillingness to submit to God's authority.

That same authoritative voice frames this warning in <a href="/deuteronomy/9-13.htm">Deuteronomy 9:13</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>also said to me</b><p>&#8226; Moses reminds the new generation that he received God&#8217;s word directly, highlighting his God-ordained role as mediator (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>; <a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrasing stresses continuity: God had already spoken in <a href="/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>, and He &#8220;also&#8221; reiterates it here. Israel&#8217;s past failings were not forgotten&#8212;history is meant to instruct (<a href="/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The personal communication underscores accountability: when God speaks to a leader, the message must be conveyed faithfully to the people (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-5.htm">Deuteronomy 5:5</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have seen this people</b><p>&#8226; God&#8217;s omniscience is on display.
