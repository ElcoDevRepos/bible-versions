The act of remembering is a recurring theme in Deuteronomy, serving as a call to recall God's past actions and the people's failures. It underscores the need for continual awareness of one's history to avoid repeating past mistakes. This concept is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are urged to remember Christ's sacrifice (<a href="/1_corinthians/11-24.htm">1 Corinthians 11:24-25</a>).<p><b>how you provoked the LORD your God in the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness period was a time of testing and revelation of the Israelites' faithlessness. The term "provoked" indicates deliberate disobedience and rebellion against God's commands. This period includes events like the golden calf incident (Exodus 32) and the complaints about manna (Numbers 11). The wilderness serves as a metaphor for spiritual testing, paralleling Jesus' temptation in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>).<p><b>From the day you left the land of Egypt</b><br>This marks the beginning of the Exodus, a foundational event in Israel's history, symbolizing liberation from bondage. The departure from Egypt is a type of salvation, prefiguring the deliverance offered through Christ. The journey from Egypt to the Promised Land is a physical and spiritual journey, representing the believer's journey from sin to salvation.<p><b>until you reached this place</b><br>"This place" refers to the plains of Moab, where Moses delivers his final speeches before the Israelites enter the Promised Land. This location is significant as it represents the threshold of fulfillment of God's promises. It is a moment of transition and preparation, akin to the believer's anticipation of eternal life.<p><b>you have been rebelling against the LORD</b><br>The Israelites' rebellion is a central theme in their wilderness journey, highlighting human sinfulness and the need for divine grace. This rebellion is documented in various instances, such as the refusal to enter the Promised Land (Numbers 14). It serves as a warning to future generations about the consequences of disobedience. The theme of rebellion and redemption is fulfilled in Christ, who offers reconciliation with God (<a href="/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is recounting their history and reminding them of their rebellion against God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt but frequently rebelled against Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who delivered them from Egypt and guided them through the wilderness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The desert area where the Israelites wandered for 40 years due to their disobedience and lack of faith.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land of slavery from which God delivered the Israelites, symbolizing bondage and oppression.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_remembering.htm">The Importance of Remembering</a></b><br>Remembering past failures is crucial for spiritual growth.

Even at Horeb, where, amid the most affecting manifestations alike of the Divine majesty and the Divine grace, just after the Lord had spoken to them directly out of the fire, and whilst Moses had gone up to receive the tables of the Law, on which the covenant of God with Israel was based, and whilst that covenant was being struck, they had sinned so grievously as to make to themselves a molten image, which they worshipped with idolatrous rites (<a href="/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18-32:6</a>;
