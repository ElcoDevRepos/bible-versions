In the context of ancient Israel, this command would apply to a runaway slave seeking refuge. The Israelites were reminded of their own history as slaves in Egypt and were called to treat others with compassion and justice. This principle is echoed in the New Testament, where believers are encouraged to show hospitality to strangers (<a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>).<p><b>wherever he chooses</b><br>The freedom given to the runaway slave to choose his place of residence highlights the value of personal agency and dignity. This is significant in a historical context where slaves typically had no rights or autonomy. The allowance for choice underscores the importance of respecting individual freedom, a concept that is foundational in the biblical understanding of human dignity. This can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament teaching of freedom in Christ (<a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>).<p><b>in the town of his pleasing</b><br>This phrase indicates that the runaway slave is not only free to choose where to live but is also allowed to integrate into the community of his choice. This reflects the inclusive nature of God's covenant community, where all are welcome regardless of their past. It also foreshadows the New Testament vision of the church as a diverse body of believers from every nation and background (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>).<p><b>Do not oppress him</b><br>The command not to oppress the runaway slave is a direct call to justice and mercy, aligning with the broader biblical mandate to care for the marginalized and oppressed. This reflects God's character as a defender of the weak and a just ruler. The prohibition against oppression is consistent with the teachings of the prophets, who often spoke against the mistreatment of the vulnerable (<a href="/isaiah/1-17.htm">Isaiah 1:17</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus embodies this principle, advocating for the poor and oppressed and calling His followers to do the same (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people to whom the laws in Deuteronomy were given.
