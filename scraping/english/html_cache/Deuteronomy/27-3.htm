The act of writing the law emphasizes the need for the Israelites to remember and adhere to God's statutes. This practice is reminiscent of ancient Near Eastern treaties where laws were inscribed on stone or clay tablets. It underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, similar to the tablets of the Ten Commandments given to Moses.<p><b>When you have crossed over</b><br>This phrase indicates a future action, pointing to the Israelites' impending crossing of the Jordan River into the Promised Land. It signifies a transition from their wilderness journey to the fulfillment of God's promise. The crossing of the Jordan is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, akin to the crossing of the Red Sea, marking a new chapter of divine provision and faithfulness.<p><b>To enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you</b><br>This highlights the divine gift of the land, emphasizing that it is not earned by the Israelites but granted by God's grace. The land is a central theme in the covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, representing God's faithfulness to His promises. It also foreshadows the ultimate rest and inheritance believers find in Christ, as the land is a type of the eternal inheritance promised to God's people.<p><b>A land flowing with milk and honey</b><br>This description portrays the fertility and abundance of the Promised Land, symbolizing prosperity and divine blessing. It reflects the agricultural richness of Canaan, contrasting with the barrenness of the wilderness. This phrase is used multiple times in Scripture to describe the land's desirability and God's provision, serving as a metaphor for the spiritual abundance found in a relationship with God.<p><b>Just as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you</b><br>This phrase reaffirms the continuity of God's covenantal promises from the patriarchs to the current generation. It underscores God's unchanging nature and faithfulness to His word. The reference to "the God of your fathers" connects the Israelites to their heritage and the promises made to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, reinforcing the idea that God's plans span generations and are fulfilled in His timing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites who is delivering God's commandments and instructions to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God who are about to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>The significant geographical boundary that the Israelites must cross to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, described as "a land flowing with milk and honey," promised by God to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_law.htm">The Law</a></b><br>Refers to the commandments and statutes given by God to the Israelites, which they are to inscribe on stones as a perpetual reminder.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_remembrance.htm">The Importance of Remembrance</a></b><br>The act of writing the law on stones serves as a physical reminder of God's commandments and promises.
