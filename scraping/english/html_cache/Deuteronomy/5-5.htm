It was a pivotal moment in Israel's history, marking the establishment of the covenant between God and His people. This time frame is crucial as it sets the stage for the giving of the Law, which would define Israel's identity and relationship with God.<p><b>I was standing between the LORD and you</b><br>Moses served as the mediator between God and the Israelites. This role is significant as it prefigures the mediatory work of Jesus Christ, who stands between God and humanity. Moses' position highlights the need for a mediator due to the holiness of God and the sinfulness of man, a theme that runs throughout Scripture.<p><b>to declare to you the word of the LORD</b><br>Moses' primary role was to communicate God's commandments and instructions to the people. This underscores the importance of God's word as the foundation for Israel's covenant relationship with Him. The declaration of God's word is a recurring theme in the Bible, emphasizing the authority and necessity of divine revelation.<p><b>because you were afraid of the fire</b><br>The fire on Mount Sinai represented God's presence and holiness, which instilled fear in the Israelites. This fear is a common biblical response to divine encounters, reflecting the awe and reverence due to God. The fire also symbolizes God's purity and judgment, themes that are echoed throughout the Bible.<p><b>and would not go up the mountain</b><br>The Israelites' reluctance to ascend the mountain highlights their recognition of God's holiness and their own unworthiness. This separation between God and the people points to the need for a mediator and foreshadows the ultimate reconciliation through Christ. The mountain itself is a place of divine revelation, as seen in other biblical accounts such as Elijah's encounter with God on Mount Horeb.<p><b>And He said:</b><br>This introduction to God's speech emphasizes the direct communication from God to His people through Moses. It sets the stage for the delivery of the Ten Commandments, which are foundational to the moral and spiritual life of Israel.

This phrase reminds Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;that God&#8217;s revelation happens in real history, at a definite point in time. &#8226; God acts in history, not myth. &#8226; Our faith rests on events, not impressions (cf. <a href="/luke/1-1.htm">Luke 1:1-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I was standing between the LORD and you</b><p>Here Moses describes his mediating role. The people could not endure God&#8217;s direct voice (<a href="/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18-19</a>). So Moses &#8220;stood between,&#8221; foreshadowing the ultimate Mediator, Jesus Christ: &#8220;For there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>). &#8226; God&#8217;s holiness requires a go-between. &#8226; Mediation is God&#8217;s gracious provision, not human invention.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to declare to you the word of the LORD</b><p>Moses&#8217; task was proclamation, not innovation.

This underscores the authority of Scripture: it is God&#8217;s own word, faithfully transmitted (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>). &#8226; The messenger must neither add nor subtract (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a>). &#8226; Hearing Scripture equals hearing God (<a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because you were afraid of the fire</b><p>The fiery theophany revealed God&#8217;s purity and power, rightly producing holy fear (<a href="/hebrews/12-18.htm">Hebrews 12:18-21</a>).

By contrast, in Christ we are invited to &#8220;draw near with confidence&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>). &#8226; Old-covenant distance highlights new-covenant access. &#8226; Worship today still holds reverence, yet with bold approach.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And He said:</b><p>The verse ends on the threshold of divine speech.
