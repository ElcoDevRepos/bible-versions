This was a common practice in ancient warfare, especially in the context of the Israelites' conquest of Canaan. It was seen as a way to purify the land from idolatry and pagan practices, ensuring that the Israelites would not be led astray by the customs of the conquered peoples. This act was also a form of divine judgment against the Canaanites for their sins, as described in <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>.<p><b>as we had done to Sihon king of Heshbon</b><br>Sihon was the king of the Amorites, and his defeat is recounted in <a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-31</a>. The Israelites' victory over Sihon was significant because it marked the beginning of their conquest of the Transjordan region. This victory demonstrated God's power and faithfulness in fulfilling His promises to Israel. The defeat of Sihon served as a precedent for the conquest of other territories, showing that God was with Israel in their battles.<p><b>utterly destroying the men, women, and children of every city</b><br>The complete destruction of the inhabitants of these cities was commanded by God as part of the herem. This was intended to prevent the Israelites from being influenced by the idolatrous practices of the Canaanites. While this command is difficult to understand from a modern perspective, it reflects the seriousness with which God viewed the threat of idolatry and the need for Israel to remain a holy people. This act also prefigures the final judgment, where sin and rebellion against God will be completely eradicated.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is recounting the events of their conquest as they journey towards the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/o/og,_king_of_bashan.htm">Og, King of Bashan</a></b><br>The ruler of Bashan, whose kingdom was defeated by the Israelites under God's command.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sihon,_king_of_heshbon.htm">Sihon, King of Heshbon</a></b><br>Another Amorite king previously defeated by the Israelites, serving as a precedent for the destruction of Og's kingdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bashan.htm">Bashan</a></b><br>A region east of the Jordan River, known for its fortified cities and strong warriors.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who are executing His judgment on the nations occupying the Promised Land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty and Judgment</a></b><br>The destruction of Og's kingdom demonstrates God's sovereign authority over nations and His right to execute judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>The Israelites' complete destruction of their enemies reflects their obedience to God's specific instructions, emphasizing the importance of following God's will fully.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_sin.htm">The Seriousness of Sin</a></b><br>The total destruction of these cities serves as a sobering reminder of the seriousness of sin and the consequences of living in opposition to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_promises.htm">Trust in God's Promises</a></b><br>The victory over Og reinforces the reliability of God's promises, encouraging believers to trust in His faithfulness in their own lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites faced physical battles, Christians are engaged in spiritual warfare, requiring vigilance and reliance on God's strength.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_3_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 3:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deut_3_6_God_s_judgment_on_sin.htm">How does Deuteronomy 3:6 demonstrate God's judgment against sin and disobedience?
