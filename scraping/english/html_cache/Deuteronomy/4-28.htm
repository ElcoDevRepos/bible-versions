The context is Moses warning the Israelites about the dangers of turning away from God. The "man-made gods" refer to idols crafted by human hands, a common practice among surrounding pagan nations. These idols were often made from materials like wood and stone, emphasizing their lifelessness and inability to interact with the world. This serves as a stark contrast to the living God of Israel, who is active and present. The warning is prophetic, as Israel would later experience exile and captivity, where they would be surrounded by such idols (<a href="/2_kings/17-7.htm">2 Kings 17:7-23</a>). The futility of idol worship is a recurring theme in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where the prophet mocks the absurdity of worshipping objects made by human hands.<p><b>which cannot see or hear or eat or smell</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the impotence and lifelessness of idols. Unlike the God of Israel, who is omniscient and omnipresent, these idols lack sensory perception and the ability to respond to worshippers. This is a direct challenge to the belief systems of the surrounding nations, which attributed divine powers to these inanimate objects. The inability of idols to "see or hear" is echoed in <a href="/psalms/115-4.htm">Psalm 115:4-8</a> and <a href="/psalms/135-15.htm">Psalm 135:15-18</a>, where the psalmist contrasts the living God with the dead idols. This also points to the uniqueness of the God of Israel, who is described as having eyes that see (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>), ears that hear (<a href="/psalms/34-15.htm">Psalm 34:15</a>), and a mouth that speaks (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>).

And so Rashi explains it. Captivity was the means of eradicating idolatry from Israel rather than encouraging it. But the cause of a people and its idols is so constantly identified in the Old Testament, that those who are in bondage to a nation may naturally be described as in bondage to its gods.
