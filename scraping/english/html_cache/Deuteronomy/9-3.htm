The Israelites are on the brink of entering the Promised Land, and the command is for the present moment. It underscores the importance of recognizing God's timing and acting in faith.<p><b>the LORD your God goes across ahead of you</b><br>This highlights God's leadership and presence with the Israelites. It is reminiscent of God's guidance during the Exodus, where He led them with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). It assures the Israelites that they are not alone in their conquest.<p><b>as a consuming fire</b><br>The imagery of God as a consuming fire is powerful, symbolizing His holiness, judgment, and power. This metaphor is used elsewhere in Scripture, such as in <a href="/hebrews/12-29.htm">Hebrews 12:29</a>, to convey God's purifying and destructive power against sin and opposition.<p><b>He will destroy them and subdue them before you</b><br>This promise of victory is rooted in God's covenant with Israel. It reflects the divine initiative in the conquest of Canaan, where God is the primary agent of victory. The Israelites are reminded that their success is due to God's intervention, not their own strength.<p><b>And you will drive them out and annihilate them swiftly</b><br>The Israelites are given the task of completing the conquest by driving out the inhabitants of the land. This reflects the historical context of ancient Near Eastern warfare, where complete victory often involved the total removal of the enemy. It also serves as a warning against the dangers of idolatry and cultural assimilation.<p><b>as the LORD has promised you</b><br>This phrase connects the current command to the broader narrative of God's promises to the patriarchs, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It underscores the faithfulness of God in fulfilling His covenant promises, as seen in <a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>, where God promised the land to Abraham's descendants.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is described as a "consuming fire," indicating His power and holiness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are being led into the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanite_nations.htm">Canaanite Nations</a></b><br>The inhabitants of the land that Israel is to conquer and drive out.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, who is delivering God's message to the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_power.htm">God's Sovereignty and Power</a></b><br>Recognize that God goes before us in our battles, just as He did for Israel.
