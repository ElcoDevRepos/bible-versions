In the ancient Near Eastern context, fear often implied reverence and awe rather than terror. This fear is a recognition of God's holiness, power, and authority. The Israelites were to acknowledge God's sovereignty and respond with obedience and worship. This phrase echoes the first commandment, emphasizing exclusive devotion to Yahweh. <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a> states, "The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge," highlighting its foundational role in wisdom and understanding.<p><b>Serve Him only</b><br>This command underscores the exclusivity of worship due to God alone, rejecting idolatry and syncretism. In the historical context, Israel was surrounded by nations with polytheistic practices, and this directive was a call to remain distinct and faithful. Serving God involves both worship and obedience, as seen in <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>, where Joshua challenges the Israelites to choose whom they will serve. This phrase also prefigures Jesus' response to Satan in <a href="/matthew/4-10.htm">Matthew 4:10</a>, affirming the singular devotion to God.<p><b>And take your oaths in His name</b><br>Oaths in the ancient world were solemn promises often invoking a deity as a witness. By instructing the Israelites to take oaths in God's name, the text emphasizes the seriousness and truthfulness required in their commitments. This practice distinguished Israel from surrounding nations, who swore by their gods. It reflects the third commandment's call to not misuse God's name (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>). Jesus later expands on this in <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>, teaching about the integrity of one's word without the need for oaths.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, Moses is delivering God's commandments to the Israelites as they prepare to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who are receiving these instructions as part of the covenant relationship with Yahweh.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_promised_land.htm">The Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to Abraham and his descendants, and where the Israelites are about to enter.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/y/yahweh.htm">Yahweh (The LORD)</a></b><br>The one true God whom the Israelites are commanded to fear, serve, and swear by.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_covenant.htm">The Covenant</a></b><br>The agreement between God and the Israelites, which includes laws and commandments that define their relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_the_lord.htm">Fear the LORD</a></b><br>Cultivate a reverent awe and respect for God, recognizing His holiness and authority in every aspect of life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/serve_him_only.htm">Serve Him Only</a></b><br>Prioritize God above all else, ensuring that your actions, decisions, and worship are directed solely towards Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_oaths.htm">Integrity in Oaths</a></b><br>When making promises or commitments, do so with sincerity and truthfulness, invoking God's name with the seriousness it deserves.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/exclusive_worship.htm">Exclusive Worship</a></b><br>Guard against idolatry in all its forms, whether it be material possessions, relationships, or personal ambitions that compete with your devotion to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/covenant_faithfulness.htm">Covenant Faithfulness</a></b><br>Remember the covenant relationship with God, which calls for obedience and loyalty, reflecting His faithfulness in your daily life.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Deuteronomy_6_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Deuteronomy 6:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Deuteronomy_6_13_Prioritize_God_daily.htm">How does Deuteronomy 6:13 instruct us to prioritize God in daily life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_fear_God_mean_today.htm">What does "fear the LORD your God" mean in practical terms today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_apply_serve_Him_only_today.htm">How can we apply "serve Him only" in our modern context?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/NT_verses_echo_Deut_6_13.htm">What New Testament verses reinforce the message of Deuteronomy 6:13?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_teach_Deut_6_13_to_youth.htm">How can we teach the principles of Deuteronomy 6:13 to the next generation?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_Fear_the_LORD_in_Deut_6_13.htm">What does "Fear the LORD your God" mean in Deuteronomy 6:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_is_fearing_God_in_Deut_6_13.htm">How does Deuteronomy 6:13 define the concept of fearing God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_emphasize_swearing_by_God_in_Deut_6_13.htm">Why is swearing by God's name emphasized in Deuteronomy 6:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_deuteronomy_6.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Deuteronomy 6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_swearing_to_god_considered_wrong.htm">Is swearing to God considered wrong?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/swear_to_tell_the_truth.htm">Do you swear to tell the truth under oath?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_a_true_friend_love_you_always.htm">Do you swear to tell the truth under oath?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_are_snowflake_adoptions.htm">What does it mean to worship?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Deuteronomy 6:13 Mean</div><b>Fear the LORD your God</b><p>&#8220;Fear the LORD your God&#8230;&#8221;

<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-13.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus affirmed it: &#8220;Do not fear those who kill the body&#8230; rather fear Him who can destroy both soul and body in hell&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, fearing God means putting His Word first in every decision and rejecting the casual attitude our culture often takes toward sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Serve Him only</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;serve Him only&#8230;&#8221;

While Christ later warns against careless swearing (<a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>; <a href="/james/5-12.htm">James 5:12</a>), the principle remains: if an oath is necessary, it must be truthful and God-honoring.<p>&#8226; Today our &#8220;yes&#8221; and &#8220;no&#8221; should carry such integrity that extra vows become largely unnecessary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a> calls for a threefold response to the Lord: reverent awe, exclusive devotion, and integrity-filled speech. To fear Him is to recognize His unrivaled greatness; to serve Him only is to reject every rival master; to swear by His name is to ground every word in His truth. Together these commands cultivate a life centered wholly on the Lord, reflecting His holiness in heart, action, and speech.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/deuteronomy/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">Jehovah thy God thou shalt fear, and him shalt thou serve: i.e., </span>Him only, as translated by the LXX., and cited by our Lord in His temptation. It is remarkable that all His answers to the tempter were taken not only from Deuteronomy, <span class= "ital">but from one and the same portion of Deuteronomy</span>--Deuteronomy 5-10 inclusive--the portion which applies the principles of the Decalogue to Israel's life.<p><span class= "bld">And shalt swear by his name.</span>--Comp. <a href="/exodus/23-13.htm" title="And in all things that I have said to you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of your mouth.">Exodus 23:13</a>. "Make no mention of the name of other gods." The principle was not unknown to the patriarchs. Laban appealed to the "God of Nahor," but "Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac" (<a href="/genesis/31-53.htm" title="The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.">Genesis 31:53</a>). (Comp. <a href="/jeremiah/5-7.htm" title="How shall I pardon you for this? your children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses.">Jeremiah 5:7</a> : "Thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by . . . no-gods.")<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God.</span> The fear of the Lord - that reverent awe which is akin to love - is the beginning of wisdom and the foundation of piety; where it is in the heart it will lead to serving of the Lord in holy obedience; and they in whom it dwells will swear by his Name, recognizing his presence and omniscience, and not daring to asseverate anything but what they know to be true. Thus, really believing in God and reverently worshipping him, the Israelites would be careful not to go after other gods, or to give to any object that homage which is due unto Jehovah alone, knowing that this he will not endure or suffer with impunity; for he is a jealous God, and them that thus dishonor him he will destroy (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-24.htm">Deuteronomy 4:24</a>, etc.). Thus also they should be kept from murmuring against God, and thereby tempting him - putting him, as it were, to the proof, and calling in question his presence and his power, as they had done at Massah (<a href="/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>). Without this genuine religious principle there will be no sincere worship, no true reverence, no real obedience, rendered unto God. But where this dwells in the heart it will influence the whole life, so that the commandments of God shall be diligently kept, and that which is good and right in his sight shall be done. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Fear</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1464;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#238;&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3372.htm">Strong's 3372: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fear, to revere, caus, to frighten</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1447;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your God,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1462;&#1435;&#1497;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;he&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><br /><span class="word">serve Him,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1465;&#1425;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;a&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5647.htm">Strong's 5647: </a> </span><span class="str2">To work, to serve, till, enslave</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and take your oaths</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1461;&#1469;&#1506;&#1463;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(ti&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#234;&#183;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7650.htm">Strong's 7650: </a> </span><span class="str2">To seven oneself, swear</span><br /><br /><span class="word">using only His name.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;i&#353;&#183;m&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124; Noun - masculine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8034.htm">Strong's 8034: </a> </span><span class="str2">A name</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">OT Law: Deuteronomy 6:13 You shall fear Yahweh your God (Deut.
