They held authority in legal and social matters, often serving as judges. This reflects the communal nature of Israelite society, where family and community were deeply intertwined. The involvement of elders underscores the seriousness of the situation and the need for communal judgment.<p><b>&#8220;This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious;</b><br>The terms "stubborn" and "rebellious" indicate a persistent refusal to adhere to parental authority, which was a grave offense in a culture that emphasized family honor and obedience. Rebellion against parents was seen as a rebellion against God's ordained order. This phrase highlights the importance of obedience and respect within the family unit, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>, <a href="/ephesians/6.htm">Ephesians 6:1-3</a>).<p><b>he does not obey us.</b><br>Obedience to parents was a fundamental expectation in Israelite society, rooted in the Ten Commandments. Disobedience was not merely a personal failing but a threat to the social and religious fabric of the community. This reflects the broader biblical principle that obedience to earthly authority is a reflection of obedience to God (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>).<p><b>He is a glutton and a drunkard.&#8221;</b><br>Gluttony and drunkenness are indicative of a lifestyle characterized by excess and lack of self-control. These behaviors were condemned in Scripture as they lead to moral and spiritual decay (<a href="/proverbs/23-20.htm">Proverbs 23:20-21</a>). The mention of these specific sins suggests a pattern of behavior that is destructive both to the individual and the community. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament warnings against such behaviors (<a href="/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>) and highlights the call to live a disciplined and holy life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/parents.htm">Parents</a></b><br>The mother and father who bring their son to the elders.
