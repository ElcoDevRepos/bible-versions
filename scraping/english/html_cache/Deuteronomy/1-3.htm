The fortieth year signifies the end of the wilderness wanderings, a period of testing and preparation for entering the Promised Land. The number forty often symbolizes a period of trial or probation in the Bible, as seen in the forty days of rain during the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>) and Jesus' forty days of fasting in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>).<p><b>on the first day of the eleventh month</b><br>This specific date situates the events in a historical context, providing a precise timeline for Moses' final speeches. The eleventh month, known as Shevat in the Hebrew calendar, is just before the Israelites' entry into Canaan. This timing underscores the urgency and importance of Moses' message as the people prepare to transition from wandering to conquest.<p><b>Moses proclaimed to the Israelites</b><br>Moses, as the leader and prophet, serves as the mediator between God and His people. His role is crucial in delivering God's commandments and guidance. This proclamation is part of Moses' farewell address, emphasizing his dedication to ensuring the Israelites understand God's laws before his impending death and their entrance into the Promised Land.<p><b>all that the LORD had commanded him concerning them</b><br>This phrase highlights the divine origin of Moses' message. The commandments are not merely Moses' words but are directly from the LORD, underscoring their authority and importance. This reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience to God's commands is central. It also foreshadows the New Covenant, where Jesus, the ultimate prophet, delivers God's final revelation to humanity (<a href="/hebrews/1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The leader of the Israelites, chosen by God to deliver His commandments and guide the people through the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who were delivered from slavery in Egypt and are now on the brink of entering the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fortieth_year.htm">The Fortieth Year</a></b><br>Marks the end of the Israelites' wilderness journey, a significant period of testing and preparation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_eleventh_month.htm">The Eleventh Month</a></b><br>Indicates the specific timing of Moses' proclamation, emphasizing the importance of God's timing in His plans.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_commandments.htm">The LORD's Commandments</a></b><br>The divine instructions given to Moses to communicate to the Israelites, highlighting the covenant relationship between God and His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Moses' role in proclaiming God's commandments underscores the necessity of obedience to God's word.

The moral of these words has been well pointed out by Jewish writers. It was but eleven days' journey from Sinai to Kadesh-barnea--the place from whence Israel should have begun the conquest of the promised land; but not only eleven days of the second year of the exodus, but eleven months of the fortieth year found them still in the wilderness. "We see that they could not enter in because of unbelief."<p>(3, 4) <span class= "bld">Moses spake unto the children of Israel . . . after he had slain Sihon . . . and Og.</span>--The conquest of these two kings and their territories was one of the exploits of the fortieth year. (See <a href="/context/numbers/21-21.htm" title="And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,">Numbers 21:21-35</a>.) Before the eleventh month of that year, not only Sihon and Og, but also the five princes of Midian, "who were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country" (<a href="/joshua/13-21.htm" title="And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.">Joshua 13:21</a>), had also been slain (Numbers 31). This completed the conquest, and was the last exploit of Moses' life. In the period of repose that followed he found a suitable time to exhort the children of Israel, "according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them" From <a href="/deuteronomy/34-8.htm" title="And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.">Deuteronomy 34:8</a>, we learn that "the children of Israel wept for Moses thirty days." These days would seem to be the last month of the fortieth year, for "on the tenth day of the first month" (probably of the next year, <a href="/joshua/4-19.htm" title="And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.">Joshua 4:19</a>) they passed over Jordan.

It was also after the destruction of Sihon and 'Og (<a href="/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-35</a>). This also is significant. By the destruction of these kings, who sought to bar the access of the Israelites to the Promised Land, God had given proof that he would indeed fulfill his promise to his people, and had at once laid them under obligations to obedience, and given them encouragement to go forward on the course to which he had called them.
