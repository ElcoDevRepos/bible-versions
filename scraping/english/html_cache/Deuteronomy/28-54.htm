In the context of <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, Moses is delivering a series of blessings and curses to the Israelites, contingent upon their obedience or disobedience to God's commandments. The "gentle and refined man" represents someone who is typically kind, cultured, and considerate. This transformation underscores the severity of the curses that would befall Israel if they turned away from God. Historically, this can be linked to the siege conditions described in <a href="/2_kings/6-24.htm">2 Kings 6:24-29</a>, where extreme famine led to unimaginable actions.<p><b>will begrudge his brother</b><br>The term "begrudge" indicates a deep-seated resentment or envy. In a cultural context where family ties were paramount, such a shift in attitude signifies a breakdown of societal norms and relationships. This reflects the intense pressure and desperation that would arise during times of famine and siege, as prophesied in the curses. The fracturing of familial bonds is a recurring theme in the Bible, often seen as a consequence of sin and disobedience (<a href="/genesis/4-8.htm">Genesis 4:8</a>, where Cain begrudges Abel).<p><b>the wife he embraces</b><br>The mention of the wife highlights the breakdown of the most intimate and sacred human relationship. In biblical times, the family unit was the cornerstone of society, and the husband-wife relationship was central to this structure. The prophecy indicates that even this bond would be strained under the weight of the curses. This can be seen as a reversal of the Genesis mandate for man and woman to be united as one flesh (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>), illustrating the devastating impact of sin and disobedience.<p><b>and the rest of his children who have survived</b><br>The phrase "who have survived" implies a preceding calamity that has already claimed lives, leaving only a remnant. This is consistent with the context of <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where the curses include war, famine, and disease. The survival of some children suggests a partial fulfillment of the curses, where not all are lost, but those who remain are caught in a dire situation. This can be connected to the remnant theology found throughout the Bible, where God preserves a faithful few even in times of judgment (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>). The survival of a remnant also foreshadows the hope of restoration and redemption, a theme that culminates in the New Testament with the coming of Jesus Christ, who offers salvation to all who believe.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws and warnings to the Israelites before they enter the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, receiving the blessings and curses based on their obedience or disobedience to God's commandments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land of Canaan, which God promised to the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/curses_for_disobedience.htm">Curses for Disobedience</a></b><br>A series of warnings given to the Israelites about the consequences of turning away from God's commandments.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/siege_and_distress.htm">Siege and Distress</a></b><br>The specific context of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-54.htm">Deuteronomy 28:54</a>, where extreme conditions lead to dire actions among the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_disobedience.htm">The Seriousness of Disobedience</a></b><br>God's warnings are not to be taken lightly.

History records God&#8217;s words coming true during later sieges of Samaria, Jerusalem, and finally in A.D. 70. The verse stands as a sobering reminder that God&#8217;s warnings are literal, His standards are unchanging, and true security is found only in wholehearted obedience to Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/deuteronomy/28-54.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The most</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1425;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3966.htm">Strong's 3966: </a> </span><span class="str2">Vehemence, vehemently, wholly, speedily</span><br /><br /><span class="word">gentle</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1443;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;ra&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
