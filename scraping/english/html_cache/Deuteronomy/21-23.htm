This command reflects the importance of maintaining purity and respect for the dead, aligning with the broader biblical principle of honoring God's creation. The practice of removing the body before nightfall also prevented ritual impurity, which was a significant concern in the Israelite community. This command is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus' body was taken down from the cross before evening (<a href="/john/19-31.htm">John 19:31-33</a>), fulfilling the law and maintaining ritual purity.<p><b>but you must be sure to bury him that day</b><br>Immediate burial was a common practice in ancient Israel, emphasizing the urgency of dealing with death in a way that respects both the individual and the community. This command ensured that the land remained undefiled and that the community remained ritually clean. The practice of same-day burial is still observed in Jewish tradition today. This urgency also prefigures the burial of Jesus, who was buried the same day He was crucified, fulfilling the law and prophetic symbolism (<a href="/matthew/27-57.htm">Matthew 27:57-60</a>).<p><b>because anyone who is hung on a tree is under God&#8217;s curse</b><br>This phrase indicates that execution by hanging was seen as a sign of divine judgment. In the cultural and historical context, being hung on a tree was a public display of shame and a declaration that the person was cursed by God. This concept is crucial in understanding the redemptive work of Christ, as Paul explains in <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>, where Christ became a curse for us by being hung on a tree, thus redeeming us from the curse of the law. This typology highlights the substitutionary atonement of Jesus, who bore the curse on behalf of humanity.<p><b>You must not defile the land that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance</b><br>The land of Israel was considered holy, a gift from God to His chosen people. Defiling the land through disobedience or neglect of God's commands was a serious offense, as the land was a tangible representation of God's covenant with Israel. This command underscores the importance of maintaining holiness and purity in the land, reflecting the broader biblical theme of stewardship and responsibility. The concept of land as an inheritance is a recurring theme in Scripture, symbolizing God's promises and blessings to His people, ultimately pointing to the eternal inheritance believers have in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/9-15.htm">Hebrews 9:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The author of Deuteronomy, delivering God's laws to the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The recipients of the law, preparing to enter the Promised Land.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/promised_land.htm">Promised Land</a></b><br>The land given by God to the Israelites, which they are about to inherit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cursed_man.htm">Cursed Man</a></b><br>A person executed and hung on a tree, symbolizing being under God's curse.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The divine lawgiver, emphasizing holiness and the sanctity of the land.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_the_land.htm">The Sanctity of the Land</a></b><br>God's command to bury the executed on the same day underscores the importance of maintaining the purity of the land.

The command safeguards human dignity, underscores the seriousness of sin, and preserves covenant purity. Ultimately it prepares hearts to grasp Christ&#8217;s work: He was hung on a tree, bore the curse in our place, was taken down and buried, and by His obedience removed our defilement so that we might inherit an undefiled, eternal kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that is hanged is accursed of</span> <span class="cmt_word">God</span>; literally, <span class="accented">a curse of God</span>.
