"Jeshurun" is a poetic name for Israel, meaning "upright one," and is used to emphasize the ideal character of the nation when it is faithful to God. This concept of God as King is foundational in the Old Testament, seen in passages like <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>, where God tells Samuel that the people have rejected Him as their king. The kingship of the LORD is also a type of Christ, who is recognized as King of Kings in the New Testament (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).<p><b>when the leaders of the people gathered</b><br>The gathering of leaders signifies a moment of unity and collective decision-making, often seen in Israel's history during times of covenant renewal or national crisis. This gathering can be compared to the assembly at Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/19-17.htm">Exodus 19:17</a>), where the leaders and people came together to receive the Law. It underscores the importance of leadership in guiding the people according to God's will, a theme echoed in the New Testament with the role of church leaders (<a href="/hebrews/13-17.htm">Hebrews 13:17</a>).<p><b>when the tribes of Israel came together</b><br>The unity of the tribes is a recurring theme in the history of Israel, symbolizing strength and solidarity under God's kingship. This unity is crucial for the fulfillment of God's promises to the patriarchs, as seen in the conquest of Canaan (Joshua 3-4). The gathering of the tribes also foreshadows the unity of believers in Christ, as described in <a href="/ephesians/4-4.htm">Ephesians 4:4-6</a>, where the church is called to maintain the unity of the Spirit. The concept of the tribes coming together is a prophetic picture of the ultimate gathering of God's people in the eschatological kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeshurun.htm">Jeshurun</a></b><br>A poetic name for Israel, meaning "upright one" or "beloved one."
