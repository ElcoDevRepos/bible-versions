The "hill country" is a reference to the mountainous region of Canaan, which was known for its challenging terrain. This area is significant in biblical history as it was part of the land promised to Abraham and his descendants (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>). The journey into the hill country symbolizes the Israelites' obedience to God's command to explore the land He had given them, despite the potential dangers and challenges they might face.<p><b>and came to the Valley of Eshcol</b><br>The Valley of Eshcol is noted for its fertility and abundance, particularly its grape clusters, which were so large that they had to be carried on a pole between two men (<a href="/numbers/13-23.htm">Numbers 13:23</a>). This valley is located near Hebron, a significant city in biblical history, as it was associated with the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The name "Eshcol" means "cluster," highlighting the region's productivity. This abundance serves as a tangible sign of the land's richness, fulfilling God's promise of a land flowing with milk and honey (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>).<p><b>and spied out the land</b><br>The act of spying out the land was a strategic move to assess the land's inhabitants, fortifications, and resources. This reconnaissance mission was crucial for the Israelites to understand what lay ahead and to prepare for the conquest of Canaan. The spies' report would later influence the Israelites' decision-making and faith in God's promise. This event foreshadows the need for faith and trust in God's provision and guidance, as seen in the New Testament when believers are called to walk by faith and not by sight (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>). The exploration of the land also serves as a test of the Israelites' faithfulness and reliance on God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God who were journeying from Egypt to the Promised Land.

Israel literally held the fruit in their hands, a preview of life in fellowship with Him.<p>&#8226; Tragically, the spies allowed intimidating geography to outweigh overwhelming provision.
