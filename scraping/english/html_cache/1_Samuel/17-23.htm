This highlights David's role as a messenger and his obedience to his father Jesse, who sent him to deliver provisions. It sets the stage for David's transition from shepherd to warrior. This moment is pivotal as it marks the beginning of David's public life and his eventual rise to kingship.<p><b>suddenly the champion named Goliath</b><br>Goliath is described as a champion, indicating his role as the representative warrior of the Philistines. His name and title emphasize his formidable nature and the threat he posed to Israel. Goliath's presence is a test of faith for Israel, and his defeat by David foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's anointed over seemingly insurmountable odds.<p><b>the Philistine from Gath</b><br>Gath was one of the five major cities of the Philistines, known for its giants. This detail underscores the historical enmity between Israel and the Philistines. Goliath's origin from Gath connects him to the Anakim, a race of giants mentioned in earlier biblical texts, symbolizing the persistent challenges faced by Israel.<p><b>came forward from the ranks of the Philistines</b><br>Goliath's emergence from the Philistine ranks signifies the challenge he posed to the Israelite army. This act of stepping forward is symbolic of the spiritual and physical battles that God's people face. It also highlights the Philistines' confidence in their champion, contrasting with Israel's initial fear and hesitation.<p><b>and shouted his usual words</b><br>Goliath's taunts were a daily occurrence, meant to intimidate and demoralize the Israelites. His words represent the voice of opposition against God's people, echoing the spiritual warfare believers face. This repetition of defiance sets the stage for David's faith-driven response, which contrasts with the fear of the Israelite soldiers.<p><b>which David also heard</b><br>David's hearing of Goliath's words is crucial, as it stirs his righteous indignation and faith in God. Unlike the other Israelites, David's response is not fear but a zealous desire to defend God's honor. This moment foreshadows David's role as a type of Christ, who confronts and overcomes the enemy on behalf of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd, the youngest son of Jesse, who later becomes the king of Israel.

It is possible that Goliath was a general designation of these monstrous descendants of the ancient Anakim in Gath; but Ewald suggests that the name Goliath really only belongs to the giant slain by Elhanan, some years after the exploit of the youthful son of Jesse, and that it was transferred in error to the "champion" whom David slew (who is, moreover, generally called simply "the Philistine") when his proper name had been lost.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23, 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The champion, the Philistine of Oath, Goliath by name.</span> The Hebrew is, "The champion (see on ver. 4), Goliath the Philistine his name, of Gath," probably the very words of the original record. <span class="cmt_word">Out of the armies,</span> or <span class="accented">ranks.</span> This is a very probable correction of the Kri, made by restoring a letter which has apparently dropped out.
