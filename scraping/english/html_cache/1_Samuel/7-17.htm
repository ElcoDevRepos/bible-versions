Located in the hill country of Ephraim, Ramah served as a central location for Samuel's ministry. The act of returning to Ramah signifies Samuel's commitment to his roots and his role as a leader who remained connected to his community. Ramah's geographical position made it a strategic location for Samuel's circuit of judging Israel, as it was accessible to many tribes.<p><b>because his home was there</b><br>Samuel's residence in Ramah highlights the importance of having a stable base for his ministry. It underscores the biblical principle of leaders being grounded in their communities. This phrase also reflects the cultural norm of the time, where family and land were integral to one's identity and ministry. Samuel's home in Ramah symbolizes his personal commitment to the people of Israel and his role as a spiritual leader.<p><b>and there he judged Israel</b><br>Samuel's role as a judge involved more than legal decisions; it encompassed spiritual leadership and guidance. As a judge, Samuel was responsible for maintaining justice and righteousness in Israel, a role that was both judicial and prophetic. This phrase connects to the broader biblical theme of God raising leaders to guide His people, as seen in the Book of Judges. Samuel's judging in Ramah signifies a centralized location for his leadership, where he could address the spiritual and social issues of the nation.<p><b>and built an altar to the LORD</b><br>Building an altar was a significant act of worship and dedication to God. It reflects Samuel's role as a spiritual leader who prioritized worship and obedience to the LORD. This act connects to the patriarchal tradition of building altars, as seen with figures like Abraham and Jacob, symbolizing a place of encounter with God. The altar in Ramah served as a focal point for communal worship and sacrifice, reinforcing the centrality of God in the life of Israel. It also prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who is the fulfillment of the sacrificial system.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet, judge, and leader of Israel who played a crucial role in transitioning Israel from the period of judges to the establishment of the monarchy.

Samuel&#8217;s return to Ramah, his home life, his ongoing judging, and his altar all intertwine to show that lasting influence springs from steady obedience and continual dependence on the LORD.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Raman.</span>--The same Ramah "of the Watchers" where Elkanah and Hannah had dwelt. After the destruction of Shiloh, Samuel seems to have fixed his abode in his father's city.<p><span class= "bld">And there he built an altar.</span>--Thus following the old custom of the patriarchs. It must be remembered that at this period there was no national sanctuary, no formal seat of worship, where the high priest and his attendant priests and Levites served. The Ark, we know, was in safe keeping in the "city of woods," Kirjath-jearim, but it was in private custody; and we hear of no priests and Levites, of no ritual or religious observances, in connection with the long sojourn of the holy Ark in that place. It is probable that the sacred vessels and furniture had been saved from the destruction of Shiloh by Samuel. These were, very likely, in the prophet-judge's safe keeping at Bamah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His return was to Ramah.</span> We have seen that Elkanah was a large landholder there, and Samuel had now apparently succeeded to his father's place. <span class="cmt_word">And there he built an altar unto Jehovah.</span> This old patriarchal custom (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7</a>) long continued, and it was only gradually that local shrines and worship on high places were superseded by attendance upon the temple services at Jerusalem. At this time there was especial need for such altars. The established worship at Shiloh had been swept away, the town destroyed, the priests put to the sword, and the ark, though restored, was resting in a private dwelling. Probably Samuel had saved the sacred vessels, and much even of the tabernacle, but no mention of them is here made. We see, however, both in the erection of this altar and all through Samuel's life, that the Aaronic priesthood was in abeyance, and that he was not only prophet and judge, but also priest. In thus restoring the priesthood in his own person he was justified not merely by his powers as prophet, but by necessity. Gradually, with more prosperous times, matters returned to their regular channel; but even when Ahiah, the grandson of Eli, was with Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a>), he was employed not for the offering of sacrifice, but for divining with the Urim and Thummim. On a most important occasion the offering of sacrifice is spoken of as undoubtedly Samuel's right, and when he delayed his coming no mention is made of a priest, but Saul is said to have offered the victim himself (<a href="/1_samuel/13-9.htm">1 Samuel 13:9</a>). It is plain, therefore, that we must not tie down the priesthood too tightly to the house of Aaron; for throughout there lies in the background the idea of a higher priesthood, and with this Samuel was invested, as being a type of him who is a Priest forever after the order of Melchisedek (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/2-35.htm">1 Samuel 2:35</a>). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/7-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then he would return</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1489;&#1464;&#1514;&#1444;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7791;&#601;&#183;&#353;u&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
