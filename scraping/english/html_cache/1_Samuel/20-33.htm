Saul's attempt to kill his own son, Jonathan, underscores the depth of his jealousy and paranoia regarding David. This act of violence is consistent with Saul's previous attempts to kill David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-11.htm">1 Samuel 18:11, 19</a>:10), showing a pattern of using his spear as a weapon of murder. The spear, a common weapon in ancient warfare, symbolizes Saul's reliance on physical power rather than spiritual guidance. Saul's actions reflect a heart hardened against God's will, as he prioritizes his own kingship over God's anointed successor, David. This moment also foreshadows the eventual breakdown of Saul's reign and his tragic end.<p><b>So Jonathan knew that his father was determined to kill David.</b><br>Jonathan's realization marks a turning point in his relationship with both his father and David. Despite his loyalty to Saul as his father and king, Jonathan's covenant with David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>) and his recognition of David's anointing by God (<a href="/1_samuel/23-17.htm">1 Samuel 23:17</a>) compel him to protect David. This knowledge confirms the seriousness of Saul's intentions and the danger David faces. Jonathan's discernment and subsequent actions demonstrate his integrity and faithfulness, qualities that align with biblical principles of friendship and loyalty (<a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>). Jonathan's role as a mediator and protector of David can be seen as a type of Christ, who intercedes on behalf of humanity. This moment also sets the stage for David's eventual rise to kingship, as Jonathan's support helps preserve David's life, ensuring the fulfillment of God's promise.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.
