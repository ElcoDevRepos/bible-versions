His actions demonstrate loyalty and friendship, reflecting the covenant made between Jonathan and David in <a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>. This summoning indicates Jonathan's commitment to protect David, despite the risk to his own position and relationship with Saul. Jonathan's actions can be seen as a type of Christ, who mediates on behalf of humanity.<p><b>and told him all these things</b><br>Jonathan informs David of Saul's intentions, showing transparency and trust. This communication is vital for David's survival, as Saul's jealousy and fear of David's rising popularity and God's favor have led him to plot against David. The phrase highlights the importance of truth and honesty in relationships, a theme echoed in <a href="/proverbs/27-5.htm">Proverbs 27:5-6</a>, which values open rebuke over hidden love.<p><b>Then Jonathan brought David to Saul</b><br>Jonathan's role as an intermediary is further emphasized as he attempts to reconcile David with Saul. This act of bringing David to Saul signifies a temporary restoration of peace and order. It reflects the biblical principle of peacemaking, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>, where peacemakers are called blessed. Jonathan's actions also foreshadow Christ's work of reconciliation between God and humanity.<p><b>and David was with Saul as before</b><br>This phrase indicates a return to the previous state of affairs, where David served in Saul's court. It suggests a temporary resolution to the conflict, though underlying tensions remain. David's presence with Saul "as before" highlights the cyclical nature of their relationship, marked by moments of peace and conflict. This situation parallels the recurring theme of God's faithfulness and the testing of His servants, as seen throughout the narratives of the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul and a close friend of David.
