In the cultural context of ancient Israel, hospitality was a significant virtue, and Nabal's refusal to provide for David's men was a breach of social norms. His question is rhetorical, indicating disdain rather than a genuine inquiry. Nabal's character is contrasted with that of his wife, Abigail, who later demonstrates wisdom and discernment.<p><b>&#8220;Who is David?</b><br>Nabal's question implies ignorance or a deliberate slight. David was already well-known in Israel as a warrior and the anointed future king. This question can be seen as an insult, as David's reputation had been established through his victory over Goliath and his service in Saul's army. Nabal's dismissal of David's identity reflects his arrogance and lack of spiritual insight.<p><b>Who is this son of Jesse?</b><br>By referring to David as "the son of Jesse," Nabal emphasizes David's humble origins. This phrase might suggest Nabal's scorn for David's lack of noble lineage. In the biblical narrative, David's rise from shepherd to king is a testament to God's sovereign choice, often using the lowly to accomplish His purposes, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>.<p><b>Many servants these days are breaking away from their masters.</b><br>Nabal's statement reflects the social instability of the time, as Saul's reign was marked by internal strife and division. This comment could be seen as a reference to David's status as a fugitive from King Saul, who viewed David as a threat to his throne. The phrase also highlights the broader theme of loyalty and rebellion, which is prevalent throughout the books of Samuel. Nabal's words unwittingly foreshadow the eventual division of the kingdom after Solomon's reign, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/12.htm">1 Kings 12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nabal.htm">Nabal</a></b><br>A wealthy but foolish man from Maon, described as harsh and evil in his dealings.

By now David&#8217;s exploits against Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-50</a>) and his victories under Saul (18:7, 30) are household news. Nabal&#8217;s &#8220;Who?&#8221; is deliberate disrespect.<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s own servants sing David&#8217;s praises (21:11), and even Saul finally says, &#8220;You are more righteous than I&#8221; (24:17). Nabal cannot plead ignorance.<p>&#8226; Rejecting God&#8217;s anointed never ends well&#8212;consider Pharaoh hardening his heart against Moses (<a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>). Nabal is walking the same perilous path.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Who is this son of Jesse?</b><p>&#8220;Who is this son of Jesse?&#8221;. The phrase echoes Saul&#8217;s scornful language (<a href="/1_samuel/20-27.htm">1 Samuel 20:27, 30</a>), hinting that Nabal sides with the king who is hunting David.<p>&#8226; By stressing David&#8217;s father&#8217;s name instead of David&#8217;s own, Nabal reduces him to &#8220;that boy from Bethlehem,&#8221; ignoring the anointing of 16:13.<p>&#8226; Isaiah later celebrates &#8220;a shoot from the stump of Jesse&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>); Nabal&#8217;s sneer therefore stands in stark contrast to God&#8217;s honor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Many servants these days are breaking away from their masters.</b><p>&#8220;Many servants these days are breaking away from their masters&#8221;.

By painting David as an outlaw, he excuses keeping his considerable wealth to himself&#8212;contrary to <a href="/leviticus/25-35.htm">Leviticus 25:35</a>&#8217;s call to help a brother in need.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Nabal&#8217;s three contemptuous questions are not ignorance but insolence. He rejects the Lord&#8217;s anointed, belittles his lineage, and slanders his character to avoid showing kindness. His words reveal a heart hardened by pride and greed, setting the stage for the swift judgment that follows (<a href="/1_samuel/25-38.htm">1 Samuel 25:38</a>). The verse warns us that scoffing at God&#8217;s servants and closing our hand against the needy invites divine correction, while humility and generosity&#8212;exemplified later by Abigail&#8212;align us with God&#8217;s purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">There be many servants now a days that break away.</span>--This evident insult indicates that Nabal was of the faction of Saul at this time--was reckoned among those who hated David. It was the report of these words, doubtless, which so furiously excited David. In Nabal, the rich sheep-master, the churlish refuser of the fairly earned gift, he saw a deadly political adversary--one who, with men like Doeg and Cush, would hunt him down like a wild beast. Without this explanation, David's wrath and determination to take such speedy and bloody vengeance on a mere selfish churl is inexplicable. With the light, however, which such an open declaration of deadly hostility on the part of Nabal throws on the transaction, the subsequent passionate conduct of David, although deeply blameable, is not difficult to understand.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">There be many servants,</span> etc. Nabal would scarcely have ventured to speak in so insulting a manner if David had been at Maon, but as he had moved with his men a long distance towards the south, he. gave free vent to his rude feelings without restraint. David was to him a mere slave who had run away from his master, Saul. <span class="cmt_word">My bread,... my water.</span> These are the necessaries of life, while the flesh was the special luxury provided for the festival. David's ten young men would not literally carry water to him at so great a distance, nor did Nabal mean more than our phrase "meat and drink."
