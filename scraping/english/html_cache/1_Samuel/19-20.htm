This reflects Saul's increasing desperation and paranoia. The act of sending messengers indicates Saul's authoritative power as king, yet it also highlights his inability to directly confront David, who is under divine protection. This mirrors earlier biblical narratives where God's chosen are pursued by earthly powers, such as Pharaoh's pursuit of Moses.<p><b>But when they saw the group of prophets prophesying,</b><br>The messengers encounter a group of prophets, which suggests a communal setting where prophetic activity was common. This group is likely part of a prophetic school or guild, a concept seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as with Elijah and Elisha. The presence of a prophetic community indicates a strong spiritual movement in Israel, emphasizing the role of prophecy in guiding and shaping the nation.<p><b>with Samuel leading them,</b><br>Samuel, the last judge and a significant prophet, is leading the group. His leadership underscores his continued influence and authority in Israel, even as Saul reigns as king. Samuel's presence signifies divine endorsement and the continuation of God's work through prophecy. Samuel's role as a leader of prophets connects to his earlier anointing of both Saul and David, highlighting his pivotal role in Israel's transition from judges to monarchy.<p><b>the Spirit of God came upon them,</b><br>The Spirit of God descending upon the messengers is a divine intervention, demonstrating God's sovereignty and ability to override human intentions. This event is reminiscent of other instances where the Spirit empowers individuals for specific purposes, such as in the judges of Israel. It signifies God's active presence and the transformative power of the Spirit, which can change hearts and redirect actions.<p><b>and Saul&#8217;s messengers also began to prophesy.</b><br>The messengers, initially sent to capture David, are instead caught up in the prophetic activity. This unexpected turn of events illustrates the overpowering nature of God's Spirit, which can compel even those with hostile intentions to participate in divine acts. It serves as a reminder of God's ultimate control over human affairs and foreshadows the New Testament outpouring of the Holy Spirit, where diverse individuals are united in prophetic witness. This incident also subtly critiques Saul's kingship, as his own envoys are unable to fulfill his orders when confronted with God's power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is increasingly consumed by jealousy and fear of David, leading him to seek David's capture.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, who is fleeing from Saul's attempts to kill him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/messengers.htm">Messengers</a></b><br>Sent by Saul to capture David, but they are overcome by the Spirit of God and begin to prophesy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The prophet and last judge of Israel, who is leading a group of prophets and is a spiritual mentor to David.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>A group of individuals who are prophesying under the influence of the Spirit of God, demonstrating God's power and presence.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_god.htm">The Sovereignty of God</a></b><br>God's Spirit can intervene in human affairs, overriding human intentions and plans.

The Hebrew word rendered "company" occurs only in this place, but the ancient versions agree in rendering it "company," or "assembly." The Chaldee paraphrases here "they saw the company of the scribes praising, and Samuel standing over them teaching."<p><span class= "bld">And they also prophesied.</span>--Like so much that happened among the chosen people during their eventful trial period, the circumstance here related does not belong to ordinary natural experience. The words which immediately precede suggest the only possible explanation of the strange occurrence: "The Spirit of God was upon these messengers of Saul." Ewald thus graphically paraphrases the Biblical record of this scene:--"It is related of those who started with the most hostile intentions against the prophets and their pupils, that as they approached they suddenly stood still, spell-bound by the music and solemn dance of the devotees; then, more and more powerfully drawn by the same Spirit into the charmed circle, they broke forth into similar words and gestures; and then, flinging away their upper garments, they joined in the dance and the music, and sinking down into ecstatic quivering, utterly forgot the hostile spirit in which they had come. . . . The same thing befell fresh messengers a second, nay, a third time. Then Saul himself, enraged, rushed to Ramah, . . . and as he looked down from the hill upon the school, and heard the loud pealing songs rising from it, he was seized by the Divine Spirit; and when he at last reached the spot he sank into the same condition of enthusiasm still more deeply than all the messengers whom he had previously despatched."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/19-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">he</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sent</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1448;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;la&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
