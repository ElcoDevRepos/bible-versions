In the context of <a href="/1_samuel/20.htm">1 Samuel 20</a>, Jonathan and David are using a covert method to communicate due to the threat posed by King Saul. The boy, likely a servant or young assistant, is unaware of the true purpose behind the actions he is participating in. This reflects a common biblical theme where God&#8217;s plans and the actions of His people are often hidden from those not directly involved, emphasizing the need for discernment and wisdom. The boy's ignorance also underscores the secrecy and danger surrounding David and Jonathan's friendship and the political tension of the time.<p><b>only Jonathan and David knew the arrangement.</b><br>Jonathan and David's knowledge of the arrangement signifies their deep bond and trust in one another. This secretive plan was devised to protect David from Saul's wrath, illustrating the loyalty and covenantal friendship between Jonathan and David. Their relationship is a powerful example of godly friendship, characterized by selflessness and sacrifice. Jonathan, despite being the heir to the throne, recognizes God's anointing on David and supports him, foreshadowing the New Testament principle of putting others before oneself (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>). This arrangement also reflects the wisdom and strategic thinking necessary to navigate the complexities of human relationships and divine purposes. The secrecy of their plan is reminiscent of other biblical narratives where God's chosen individuals must act with discretion to fulfill His will, such as Moses' hidden identity in Egypt or Jesus' parables that revealed truths only to those with ears to hear.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul and a close friend of David.
