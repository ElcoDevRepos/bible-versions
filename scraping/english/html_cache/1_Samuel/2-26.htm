He was raised in the tabernacle at Shiloh under the priest Eli. This setting is significant as it was a time of spiritual decline in Israel, with corrupt priests like Eli's sons, Hophni and Phinehas. Samuel's presence in the tabernacle symbolizes a new beginning and hope for Israel.<p><b>continued to grow in stature</b><br>This phrase indicates Samuel's physical growth and development. It parallels the growth of other significant biblical figures, such as Jesus, who "grew in wisdom and stature" (<a href="/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>). It suggests that Samuel was healthy and strong, preparing him for the leadership role he would eventually assume as a prophet and judge over Israel.<p><b>and in favor with the LORD</b><br>Samuel's favor with the Lord highlights his spiritual growth and the divine approval of his life and actions. Unlike Eli's sons, who were corrupt and disobedient, Samuel's life was marked by obedience and dedication to God. This favor is reminiscent of other biblical figures like Joseph and David, who also found favor with God due to their faithfulness.<p><b>and with man</b><br>Samuel's favor with man indicates that he was respected and admired by those around him. This is significant in a time when the priesthood was marred by corruption. Samuel's integrity and dedication set him apart, earning him the respect of the people. This dual favor with God and man is a precursor to the ministry of Jesus, who also grew in favor with God and man, as noted in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A young boy dedicated to the Lord by his mother, Hannah, serving under the priest Eli in the tabernacle at Shiloh.
