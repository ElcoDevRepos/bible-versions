David sought refuge with Achish to escape King Saul's pursuit. The giving of Ziklag signifies a political alliance and trust between Achish and David. Ziklag was a town on the border of Philistine territory and Judah, strategically significant for its location. This act of giving Ziklag to David indicates Achish's recognition of David's leadership and potential as a future ally. The transfer of Ziklag also reflects the complex relationships between the Israelites and Philistines during this period, where political and military alliances were often fluid.<p><b>and to this day it still belongs to the kings of Judah</b><br>The phrase "to this day" suggests that the text was written at a time when the ownership of Ziklag by the kings of Judah was still recognized. This indicates the lasting impact of David's acquisition of the town. Ziklag's continued association with Judah highlights its integration into the Israelite kingdom, which David would later unify. The historical context shows that Ziklag became a part of the inheritance of the tribe of Judah, as seen in the division of the land among the tribes of Israel. This phrase also underscores the enduring legacy of David's leadership and the establishment of his dynasty, which is central to the narrative of the united monarchy in Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, who at this time is fleeing from King Saul and seeking refuge among the Philistines.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/achish.htm">Achish</a></b><br>The king of Gath, a Philistine city, who grants David the town of Ziklag.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziklag.htm">Ziklag</a></b><br>A town given to David by Achish, which becomes a possession of the kings of Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A group of people who were often in conflict with Israel; David seeks refuge among them during his flight from Saul.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which later includes Ziklag as part of its territory.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_in_unlikely_places.htm">God's Provision in Unlikely Places</a></b><br>David finds refuge and provision in Ziklag, a Philistine town, demonstrating God's ability to provide for His people in unexpected ways.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/strategic_positioning_for_future_leadership.htm">Strategic Positioning for Future Leadership</a></b><br>Ziklag becomes a base for David's operations, illustrating how God positions His servants for future roles and responsibilities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_trusting_god's_timing.htm">The Importance of Trusting God's Timing</a></b><br>David's time in Ziklag is a period of waiting and preparation, reminding believers to trust in God's timing for the fulfillment of His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_alliances_and_relationships.htm">The Role of Alliances and Relationships</a></b><br>David's relationship with Achish shows the importance of wise alliances, even with those outside the faith community, for the advancement of God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/legacy_and_inheritance.htm">Legacy and Inheritance</a></b><br>Ziklag's continued association with the kings of Judah underscores the lasting impact of David's decisions and God's faithfulness to His covenant people.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Samuel_27_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Samuel 27:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_Achish_give_David_Ziklag.htm">Why did Achish give David Ziklag, and what does this reveal about God's plan?
