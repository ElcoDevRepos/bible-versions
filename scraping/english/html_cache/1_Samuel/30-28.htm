It was a city on the edge of the Arnon Gorge, marking the boundary of Moab. This city was significant in the conquest narratives of Israel, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/2-36.htm">Deuteronomy 2:36</a> and <a href="/joshua/13-9.htm">Joshua 13:9</a>. The mention of Aroer here indicates David's outreach to the Transjordan tribes, reflecting his political acumen in securing alliances and support. This act of sending spoils to Aroer demonstrates David's recognition of the importance of maintaining strong ties with these regions, which were crucial for the security and expansion of his future kingdom.<p><b>Siphmoth</b><br>Siphmoth is a less well-known location, with limited references in the biblical text. It is believed to be a town in the southern part of Judah, possibly near Ziklag, where David and his men had been residing. The inclusion of Siphmoth in the list of places receiving gifts from David suggests its strategic or familial importance. This act of generosity would have helped solidify David's support among the local populations, ensuring loyalty and favor as he prepared to ascend to the throne. The distribution of spoils to Siphmoth reflects the broader theme of David's leadership style, characterized by generosity and strategic alliances.<p><b>and Eshtemoa</b><br>Eshtemoa was a Levitical city in the hill country of Judah, as noted in <a href="/joshua/21-14.htm">Joshua 21:14</a>. It was also a city of refuge, providing sanctuary and justice, which aligns with the biblical theme of God's provision and protection for His people. By sending spoils to Eshtemoa, David acknowledges the city's religious significance and its role in the spiritual life of Israel. This act can be seen as a gesture of respect and support for the Levitical priesthood, which played a crucial role in maintaining the covenant relationship between God and Israel. David's actions here prefigure the messianic role of Christ, who fulfills the law and the prophets, providing ultimate refuge and salvation for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, who at this time is leading his men in battle and distributing the spoils of war.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/aroer.htm">Aroer</a></b><br>A city located in the territory of Reuben, east of the Jordan River.
