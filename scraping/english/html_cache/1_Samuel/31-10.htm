This act was a way to honor their gods for victory and to humiliate the defeated Israelites by showing that their God was powerless against the Philistine deities. The temple of the Ashtoreths would have been a significant religious site, possibly located in one of the major Philistine cities such as Ashdod, Ashkelon, or Gaza. This act parallels the earlier capture of the Ark of the Covenant by the Philistines, which they placed in the temple of Dagon (<a href="/1_samuel/5-2.htm">1 Samuel 5:2</a>). The desecration of Saul's armor in this manner underscores the spiritual and national defeat of Israel at this time.<p><b>and hung his body on the wall of Beth-shan</b><br>Beth-shan was a strategic city located in the Jordan Valley, controlling the routes between the Jezreel Valley and the Jordan River. Archaeological excavations have revealed that Beth-shan was a significant urban center during the time of Saul. By hanging Saul's body on the city wall, the Philistines intended to display their triumph and further disgrace the fallen king. This act of public humiliation was meant to demoralize the Israelites and assert Philistine dominance. The hanging of Saul's body can be seen as a foreshadowing of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, who was also publicly displayed, though His death ultimately led to victory over sin and death. The retrieval and proper burial of Saul's body by the men of Jabesh-gilead (<a href="/1_samuel/31-11.htm">1 Samuel 31:11-13</a>) highlights themes of loyalty and respect for the anointed king, despite his failures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, whose tragic end is depicted in this chapter.

Every detail screams humiliation for a king who had turned from the Lord. The episode warns that disobedience invites disgrace, but it also sets the stage for God&#8217;s ultimate vindication under David.

The latter supposition seems the more probable, as Askelon is specially mentioned by David in the funeral hymn of Saul and Jonathan (<a href="/2_samuel/1-20.htm" title="Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.">2Samuel 1:20</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The wall of Beth-shan.</span>--Beth-shan was in the tribe of Manasseh, some four miles west of the Jordan, and twelve miles south of the sea of Galilee.

This Canaanitish element in the population was perhaps the reason why Beth-shan was chosen for the barbarous exhibition. The Canaanites would probably have welcomed the miserable spectacle which seemed to degrade their ancient enemies. The writer of the chronicle adds one more ghastly detail to this account: "They fastened the head (skull) of Saul in the Temple of Dagon."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/31-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They put</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1433;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#347;i&#183;m&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
