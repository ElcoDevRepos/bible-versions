His band of six hundred men indicates a significant following, suggesting his leadership and the loyalty he commanded. This group is a testament to David's growing influence and the trust placed in him by his followers. The number six hundred is consistent with earlier accounts of David's men (<a href="/1_samuel/23-13.htm">1 Samuel 23:13</a>), showing continuity in his leadership. This movement is strategic, as David seeks refuge from Saul's relentless pursuit.<p><b>and went to Achish son of Maoch, the king of Gath.</b><br>Gath is one of the five Philistine city-states, and Achish is its king. David's decision to seek refuge with a Philistine king is significant, as it shows his desperation and the complexity of his situation. Gath is notably the hometown of Goliath, whom David famously defeated (1 Samuel 17), adding irony to his seeking asylum there. Achish, son of Maoch, is mentioned here, providing a historical anchor for the narrative. This move also reflects the political dynamics of the time, where allegiances could be fluid, and former enemies could become temporary allies. David's relationship with Achish is complex, as seen in later chapters, where David feigns loyalty to the Philistines while secretly supporting Israel (1 Samuel 29). This situation foreshadows the dual nature of Christ's mission, where He navigated between earthly and divine realms, often misunderstood by those around Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who is fleeing from King Saul.

He has just said in his heart, &#8220;I will perish one day by the hand of Saul&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1</a>), so this departure is motivated by real danger.<p>&#8226; David is not running from God&#8217;s call but seeking preservation until God fulfills His promise of kingship (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/24-20.htm">1 Samuel 24:20</a>).<p>&#8226; This step echoes earlier escapes (<a href="/1_samuel/21-10.htm">1 Samuel 21:10&#8211;11</a>) and shows a pattern of wisely avoiding Saul while trusting the Lord (<a href="/psalms/57-1.htm">Psalm 57:1</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s providence is evident: even in flight, David is being positioned for future victories over the Philistines (<a href="/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17&#8211;25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with his six hundred men</b><p>&#8226; David&#8217;s company has grown from the original &#8220;about four hundred men&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>) to six hundred, indicating God&#8217;s continued favor and leadership capacity.<p>&#8226; These men are loyal despite hardship (<a href="/1_samuel/23-13.htm">1 Samuel 23:13</a>; 30:9). Their presence underscores that David&#8217;s decisions affect families and futures, not merely himself.<p>&#8226; The size of the group requires significant resources; moving into Philistine territory provides temporary relief from Saul&#8217;s pursuit and opens new supply lines (<a href="/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture shows God often shapes leaders in the wilderness with a band of faithful followers (Moses &#8211; <a href="/exodus/18-25.htm">Exodus 18:25</a>; Jesus &#8211; <a href="/luke/6-13.htm">Luke 6:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and went to Achish son of Maoch</b><p>&#8226; Achish is the same Philistine ruler who once regarded David with suspicion (<a href="/1_samuel/21-12.htm">1 Samuel 21:12&#8211;15</a>). David&#8217;s earlier feigned madness paved the way for a more durable relationship now.<p>&#8226; The text calls Achish the &#8220;son of Maoch,&#8221; grounding the narrative in real history. God&#8217;s Word is rooted in factual detail, reaffirming its trustworthiness (<a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s approach shows strategic thinking: he seeks asylum from an enemy of Saul. By serving Achish, David removes Saul&#8217;s excuse to keep chasing him (<a href="/1_samuel/27-4.htm">1 Samuel 27:4</a>).<p>&#8226; This alliance is not compromise with paganism but a tactical refuge. Like Joseph in Egypt (<a href="/genesis/41-41.htm">Genesis 41:41</a>), David operates within a foreign court while remaining God&#8217;s man.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the king of Gath</b><p>&#8226; Gath is one of the five principal Philistine cities (<a href="/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>).

He must avoid adopting Philistine idolatry (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>) while honoring his host (<a href="/1_peter/2-12.htm">1 Peter 2:12</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty shines: even an enemy king becomes a shelter for His anointed (<a href="/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a> records a calculated move of David, driven by real danger yet guided by faith. He departs decisively, brings his loyal six hundred, allies temporarily with Achish, and dwells in Gath. Each phrase reveals God&#8217;s protective hand, David&#8217;s strategic obedience, and the unfolding plan that will ultimately seat him on Israel&#8217;s throne (<a href="/2_samuel/2-4.htm">2 Samuel 2:4</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">The six hundred men.</span>--This was the original number. They still formed the nucleus of the force, but the total number was now far larger. These "six hundred" had each their households, besides which, many a group of warriors, large and small, had already joined the now renowned standard of the future king.<p><span class= "bld">Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.</span>--The same, we believe, as that Achish to whom David fled before (see <a href="/1_samuel/21-11.htm" title="And the servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?">1Samuel 21:11</a>), and identical with Achish, son of Maachah (<a href="/1_kings/2-39.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants be in Gath.">1Kings 2:39</a>). This would involve the necessity of ascribing a fifty years' reign to this prince. (Such a lengthy reign is quite possible.) The whole of Philistia subsequently fell under King David's rule. It seems, however, that he permitted, even after the conquest, Achish to remain in his old city of Gath, most likely as his tributary: thus, we may suppose, paying back the old debt of kindness to Achish.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Achish, the son of Maoch.</span> No doubt the Achish of <a href="/1_samuel/21-10.htm">1 Samuel 21:10</a>; but if the same as <span class="cmt_word">Achish, son of Maachah,</span> in <a href="/1_kings/2-39.htm">1 Kings 2:39</a>, as is probably the case, he must have lived to a good old age. As it is said in <a href="/1_chronicles/18-1.htm">1 Chronicles 18:1</a> that David conquered the Philistines, and took from them Gath and other towns, it would seem that he still permitted Achish to remain there as a tributary king, while Ziklag he kept as his private property (ver. 6). On the former occasion,. when David was alone, Achish had paid him but scant courtesy; but now that he came with 600 warriors, each <span class="cmt_word">with his household,</span> and, therefore, with numerous followers, he shows him every respect, and for the time David and his men settle at Gath, and Saul gives over his pursuit, knowing that if he followed him into Philistine territory he would provoke a war, for which he was not now prepared. It has been pointed out that David probably introduced from Gath the style of music called Gittith (<a href="/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8, 81, 84</a>, titles).
