Samuel, as a prophet, speaks with authority from God. Saul's actions are considered foolish because they demonstrate a lack of trust in God's timing and instructions. This phrase highlights the importance of obedience and wisdom in leadership, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>, where the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.<p><b>&#8220;You have not kept the command that the LORD your God gave you;&#8221;</b><br>This refers to Saul's failure to wait for Samuel to offer the burnt offering, as instructed in <a href="/1_samuel/10-8.htm">1 Samuel 10:8</a>. Saul's impatience and presumption led him to take on a priestly role, which was not his to assume. This disobedience is significant because it shows a disregard for God's established order and commands. The importance of obedience to God's commands is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are tied to obedience.<p><b>&#8220;if you had, the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time.&#8221;</b><br>This statement underscores the conditional nature of God's promises based on obedience. Saul's dynasty could have been established permanently, similar to the Davidic covenant later promised to David in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>. The concept of a lasting kingdom is also a type of the eternal kingdom of Jesus Christ, who is from the line of David and whose kingdom is established forever, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a>.

Scripture calls such conduct &#8220;foolish&#8221; because it ignores God&#8217;s revealed will (<a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>; <a href="/proverbs/10-8.htm">Proverbs 10:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Genuine wisdom begins with reverent submission to God (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).

He knew, moreover, how much depended upon his waiting, and that obedience to the prophet's command was an essential condition of his appointment. Nevertheless, in his impatience and distrust of Jehovah, he cannot bide the set time; not really because of any wish to propitiate God, but because of the effect to be produced upon the mind of the people. It was tedious to remain inactive; his position in the plains was. untenable; at any moment his retreat to the mountains might be cut off; and so he prefers the part of a prudent general to that of an obedient and trustful servant of God. And we may notice that there is no confession of wrong on his part. His mind rather seems entirely occupied with his duty as a king, without having regard to the higher King, whom it ought to have been his first duty to obey. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/13-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;You have acted foolishly,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1460;&#1505;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1500;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(nis&#183;k&#257;&#183;l&#601;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Perfect - second person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5528.htm">Strong's 5528: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be foolish or a fool</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Samuel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1461;&#1435;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8050.htm">Strong's 8050: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samuel -- 'name of God', a prophet of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">declared.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1447;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
