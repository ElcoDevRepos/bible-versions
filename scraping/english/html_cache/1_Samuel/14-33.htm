It reflects the hierarchical structure of ancient Israelite society, where the king was the central authority. The act of reporting suggests a sense of accountability and the importance of maintaining religious and moral order. This is consistent with the role of leaders in Israel, who were expected to uphold the covenant with God.<p><b>Look, the troops are sinning against the LORD:</b><br>The troops' actions are described as sinning against the LORD, highlighting the seriousness of their offense. In the Mosaic Law, consuming blood was strictly prohibited (<a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>), as blood was considered the life force and belonged to God. This underscores the importance of obedience to God's commands and the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<p><b>by eating meat with the blood still in it:</b><br>This specific sin involves the consumption of blood, which was forbidden in the dietary laws given to Israel. The prohibition against eating blood is rooted in the belief that life is sacred and belongs to God. This commandment is reiterated in the New Testament (<a href="/acts/15-20.htm">Acts 15:20</a>), showing its continued significance. The act of eating meat with blood reflects a disregard for divine law and a lapse in spiritual discipline.<p><b>&#8220;You have broken faith,&#8221; said Saul:</b><br>Saul's response indicates a breach of faithfulness to God's commandments. Breaking faith implies a violation of trust and covenant obligations. Saul's role as king included ensuring that the people adhered to God's laws. This moment reflects the tension between Saul's leadership and the spiritual state of the nation, foreshadowing his eventual downfall due to disobedience.<p><b>&#8220;Roll a large stone over here at once.&#8221;</b><br>Saul's command to roll a large stone suggests a practical solution to the problem. The stone would be used as an altar or platform for properly slaughtering the animals, ensuring the blood was drained according to the law. This action demonstrates a return to proper worship practices and an attempt to rectify the sin. It also reflects the importance of immediate repentance and correction in maintaining a right relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Hunger drives the men to slaughter the captured animals improperly. An observer steps forward and alerts Saul&#8212;a needed act of accountability reminiscent of Nathan confronting David later (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1-7</a>). Such reporting protects the holiness of the community (<a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-1.htm">Galatians 6:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Look, the troops are sinning against the LORD by eating meat with the blood still in it.&#8221;</b><p>The charge is precise: they are violating God&#8217;s explicit prohibition against consuming blood (<a href="/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/12-23.htm">Deuteronomy 12:23-25</a>).<p>Why this mattered:<p>&#8226; Blood represents life given by God and reserved for atonement&#8212;treating it casually demeans both the Giver and His covenant.<p>&#8226; Their haste exposed a deeper issue: victory had dulled their vigilance toward God&#8217;s commands, echoing later warnings like <a href="/1_corinthians/10-12.htm">1 Corinthians 10:12</a>, &#8220;So the one who thinks he is standing firm should be careful not to fall.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;You have broken faith,&#8221; said Saul.</b><p>Saul rightly identifies the offense as covenant breach (<a href="/numbers/15-30.htm">Numbers 15:30-31</a>; <a href="/joshua/7-1.htm">Joshua 7:1</a>).

Hunger, impatience, and inadequate leadership combined to breach God&#8217;s clear command about blood. Saul&#8217;s swift corrective measures underscore that restoring obedience matters more than preserving pride. The passage calls believers to guard against rash decisions, remain alert to God&#8217;s standards even in success, and act promptly to restore holiness when sin surfaces.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">Roll a great stone unto me this day.</span>--The object of this was that the people should kill their beasts upon the stone, and the blood could run off upon the ground. It was a rough expedient, but it showed the wild soldiers that their king and general determined that the Law of Moses should be kept and honoured, even under circumstances of the direst necessity. This scrupulous care for the "Law of the Lord" at such a time as the evening of the battle of Michmash shows us what a strange complex character was Saul's: now superstitiously watchful lest the letter of the Law should be broken; now recklessly careless whether or not the most solemn commands of God were executed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 33, 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye have transgressed.</span> Better as in the margin, "dealt treacherously," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> faithlessly, to the covenant between Israel and Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">Roll a great stone unto me this day.</span> Or, as we should say, <span class="accented">this minute</span>; but the Hebrew uses "this day" for anything to be done at once (see on ch. 2:16).
