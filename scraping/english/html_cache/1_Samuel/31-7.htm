The valley likely refers to the Jezreel Valley, a strategic location in northern Israel. The mention of "the other side of the Jordan" suggests the eastern tribes of Israel, such as Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, who were settled there. The flight of the army signifies a complete military collapse, which would have been demoralizing for the Israelites and indicative of a significant loss of leadership and morale.<p><b>and that Saul and his sons had died</b><br>The death of Saul and his sons, including Jonathan, marks the end of Saul's reign and the beginning of a transition in Israel's monarchy. Saul's death fulfills the prophecy given by Samuel in <a href="/1_samuel/28-19.htm">1 Samuel 28:19</a>, where he foretold that Saul and his sons would die in battle. This event also sets the stage for David's rise to kingship, as Saul's death removes the primary obstacle to David's anointing as king over Israel.<p><b>they abandoned their cities and ran away</b><br>The abandonment of cities reflects the fear and panic among the Israelites following the defeat. In ancient times, cities were centers of security and refuge, so leaving them indicates a severe threat to their safety. This reaction underscores the vulnerability of Israel without strong leadership and the immediate threat posed by the Philistines.<p><b>So the Philistines came and occupied their cities</b><br>The occupation of Israelite cities by the Philistines demonstrates the shift in power and control in the region. The Philistines, long-time adversaries of Israel, took advantage of the situation to expand their territory and influence. This occupation would have had significant cultural and religious implications, as the Philistines brought their own practices and deities into the conquered areas, challenging the Israelites' covenantal relationship with Yahweh. This event foreshadows the ongoing struggle between the Israelites and the Philistines, which continues into the reign of David, who eventually subdues them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_israel.htm">Men of Israel</a></b><br>The Israelite soldiers and inhabitants who were on the other side of the valley and across the Jordan.

Yet it also prepares the stage for God&#8217;s restoration through a new, righteous king, reminding us that ultimate security is found in steadfast obedience to the Lord and trust in His appointed Messiah.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">On the other side of the valley.</span>--The words "on the other side of the valley" denote the country opposite to the battle-field in the valley of Jezreel, on which the writer supposes himself to be standing, the land occupied especially by the tribes of Issachar, Zabulon, and Napthali. The expression "on the other side of Jordan," is the usual phrase for the country east of the River Jordan. It is highly probable that the alarm caused by the great defeat of their king caused many of the dwellers in the smaller cities and villages to the east of Jordan hastily to abandon their houses rather than be exposed to the insolence and demands of the invading army. Still the Philistine army in this direction could not have penetrated very far, as shortly after Gilboa we hear of Abner rallying the friends of the house of Saul round the Prince Ishbosheth, whom he proclaimed king at Mahanaim, a town some twenty miles east of the river. The country to the south of the plain of Jezreel does not appear to have been overrun by the victorious army. The presence of David in that part no doubt insured its immunity from invasion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The men of Israel.</span> The term is here applied to non-combatants, while in ver. 1 it meant those following Saul in arms. <span class="cmt_word">On the other side of the valley.</span> <span class="accented">I.e</span>. of Jezreel, and so all the Israelites inhabiting the tribes of Issachar, Zabulon, and Naphthali, and the region generally to the north. In <a href="/1_chronicles/10-7.htm">1 Chronicles 10:7</a> this flight is confined to the inhabitants of the valley, one of the most fertile districts of Palestine; but probably the statement made here, that a very large extent of country was the prize of victory, is the more correct. <span class="cmt_word">On the other side Jordan.</span> This phrase constantly means the eastern side of the Jordan, nor need we doubt but that the people living near it abandoned their homes and fled; for the river would form but a slight protection for them in this northerly part of its course. Still the conquests on the eastern bank of the Jordan must have been confined to a small district near the lake of Tiberias, as Abner was able to place Ishbosheth as king at Mahanaim, a town about twenty miles to the east of the river, and not far from Jabez-Gilead. South of Jezreel the Philistines made no conquests, and thus Ephraim, Benjamin, and Judah remained free, and of course Gilead, and the most part of the region beyond Jordan (see <a href="/2_samuel/2-8.htm">2 Samuel 2:8-11</a>).
