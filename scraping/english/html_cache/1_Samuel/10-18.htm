The Israelites, as the chosen people, are often addressed collectively in the Old Testament, highlighting their covenant relationship with God. This communal address is consistent with the theocratic society of ancient Israel, where national identity and religious faith were intertwined.<p><b>&#8220;This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says:</b><br>The introduction of a divine message underscores the authority and importance of the words that follow. The title "the LORD, the God of Israel" reaffirms the covenant relationship established at Sinai (Exodus 19-24).

This deliverance is a type of Christ's ultimate salvation, as Jesus is seen as the one who delivers humanity from the bondage of sin (<a href="/john/8-34.htm">John 8:34-36</a>). The historical context of the Exodus also emphasizes God's role as a warrior and protector of Israel.<p><b>and of all the kingdoms that oppressed you.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase expands the scope of God's deliverance beyond Egypt to include all oppressive kingdoms. It reflects the ongoing struggles Israel faced with surrounding nations throughout their history, such as the Canaanites, Philistines, and later empires like Assyria and Babylon.
