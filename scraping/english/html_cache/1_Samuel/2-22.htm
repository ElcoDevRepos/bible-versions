His age suggests a lifetime of service, yet it also implies a potential decline in his ability to effectively manage his responsibilities, particularly concerning his sons. In biblical culture, age was often associated with wisdom and respect, yet here it underscores Eli's inability to control his household, a critical failure for a leader in Israel.<p><b>and he heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel</b><br>Eli's sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests who abused their positions, committing acts that were not only sinful but also detrimental to the spiritual well-being of the nation. Their actions included taking more than their share of the sacrifices (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>), which was a direct violation of the Levitical laws. This phrase indicates that their misconduct was widely known, affecting the entire community of Israel and leading to a loss of respect for the priesthood.<p><b>and how they were sleeping with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting</b><br>This behavior was a grave sin, as it involved sexual immorality and the desecration of a sacred space. The women mentioned were likely part of a group dedicated to serving at the Tabernacle, similar to the women who served at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting in <a href="/exodus/38-8.htm">Exodus 38:8</a>. The actions of Eli's sons were not only a personal moral failing but also a corruption of the religious practices of Israel, drawing parallels to the pagan practices of surrounding nations. This behavior foreshadows the eventual downfall of Eli's house, as prophesied by the man of God in <a href="/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27-36</a>. The corruption of the priesthood here contrasts with the purity and faithfulness expected of God's servants, pointing to the need for a righteous priest, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who serves as our perfect High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli.htm">Eli</a></b><br>The high priest of Israel at the time, Eli was responsible for the spiritual leadership of the nation.

Hearing of their actions obligated him to intervene for the sake of all Israel&#8217;s worship. Hophni and Phinehas turned the holy place into a venue for self&#8211;indulgence, corrupting sacrifice and sexuality alike. Their sin underscores that leaders influence everyone under their care and that God will act decisively when His sanctuary is profaned.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Now Eli was very old.</span>--The compiler of these Books of Samuel was evidently wishful to speak as kindly as possible of Eli. He had, no doubt, deserved well of Israel in past days; and though it was clear that through his weak indulgence for his wicked sons, and his own lack of energy and foresight, he had brought discredit on the national sanctuary, and, in the end, defeat and shame on the people, yet the compiler evidently loved to dwell on the brightest side of the old high priest's character--his piety, his generous love for Samuel, his patriotism, &c.; and here, where the shameful conduct of Hophni and Phinehas is dwelt on, an excuse is made for their father, Eli. "He was," says the writer, "very old."<p><span class= "bld">The women that assembled.</span>--These women were evidently in some way connected with the service of the Tabernacle; possibly they assisted in the liturgical portion of the sanctuary worship. (Compare <a href="/psalms/68-11.htm" title="The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.">Psalm 68:11</a> : "The Lord gave the word, great was the company of female singers.") Here, as <span class= "ital">so </span>often in the world's story, immorality follows on unbelief.<p>In <a href="/context/psalms/78-60.htm" title="So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;">Psalm 78:60-64</a>, the punishment of the guilty priests and the forsaking of the defiled sanctuary is recorded. The psalmist Asaph relates how, in His anger at the people's sin, God greatly abhorred Israel, so that He "forsook the Tabernacle at Shiloh--even the tent that He had pitched among men. He delivered their power into captivity, and their beauty into the enemy's hand. The fire consumed their young men, and their maidens were not given to marriage. Their priests were slain with the sword, and there were no widows to make lamentation."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Eli... heard all that his sons did</span>. To the profanity and greed described in vers. 12-17 the sons of Eli added unchastity; and their sin was the greater because the women whom they corrupted were those dedicated to religious service (see <a href="/exodus/38-8.htm">Exodus 38:8</a>). The order of ministering women instituted by Moses probably lasted down to the destruction of the temple, and Anna may have belonged to it (<a href="/luke/2-37.htm">Luke 2:37</a>); afterwards it appeared again in a more spiritual form in the widows and deaconesses of the Christian Church. The word rendered <span class="cmt_word">assembled</span> means "arranged in bands," and shows not merely that they were numerous, but that they had regular duties assigned them, and each one her proper place and office. The frequent sacrifices, with the feasts which followed, must have provided occupation for a large number of hands in the cleaning of the utensils and the cooking of the food. But though Eli heard of the depraved conduct of his sons in thus defiling those who ministered in the tabernacle, he gives them but the faintest rebuke, and that apparently only because their misdeeds were in everybody's mouth; for the last clause of ver. 23 really is, "For I hear of your evil doings from all this people." Eli's old age may have increased his indifference, but his religious character could never have had much depth or earnestness, to allow him to regard such heinous sins so lightly. It seems even as if he chiefly felt the annoyance occasioned to himself by the expostulations urged upon him "from all this people." Still all that he says is wise and thoughtful. The sins of men in high station do not end with themselves; they make others also to transgress. And as Eli's sons were Jehovah's ministers, and they had led into wickedness those who also were bound to holy service, their misconduct was a sin against Jehovah himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/2-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Eli</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;l&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
