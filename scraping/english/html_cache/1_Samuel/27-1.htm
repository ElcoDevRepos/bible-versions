It highlights a moment of personal crisis and fear, as David contemplates his future. This introspection is a common theme in the Psalms, many of which are attributed to David, where he often reflects on his circumstances and seeks God's guidance.<p><b>One of these days now I will be swept away by the hand of Saul</b><br>David acknowledges the persistent threat posed by King Saul, who has been pursuing him relentlessly. This reflects the historical context of Saul's jealousy and fear of David, who was anointed by Samuel to be the next king of Israel. The phrase "swept away" suggests a sense of inevitability and danger, emphasizing David's precarious situation. This fear is consistent with previous encounters where Saul attempted to kill David (1 Samuel 18-26).<p><b>There is nothing better for me than to escape to the land of the Philistines</b><br>David considers seeking refuge among the Philistines, Israel's traditional enemies. This decision underscores the desperation of his situation, as he chooses to align temporarily with those who oppose his own people. The Philistines were a significant power in the region, and their territory offered a potential safe haven. This move is strategic, as it removes David from Saul's immediate reach.<p><b>Then Saul will stop searching for me all over Israel</b><br>David anticipates that by leaving Israel, Saul will cease his pursuit. This reflects the political and geographical realities of the time, where crossing into enemy territory would make it difficult for Saul to justify continued pursuit. It also highlights Saul's focus on internal threats, as he would be less likely to chase David into Philistine lands.<p><b>and I will slip out of his hand</b><br>The imagery of slipping out of Saul's hand suggests evasion and escape from danger. It conveys David's hope for relief from constant threat and pursuit. This phrase also foreshadows David's eventual rise to power, as he continues to evade Saul's grasp until Saul's death. David's ability to escape Saul's hand can be seen as a testament to God's providence and protection over his anointed servant, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of God's faithfulness to His chosen leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, currently fleeing from King Saul who seeks his life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is pursuing David out of jealousy and fear of losing his throne.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A neighboring people and traditional enemies of Israel, among whom David seeks refuge.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/l/land_of_the_philistines.htm">Land of the Philistines</a></b><br>The territory where David plans to escape to avoid Saul's pursuit.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/david's_internal_struggle.htm">David's Internal Struggle</a></b><br>David's decision-making process as he contemplates his safety and future.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>David's decision to flee reflects a moment of doubt in God's timing.

Convinced Saul will eventually kill him, he devises his own escape by living among the Philistines. The verse illustrates how fear can eclipse divine promises, leading even the strongest believers to lean on human strategies. Yet God&#8217;s faithfulness remains; He will guide David through the consequences of this choice and keep His word to seat him on Israel&#8217;s throne.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">And David said in his heart.</span>--David's position seems to have grown more and more untenable during the latter days of Saul's reign. Probably the paroxysms of the king's fatal malady grew sharper and more frequent, and his chieftains and favourites, whom, as we have already seen (1 Samuel 26), he had chosen mostly out of the one small tribe of Benjamin, feared--and with good reason--the advent of David to the throne, which they saw was imminent in the event of Saul's dying or being permanently disqualified to rule. These men, whose bitter hostility to David is more than hinted at in several places, doubtless taking advantage of the king's state of mind, incited him against David. The words and persuasions of such men as Cush the Benjamite (see Psalms 7), Doeg the Edomite, probably Abner the captain of the host, the men of Ziph, and others, quickly erased from the memory of Saul such scenes as we have witnessed in the En-gedi cave, and, still more recently, in the hill of Hachilah, and more than counterbalanced the devotion and powerful friendship of true warriors like Jonathan, who loved and admired David. In David's words, after he had taken the spear and cruse from the side of the sleeping Saul, we see something of what was passing in his mind--his constant fear of a violent death; his knowledge that powerful and wicked men were constantly plotting against him; and his determination to seek a home in another land, where, however, he expected to find a grave far away from the chosen race, among the idolators and enemies of Jehovah of Israel. He now realises a part of these sorrowful forebodings. But in this determination of the son of Jesse we never hear of prayer, or of consultation with prophet or with priest. A dull despair seems to have at this time deprived David at once of faith and hope.<p><span class= "bld">Into the land of the Philistines.</span>--David chose to seek a refuge among these warlike people, for he believed he would be in greater security there than among his friendly kinsfolk, the Moabites, where, in former days, he had found such a kindly welcome for his family in the first period of Saul's enmity. He probably doubted the power of Moab to protect him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Ver 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David said in his heart.</span> Hebrew, "to his heart," to himself (see <a href="/1_samuel/1-13.htm">1 Samuel 1:13</a>). l shall perish by the hand. The verb is that used in <a href="/1_samuel/12-25.htm">1 Samuel 12:25</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/26-10.htm">1 Samuel 26:10</a>, but instead of <span class="accented">by the hand</span> the Hebrew has <span class="accented">into the hand.</span> Hence the versions generally render it, "I shall some day fall into the hand." Really it is a <span class="accented">proegnans constructio</span>: "I shall perish by failing into the hand of Saul." It was the second treachery of the Ziphites which made David feel that, surrounded as he was by spies, there was no safety for him but in taking that course to which, as he so sorrowfully complained to Saul, his enemies were driving him (<a href="/1_samuel/26-19.htm">1 Samuel 26:19</a>). His words there show that the thought of quitting Judaea was already in his mind, so that this chapter follows naturally on ch. 26, and not, as some have argued, upon ch. 24. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/27-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">David, however,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
