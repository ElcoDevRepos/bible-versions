By sacrificing his own oxen, issuing a stark warning, and standing alongside Samuel, he calls Israel to obedience. God validates the call by sending holy fear, uniting every tribe in a single, ready army. The verse teaches that when God ordains leadership, bold obedience and divine power work together to rally His people for deliverance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">A yoke of oxen.</span>--In a moment all the great powers of Saul, hitherto dormant, woke up, and he issued his swift commands in a way which at once showed Israel that they had got a hero-king who would brook no trifling. In that self-same hour, striking dead the oxen standing before his plough, he hews them in pieces, and handing a bloody strip to certain of the men standing around him, weeping for grief and shame and the wrong done to Israel, bade them swiftly bear these terrible war-signals throughout the length and breadth of the land, and by these means to rouse the nation to prompt action.<p>On this strange war-signal of king Saul, Ewald, in his <span class= "ital">History of Israel, </span>Book II., section iii. 1 (note), remarks, "how in like manner it was formerly the custom in Norway to send on the war-arrow; and in Scotland a fire-brand, with both ends dipped in blood, was dispatched as a war-token."<p>Not improbably Saul cut the oxen into eleven pieces, and sent one to each of the other tribes.<p><span class= "bld">And the fear of the Lord fell on the people.</span>--It was some such mighty awakening under the influence of the Spirit of the Eternal, as is here related of King Saul, which suggested to the poet Asaph the bold but splendid image of the seventy-eighth Psalm, when, after describing in moving language the degradation and bitter woe of fallen Israel, the singer, struck with a new inspiration, bursts forth with "Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. And he smote his enemies," &c. (<a href="/psalms/78-65.htm" title="Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouts by reason of wine.">Psalm 78:65</a>). "The people rose as one man" (see margin) against the enemies of their national freedom. It was the same Spirit of the Lord which inspired Saul to put himself at the head of the children of Israel which now laid hold of all the people, lifting them up, and giving them new strength and resistless courage, and the mighty feeling that God was with them.<p>It was owing to some influence of a similar nature that with scanty numbers, ill-armed and ill-trained, the Swiss won for their land centuries of freedom on memorable fields like Laupen and Morat, though the proudest chivalry of Europe was arrayed against them. it was the same Spirit which impelled the peace-loving traders of the marshes of Holland to rise as one man, and to drive out for ever from their loved strip of fen land the hitherto invincible armies of Spain. No oppressor, though backed by the wealth and power of an empire, has ever been able to resist the smallest people in whose heart has burned the flame of the Divine fire of the "fear of the Lord."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - Acting then with Divine enthusiasm, Saul cut into pieces a yoke of oxen, and sent them <span class="cmt_word">throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers.</span> For a similar act see <a href="/judges/19-29.htm">Judges 19:29</a>. Probably Saul cut the oxen into twelve pieces, and sent one to each tribe, with the threat that in case of disobedience their oxen would be similarly treated. The threat was moderate in that it did not touch their persons, but severe as regards their property, the labouring ox being man's faithful friend and servant. It is important also to notice that Saul speaks not only in his own name, but also in that of Samuel. It was as the man chosen of Jehovah to be king by the voice of his prophet that he acted, and so as one possessed of legitimate authority; and it seems also that Samuel went with him in person to the war (ver. 12). And the result answered to the energy with which Saul acted, for <span class="cmt_word">the fear of Jehovah</span> - or, rather, "a terror from Jehovah" - <span class="cmt_word">fell on the people, and they came out with one consent,</span> or, as it is rendered far more correctly and forcibly in the margin, "as one man." United by the kingly power, it was a nation that rose to defend one of its injured members. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/11-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
