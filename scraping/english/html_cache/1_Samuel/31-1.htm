They were a seafaring people who settled along the coastal regions of Canaan. Their conflict with Israel is a recurring theme, highlighting the ongoing struggle between the Israelites and their pagan neighbors. This battle is part of a larger narrative of Israel's struggle to maintain its identity and faithfulness to God amidst external pressures. The Philistines' advanced military technology, including iron weaponry, often gave them an advantage over the Israelites.<p><b>and the men of Israel fled before them</b><br>The Israelites' retreat indicates a significant defeat, reflecting a moment of crisis for the nation. This phrase underscores the demoralization and fear that had gripped the Israelite army. Historically, this defeat can be attributed to the lack of strong leadership, as King Saul's reign was marked by disobedience to God, leading to divine disfavor. The Israelites' flight is reminiscent of other instances in the Bible where God's people faced consequences for their unfaithfulness, such as in the battles described in the Book of Judges.<p><b>and many fell slain on Mount Gilboa</b><br>Mount Gilboa is a significant geographical location in the biblical narrative. It is situated in the northern part of Israel, near the Jezreel Valley. The mountain's mention here is crucial as it becomes the site of King Saul's death, marking the end of his troubled reign. The defeat at Mount Gilboa fulfills Samuel's prophecy of Saul's downfall due to his disobedience to God (<a href="/1_samuel/28-19.htm">1 Samuel 28:19</a>). This event sets the stage for David's rise to kingship, a pivotal moment in Israel's history. Theologically, the fall of Saul and his army serves as a somber reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A significant enemy of Israel throughout the Old Testament, known for their military prowess and frequent conflicts with the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, often depicted in the Old Testament as struggling with faithfulness and obedience to God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_gilboa.htm">Mount Gilboa</a></b><br>A mountain range in northern Israel, significant as the site of the battle where King Saul and his sons were killed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/battle.htm">Battle</a></b><br>The event described in this verse is a critical battle between the Philistines and Israelites, leading to a significant defeat for Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fleeing_israelites.htm">Fleeing Israelites</a></b><br>The men of Israel fled, indicating a lack of morale and possibly a lack of faith, leading to their defeat.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Israel's defeat can be seen as a result of their disobedience and lack of faith in God.

Yet the accuracy of this judgment also assures us that every promise of mercy and future restoration will be kept with equal certainty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Now the Philistines fought against Israel.</span>--The narrator here is very abrupt. No doubt a devoted patriot, it was very bitter for him to write the story of the fatal day of Gilboa. Yet there were certain things belonging to that fated day which were necessary for every child of Israel to know. It was right that the punishment of the rejected king should be known; right too that the people should be assured that the remains of the great first king lay in no unknown and unhonoured sepulchre. It was well too that coming generations should honour the devoted loyalty of the grateful men of Jabesh-Gilead. But the narrator hurries over his unwelcome task; very curtly he picks up the dropped threads of <a href="/context/1_samuel/28-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel. And Achish said to David, Know you assuredly, that you shall go out with me to battle, you and your men.">1Samuel 28:1-5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/29-2.htm" title="And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rear guard with Achish.">1Samuel 29:2</a>. The march of the Philistines northward into the valley of Jezreel has been told, and their gallant array--as under the many banners of their lords they passed on by hundreds and by thousands--has been glanced at. The assembling of the armies of Israel at Shunem, overlooking the Jezreel vale, has been narrated; and there the historian dwelt on the terror of King Saul, which led to the visit to the witch of En-dor. David's fortunes at this juncture then occupied the writer or compiler of the Book; but now he returns, with evident reluctance, to the battle which rapidly followed the En-dor visit of Saul.<p>He simply relates that the hosts joined battle. The locality of the fight is not mentioned, but it was most likely somewhere in that long vale which was spread out at the foot of the hills occupied by the hostile camps Israel was defeated, and fled upwards, towards their old position on the slope of Gilboa.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Philistines fought.</span> Literally it is a participle present, "the Philistines are warring," as if it were a mere resumption of <a href="/1_samuel/28-1.htm">1 Samuel 28:1</a>.
