David's willingness to risk his life demonstrates his trust in God rather than in human strength or armor. This act is a pivotal moment in Israel's history, showcasing God's power to deliver through unlikely means. The phrase "took his life in his hands" indicates the extreme danger and personal risk involved, highlighting David's bravery and reliance on divine intervention.<p><b>and the LORD worked a great salvation for all Israel</b><br>The victory over Goliath was not just a personal triumph for David but a significant deliverance for the entire nation of Israel. This event is a testament to God's faithfulness and His ability to save His people through unexpected instruments. The term "great salvation" underscores the magnitude of the victory, which turned the tide against the Philistines and brought peace and security to Israel. This deliverance is a type of the ultimate salvation that God provides through Jesus Christ, who delivers humanity from sin and death.<p><b>You saw it and rejoiced</b><br>This part of the verse is directed at Saul, reminding him of his initial reaction to David's victory. Saul's joy at the time indicates his recognition of God's hand in the event. It serves as a reminder of the shared national celebration and the acknowledgment of God's intervention. This joy contrasts with Saul's later jealousy and hostility towards David, highlighting the change in Saul's heart and his departure from God's will.<p><b>so why would you sin against innocent blood by killing David for no reason?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges Saul's intentions to harm David, who is described as "innocent." The phrase "innocent blood" is significant in biblical law, which condemns the shedding of innocent blood (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-10.htm">Deuteronomy 19:10</a>). The question underscores the moral and spiritual implications of Saul's actions, urging him to reconsider his unjustified hostility. It also reflects the biblical principle of justice and the protection of the innocent, which is a recurring theme throughout Scripture. David, as a type of Christ, prefigures the ultimate innocent one, Jesus, who was also unjustly persecuted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd who became a hero in Israel after defeating Goliath, the Philistine giant.

Risking everything for God&#8217;s people echoes Jephthah&#8217;s words in <a href="/judges/12-3.htm">Judges 12:3</a> and foreshadows <a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>. Courage like this is never reckless self-display; it is faith-driven obedience that trusts God more than personal safety (cf. <a href="/acts/15-26.htm">Acts 15:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When he struck down the Philistine</b><p>The single Philistine is Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-49.htm">1 Samuel 17:49-51</a>). David&#8217;s victory was not a lucky swing but the climax of confident reliance on the LORD (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-47</a>). Saul cannot deny the historic reality he once celebrated&#8212;David stood where the king himself would not.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The LORD worked a great salvation for all Israel</b><p>Jonathan anchors David&#8217;s success in divine action, echoing <a href="/1_samuel/14-23.htm">1 Samuel 14:23</a> when &#8220;the LORD saved Israel&#8221; through Jonathan. Salvation belongs to the LORD (<a href="/psalms/3-8.htm">Psalm 3:8</a>), and He used David as His chosen instrument. Recognizing God&#8217;s hand leaves no room for jealousy; it calls for worship (<a href="/psalms/118-23.htm">Psalm 118:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You saw it and rejoiced</b><p>Saul personally witnessed the triumph and initially shared the nation&#8217;s joyful acclaim (<a href="/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6-7</a>). Jonathan appeals to that truthful memory, urging his father to return to earlier clarity before envy clouded his judgment (cf. <a href="/galatians/4-15.htm">Galatians 4:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why would you sin against innocent blood by killing David for no reason?</b><p>To shed innocent blood violates God&#8217;s explicit commands (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-10.htm">Deuteronomy 19:10</a>). David has committed no crime; executing him would be murder. Jonathan&#8217;s question exposes Saul&#8217;s intent as lawless and warns that persisting would make Saul fight not David but God Himself (<a href="/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jonathan&#8217;s plea strings together five undeniable facts: David risked his life, defeated Goliath, was God&#8217;s chosen means of national deliverance, brought Saul joy, and remains innocent. Any move to kill David would reject God&#8217;s salvation, break God&#8217;s law, and stain Saul with the guilt of innocent blood.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/19-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1501;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#347;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
