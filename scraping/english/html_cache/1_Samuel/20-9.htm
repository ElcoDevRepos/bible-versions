This strong denial reflects the covenantal bond between Jonathan and David, which is a central theme in their relationship. The use of "Never!" indicates Jonathan's determination to protect David, even against his own father, King Saul. This loyalty can be seen as a foreshadowing of the ultimate loyalty and sacrifice demonstrated by Jesus Christ for humanity.<p><b>Jonathan replied.</b><br>Jonathan's role as the son of King Saul and heir to the throne places him in a complex position. His reply signifies his willingness to prioritize his friendship with David over his familial duties. This act of selflessness is reminiscent of the biblical principle of putting others before oneself, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>. Jonathan's actions serve as a model of true friendship and integrity.<p><b>If I ever found out that my father had evil intentions against you,</b><br>This phrase highlights the tension between Jonathan's loyalty to David and his relationship with his father, Saul. The historical context reveals Saul's growing jealousy and paranoia towards David, which is documented throughout 1 Samuel. Jonathan's awareness of his father's potential for evil intentions is significant, as it shows his discernment and understanding of the situation. This also reflects the biblical theme of the struggle between good and evil intentions, as seen in <a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>.<p><b>would I not tell you?</b><br>Jonathan's rhetorical question emphasizes his commitment to transparency and honesty with David. This assurance of communication is crucial in their covenant, as it provides David with the necessary information to protect himself from Saul's wrath. The trust between Jonathan and David is a powerful example of covenantal faithfulness, akin to the faithfulness God shows to His people. This phrase also echoes the biblical principle of being a faithful witness, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/14-5.htm">Proverbs 14:5</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul and a close friend of David.

Paul calls shepherds to &#8220;pay careful attention&#8221; to the flock (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also underscores personal responsibility: Jonathan does not leave David&#8217;s safety to rumor; he will verify facts (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Faith never excuses passivity; it acts on truth (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that my father had evil intentions against you</b><p>&#8226; Jonathan names sin for what it is&#8212;&#8220;evil intentions.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Family loyalty does not override loyalty to righteousness (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>).<p>&#8226; The tension illustrates Jesus&#8217; teaching that allegiance to God&#8217;s anointed (foreshadowed in David) surpasses every earthly tie (<a href="/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Jonathan&#8217;s candor also highlights the biblical principle of exposing rather than covering unrepentant wrongdoing (<a href="/ephesians/5-11.htm">Ephesians 5:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>would I not tell you?</b><p>&#8226; Jonathan pledges full disclosure, promising to warn David at personal cost.<p>&#8226; This is covenant accountability (<a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3&#8211;4</a>). True fellowship involves truthful communication (<a href="/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a>).<p>&#8226; His question functions rhetorically&#8212;of course he would tell. Similar constructions appear when God guarantees action: &#8220;Will I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/18-17.htm">Genesis 18:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Jonathan&#8217;s commitment foreshadows the Spirit&#8217;s ministry of revealing danger and guiding believers into all truth (<a href="/john/16-13.htm">John 16:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/20-9.htm">1 Samuel 20:9</a> records Jonathan&#8217;s firm vow of loyalty to David. He utterly rejects the idea of concealing Saul&#8217;s malice (&#8220;Never!&#8221;), assumes the role of faithful protector, commits to verify any threat, prioritizes righteousness over family ties, and promises full warning. The verse models covenant love that is vigilant, truthful, and self&#8208;sacrificing&#8212;anticipating the ultimate faithfulness of Christ to His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Far be it from thee.</span>--Vulg., <span class= "ital">absit hoc a te. </span>This strong expression bears emphatic testimony to Jonathan's implicit belief in his loved friend's stainless loyalty. He indignantly refuses to take his life, or even to allow that life to be touched by his father. The sentences here are broken ones; the next one following is left, in the Hebrew, incomplete. They betoken the agitation and deep feeling of the chivalrous, indignant speaker.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Far be it,</span> the word rendered <span class="accented">God forbid</span> in ver. 2. It indignantly rejects the idea of David having committed any crime. The rest of the verse is an incomplete sentence: "If I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, and did not tell thee -" These broken sentences have great force in the original, as signs of intense feeling (comp. <a href="/luke/19-42.htm">Luke 19:42</a>).
