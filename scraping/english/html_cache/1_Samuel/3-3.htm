The lamp symbolizes God's presence and guidance. The timing indicates the early morning hours, suggesting a period of transition and new beginnings. The lamp's light represents spiritual illumination and the ongoing revelation of God to His people.<p><b>Samuel was lying down</b><br>Samuel, a young boy dedicated to the Lord by his mother Hannah, was serving under Eli the priest. His lying down signifies his readiness to receive God's message. This posture of rest and openness is symbolic of a servant's heart, prepared to hear and obey God's call. Samuel's position also contrasts with Eli's spiritual dullness, highlighting the theme of God raising new leadership.<p><b>in the temple of the LORD</b><br>The term "temple" here refers to the tabernacle at Shiloh, the central place of worship before the construction of Solomon's Temple. This location is significant as it was the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. The tabernacle served as a meeting point between God and Israel, emphasizing the sacredness of Samuel's environment and his proximity to divine revelation.<p><b>where the ark of God was located</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant, housed in the Most Holy Place, symbolized God's throne and His covenant with Israel. It contained the tablets of the Law, Aaron's rod, and a pot of manna, representing God's law, leadership, and provision. Samuel's proximity to the ark underscores the gravity of his calling and the direct communication he would receive from God. The ark's presence signifies God's faithfulness and the continuity of His promises, foreshadowing the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who is the true presence of God among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A young boy dedicated to the service of the Lord by his mother, Hannah.
