This moment is significant as it marks a transition from the period of judges to the monarchy. Samuel's role as a leader and prophet is crucial, as he serves as a bridge between these two eras. His address to "all Israel" indicates the unity and collective identity of the tribes, emphasizing the importance of national cohesion under God's covenant.<p><b>I have listened to your voice</b><br>Samuel acknowledges the people's request for a king, which they made in <a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>. This phrase highlights the democratic aspect of Israel's governance at the time, where the people's desires were considered. However, it also reflects a deeper spiritual issue, as their request for a king was seen as a rejection of God's direct rule over them (<a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>). This moment underscores the tension between human desires and divine will.<p><b>in all that you have said to me</b><br>Samuel's statement indicates that he has fully understood and considered the people's demands. This phrase suggests thorough communication and deliberation, showing Samuel's role as an intermediary between God and the people. It also reflects the seriousness of the people's request, which was not made lightly but with insistence and clarity.<p><b>and I have set over you a king</b><br>This marks the fulfillment of the people's request for a monarchy, with Saul being anointed as the first king of Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/10.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>). The establishment of a king represents a significant shift in Israel's governance, aligning them more closely with neighboring nations. This phrase also foreshadows the complexities and challenges of monarchy, as seen in the subsequent narratives of Saul, David, and Solomon. Theologically, it points to the ultimate kingship of Jesus Christ, who fulfills the role of the perfect and eternal king, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel, a prophet, and a pivotal figure in the transition from the period of judges to the monarchy.

When God&#8217;s spokesman addresses &#8220;all Israel,&#8221; everyone is called to accountability. Samuel&#8217;s words carry God&#8217;s authority, affirming that Scripture reports an actual historical assembly, not merely a moral tale.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have listened to your voice</b><p>Samuel reminds the people that he has heeded them. This shows:<p>&#8226; the prophet&#8217;s humility&#8212;he does not stubbornly cling to personal preference (<a href="/1_samuel/8-6.htm">1 Samuel 8:6</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s willingness to allow human choice within His sovereign plan (<a href="/hosea/13-11.htm">Hosea 13:11</a>).<p>Listening here is neither begrudging nor selective; it is complete obedience to their request. In doing so, Samuel models servant leadership (compare <a href="/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18&#8211;20</a>, where Moses installs Joshua per God&#8217;s directive and people&#8217;s need).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In all that you have said to me</b><p>The phrase underscores that every element of Israel&#8217;s plea has been taken seriously.

God permitted the request but warned of consequences (<a href="/1_samuel/8-10.htm">1 Samuel 8:10&#8211;18</a>). Samuel&#8217;s full compliance highlights the literal fulfillment of their words&#8212;no detail was ignored.

Key truths emerge:<p>&#8226; Leadership is ultimately installed by God through His chosen instruments (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Earthly authority is a stewardship; the king is &#8220;over&#8221; the nation but still under God (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement sets the stage for Samuel&#8217;s forthcoming covenant challenge (<a href="/1_samuel/12-14.htm">1 Samuel 12:14&#8211;15</a>), clarifying that monarchy does not replace obedience to the LORD.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/12-1.htm">1 Samuel 12:1</a> records Samuel&#8217;s formal acknowledgment that Israel&#8217;s demand for a king has been fully granted.

The verse underscores the integrity of God&#8217;s prophet, the seriousness of Israel&#8217;s choice, and the ongoing truth that while human leaders may change, God&#8217;s sovereign authority remains unchanged and supreme.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">And Samuel said unto all Israel.</span>--We believe we possess in this section of our history, in the report the compiler of these memoirs has given us of the dialogue between the judge Samuel and the elders of Israel at the solemn assembly of Gilgal, many of the very words spoken on this momentous occasion by the old man. It is doubtless a true and detailed account of all that took place on that day--the real inauguration of the earthly monarchy; that great change in the life of Israel which became of vast importance in the succeeding generations. In such a recital the words used by that grand old man, who belonged both to the old order of things and to the new, who was the link between the judges and the kings--the link which joined men like Eleazar, the grandson of Aaron, Gideon, and Jephthah, heroes half-veiled in the mists which so quickly gather round an unlettered past, with men like David and Solomon, round whose lives no mist will ever gather--the words used by that old man, who, according to the cherished tradition in Israel, was the accredited minister of the invisible King when the Eternal made over the sovereignty to Saul, would surely be treasured up with a jealous care. This gives an especial and peculiar interest to the present chapter, which contains the summary of the proceedings of the Gilgal assembly. The old judge Samuel, with the hero-king Saul standing by his side, presents the king to the people of the Lord under the title of the "Anointed of the Eternal," and then in a few pathetic words speaks first of his own pure and upright past. The elders reply to his moving words. Then he rehearses the glorious acts of the Eternal King, and repeats how He, over and over again, delivered the people from the miseries into which their own sins had plunged them; and yet, in full memory of all this, says the indignant old man, "in the place of this invisible Ruler, so full of mercy and pity, you asked for an earthly king. The Lord has granted your petition now. Behold your king !" pointing to Saul at his side.--The old man continues: "Even after your ingratitude to the true King, still He will be with you and the man He has chosen for you, if only you and he are obedient to the old well-known Divine commandments." At this juncture Samuel strengthens his argument by invoking a sign from heaven. Awe-struck and appalled, the assembled elders, confessing their sin, ask for Samuel's prayers. The old prophet closes the solemn scene with a promise that his intercession for king and people shall never cease.<p><span class= "bld">Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king over you.</span>--This should be compared with <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm" title="And the LORD said to Samuel, Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you: for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.">1Samuel 8:7</a>; <a href="/context/1_samuel/8-19.htm" title="Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, No; but we will have a king over us;">1Samuel 8:19-20</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/8-22.htm" title="And the LORD said to Samuel, Listen to their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel, Go you every man to his city.">1Samuel 8:22</a>, where the proceedings of the deputation of the people to Samuel at Ramah are related at length. Their wishes expressed on that public occasion had been scrupulously carried out by him. He would now say a few words respecting the past, as regards his (Samuel's) administration, would ask the assembled elders of the nation a few grave questions, and then would leave them with their king. The account, as we possess it, of these proceedings at Gilgal on the occasion of the national reception of Saul as king, is in the form of a dialogue between the prophet Samuel and the elders of the people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have hearkened unto your voice.</span> See <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7, 9, 22</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/12-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Samuel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8050.htm">Strong's 8050: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samuel -- 'name of God', a prophet of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
