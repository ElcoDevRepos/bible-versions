The Amalekites were a nomadic tribe that first attacked the Israelites shortly after their exodus from Egypt (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>). This attack was unprovoked and targeted the vulnerable, including the weak and weary at the rear of the Israelite camp (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>). The Amalekites' actions were seen as a direct affront to God&#8217;s covenant people, and thus to God Himself.<p><b>when they opposed them on their way up from Egypt:</b><br>This refers to the historical event recorded in <a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17</a>, where the Amalekites attacked the Israelites at Rephidim. This opposition was not just a military confrontation but a spiritual one, as it was an attempt to thwart God's plan for His people. The Amalekites' hostility is emblematic of the broader spiritual warfare against God's purposes. This event led to God declaring a perpetual enmity with Amalek, promising to "blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven" (<a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14</a>).

They were descended from Esau's grandson, Amalek. Not long after the exodus from Egypt, they attacked and cruelly harassed the almost defenceless rear-guard of Israel in the desert of Rephidim. They were then, at the prayer of Moses, defeated by Joshua; but, for this cowardly unprovoked attack, solemnly doomed to destruction. In the prophecy of Balaam they are alluded to as the first of the nations who opposed the Lord's people. During the stormy ages that followed, the hand of Amalek seems to have been constantly lifted against Israel, and we read of them perpetually as allied to their relentless foes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Amalek</span>. The Amalekites were a fierce race of nomads who inhabited the desert to the south of Judaea towards Egypt. They were, and still continue to be in their descendants, the Bedouins, an untamable race of savages, whose delight is in robbery and plunder. Between them and Israel there was bitter hostility occasioned by their having attacked the people immediately after the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>), and the command there given to exterminate them is repeated now, probably in consequence of their raids having become more numerous and sanguinary under their present king, as we gather from ver. 33. The reference to a war with the Amalektes in <a href="/1_samuel/14-48.htm">1 Samuel 14:48</a> no doubt refers to this expedition, as we have there a mere summary of Saul's military enterprises. <span class="cmt_word">I remember.</span> Literally, "I have visited;" but the sense of <span class="accented">remembering</span> seems confirmed by such passages as <a href="/genesis/21-1.htm">Genesis 21:1</a>; <a href="/genesis/1-24.htm">Genesis 1:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/23-17.htm">Isaiah 23:17</a>; <a href="/isaiah/26-16.htm">Isaiah 26:16</a>. The Septuagint, however, and Aquila, give a very good sense: "I have considered, "thought over." <span class="cmt_word">How he laid wait for him in the way.</span> There is no idea in the Hebrew of ambuscade or treachery. It is simply, "How he set himself in the way against him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> opposed, withstood him, tried to bar his progress. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/15-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This is what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3541.htm">Strong's 3541: </a> </span><span class="str2">Like this, thus, here, now</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Hosts</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6635.htm">Strong's 6635: </a> </span><span class="str2">A mass of persons, reg, organized for, war, a campaign</span><br /><br /><span class="word">says:</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;I witnessed</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1429;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#257;&#183;qa&#7695;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6485.htm">Strong's 6485: </a> </span><span class="str2">To visit, to oversee, muster, charge, care for, miss, deposit</span><br /><br /><span class="word">what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Amalekites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1464;&#1500;&#1461;&#1430;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;m&#257;&#183;l&#234;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6002.htm">Strong's 6002: </a> </span><span class="str2">Amalek -- a descendant of Esau, also his posterity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
