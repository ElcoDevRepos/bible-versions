The act of strapping on a sword signifies readiness for combat. However, David's use of a sword is significant because he is not a trained soldier. The tunic, a basic garment, contrasts with the armor of a warrior, highlighting David's humble beginnings as a shepherd. This moment foreshadows David's reliance on God rather than conventional weapons, a theme that recurs throughout his life.<p><b>and tried to walk, but he was not accustomed to them.</b><br>David's attempt to walk in the armor shows his inexperience with traditional military gear. This highlights the cultural and historical context of ancient warfare, where armor was essential for protection. David's struggle symbolizes the burden of human expectations and the limitations of relying on human strength. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of God using the weak and untrained to accomplish His purposes, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>.<p><b>&#8220;I cannot walk in these,&#8221; David said to Saul.</b><br>David's admission to Saul reveals his honesty and self-awareness. It underscores the importance of authenticity and reliance on one's God-given strengths rather than conforming to others' expectations. This moment is a turning point, where David chooses to trust in God's provision rather than human methods. It parallels other biblical figures who rejected worldly means, such as Gideon in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>.<p><b>&#8220;I am not accustomed to them.&#8221;</b><br>David's repetition emphasizes his discomfort and the unsuitability of the armor. This phrase highlights the theme of divine empowerment over human ability. David's reliance on God rather than armor prefigures the New Testament teaching of spiritual armor in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, where believers are called to rely on God's strength.<p><b>So David took them off.</b><br>David's decision to remove the armor signifies his faith and trust in God. It marks a pivotal moment where he chooses to face Goliath with the tools and skills God has given him. This act of faith is a type of Christ, who also relied on God's power rather than earthly means. David's action foreshadows Jesus' teachings on faith and reliance on God, as seen in <a href="/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd who would later become the king of Israel.

This reflects a willingness to test what is offered (cf. <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-21.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:21</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase highlights movement; throughout Scripture &#8220;walking&#8221; pictures a manner of life (<a href="/colossians/1-10.htm">Colossians 1:10</a>).

Heavy armor symbolizes self-reliance; David&#8217;s life has been shaped by dependence on God (<a href="/psalms/18-32.htm">Psalm 18:32-34</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel had wanted a king &#8220;like all the nations&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>), and Saul&#8217;s armor epitomizes that desire. David discerns that the LORD&#8217;s deliverance will not come through the same means (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I cannot walk in these,&#8221; David said to Saul</b><p>&#8226; David speaks truth respectfully yet firmly, modeling honest communication under authority (<a href="/ephesians/4-15.htm">Ephesians 4:15</a>; <a href="/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>).<p>&#8226; His confession echoes <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>&#8212;choosing trust in God over leaning on unfamiliar tools.<p>&#8226; By stating his inability, he magnifies God&#8217;s sufficiency (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I am not accustomed to them.&#8221; So David took them off</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Took them off&#8221; is decisive; he removes hindrances much like <a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a> urges believers to lay aside every weight.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s action recalls earlier victories secured without conventional weapons&#8212;lion and bear defeated by the LORD&#8217;s power (<a href="/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34-37</a>).<p>&#8226; The episode foreshadows how God often chooses what the world calls weak to shame the strong (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical takeaways:<p>&#8211; Discern between man-made expectations and God-given calling.<p>&#8211; Courage sometimes means saying no to good offers that are not God&#8217;s offers.<p>&#8211; Freedom to obey God grows when unnecessary burdens are shed (<a href="/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/17-39.htm">1 Samuel 17:39</a> teaches that genuine faith refuses to rely on human strength or imitation, even when such means seem logical. David&#8217;s brief experiment with Saul&#8217;s armor demonstrates discernment, humility, and confidence in God&#8217;s proven methods. By setting aside what hindered him, David positioned himself to experience the LORD&#8217;s deliverance, reminding believers today to trust God&#8217;s equipping over worldly resources, to walk in what He has fitted to us, and to cast off anything that impedes wholehearted obedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1443;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">strapped</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1490;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#7717;&#183;g&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
