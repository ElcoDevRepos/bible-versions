The Philistines were a formidable enemy, often technologically superior, particularly in their use of iron weapons. This encounter takes place in the region of Shunem, a strategic location in the Jezreel Valley, which was crucial for controlling trade routes. Saul's fear contrasts with earlier victories over the Philistines, such as Jonathan's triumph in <a href="/1_samuel/14.htm">1 Samuel 14</a>, indicating a shift in Saul's confidence and God's favor.<p><b>he was afraid</b><br>Saul's fear is significant as it reflects his spiritual state. Earlier in his reign, Saul was empowered by the Spirit of God (<a href="/1_samuel/11-6.htm">1 Samuel 11:6</a>), but by this point, he has been rejected by God due to his disobedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>). His fear is not just of the physical threat but also of his separation from divine guidance. This fear contrasts with David's faith when facing Goliath, another Philistine threat, in <a href="/1_samuel/17.htm">1 Samuel 17</a>, where David's trust in God overcame fear.<p><b>and trembled violently</b><br>The phrase indicates a deep, paralyzing fear, suggesting Saul's complete loss of confidence and reliance on God. This trembling can be seen as a physical manifestation of his spiritual turmoil and the absence of God's presence in his life. In biblical terms, trembling often accompanies encounters with the divine or moments of great fear (e.g., <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>, <a href="/daniel/10-7.htm">Daniel 10:7</a>). Saul's reaction foreshadows his desperate actions in seeking the medium at Endor, further illustrating his spiritual decline and the consequences of his disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Saul&#8217;s trembling leads not to repentance but deeper desperation&#8212;he will seek a medium rather than the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Saul fixed on what he saw instead of on the God who had repeatedly delivered Israel. The massive Philistine army rekindled past traumas, and because his relationship with the Lord was fractured, natural fear escalated into paralyzing terror. His violent trembling dramatizes the cost of disobedience and unbelief: once divine favor is forfeited, human strength collapses. <a href="/1_samuel/28-5.htm">1 Samuel 28:5</a> therefore stands as a solemn warning to keep our eyes on the Lord, rest in His covenant faithfulness, and reject fear by walking in obedience and trust.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">He was afraid.</span>--There is no doubt that Saul was discouraged when he viewed the enemy's ranks from the eminence of Gilboa. They were far more numerous than he had expected. But the real reason of his trembling must be looked for in the consciousness that God had forsaken him. Many of the well-known Israelite warriors had, during the late events, taken service with his dreaded rival, David, and David, he knew, was now the vassal of Achish, a Philistine king. We may imagine Saul, the forsaken of God, as be stood on the white chalk hill of Gilboa, gazing on the long lines of Philistine tents pitched on the opposite hill of Shunem, wondering if his old friend was there, with his mighty following, in the division of Gath.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Saul saw,</span> etc. It is plain from this that the Philistines had not forced their way up through the Israelite territory; for this was evidently Saul's first sight of their forces, and his alarm was caused by finding them so much larger than he had expected. He therefore in his anxiety <span class="cmt_word">enquired of Jehovah,</span> but received no answer, <span class="cmt_word">neither by dreams.</span> He had expected these to be vouchsafed, possibly to himself, but more probably to some class of prophets (see <a href="/jeremiah/23-25.htm">Jeremiah 23:25</a>, where false prophets claim to have dreamed, in imitation no doubt of true prophets); but though dreams were thus recognised as a means for communicating God's will to man, yet, as Erdmann well remarks, "a subordinate position is certainly assigned in the Old Testament to the <span class="accented">dream</span> as the medium of the Divine influence on the inner life, which in sleep sinks into a state of passiveness." <span class="cmt_word">Nor by Urim.</span> Though Abiathar after the massacre of his family had fled to David with the ephod, it is quite possible that Saul may have had another ephod made, and have set up a fresh sanctuary, perhaps at Gibeon, with Zadok, of the family of Eleazar, as high priest. This would account for Zadok being joined with Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar, as one of two high priests early in David's reign (<a href="/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>). It is remarkable, however, that Saul does not mention the Urim himself in ver. 15, and very probably it is named here not because the ephod was actually used, but as enumerating all the various ways by which men inquired of Jehovah. <span class="cmt_word">Nor by prophets.</span> In his dee spair Saul may have turned to some reputed soothsayer present with the host, but his wilful life had alienated both priest and prophet from him. And this is the meaning of the passage in <a href="/1_chronicles/10-14.htm">1 Chronicles 10:14</a>: "Saul enquired not of Jehovah; therefore he slew him." He may have gone through the form of inquiring, and certainly now would have been glad of an answer, but his whole mind was determinately set upon carrying out his own purposes, and he would never permit, after the first year or two of his reign, the royal prerogative to bend to the will of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/28-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1430;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
