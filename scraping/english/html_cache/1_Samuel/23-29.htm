David had been in the wilderness of Ziph, where he narrowly escaped capture by Saul. The phrase "went up" suggests a movement to a higher elevation, which is consistent with the geography of the region. This movement is part of David's ongoing evasion of King Saul, who sought his life due to jealousy and fear of losing his throne. David's journey reflects his reliance on God's guidance and protection, as he continually seeks refuge in various locations.<p><b>and lived in the strongholds</b><br>The term "strongholds" refers to natural fortifications, often caves or rocky areas that provide defense and concealment. In the context of David's life, these strongholds symbolize God's provision of safety and security amidst adversity. David's choice to reside in such places highlights his strategic acumen and his dependence on God's protection. The strongholds also serve as a metaphor for God's strength and refuge, themes frequently echoed in the Psalms attributed to David.<p><b>of En-gedi.</b><br>En-gedi is an oasis located near the western shore of the Dead Sea. Known for its lush vegetation and abundant water supply, it provided an ideal refuge for David and his men. The geographical features of En-gedi, including its cliffs and caves, offered natural protection against Saul's forces. Historically, En-gedi was a place of refuge and sustenance, and its mention here underscores God's provision for David. The location is also significant in biblical history, as it is mentioned in other scriptures, such as <a href="/songs/1-14.htm">Song of Solomon 1:14</a>, highlighting its beauty and fertility. En-gedi's strategic and resourceful environment made it a fitting place for David to regroup and plan his next moves while remaining under God's care.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, who is fleeing from King Saul.

David does not wait for circumstances to change; he moves in confidence that the LORD is guiding his steps, just as he had done when &#8220;David inquired of the LORD&#8221; before striking the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2, 4</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Went up&#8221; is more than geography; it shows forward motion after a narrow escape. Saul had nearly trapped him on one side of the mountain, but God&#8217;s timely intervention&#8212;&#8220;Saul returned from pursuing David&#8221; (23:28)&#8212;opened the way. <a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a> echoes this pattern: &#8220;Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him out of them all.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Spiritual takeaway: obedience involves upward, faith-filled steps even when danger lingers behind.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from there</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;There&#8221; points back to the wilderness of Maon, the place later called &#8220;the Rock of Escape&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/23-28.htm">1 Samuel 23:28</a>). The context matters: God had just proven His covenant faithfulness by thwarting Saul.<p>&#8226; Moving on &#8220;from there&#8221; prevents David from lingering where past danger could easily return. Jesus used a similar principle with His disciples: &#8220;When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-23.htm">Matthew 10:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Leaving a crisis site underscores trust in God&#8217;s ongoing guidance rather than in a single miraculous rescue.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and lived</b><p>&#8226; David does more than hide; he &#8220;lived&#8221; (settled) in a new place. Survival gives way to stability, resembling earlier seasons at Adullam (<a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1&#8211;2</a>) and Ziklag (27:6).<p>&#8226; God grants David breathing room, permitting community life with his six hundred men and their families (23:13). <a href="/psalms/23-6.htm">Psalm 23:6</a> pictures this hope: &#8220;I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Living, not just escaping, highlights God&#8217;s purpose to preserve David for the throne promised in <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the strongholds of En-gedi</b><p>&#8226; En-gedi (&#8220;spring of the wild goat&#8221;) sits along the western shore of the Dead Sea, famous for steep cliffs, caves, and fresh water. Natural fortresses there make perfect &#8220;strongholds,&#8221; illustrating <a href="/proverbs/18-10.htm">Proverbs 18:10</a>: &#8220;The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Soon Saul will chase David even into these crags (<a href="/1_samuel/24-1.htm">1 Samuel 24:1&#8211;3</a>), yet the location allows David to spare Saul&#8217;s life, proving his integrity.<p>&#8226; En-gedi&#8217;s lush springs form an oasis; Song of Songs 1:14 speaks of &#8220;the vineyards of En-gedi,&#8221; hinting at refreshment amid barrenness. God provides both protection and renewal in one spot.<p>&#8226; Later, <a href="/ezekiel/47-10.htm">Ezekiel 47:10</a> foresees fishermen standing at En-gedi when the Dead Sea teems with life, a reminder that God turns places of refuge into places of future blessing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every phrase in <a href="/1_samuel/23-29.htm">1 Samuel 23:29</a> builds a portrait of God-directed movement: David rises, leaves the past crisis, settles under divine protection, and finds both safety and refreshment in En-gedi. The verse reassures believers that the Lord not only delivers from immediate peril but also leads into seasons where faith can breathe, grow, and prepare for the next chapter of His plan.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/23-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
