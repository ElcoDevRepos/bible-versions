The context is David's decision to share the spoils of war equally between those who fought in battle and those who stayed behind to guard the supplies. This principle of fairness and unity reflects God's justice and provision, emphasizing the importance of community and shared responsibility. It highlights a shift in Israelite military practice, promoting equality and preventing division among the people.<p><b>David established this statute and ordinance for Israel</b><br>David's leadership is marked by wisdom and fairness, and this decision becomes a formal decree. The use of "statute and ordinance" suggests a legal and binding decision, akin to the laws given by God through Moses. This reflects David's role as a king who seeks to govern according to God's principles. It also foreshadows the establishment of a more organized and unified nation under his rule, setting a precedent for future governance in Israel.<p><b>to this very day.</b><br>The phrase underscores the enduring impact of David's decision, suggesting that it was respected and upheld long after his reign. This continuity points to the effectiveness and acceptance of the statute within the community. It also serves as a testament to David's legacy as a leader who implemented lasting reforms. The phrase may also imply that the principles of fairness and shared responsibility are timeless values that continue to resonate within the faith community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, who at this time was leading his men in battle and making decisions that would impact the nation.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziklag.htm">Ziklag</a></b><br>The town where David and his men were staying, which had been attacked and plundered by the Amalekites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_amalekites.htm">The Amalekites</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe that raided Ziklag, taking captives and spoils.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david's_men.htm">David's Men</a></b><br>The group of warriors who followed David, some of whom were too exhausted to pursue the Amalekites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_statute_and_ordinance.htm">The Statute and Ordinance</a></b><br>The rule established by David that those who stayed with the supplies would share equally in the spoils of battle with those who fought.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/equity_and_fairness.htm">Equity and Fairness</a></b><br>David's decision to share the spoils equally teaches us about the importance of fairness and equity in community life.

His decision on how to divide the spoil became the new normal &#8220;from that day forward.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture shows that when God sets a pattern through His servant, it stands firm. Think of the Passover: &#8220;This day is to be a memorial for you, and you shall celebrate it as a feast to the LORD; it is a lasting ordinance&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/12-14.htm">Exodus 12:14</a>). Similarly, once Ezra re-instituted the reading of the Law, it became a yearly practice (<a href="/nehemiah/8-18.htm">Nehemiah 8:18</a>).<p>&#8226; By recording the phrase &#8220;from that day forward,&#8221; the text underscores permanence, echoing the truth that &#8220;Forever, O LORD, Your word stands firm in the heavens&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/119-89.htm">Psalm 119:89</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse invites us to trust the ongoing faithfulness of God&#8217;s directives; what He ordains remains reliable and just.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>David established this statute and ordinance for Israel to this very day</b><p>&#8226; The &#8220;statute and ordinance&#8221; refers to David&#8217;s ruling that those who stayed with the supplies would receive an equal share of the plunder with those who fought (<a href="/1_samuel/30-24.htm">1 Samuel 30:24</a>). This echoes the principle God gave Moses after the battle with Midian: &#8220;Divide the plunder between the soldiers who fought in the battle and the rest of the congregation&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/31-27.htm">Numbers 31:27</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s leadership mirrors the heart of God, who values every role within His people (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-22.htm">1 Corinthians 12:22&#8211;25</a>). By making the ruling a formal decree, David ensured justice and unity in future military campaigns, preventing envy and division.<p>&#8226; His action foreshadows the coming King who will institute perfect, righteous statutes&#8212;Jesus Christ, &#8220;of whose kingdom there will be no end&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-33.htm">Luke 1:33</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;to this very day&#8221; (written by the inspired author years later) confirms that the rule endured, much like the covenant promises to David himself (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>).
