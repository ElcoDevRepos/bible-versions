The priest mentioned here is likely Ahijah, who was wearing the ephod, a priestly garment used for divination. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israel's leadership, where kings were expected to seek divine counsel. The role of the priest as an intermediary between God and the king underscores the importance of spiritual guidance in leadership decisions.<p><b>the commotion in the Philistine camp continued to increase</b><br>The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel during Saul's reign. The "commotion" suggests a state of confusion or panic, possibly caused by Jonathan's earlier attack on the Philistine outpost. This chaos can be seen as divine intervention, reminiscent of other biblical instances where God sowed confusion among Israel's enemies (e.g., <a href="/judges/7-22.htm">Judges 7:22</a> with Gideon). The increasing turmoil in the enemy camp highlights God's sovereignty and ability to deliver His people through unexpected means.<p><b>So Saul said to the priest, &#8220;Withdraw your hand.&#8221;</b><br>Saul's command to "withdraw your hand" indicates an abrupt decision to stop seeking divine guidance through the priest. This phrase suggests urgency and a shift from spiritual consultation to immediate military action. Saul's impatience and impulsiveness are recurring themes in his reign, often leading to negative consequences. This moment foreshadows Saul's later failures to fully obey God's commands, contrasting with the ideal of a king who waits on the Lord. Saul's decision here can be compared to other biblical figures who acted without waiting for God's direction, such as King Saul's unlawful sacrifice in <a href="/1_samuel/13.htm">1 Samuel 13</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

The escalating noise is visible evidence that God is already fighting for Israel&#8212;without Saul&#8217;s strategy or permission (<a href="/1_samuel/14-23.htm">1 Samuel 14:23</a>).<p>&#8226; While Saul stalls in consultation, heaven is busy delivering victory, illustrating that divine action is never hindered by human hesitation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So Saul said to the priest, &#8220;Withdraw your hand.&#8221;</b><p>&#8220;So Saul said to the priest, &#8216;Withdraw your hand.&#8217;&#8221;

By dismissing the priest mid-process, Saul signals that tangible circumstances, not divine guidance, will dictate his next move&#8212;a subtle but serious slide from dependence on God to reliance on sight (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/14-19.htm">1 Samuel 14:19</a> captures a decisive moment: Saul starts to seek God, hears growing evidence of God&#8217;s intervention, then abruptly abandons the inquiry to rush into battle. The verse exposes Saul&#8217;s recurring impatience&#8212;consulting the LORD only until events demand quick action&#8212;and contrasts it with the LORD&#8217;s sovereign ability to save regardless of human delay. It challenges readers to finish seeking God&#8217;s guidance before stepping forward, trusting that when He is already at work, our calm obedience, not hurried impulse, is the surest path to victory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Withdraw thine hand.</span>--The instinct of the general, as we should expect from the character of Saul, soon got the better of his first desire for some Divine guidance. His watchful eye saw that the confusion in the Philistine camp was increasing; now was the moment for his little compact force to throw itself into the melee; so he at once bids Ahijah, the priest of the Lord, to put up the Urim and Thummim, and no longer to seek higher counsel, for the hour was come to fight rather than to pray. This has been the general interpretation of Saul's action here. Wordsworth quotes Bishop Andrewes, saying, "There are some who with Saul will call for the Ark, and will presently cry 'Away with it !' that is, will begin their prayers, and break them off in the midst on every occasion." And Bishop Hall: "Saul will consult the Ark; hypocrites, when they have leisure, will perhaps be holy. But when the tumult was aroused, Saul's piety decreased. 'Withdraw thine hand,' he said; the Ark must give place to arms.'"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Withdraw thine hand.</span> Saul, impatient of delay, cannot wait till the will of God is made known to him. There would have been no real loss of time, and he might have been saved from the errors which marred the happiness of the deliverance. But this precipitancy very well shows the state of Saul's mind. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/14-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">While</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1443;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5704.htm">Strong's 5704: </a> </span><span class="str2">As far as, even to, up to, until, while</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was talking</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(dib&#183;ber)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the priest,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1492;&#1461;&#1428;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;h&#234;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
