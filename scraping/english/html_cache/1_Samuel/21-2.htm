At this point, David is fleeing from King Saul, who is seeking his life. The "king" David refers to is likely a fabricated story to explain his presence and need for provisions. This reflects David's quick thinking and resourcefulness, traits that are evident throughout his life. Theologically, this moment foreshadows the greater mission of Jesus Christ, who also faced opposition and had to navigate through hostile environments.<p><b>David replied.</b><br>David's interaction with Ahimelech is significant as it shows his ability to communicate effectively under pressure. This encounter is a pivotal moment in David's life, marking the beginning of his life as a fugitive. It also highlights the theme of divine providence, as God continues to protect David despite the dangers he faces. This can be compared to the way Jesus often responded to questions and challenges with wisdom and authority.<p><b>He told me no one is to know about the mission on which I am sending you.</b><br>David's claim of secrecy underscores the urgency and danger of his situation. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, secrecy in missions was not uncommon, especially in matters of national security or personal safety. This phrase also reflects the theme of divine secrecy and revelation found throughout Scripture, where God's plans are often hidden until the appointed time. It parallels the way Jesus often spoke in parables, revealing truths only to those who were ready to understand.<p><b>And I have directed my young men to meet me at a certain place.</b><br>David's mention of his "young men" indicates that he is not alone, emphasizing his role as a leader even in exile. This phrase suggests a prearranged plan, showcasing David's strategic planning and leadership skills. The "certain place" remains unspecified, adding to the tension and uncertainty of the narrative. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who also gathered a group of followers and led them with purpose and direction, often in secretive or secluded settings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, and a man after God's own heart.

Yet the half-truth backfires when Doeg reports it, leading to tragedy (<a href="/1_samuel/22-9.htm">1 Samuel 22:9&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture contrasts David&#8217;s concealment with the open integrity God desires (<a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>; <a href="/john/18-20.htm">John 18:20</a>). Even noble goals never justify deception; the passage warns that hidden sin bears bitter fruit (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have directed my young men to meet me at a certain place</b><p>&#8226; David continues, &#8220;I have directed my young men to meet me at a certain place&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/21-2.htm">1 Samuel 21:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Though alone before the priest, he implies a troop nearby to legitimize requesting supplies. Soon actual followers will gather at Adullam (<a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1&#8211;2</a>), but here the statement remains part of the ruse.<p>&#8226; God later provides bread and a sword, showing grace despite David&#8217;s method (<a href="/1_samuel/21-3.htm">1 Samuel 21:3&#8211;9</a>). The contrast teaches that divine provision depends on the Lord&#8217;s covenant faithfulness, not human perfection (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226; Like David, believers may feel pressure to manipulate circumstances, yet faith rests in truthful dependence on God&#8217;s care (<a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/21-2.htm">1 Samuel 21:2</a> records David&#8217;s threefold claim&#8212;royal commissioning, strict secrecy, rendezvous with troops&#8212;to secure aid while fleeing Saul. Scripture presents the words exactly as spoken, revealing both David&#8217;s respect for God-given authority and his lapse into deception. The verse cautions that hiding behind falsehood, even for self-preservation, leads to greater harm, yet it also highlights the Lord&#8217;s unbreakable commitment to sustain His people. God&#8217;s faithfulness, not our flawless conduct, ultimately secures His mission for our lives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">The king hath commanded me.</span>--This is one of the sad episodes in a glorious life. Overwhelmed with dismay at his sudden fall, home and wife, friends and rank, all had been taken from him, and he who had been on the very steps of the throne, the darling of the people, strangely successful in all that he had up to this time put his hand to, was now a proscribed exile, flying for his life. These things must plead as his excuse for his falsehood to Ahimelech, and his flight to and subsequent behaviour among the hereditary enemies of his race, the Philistines. But here, as in so many places, the Holy Spirit who guided the pen of the compiler of this true history could not lie, but fearlessly tells the repulsive truth which must ever be deeply damaging to the favourite hero of Israel. "The Holy Spirit is become the chronicler of men's foolish, yea, sinful actions. He has narrated the lies of Abraham, the incest of Lot, the simulation of the man after God's heart."--<span class= "ital">Lange.</span><p><span class= "bld">I have appointed my servants.</span>--This portion of his words to Ahimelech was, no doubt, strictly true. It is unlikely that one in the high position of David at the court of Saul, possessing, too, such powers over men's hearts, would be allowed to go even into exile without any friends or attendants. Those alluded to here probably joined him soon after his parting with Jonathan. Our Lord, in <a href="/context/mark/2-25.htm" title="And he said to them, Have you never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungered, he, and they that were with him?">Mark 2:25-26</a>, speaks of the priest giving the shewbread to David and to those that were with him, when both he and they that were with him were an hungred.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king hath commanded me a business.</span> This pretence of a private commission from the king was a mere invention, but his "appointing his servants to meet him at such and such a place" was probably the exact truth. After parting with Jonathan, David probably did not venture to show himself at home, but, while Saul still supposed him to be at Bethlehem, gave orders to some trusty officer to gather together a few of his most faithful men, and await him with them at some fit place. Meanwhile alone he sets out on his flight, and, having as yet no settled plan, goes to Nob, because it was out of the way of the road to Bethlehem, whither Saul would send to arrest him. Naturally such a visit would seem strange to Ahimelech; but David needed food and arms, and probably counsel; and. but for the chance of the presence of Doeg, no harm might have ensued.
