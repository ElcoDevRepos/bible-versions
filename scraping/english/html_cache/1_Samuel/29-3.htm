The presence of Hebrews among them would naturally raise suspicion. The term "Hebrews" is often used by outsiders to refer to the Israelites, highlighting their distinct ethnic and cultural identity. This question reflects the tension and distrust between the Philistines and the Israelites, as well as the unusual situation of David, an Israelite, being among them.<p><b>Achish replied, &#8220;Is this not David, the servant of King Saul of Israel?</b><br>Achish, the king of Gath, recognizes David's former allegiance to Saul, which underscores the complexity of David's position. David's reputation as a servant of Saul is well-known, and his presence among the Philistines is a testament to his complicated relationship with Saul, who sought his life. This acknowledgment by Achish also highlights David's past as a loyal servant, which is a recurring theme in his life story.<p><b>He has been with me all these days, even years,</b><br>David's time with the Philistines is marked by a period of refuge and alliance, which lasted for over a year and four months. This phrase indicates a significant duration, suggesting that David had established a level of trust and rapport with Achish. It also reflects David's strategic acumen in navigating his precarious situation while maintaining his safety from Saul.<p><b>and from the day he defected until today I have found no fault in him.&#8221;</b><br>Achish's statement about finding no fault in David is reminiscent of the biblical theme of integrity and blamelessness, often associated with God's chosen leaders. This echoes the New Testament portrayal of Jesus Christ, who was found blameless by Pilate (<a href="/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4</a>). David's ability to maintain his integrity in a foreign land among potential enemies is a testament to his character and foreshadows his future role as king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistine_commanders.htm">Philistine Commanders</a></b><br>Military leaders of the Philistine army, questioning the presence of Hebrews among them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/achish.htm">Achish</a></b><br>The king of Gath, a Philistine city, who had given refuge to David and trusted him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, who had sought refuge with the Philistines while fleeing from King Saul.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, from whom David was fleeing due to Saul's jealousy and attempts on his life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrews.htm">Hebrews</a></b><br>Referring to David and his men, highlighting their identity as Israelites among the Philistines.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_timing.htm">Trust in God's Timing</a></b><br>David's time with the Philistines shows the importance of trusting God's timing and provision, even when circumstances seem contrary to His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_adversity.htm">Integrity in Adversity</a></b><br>Despite being in enemy territory, David maintained his integrity, as Achish found "no fault in him."
