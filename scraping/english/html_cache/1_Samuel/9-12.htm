The seer, Samuel, is ahead, suggesting a divine orchestration in Saul's journey. This encounter is pivotal, as it leads to Saul's anointing as the first king of Israel. The phrase also highlights the role of divine providence in guiding Saul to Samuel, setting the stage for the establishment of monarchy in Israel, which was a significant shift from the period of the judges.<p><b>"Hurry now,"</b><br>The urgency in this command underscores the importance of the meeting between Saul and Samuel. It reflects the cultural practice of seizing the moment, especially in matters involving divine appointments. The urgency also suggests that there is a specific time for the sacrifice, and missing it could mean missing the opportunity for divine guidance and blessing.<p><b>"for today he has come to the city"</b><br>This indicates that Samuel's presence in the city is not a regular occurrence, emphasizing the special nature of the event. Samuel, as a prophet and judge, traveled throughout Israel, and his presence in a particular city would draw attention. This also reflects the itinerant nature of prophetic ministry during this period, where prophets would move from place to place to deliver God's messages.<p><b>"because the people have a sacrifice on the high place."</b><br>High places were common sites for worship in ancient Israel, often located on elevated ground. While later condemned for idolatrous practices, at this time, they were still used for legitimate worship of Yahweh. The sacrifice indicates a communal religious event, possibly a peace offering or a festival, which would involve the entire community. This setting provides a backdrop for Saul's anointing, linking his kingship to the religious life of Israel. The high place also foreshadows the centralization of worship in Jerusalem under David and Solomon, pointing to the future establishment of the temple.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The son of Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin, who is on a journey to find his father's lost donkeys.

The two strangers accost them with the words, "Is the seer who dwells among you here just now?" and they eagerly reply, "Yes, this very day he came from his house into the town.
