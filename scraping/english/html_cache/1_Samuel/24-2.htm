The number "three thousand" indicates a significant military force, suggesting that Saul viewed David as a substantial threat. The term "chosen men" implies that these were elite soldiers, possibly the best warriors available, reflecting Saul's intent to ensure success in capturing David. This pursuit is part of the broader narrative of Saul's jealousy and fear of David, who had been anointed by Samuel as the future king of Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). The selection of men from "all Israel" underscores the national scope of Saul's campaign, as he mobilizes resources from across the tribes.<p><b>and went to look for David and his men</b><br>David, at this point, is a fugitive, having fled from Saul's court due to Saul's attempts on his life (<a href="/1_samuel/19-10.htm">1 Samuel 19:10</a>). David's men, often referred to as his "mighty men" or "the men who were with him," were a group of loyal followers who had gathered around him during his time in exile. This pursuit by Saul is a continuation of the conflict between the two, which is a central theme in the narrative of 1 Samuel. The search for David is not just a physical pursuit but also a spiritual and moral one, as Saul grapples with his own disobedience to God and the loss of divine favor.<p><b>in the region of the Rocks of the Wild Goats</b><br>The "Rocks of the Wild Goats" refers to a specific geographical location, likely in the rugged terrain of the Judean wilderness near En Gedi. This area is characterized by steep cliffs and rocky outcrops, providing natural fortifications and hiding places. The mention of "wild goats" suggests a remote and desolate area, suitable for David and his men to evade capture. This setting is significant as it reflects the harsh conditions David endured while on the run and highlights his resourcefulness and reliance on God for protection. The wilderness motif is common in biblical narratives, often symbolizing a place of testing and divine encounter, as seen in the experiences of Moses and Elijah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who is pursuing David out of jealousy and fear of losing his throne.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who is on the run from Saul and hiding in the wilderness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/three_thousand_chosen_men.htm">Three Thousand Chosen Men</a></b><br>A select group of Israel's soldiers, indicating the seriousness of Saul's pursuit of David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rocks_of_the_wild_goats.htm">Rocks of the Wild Goats</a></b><br>A rugged, mountainous area in the wilderness of En Gedi, known for its difficult terrain and wild goats, providing a strategic hiding place for David and his men.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_trials.htm">God's Sovereignty in Trials</a></b><br>David's situation reminds us that God is in control, even when we face unjust persecution or trials.
