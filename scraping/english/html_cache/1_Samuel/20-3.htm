In the ancient Near Eastern culture, vows were binding and often invoked the name of God to underscore their gravity. David's repeated vow indicates his earnestness and the urgency of his message to Jonathan.<p><b>&#8220;Your father knows very well that I have found favor in your eyes</b><br>Saul, Jonathan's father, was aware of the close friendship between David and Jonathan. This relationship is significant because it represents a covenantal bond, which was a common practice in ancient times to ensure loyalty and mutual protection. Saul's awareness of this favor suggests his strategic thinking and his intent to isolate David from his allies.<p><b>and he has said, &#8216;Jonathan must not know of this, or he will be grieved.&#8217;</b><br>Saul's decision to keep Jonathan uninformed highlights the tension within the royal family and Saul's increasing paranoia. The phrase reflects Saul's understanding of Jonathan's loyalty to David, which is a testament to their covenant. This secrecy also underscores the tragic conflict between familial loyalty and divine anointing, as Jonathan is torn between his father and his friend.<p><b>As surely as the LORD lives and as you yourself live</b><br>This phrase is a double oath, invoking both the living God and Jonathan's life. In biblical times, such oaths were powerful affirmations of truth and sincerity. The invocation of the LORD's name indicates David's reliance on divine witness and protection, while also appealing to Jonathan's personal integrity and their shared faith.<p><b>there is but a step between me and death.&#8221;</b><br>David's statement reflects the imminent danger he faces from Saul. The imagery of a single step suggests the precariousness of his situation, emphasizing the constant threat to his life. This phrase can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's own journey, where He too faced death for the sake of God's plan. David's trust in God's sovereignty, despite the danger, mirrors the faithfulness expected of believers in the face of trials.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, and a man after God's own heart.

The verse calls readers to honest covenant relationships, vigilance against hidden sin, and confident reliance on the Lord who holds every step&#8212;even the ones that hover over the edge of mortality.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Thy father certainly knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes.</span>--David urges that his fall, and even his death, had been decided upon by Saul, who, knowing how Jonathan loved him, would shrink from confiding to his son his deadly plans respecting his loved friend. David, with his clear, bright intellect, looked deeper into Saul's heart than did the heroic, guileless son. He recognised only too vividly the intensity of the king's hatred of him; and we see in the next verse that the mournful earnestness of the son of Jesse had its effect upon the prince, who consented to make the public trial of Saul's real mind which his friend asked for.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy father certainly knoweth,</span> etc. Though Saul did not know the entireness of Jonathan's love for David, yet he was aware of the friendship that existed between them, and consequently might keep his purpose a secret from Jonathan, especially if he considered that his frankness in speaking openly to his son and servants on a previous occasion had led to David's escape. David, therefore, urges upon his friend a different course, to which he assents. But how are we to explain the entirely different views taken of Saul's conduct by the two. When David tells his fears Jonathan utters an exclamation of horror, and says, "Thou shalt not die." Yet he knew that his father had talked to him and his Officers about putting David to death; that he had tried to kill him with his own hand, and on his escape had set people to watch his house with orders to slay him; and on David's flight to the prophet had thrice sent emissaries to bring him away by force. The explanation probably lies in Saul s insanity. When he threw his javelin at David and during the subsequent proceed. ings he was out of his mind. The violent fit at Naioth had for the time cleared his reason, and he had come back sane. Jonathan regarded all that had taken place as the effect of a mind diseased, and concluded, therefore, that David might now return to his home and wife, and resume his duties and take his place at the royal table. Should the old craze come back about David being his rival and destined successor, Saul would be sure to talk about it, and then Jonathan would give him timely warning. But David was convinced that it was no craze, but that Saul, sane or insane, had determined upon his death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/20-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1431;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">again</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1436;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5750.htm">Strong's 5750: </a> </span><span class="str2">Iteration, continuance, again, repeatedly, still, more</span><br /><br /><span class="word">vowed,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1463;&#1448;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#7687;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
