Jezreel, a city in the territory of Issachar, was strategically located in the northern part of Israel, suggesting that David was expanding his influence beyond Judah. Marriages in ancient times often served to solidify political alliances and strengthen claims to leadership. Ahinoam's marriage to David may have been part of such a strategy. This marriage is mentioned in <a href="/1_samuel/27-3.htm">1 Samuel 27:3</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/3.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1</a>, indicating her importance in David's life and the royal lineage. The name Ahinoam means "my brother is delight," which may reflect her esteemed status.<p><b>So she and Abigail were both his wives.</b><br>The mention of both Ahinoam and Abigail as David's wives highlights the practice of polygamy in ancient Israel, which was common among leaders and kings. This practice is seen in the lives of other patriarchs and kings, such as Jacob and Solomon. Abigail, previously the wife of Nabal, became David's wife after Nabal's death, as recorded earlier in <a href="/1_samuel/25.htm">1 Samuel 25</a>. Her marriage to David was not only a personal union but also a strategic alliance, as Abigail was wealthy and influential. The dual mention of these wives underscores the complexity of David's personal life and the challenges of maintaining multiple familial relationships. This situation foreshadows future familial conflicts, as seen in the lives of David's children, and serves as a reminder of the human imperfections of biblical figures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, known for his heart after God.

Just as he formed alliances with the men who would become his mighty warriors (<a href="/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1-2</a>), he now forms a covenant bond with a woman from the territory God will soon give him to rule (<a href="/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Later, Ahinoam bears David his firstborn son Amnon (<a href="/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2</a>). The verse quietly anticipates that future, reminding us that God is sovereign over David&#8217;s dynasty even before the throne is his.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So she and Abigail were both his wives</b><p>&#8226; The text states matter-of-factly, &#8220;So she and Abigail were both his wives.&#8221; Polygamy was culturally accepted in the ancient Near East, though never God&#8217;s ideal (<a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a>). Like Abraham (<a href="/genesis/16-1.htm">Genesis 16:1-4</a>) and Jacob (<a href="/genesis/29-30.htm">Genesis 29:30</a>), David takes more than one wife.<p>&#8226; God allows this practice for a time, yet later regulations place limits on royal polygamy (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>). David&#8217;s choice foreshadows family complications&#8212;rivalry among sons and heartbreak for Tamar (<a href="/bsb/2_samuel/13.htm">2 Samuel 13</a>)&#8212;that Scripture records without glossing over sin&#8217;s consequences.<p>&#8226; Even so, the verse emphasizes that both women hold legitimate marital status. In the unfolding plan of redemption, God can work through imperfect arrangements to advance His covenant promises, ultimately leading to David&#8217;s greater Son, the Messiah (<a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Abigail, known for her wisdom and faith (<a href="/1_samuel/25-32.htm">1 Samuel 25:32-33</a>), and Ahinoam together form part of the household God will use to establish the unified kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/5-5.htm">2 Samuel 5:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/25-43.htm">1 Samuel 25:43</a> confirms that David, while still a fugitive, lawfully marries Ahinoam of Jezreel, adding her to his household alongside Abigail. The verse records historical fact, shows David&#8217;s growing ties within Judah, illustrates the reality of polygamy in that era, and hints at future blessings and trials flowing from these marriages&#8212;all under God&#8217;s sovereign hand as He prepares David for the throne and, ultimately, points toward Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(43) <span class= "bld">David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel.</span>--Jezreel is not the city in Issachar (<a href="/joshua/19-18.htm" title="And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem,">Joshua 19:18</a>), but a town in the southern part of Canaan, situate in the hill country of Judah, near Maon. The fatal results of this disastrous and unhappy Oriental custom of polygamy, as time went on, showed themselves in King David's household--a plentiful crop of intrigues, crimes, and murders in the royal palace were the sad fruits of his yielding to the miserable practice, which has ever been one of the curses of the East.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 43, 44.</span> - Besides Abigail, David also took to wife <span class="cmt_word">Ahinoam of Jezreel</span>, a small village among the hills of Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-56.htm">Joshua 15:56</a>), and not the better known town of that name in the tribe of Issachar.
