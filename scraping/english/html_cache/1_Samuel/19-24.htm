Saul removing his robes signifies a loss of royal dignity and control. This act can be seen as a symbolic stripping away of his kingly authority, which aligns with God's earlier rejection of Saul as king (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26-28</a>). The removal of robes also indicates vulnerability and humility, whether voluntary or involuntary.<p><b>and also prophesied before Samuel.</b><br>Prophesying in this context refers to being overtaken by the Spirit of God, leading to ecstatic utterances or actions. Saul's prophesying is significant because it occurs in the presence of Samuel, the prophet who anointed him as king. This event mirrors an earlier episode in <a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10-12</a>, where Saul also prophesied, marking the beginning of his kingship. The presence of Samuel underscores the divine influence and the prophetic authority that Saul is temporarily under.<p><b>And he collapsed and lay naked all that day and night.</b><br>The term "naked" here may not imply complete nudity but rather being stripped of his outer garments, leaving him in a state of undress. This act of lying prostrate and exposed for an extended period signifies a profound spiritual experience or judgment. It reflects Saul's helplessness and the overpowering nature of God's Spirit, which can be seen as a form of divine intervention or correction. This incident highlights Saul's vulnerability and the temporary suspension of his kingly duties.<p><b>That is why it is said, &#8220;Is Saul also among the prophets?&#8221;</b><br>This phrase became a proverbial expression in Israel, indicating surprise at someone acting out of character or being unexpectedly overtaken by the Spirit of God. It first appeared in <a href="/1_samuel/10-11.htm">1 Samuel 10:11-12</a> when Saul was initially anointed as king. The repetition of this phrase here emphasizes the irony of Saul's spiritual state, contrasting his initial divine appointment with his current rejection by God.

By removing them he unknowingly relinquished the visible signs of kingship.<p>&#8226; God had already told Saul that the kingdom was torn from him (<a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>); this act vividly pictures that judgment.<p>&#8226; The outer robes likely included his cloak and armor, leaving only a simple undergarment. Similar symbolic stripping occurs with Jonathan (<a href="/1_samuel/18-4.htm">1 Samuel 18:4</a>) and later with Jesus&#8217; mock stripping by soldiers (<a href="/matthew/27-28.htm">Matthew 27:28</a>).<p>&#8226; The Spirit&#8217;s sudden overpowering shows the Lord can humble any ruler (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>; <a href="/daniel/4-37.htm">Daniel 4:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And also prophesied before Samuel</b><p>&#8226; Just as in <a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10&#8211;12</a>, the Spirit of God fell on Saul, compelling speech he could not control.<p>&#8226; This prophecy was not a sign of Saul&#8217;s obedience but of God&#8217;s overruling power, much like Balaam&#8217;s compelled blessings (<a href="/numbers/23-5.htm">Numbers 23:5, 12</a>).<p>&#8226; Samuel&#8217;s presence underscores God&#8217;s prophetic authority; Saul is forced to submit to the very prophet who had pronounced his rejection (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>).<p>&#8226; The episode safeguarded David, for the prophetic frenzy diverted Saul from his murderous pursuit (<a href="/1_samuel/19-18.htm">1 Samuel 19:18&#8211;20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he collapsed and lay naked all that day and night</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Lay naked&#8221; stresses total helplessness.

Repetition shows Saul&#8217;s life bookended by dramatic but superficial spiritual moments.<p>&#8226; The saying became a national expression of surprise when an unlikely person manifests prophetic speech&#8212;much like <a href="/john/11-49.htm">John 11:49&#8211;52</a> records Caiaphas&#8217;s unintended prophecy.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty shines: He may speak through anyone (<a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>), yet genuine obedience matters more than gifted utterance (<a href="/matthew/7-22.htm">Matthew 7:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast between external charisma and internal rebellion warns against confusing spiritual experience with spiritual fidelity (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/19-24.htm">1 Samuel 19:24</a> records God overpowering Saul: stripping his royal symbols, compelling prophecy, and rendering him helpless for twenty-four hours. The event literally happened and served three purposes&#8212;publicly humbling a disobedient king, protecting God&#8217;s chosen servant David, and reminding Israel that the Spirit&#8217;s gifts do not guarantee a right heart. The proverb &#8220;Is Saul also among the prophets?&#8221; endures as a witness that the Lord can use&#8212;even overrule&#8212;anyone to accomplish His will, while true honor rests on those who obey Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before Samuel in like manner.</span>--This was certainly not the first time that Saul had experienced a similar influence of the Spirit of God. We are told (<a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm" title="And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came on him, and he prophesied among them.">1Samuel 10:10</a>) that directly after his anointing by Samuel, he met a company of prophets, who were prophesying at Gibeah, and that "the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them." On <span class= "ital">that </span>occasion he had been changed into another man. What was the meaning of the outpouring upon the faithless king now? The Chaldee, according to Raschi's explanation, says <span class= "ital">he was mad. </span>Is it not, however, better to explain the incident by understanding that once more the pitiful Spirit pleaded with the man whom the Lord had chosen to be His anointed? But, alas! when the moment of strange excitement was over, the blessed pleading was forgotten. Is not this a matter of every-day experience?<p><span class= "bld">And lay down naked.</span>--Not necessarily without any clothes, for under the tunic there was worn by men of the upper ranks certainly a fine-woven shirt of linen or cotton. Lyranus explains the words "stripped off his clothes" as simply denoting that he threw off his upper garment, "his royal robe."<p><span class= "bld">Is Saul also among the prophets?</span>--The same thing having taken place before (see <a href="/1_samuel/10-12.htm" title="And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?">1Samuel 10:12</a>), this saying gained currency among the people. There seemed something strange to men in one so self-willed and disobedient as was Saul receiving, as it seemed to the by-standers, the Divine and much coveted gift. "Many," says St. Augustine, "are the gifts of God which are possessed by evil men. Evil men have often great talents, great skill, great wealth. . . . The gift of prophesy is a great gift, but it was possessed by Saul. Saul, an evil king, prophesied at the very time he was persecuting holy David. Let not, therefore, men boast if they have God's gifts; those gifts will profit them nothing without charity (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/13-1.htm" title="Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.">1Corinthians 13:1-2</a>). But let them think of the fearful account they must one day give to God, if they use not holy things holily."--<span class= "ital">St. Augustine, </span>in Psalms 103, quoted by Wordsworth.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/19-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">stripped off</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1448;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yip&#772;&#183;&#353;a&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
