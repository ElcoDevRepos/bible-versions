Examples include the forty days and nights of rain during the flood (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>), Moses' forty days on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/24-18.htm">Exodus 24:18</a>), and Jesus' forty days of fasting in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). In this context, the forty days represent a time of challenge and intimidation for Israel, testing their faith and resolve.<p><b>the Philistine</b><br>This refers to Goliath, the champion of the Philistines, who were a sea-faring people and one of Israel's main adversaries during this period. The Philistines occupied the coastal regions of Canaan and were known for their advanced weaponry and military prowess. Goliath's presence symbolizes the formidable opposition faced by Israel, both physically and spiritually.<p><b>came forward</b><br>Goliath's act of coming forward signifies a challenge to the Israelites, a call to battle, and a test of their courage. This act of stepping out from the Philistine ranks is a direct confrontation, demanding a response from Israel. It highlights the tension and fear that gripped the Israelite camp.<p><b>every morning and evening</b><br>The repetition of Goliath's challenge twice daily underscores the persistent nature of the threat. Morning and evening were significant times for prayer and sacrifice in Israel (<a href="/exodus/29-39.htm">Exodus 29:39</a>), suggesting that Goliath's defiance was not only a military challenge but also a spiritual affront. This relentless provocation aimed to demoralize the Israelites and shake their faith in God.<p><b>to take his stand</b><br>Goliath's stance is symbolic of defiance and dominance. In biblical terms, taking a stand often implies readiness for battle or a declaration of intent (<a href="/ephesians/6-13.htm">Ephesians 6:13</a>). Goliath's position as a giant warrior represents the seemingly insurmountable obstacles that God's people often face. This scene foreshadows the ultimate victory of David, a type of Christ, who defeats the giant not by might, but by faith in God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/goliath.htm">Goliath</a></b><br>A Philistine giant and warrior who challenged the Israelites, representing the forces of opposition against God's people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, led by King Saul, who were encamped in the Valley of Elah, facing the Philistine threat.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A perennial enemy of Israel, representing the worldly powers and opposition to God's purposes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/valley_of_elah.htm">Valley of Elah</a></b><br>The geographical location where the standoff between the Israelites and the Philistines took place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/forty_days.htm">Forty Days</a></b><br>A significant period in biblical terms, often associated with testing, trial, and preparation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_forty_days.htm">The Significance of Forty Days</a></b><br>The number forty in the Bible often symbolizes a period of testing, trial, and preparation.

Noah&#8217;s floodwaters lasted &#8220;forty days and forty nights&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/7-12.htm">Genesis 7:12</a>). Jesus fasted &#8220;forty days and forty nights&#8221; before facing the tempter (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel, paralyzed for the same span, reveals how prolonged intimidation can drain faith when God&#8217;s people stare at a problem instead of at the Lord.<p>&#8226; Yet the forty-day clock also signals that God is about to act. Just as the flood ended, the law was given, and Christ emerged victorious, a deliverer&#8212;David&#8212;is on the horizon.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Philistine came forward</b><p>&#8226; Goliath is more than a tall soldier; he embodies a defiant, God-opposing spirit. &#8220;Then a champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4</a>).<p>&#8226; His single-combat challenge mirrors the enemy&#8217;s tactic of isolating believers, turning a corporate battle into what feels like a personal duel.<p>&#8226; Jesus identified the true source of such hostility: &#8220;The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>). Behind every visible foe lurks a spiritual adversary.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Every morning and evening</b><p>&#8226; Two appearances daily equal relentless pressure. Intimidation repeated at sunrise and sunset keeps fear fresh and hope suppressed.<p>&#8226; Morning and evening were also the times of Israel&#8217;s daily sacrifices (<a href="/numbers/28-4.htm">Numbers 28:4</a>). While God&#8217;s people should have been reminded of covenant faithfulness, they instead fixated on the giant.<p>&#8226; David later wrote, &#8220;Evening, morning, and noon I cry out&#8230; and He hears my voice&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>). The antidote to unceasing threats is unceasing prayer and worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To take his stand</b><p>&#8226; Goliath isn&#8217;t merely pacing; he is staking a claim on territory that belongs to the LORD and His people. &#8220;I defy the ranks of Israel this day&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-10.htm">1 Samuel 17:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase also hints at a courtroom-like confrontation. Goliath positions himself as prosecutor, accusing and belittling.<p>&#8226; God calls His people to counter such posturing with their own stand: &#8220;Put on the full armor of God, so that you can make your stand against the devil&#8217;s schemes&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-11.htm">Ephesians 6:11</a>). David will soon model that posture, advancing not in self-confidence but in covenant confidence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/17-16.htm">1 Samuel 17:16</a> records forty days of nonstop, twice-daily intimidation designed to paralyze Israel. The length echoes other biblical periods of testing, signaling that God will soon intervene. Goliath&#8217;s repeated advance spotlights the enemy&#8217;s strategy of relentless pressure, especially during times when God&#8217;s people should be renewing covenant focus. By showing up to &#8220;take his stand,&#8221; the Philistine draws a battle line that ultimately invites God&#8217;s champion to cross it. The verse sets the stage for David&#8217;s arrival and reminds believers today to fix their eyes on the LORD, offer unceasing worship, and stand firm in His strength against every giant that dares to step forward.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">And presented himself forty days.</span>--Wordsworth, following Augustine, sees here a reference to the temptation of the true David, who "was in the wilderness <span class= "ital">forty days, </span>tempted of the devil." "In David is Christ . . . do not, therefore, read this history of David as if it did not concern you who are members of Christ." (Aug. in Psalms 143).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Philistine .... presented himself.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> took his stand (see on 1 Samuel 10:23; 12:7, 16). This verse takes up the narrative, disturbed by the inserted explanation about David's family relations. The extraordinary formation of the ground, as described in ver. 3, shows how it was possible for this challenge to go on for forty days without either army advancing or retiring. During this long time it seems to have been the business of the friends at home to supply the combatants with food, and so Jesse sends David with <span class="cmt_word">an ephah</span>, about three pecks, <span class="cmt_word">of parched corn</span> - as the word is spelt in the Hebrew it means "parched pease." Also <span class="cmt_word">ten loaves,</span> and, for the captain of their thousand, <span class="cmt_word">ten cheeses</span> - rather, "ten slices of fresh curd." David was also <span class="cmt_word">to take their pledge</span>. Apparently neither Eliab nor his brethren could write, and therefore they would send back to their father some token previously agreed upon to show that they were in good health, and had received the supplies sent them. <span class="cmt_word">Now Saul,</span> etc. This is a part of Jesse's speech, telling David where he would find his brethren. For <span class="accented">were</span>, the right translation is, "They are in the terebinth valley, fighting with the Philistines." <p> CHAPTER 17:20-58 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For forty</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ar&#183;b&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_705.htm">Strong's 705: </a> </span><span class="str2">Forty</span><br /><br /><span class="word">days</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3117.htm">Strong's 3117: </a> </span><span class="str2">A day</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Philistine</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(hap&#183;p&#601;&#183;li&#353;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
