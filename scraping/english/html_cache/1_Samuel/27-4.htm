Saul, the first king of Israel, had been relentlessly pursuing David, who was anointed by Samuel to be the next king. Saul's pursuit was driven by jealousy and fear of losing his throne. The phrase suggests a moment of realization for Saul, highlighting the ongoing tension between him and David. This pursuit is a recurring theme in 1 Samuel, illustrating Saul's decline and David's rise.<p><b>that David had fled to Gath</b><br>Gath was one of the five major Philistine cities and the hometown of Goliath, whom David had previously defeated. David's decision to flee to Gath is significant, as it shows his desperation and strategic thinking. By seeking refuge among the Philistines, Israel's enemies, David placed himself outside Saul's reach. This move also reflects David's complex relationship with the Philistines, as he later becomes a vassal to Achish, the king of Gath. The historical context of Gath as a fortified city and its role in Philistine-Israelite conflicts provides insight into David's choice.<p><b>he no longer searched for him</b><br>Saul's cessation of his pursuit of David marks a temporary end to the immediate threat against David's life. This phrase underscores a moment of respite for David, allowing him to regroup and plan his next steps. It also highlights Saul's limitations and the divine protection over David, as seen throughout the narrative. Theologically, this can be seen as part of God's providential plan for David, who is a type of Christ, foreshadowing the ultimate deliverance and kingship of Jesus. Saul's inability to capture David despite numerous attempts reflects the futility of opposing God's anointed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, who is fleeing from King Saul's relentless pursuit.

Now, led by sober reflection (<a href="/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1</a>), he returns with six hundred men, showing strategic thought yet continuing to rely on God&#8217;s sovereign protection (<a href="/psalms/56-11.htm">Psalm 56:11</a>).<p>&#8226; By stepping into enemy territory, David highlights a recurring biblical theme: God can shield His servants even in the most unlikely places (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he no longer searched for him</b><p>&#8220;and Saul no longer searched for him&#8221;.<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s relentless pursuit suddenly stops, illustrating God&#8217;s timely relief for His people (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The cessation is not due to a change of heart but to fear and practical limits&#8212;Saul will not wage open war in Philistia, showing that worldly power has boundaries set by God (<a href="/job/38-10.htm">Job 38:10&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s respite foreshadows the greater rest God grants to those He intends to exalt in His time (<a href="/2_samuel/7-1.htm">2 Samuel 7:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/37-7.htm">Psalm 37:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse therefore reassures believers that when God says &#8220;enough,&#8221; every adversary must stand down (<a href="/isaiah/54-17.htm">Isaiah 54:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/27-4.htm">1 Samuel 27:4</a> records the moment Saul hears of David&#8217;s escape to Gath and halts his pursuit.

The episode encourages us to trust that God can provide safety in unexpected ways and silence opposition precisely when His purpose requires it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">And it was told Saul.</span>--This short statement tells us plainly that up to the moment when Saul heard that David had crossed the frontier, he had not ceased to pursue after him and to seek his life. Ewald considers that it was during the residence at Gath that David exercised himself as a musician in the Gittite--i.e., the Philistine--style, which he afterwards transferred from there to Judah and Jerusalem. (See titles of Psalms 8, 81, 84, "upon the Gittith.") Gittith is a feminine adjective derived from Gath; the words possibly signify, "after the Gittith manner: some peculiar measure of style of Philistine music, or else the reference may be to a Philistine musical instrument."<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/27-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And when Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
