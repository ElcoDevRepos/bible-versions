This decision can be seen as a wartime tactic to protect his position and the safety of his men. In the ancient Near Eastern context, it was not uncommon for military leaders to eliminate potential threats to their security. David's actions, while harsh, were aimed at maintaining the trust of Achish, who believed David was raiding Israelite territories. This reflects the complex and often brutal nature of ancient warfare and survival.<p><b>for he said, &#8220;Otherwise they will report us, saying, &#8216;This is what David did.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>David's concern about being reported highlights the precariousness of his situation. Living among the Philistines, traditional enemies of Israel, required careful navigation of alliances and enmities. David's fear of exposure underscores the tension between his loyalty to Israel and his need to survive in Philistine territory. This phrase also illustrates the importance of reputation and intelligence in ancient military strategy. David's actions were not just about immediate survival but also about maintaining a long-term strategic advantage.<p><b>And this was David&#8217;s custom the whole time he lived in Philistine territory</b><br>David's consistent behavior during his time in Philistine territory suggests a calculated approach to his exile. This period of David's life, living among the Philistines, is marked by a delicate balance of deception and diplomacy. His ability to maintain this custom without arousing suspicion from Achish indicates his skill in leadership and strategy. This time in Philistine territory also foreshadows David's future as a king who would need to navigate complex political landscapes. It reflects the theme of God's providence in David's life, preparing him for future challenges as the leader of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, who at this time is living among the Philistines to escape King Saul's pursuit.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistine_territory.htm">Philistine Territory</a></b><br>The region where David sought refuge, specifically in the city of Gath, under the rule of King Achish.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gath.htm">Gath</a></b><br>A Philistine city where David and his men resided during this period.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_achish.htm">King Achish</a></b><br>The Philistine king of Gath who allowed David to stay in his territory.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/raids.htm">Raids</a></b><br>David conducted raids against various groups while living in Philistine territory, ensuring no survivors to prevent intelligence from reaching Achish.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Despite David's actions, God was working through his circumstances to fulfill His promises.

The text reports the fact without endorsing undue cruelty; it shows David acting within the era&#8217;s war practices while simultaneously fulfilling earlier commands regarding these specific peoples.<p>&#8226; The narrative underscores God&#8217;s sovereign protection: even while David lived among enemies, none could expose him or thwart God&#8217;s plan to establish him as king (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Otherwise they will report us</b><p>&#8220;Otherwise they will report us, saying, &#8216;This is what David did.&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; David feared that survivors would reach Achish of Gath and reveal that his raids struck non-Israeli foes, not Judah, contradicting the story he fed Achish (<a href="/1_samuel/27-10.htm">1 Samuel 27:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; By silencing informants, David preserved his cover, safeguarding both his men and Israel&#8217;s southern borders from Philistine suspicion.<p>&#8226; Scripture records David&#8217;s use of shrewdness: &#8220;Be as shrewd as serpents and as innocent as doves&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>).

The passage highlights God&#8217;s faithfulness, human complexity, and the ultimate certainty that His purposes stand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And David saved neither man nor woman.</span>--This and the following (12th) verse gives the reason for these atrocious acts of murder. The wild and irresponsible Arab chief alone seemed represented in David in this dark portion of his career. This saddest of all the chapters in David's life follows close upon the death of Samuel. It appears that the holy man of God had exercised, all the time that he had lived, a great and beneficent influence over the son of Jesse; and when he passed away, other and less wise counsellors prevailed with David. Want of trust in God and a craven fear for his own life (see his words, <a href="/1_samuel/26-20.htm" title="Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as when one does hunt a partridge in the mountains.">1Samuel 26:20</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/26-24.htm" title="And, behold, as your life was much set by this day in my eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.">1Samuel 26:24</a>) drove him to leave the land of Israel, and to seek a refuge among his Philistine foes. One sin led on to another, when, in Philistia--to preserve that life of his--he commenced a course of duplicity, to carry out which he was driven to commit these terrible cruelties. "The prisoners taken would naturally have been part of the spoil; but David dared not bring them to Gath, lest his deceit should be discovered. Obviously these tribes (Geshurites, Gezerites, and Amalekites) were allies of the Philistines."<p><span class= "bld">Saying, So did David, and so will be his manner.</span>--The English Version of this passage is in accordance with the present punctuation in the Hebrew Bible, and represents these words as the saying of the slaughtered enemies. This is of itself most improbable. The Hebrew, too, will scarcely bear this interpretation; for the verb "to dwell" is a past, and cannot correctly be rendered "while he dwelleth." The Masoretic punctuation of the present Hebrew text is of comparatively recent date. It is better, then, in their place, with Maurer and Keil, the LXX., and Vulg. Versions, simply to put a stop after the words "so did David," and then begin a new sentence, which will read, "And so was his manner all the while he dwelt in the land of the Philistines;" understanding these words as a remark of the narrator of the history.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To bring tidings.</span> The A.V. is wrong in adding the word <span class="accented">tidings</span>, as the Hebrew means "to bring them to Gath." Prisoners to be sold as slaves formed an important part of the spoil of war in ancient times. But David, acting in accordance with the cruel customs of warfare in his days, and which he practised even when he had no urgent necessity as here (see <a href="/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>), put all his prisoners to death, lest, if taken to Gath and sold, they should betray him. The A.V. makes his conduct even more sanguinary, and supposes that he suffered none to escape. <span class="cmt_word">And so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth.</span> The Hebrew is "he dwelt," and thus the rendering of the A.V., though supported by the Masoretic punctuation, is untenable. But this punctuation is of comparatively recent date, and of moderate authority. The words really belong to the narrator, and should be translated, "And so was his manner all the days that he dwelt in the field of the Philistines." It seems that Achish was completely deceived by David, and supposing that his conduct would make him hateful forever to his own tribesmen of Judah, and so preclude his return home, he rejoiced in him as one who would always remain his faithful vassal and adherent. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/27-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1431;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did not {leave}</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1469;&#1488;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
