In <a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>, Samuel had previously told Saul that the kingdom would be torn from him due to his disobedience. This highlights the theme of divine sovereignty and the certainty of God's word. The role of prophets in Israel was to communicate God's will, and their words were seen as authoritative and binding.<p><b>The LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand:</b><br>The imagery of tearing signifies a violent and irreversible action, emphasizing the seriousness of Saul's disobedience. This echoes the earlier incident in <a href="/1_samuel/15-27.htm">1 Samuel 15:27-28</a>, where Saul's robe was torn, symbolizing the kingdom being taken from him. The kingdom of Israel was a theocracy, and Saul's failure to obey God led to his rejection as king. This act of tearing also reflects the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where obedience was required for blessing.<p><b>and given it to your neighbor David:</b><br>David, referred to as Saul's "neighbor," was chosen by God to be the next king of Israel. This choice was made in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16</a> when David was anointed by Samuel. The term "neighbor" signifies proximity and relationship, indicating that David was already within Saul's sphere, serving in his court. David is a type of Christ, as he is a shepherd-king who foreshadows Jesus, the Good Shepherd and King of Kings. The transfer of kingship to David also fulfills God's promise to establish a lasting dynasty through him, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who communicates His will and executes His judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The prophet who, even after his death, delivers God's message to Saul through the medium at Endor.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is facing the consequences of his disobedience to God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The neighbor to whom God has given the kingdom, anointed by Samuel as the future king of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/endor.htm">Endor</a></b><br>The location where Saul seeks out a medium to communicate with the deceased Samuel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_faithfulness.htm">God's Sovereignty and Faithfulness</a></b><br>God's plans and purposes will be fulfilled regardless of human actions.

Saul's rebellion is there said, in ver. 23, to be a crime as great as the witchcraft which he was at that time so zealously punishing; here, where the sentence is being carried into execution, Saul has himself become guilty of what in his better hours he so abominated. <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah will also deliver Israel with thee.</span> Rather, "will deliver Israel also with thee," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the nation is to share thy punishment. <span class="cmt_word">Tomorrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> shall be dead. Whence this voice came it is difficult to say. St. Augustine thought that the woman really conjured up a demon, who took the form of Samuel. Maimonides treats the whole as the effect of Saul's diseased imagination; while many modern commentators regard it as a well played piece of jugglery on the part of the woman, who recognised Saul at once on his entrance, but professed not to know him till his name was revealed to her by the pretended apparition, in whose name she reproached him for his crimes, announced to him, what now all were convinced of, that David was to be his successor, and foretold his defeat and death. In the face of such a passage as <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a> we cannot believe that the Bible would set before us an instance of witchcraft employed with the Divine sanction for holy purposes; but we can easily believe that the woman would gladly take a bitter revenge on the man who had cruelly put to death all persons reputed to have such powers as those to which she laid claim. The object of the narrative is plainly to set before us the completeness of Saul's moral downfall and debasement. Here is the man endowed with so many and so great gifts of genius, and who in so many things started so well and behaved so nobly, the victim of a despairing melancholy; his conscience is blackened with the wholesale massacre of the priesthood, his imagination is ever brooding over the sick fancy of treason plotted by his son-in-law, whom now he supposes to be in the Philistine camp; his enemies have invaded his territory in extraordinary numbers and upon new ground; to him it seems as if they have come to dethrone him and place his crown on David's head. In this dire extremity his one wish is to pry into futurity and learn his fate. There is no submission to God, no sorrow for disobedience, no sign of even a wish for amendment; it is to unholy arts that he looks, simply that he may know what a few more hours will make known to all. Neglecting his duties as a general and king, instead of making wise preparation for the coming fight, he disguises himself, takes a dangerous and wearisome journey round the enemies' camp, arrives at his destination by night, and, exhausted with hunger and mental agitation, seeks there for the knowledge unattainable in any upright manner from a reputed witch. He has rejected God, lost all the strength and comfort of true religion, and is become the victim of abject superstition. Whether he were the victim also of the woman's arts, or of his own sick fantasy, is not a matter of much consequence; the interest of the narrative lies in the revelation it makes to us of Saul's mental and moral state; and scarcely is there in the whole of Scripture anything more tragic than this narrative, or any more intense picture of the depth of degradation to which a noble but perverse intellect is capable of falling. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/28-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">[He]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has done</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1506;&#1463;&#1513;&#1474;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
