The use of a flask indicates a deliberate and formal act, as opposed to a casual or spontaneous one. Anointing with oil is a practice seen throughout the Old Testament, often associated with priests and kings (<a href="/exodus/30-30.htm">Exodus 30:30</a>, <a href="/1_kings/1-39.htm">1 Kings 1:39</a>).<p><b>poured it on Saul&#8217;s head</b><br>The act of pouring oil on the head signifies the bestowal of God&#8217;s Spirit and blessing. This act marks Saul as chosen by God for leadership. The head is symbolic of authority and leadership, and this anointing signifies Saul's divine appointment as king. This practice foreshadows the anointing of Jesus Christ, the Messiah, whose title means "Anointed One" (<a href="/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>).<p><b>kissed him</b><br>A kiss in this context is a sign of respect, acceptance, and allegiance. It indicates Samuel's personal endorsement of Saul as king. This gesture also reflects the cultural practices of the time, where a kiss could signify loyalty and submission (<a href="/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>).<p><b>and said, &#8220;Has not the LORD anointed you</b><br>Samuel emphasizes that it is the LORD who has chosen and anointed Saul, not merely a human decision. This divine selection underscores the theocratic nature of Israel's monarchy, where the king is seen as ruling under God's authority. This echoes the concept of divine right, where rulers are seen as appointed by God (<a href="/romans/13.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><b>ruler over His inheritance?</b><br>The term "inheritance" refers to the people of Israel, whom God considers His own possession (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-29.htm">Deuteronomy 9:29</a>). Saul is appointed as ruler over God's chosen people, highlighting the responsibility and sacred duty of his kingship. This phrase underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where the king serves as a steward of God's people, pointing forward to Jesus Christ, the ultimate Shepherd and King of God's inheritance (<a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel is a pivotal figure in the transition from the period of judges to the monarchy.

By using it here, Samuel signals that kingship is a sacred office set apart for God&#8217;s purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Poured it on Saul&#8217;s head</b><p>- The head symbolizes authority; the out-poured oil pictures God&#8217;s Spirit coming upon Saul to equip him (<a href="/1_samuel/10-6.htm">1 Samuel 10:6</a>; <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>).<p>- Other leaders were installed the same way&#8212;Aaron (<a href="/leviticus/8-12.htm">Leviticus 8:12</a>), David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>), and Jehu (<a href="/2_kings/9-6.htm">2 Kings 9:6</a>)&#8212;underscoring the continuity of God&#8217;s method.<p>- <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a> recalls, &#8220;You anoint my head with oil,&#8221; linking kingship with shepherding care for the people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Kissed him</b><p>- A kiss conveys acceptance, loyalty, and affection (<a href="/genesis/29-13.htm">Genesis 29:13</a>; <a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>). Samuel publicly affirms Saul before any skeptic can question the legitimacy of his appointment.<p>- This gesture also teaches that God&#8217;s representatives should bless what He ordains, modeling unity for the nation (<a href="/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Has not the LORD anointed you ruler over His inheritance?</b><p>- Samuel redirects all credit to &#8220;the LORD,&#8221; making clear that Saul&#8217;s authority originates in heaven (<a href="/daniel/4-17.htm">Daniel 4:17</a>; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p>- &#8220;Ruler&#8221; (or &#8220;prince&#8221; in some translations) stresses stewardship more than domination; Saul is to govern under God, not replace Him (<a href="/1_samuel/12-14.htm">1 Samuel 12:14</a>).<p>- &#8220;His inheritance&#8221; refers to Israel, described elsewhere as God&#8217;s treasured possession (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-9.htm">Deuteronomy 32:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/33-12.htm">Psalm 33:12</a>). Saul rules people who already belong to Yahweh, so every decision must honor their true Owner.<p>- This clause reminds us that leadership is a trust, not a personal entitlement&#8212;an idea echoed when David later refuses to harm &#8220;the LORD&#8217;s anointed&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a> records a literal, historical event where God, through Samuel, sets Saul apart as Israel&#8217;s first king. The flask of oil shows sacred consecration; the pouring signifies the Spirit&#8217;s enablement; the kiss demonstrates public affirmation; and the final declaration roots Saul&#8217;s authority in God alone. Together these elements teach that leadership among God&#8217;s people is a holy stewardship granted, equipped, and overseen by the LORD Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Then-Samuel took a vial of oil.</span>--The vial was a narrow-necked vessel, from which the oil flowed in drops. It was, of course, no common oil which the prophet used on this momentous occasion, but the oil of holy ointment, the sacred anointing oil which was used at the consecration of the priests, and also of the Tabernacle and the sacred vessels. (See <a href="/exodus/29-7.htm" title="Then shall you take the anointing oil, and pour it on his head, and anoint him.">Exodus 29:7</a>; <a href="/context/exodus/30-23.htm" title="Take you also to you principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty shekels,">Exodus 30:23-33</a>, &c.) The solemn anointing took place in the ceremony of consecration in the case of some, but not of all, the Hebrew sovereigns. We hear of it at the accession of David, Absalom, Solomon, Joash, Jehoahaz, And Jehu. In cases of regular succession the anointing was supposed to continue its effect--that is, the regular succession needed no new anointing. Hence it is that only the above named kings are mentioned as having been anointed, all founders of dynasties or irregularly advanced to the throne. (See Erdman in <span class= "ital">Lange </span>here.)<p><span class= "bld">And kissed him.</span>--Rather as a customary sign of reverential homage than as a mark of affection, which at that early date of their acquaintance it was hardly possible to assume that the old man felt for the younger. (Compare <a href="/psalms/2-12.htm" title="Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.">Psalm 2:12</a> : "Kiss the son, lest he be angry": that is, "Do homage, O ye kings of the earth, to Him who is your anointed King.")<p><span class= "bld">The Lord hath anointed thee.</span>--Samuel replies to the look and gesture of extreme astonishment with which the young Saul received the anointing and the kiss with these words: "Do you mutely ask me why I pay you this formal homage? why I salute you with such deep respect?

Throughout Holy Scripture the office of king appears as one most sacred, and it is the king, and not the priest, who is especially called Messiah, Jehovah s anointed (<a href="/1_samuel/2-10.htm">1 Samuel 2:10, 35</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/12-3.htm">1 Samuel 12:3, 5</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-6.htm">1 Samuel 16:6</a>, etc.), because he represented the authority and power of God. <span class="cmt_word">And kissed him.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> did homage to him, and gave him the symbol and token of allegiance (see <a href="/psalms/2-12.htm">Psalm 2:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Is it not?</span>.... A strong affirmation often takes the form of a question, especially when, as probably was the case here, surprise is manifested. Saul, on whom the occurrences of the previous day must have come as strange and unintelligible marvels, was no doubt still more embarrassed when one so old and venerable, both in person and office, as Samuel solemnly consecrated him to be Israel's prince (see <a href="/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16</a>), and gave him the kiss of fealty and allegiance. Samuel, therefore, answers Saul's inquiring looks with this question, and, further, gives him three signs to quiet his doubts, and convince him that his appointment is from God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/10-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Samuel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1461;&#1436;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8050.htm">Strong's 8050: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samuel -- 'name of God', a prophet of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
