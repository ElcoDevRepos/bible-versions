This phrase indicates Samuel's return to his resting place after receiving a profound message from God. The act of lying down suggests a return to normalcy and obedience, as he waits for the appropriate time to act. In the context of ancient Israel, night was often a time for divine revelation, as seen in other biblical accounts such as Jacob's dream (<a href="/genesis/28-10.htm">Genesis 28:10-17</a>). Samuel's ability to return to sleep after such an encounter demonstrates his trust and peace in God's presence.<p><b>then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD.</b><br>Opening the doors of the house of the LORD was likely part of Samuel's duties as a servant in the tabernacle. This act signifies the beginning of a new day and the continuation of worship and service in the house of God. The tabernacle, located in Shiloh at this time, was the central place of worship for the Israelites. Samuel's role in opening the doors symbolizes his growing responsibility and foreshadows his future leadership. This act also connects to the idea of Jesus as the door (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>), through whom believers enter into the presence of God.<p><b>He was afraid to tell Eli the vision,</b><br>Samuel's fear in sharing the vision with Eli reflects the weight and seriousness of the message he received. The vision was a prophecy of judgment against Eli's household due to the sins of his sons, Hophni and Phinehas, and Eli's failure to restrain them (<a href="/1_samuel/3-11.htm">1 Samuel 3:11-14</a>). In the cultural context, delivering a message of judgment to a superior, especially one like Eli who was both a father figure and a priest, would have been daunting. This fear highlights Samuel's humility and respect for Eli, as well as the challenging nature of prophetic ministry. It also prefigures the role of prophets in Israel, who often delivered difficult messages from God, much like Jesus, who spoke truth even when it was unpopular (<a href="/john/8-40.htm">John 8:40</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A young boy serving in the temple under Eli, chosen by God to be a prophet.
