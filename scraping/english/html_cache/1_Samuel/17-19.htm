Saul, the first king of Israel, is leading the Israelite army. This highlights the central role of Saul as a military leader, though his leadership is increasingly questioned due to his disobedience to God (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>). The presence of "all the men of Israel" underscores the national significance of this conflict, as the entire nation is represented in this battle. This gathering of Israel's forces can be seen as a fulfillment of the people's desire for a king to lead them in battle, as expressed in <a href="/1_samuel/8-20.htm">1 Samuel 8:20</a>.<p><b>in the Valley of Elah</b><br>The Valley of Elah is a significant geographical location, situated approximately 15 miles southwest of Jerusalem. It serves as a natural battleground due to its wide, open spaces. Archaeological findings, such as the ancient fortress at Khirbet Qeiyafa, provide evidence of the historical accuracy of this setting. The valley's strategic importance is underscored by its location between the Philistine cities and the heartland of Israel, making it a frequent site of conflict. The Valley of Elah is also notable for its association with the famous battle between David and Goliath, which occurs later in this chapter.<p><b>fighting against the Philistines.</b><br>The Philistines were a formidable enemy of Israel, known for their advanced military technology, including iron weaponry and chariots. Their presence in the land posed a significant threat to the Israelites, both militarily and culturally. The Philistines' repeated incursions into Israelite territory reflect the ongoing struggle for dominance in the region. This conflict is not only a physical battle but also a spiritual one, as the Philistines worshiped gods like Dagon, in contrast to the Israelites' worship of Yahweh. The battle against the Philistines can be seen as a type of the spiritual warfare faced by believers, with David's eventual victory over Goliath foreshadowing Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, chosen by God but later rejected due to disobedience.

Jesse&#8217;s report hints at the tension between the king&#8217;s calling and his current fear.<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us that battles are fought under leadership&#8212;good or bad&#8212;and that God still works even through imperfect leaders (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>; <a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all the men of Israel</b><p>&#8226; The entire fighting force has been mustered; this is a national crisis, not a skirmish (<a href="/1_samuel/8-20.htm">1 Samuel 8:20</a>; 14:52).<p>&#8226; Corporate language emphasizes covenant solidarity: victory or defeat will affect every tribe (<a href="/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/7-5.htm">1 Samuel 7:5-8</a>).<p>&#8226; It sets the stage for David&#8217;s later words, &#8220;the battle belongs to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>), because when all Israel is present, God&#8217;s honor is publicly at stake (<a href="/joshua/4-24.htm">Joshua 4:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the Valley of Elah</b><p>&#8226; A real, identifiable location about fifteen miles southwest of Bethlehem (<a href="/joshua/15-33.htm">Joshua 15:33</a>). The Bible places events in verifiable geography, underscoring its historical reliability.<p>&#8226; The valley forms a natural corridor toward the Judean hills; whoever controls it gains access to the heartland. Military strategy, not mere coincidence, has brought both armies here (<a href="/1_samuel/17-1.htm">1 Samuel 17:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Later, David will retrieve Goliath&#8217;s sword from Nob, and the priest will recall this very battlefield (<a href="/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>), linking God&#8217;s past faithfulness to future needs.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>fighting</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Fighting&#8221; implies active engagement, yet the narrative reveals a stalemate: forty days of taunts from Goliath with no forward motion (<a href="/1_samuel/17-16.htm">1 Samuel 17:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often uses battle scenes to expose spiritual realities; here the word prepares us for a contest that will be won by faith, not armor (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-17</a>).<p>&#8226; The verb highlights that Israel&#8217;s soldiers are not spectators&#8212;tension is mounting, and God is about to intervene through an unexpected agent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>against the Philistines</b><p>&#8226; The Philistines are long-standing enemies, repeatedly threatening Israel&#8217;s covenant land (<a href="/judges/13-1.htm">Judges 13:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/7-13.htm">1 Samuel 7:13</a>; 14:52).<p>&#8226; Their challenge at Elah continues a pattern: every time Israel&#8217;s faith wanes, Philistine pressure intensifies, driving the nation back to dependence on the LORD (<a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming the foe, the verse reminds us that God&#8217;s people face identifiable adversaries; deliverance is never abstract but concrete, just as Goliath will be a literal giant felled by a literal stone (<a href="/1_samuel/17-49.htm">1 Samuel 17:49-50</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/17-19.htm">1 Samuel 17:19</a> situates David&#8217;s brothers, King Saul, and the entire army at a critical geographic and spiritual juncture. The Valley of Elah is the stage; Saul is the earthly leader; the Philistines are the tangible threat. Yet the verse quietly sets up the revelation that victory will not come from numbers or armor but from trust in the LORD. In a single sentence, Scripture reminds us that God works through real people, real places, and real conflicts to display His faithfulness and power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">In the valley of Elan, fighting with the Philistines.</span>--The words of this verse, which read in the English Version as an explanatory parenthesis, are really part of Jesse's direction to his shepherd son, telling him where he would find his brethren.
