This anger is not just a personal vendetta but also a sign of Saul's spiritual decline, as he moves further away from God's guidance. Jonathan, Saul's son, is caught in the middle, loyal to both his father and David, his friend. This tension highlights the familial and political strife within Saul's household.<p><b>and he said to him, &#8220;You son of a perverse and rebellious woman!</b><br>Saul's insult towards Jonathan's mother is a reflection of his irrational state and his attempt to shame Jonathan. In ancient Israelite culture, family honor was paramount, and such an insult would have been deeply offensive. Saul's words reveal his desperation and loss of control, as he lashes out at those closest to him. This phrase also underscores the breakdown of Saul's family, both spiritually and relationally.<p><b>Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse</b><br>Saul's reference to David as "the son of Jesse" rather than by name indicates his disdain and refusal to acknowledge David's growing importance. Saul's paranoia is evident as he accuses Jonathan of betrayal. This accusation highlights the tension between Saul's house and David, who is anointed by God to be the next king. Jonathan's choice to support David over his father is a testament to his recognition of God's will and his own integrity.<p><b>to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you?</b><br>Saul's focus on shame reflects the cultural importance of honor and family reputation in ancient Israel. By aligning with David, Jonathan risks his own status and that of his family. Saul's words are meant to manipulate Jonathan through guilt and familial duty. This phrase also foreshadows the eventual downfall of Saul's lineage, contrasting with the rise of David's house, which is established by God. Jonathan's loyalty to David, despite the potential for shame, is a precursor to the self-sacrificial love exemplified by Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Probably he had determined at that very feast, surrounded by his own devoted friends and members of his family, to carry out his evil designs against David's life.<p>Murder was, probably enough, one of the incidents arranged for at that banquet, but the absence of the intended victim marred the plot; besides which, the king, too, with the cunning which the partially insane so often display, saw through the veil of the specious excuse that David too clearly suspected his wicked design, and purposely stayed away; nay, more, that his own son Jonathan, the heir of his kingdom, suspected him, and openly sympathised with his friend David, for whose pointed absence he thus publicly apologised.<p><span class= "bld">Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman.</span>--These words, spoken in public, in any sense were a bitter insult to the prince. Another and better rendering has, however, been suggested. The word <span class= "ital">na?vath, </span>rendered <span class= "ital">perverse, </span>instead of being a feminine adjective, is probably an abstract noun. The translation would then run, "Thou son of perversity of rebellion," a common Hebraism for "a man of perverse and refractory nature;" so Clericus, Lange, and Payne Smith.

Literally, "thou son of one perverse in rebellion." In the East it is the greatest possible insult to a man to call his mother names; but the word rendered <span class="accented">perverse</span>, instead of being a feminine adjective, is probably an abstract noun, and "son of perversity of rebellion" would mean one who was thoroughly perverse in his resistance to his father's will. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> thy mother will feel ashamed and disgraced at having borne such a son. <span class="cmt_word">He shall surely die.</span> Hebrew, "he is a son of death," <span class="accented">son</span>, being constantly used in Hebrew to express qualities, or, as here, the fate to which a man is destined. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/20-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Saul's</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">anger</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1444;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ap&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_639.htm">Strong's 639: </a> </span><span class="str2">The nose, nostril, the face, a person, ire</span><br /><br /><span class="word">burned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1495;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#183;&#7717;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
