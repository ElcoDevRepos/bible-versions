This location sets the stage for Saul's encounter with Samuel, which is pivotal in the narrative of Saul's anointing as king. The mention of Zuph connects to the broader biblical theme of divine providence and guidance, as God orchestrates events leading Saul to Samuel.<p><b>Saul said to his servant</b><br>Saul, the son of Kish, is introduced as a young man from the tribe of Benjamin. His interaction with his servant highlights his status and the social norms of the time, where servants accompanied their masters on journeys. This relationship also reflects Saul's initial humility and reliance on others for counsel, a trait that contrasts with his later kingship. The servant's role is crucial, as he suggests seeking the prophet Samuel, demonstrating God's use of seemingly minor characters to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>Come, let us go back</b><br>Saul's suggestion to return home indicates his concern for his father's peace of mind, showing his sense of responsibility and familial duty. This decision point is critical, as it leads to the encounter with Samuel, which was divinely orchestrated. The narrative tension here underscores the theme of divine intervention in human affairs, as Saul's mundane concern about returning home is part of God's larger plan for Israel.<p><b>or my father will stop worrying about the donkeys</b><br>The lost donkeys serve as a narrative device to bring Saul to Samuel. In the ancient Near East, donkeys were valuable assets, essential for transportation and agriculture, reflecting Kish's wealth and concern. This concern for the donkeys illustrates the practical and immediate worries of life, which God uses to direct Saul's path. The mention of donkeys also subtly foreshadows Saul's future role, as kingship involves both mundane and significant responsibilities.<p><b>and start worrying about us</b><br>Saul's awareness of his father's potential worry for their safety highlights the familial bonds and responsibilities in ancient Israelite culture. This concern for personal safety and well-being is a recurring theme in the biblical narrative, emphasizing the human element in God's unfolding plan. Saul's statement also reflects his character at this point&#8212;considerate and mindful of his father's feelings, traits that are significant in understanding his initial suitability for leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The son of Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin, who would later become the first king of Israel.

Zuph is tied to Samuel&#8217;s family line (<a href="/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>), quietly signaling that God is steering Saul toward the prophet even through a mundane errand. Like Abram reaching the place God would reveal (<a href="/genesis/12-5.htm">Genesis 12:5-7</a>) or the two disciples unknowingly approaching Emmaus with Jesus (<a href="/luke/24-13.htm">Luke 24:13-15</a>), ordinary geography becomes a stage for extraordinary guidance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Saul said to his servant</b><p>Saul, though the son of a &#8220;mighty man of valor&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a>), includes his servant in the decision-making. This echoes Jonathan later conferring with his armor-bearer (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6-7</a>) and David listening to Abigail (<a href="/1_samuel/25-32.htm">1 Samuel 25:32-33</a>). Scripture repeatedly portrays wise leaders as willing to hear advice (<a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>). Saul&#8217;s openness here reveals an early humility before the crown ever touches his head.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Come, let us go back</b><p>The proposal sounds practical&#8212;resources are spent, the goal unmet. Yet in God&#8217;s design the apparent failure is the very path to success, for turning back will bring Saul face-to-face with Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/9-14.htm">1 Samuel 9:14</a>). Many biblical journeys look counter-productive just before a breakthrough&#8212;Israel boxed in at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-1.htm">Exodus 14:1-4</a>) or Peter ready to quit fishing when Jesus says, &#8220;Put out into deep water&#8221; (<a href="/luke/5-4.htm">Luke 5:4-6</a>). Our detours can be divine appointments.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My father will stop worrying about the donkeys and start worrying about us</b><p>Saul&#8217;s concern is relational, not merely logistical. Honoring a parent&#8217;s peace of mind fulfills the heart of the fifth commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="/ephesians/6-2.htm">Ephesians 6:2</a>). Kish&#8217;s anxiety foreshadows Jacob&#8217;s anguish over Joseph (<a href="/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a>) and contrasts Eli&#8217;s dull concern for wayward sons (<a href="/1_samuel/2-29.htm">1 Samuel 2:29</a>). The donkeys mattered, but the sons mattered more&#8212;Saul recognizes this and acts accordingly. Ironically, even as he seeks to ease his father&#8217;s fears, God is preparing him to bear the fears of an entire nation (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>&#8226; A lost-donkey quest leads Saul to Zuph, the prophet&#8217;s homeland, showing God&#8217;s quiet orchestration.<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s willingness to confer with a servant highlights early humility and teachability.<p>&#8226; The decision to turn back appears sensible yet precisely positions Saul for divine encounter.<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s filial concern underscores biblical honor for parents and prefigures his emerging leadership.<p><a href="/1_samuel/9-5.htm">1 Samuel 9:5</a> thus reminds us that routine problems, respectful dialogue, prudent choices, and family responsibilities can all be woven by God into His larger redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">The land of Zuph.</span>--This was believed to be in the south-west of Benjamin.<p><span class= "bld">Lest my father . . . take thought for us.</span>--"Saul's tender regard for his father's feelings here is a favourable indication of character."--<span class= "ital">Dr. Kitto.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The land of Zuph.</span> See on 1 Samuel 1:1.
