The biblical context reveals that God had given Saul a clear command through the prophet Samuel to completely destroy the Amalekites (<a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>). Saul's assertion of obedience is contradicted by his actions, highlighting a common theme in Scripture where outward compliance is mistaken for true obedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). This phrase also reflects the human tendency to justify partial obedience as full compliance, a theme seen throughout the Bible.<p><b>Saul replied.</b><br>Saul's response to Samuel is defensive, indicating his awareness of having not fully complied with God's command. This interaction between Saul and Samuel is significant as it marks a turning point in Saul's reign. The historical context shows that Saul's kingship was initially marked by divine favor, but his repeated disobedience led to his rejection by God (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>).<p><b>I went on the mission that the LORD gave me.</b><br>Saul acknowledges that the mission was divinely appointed, which underscores the gravity of his partial obedience. The mission against the Amalekites was not merely a military campaign but a divine judgment against a people who had long opposed Israel (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>). This mission was a continuation of God's promise to blot out the memory of Amalek, showing the fulfillment of divine prophecy.<p><b>I brought back Agag king of Amalek</b><br>Saul's decision to spare Agag is a direct violation of God's command. In the cultural and historical context, sparing a king could be seen as a political move to gain favor or as a trophy of war. However, in the biblical narrative, it represents Saul's failure to fully execute God's judgment. This act of disobedience foreshadows the eventual downfall of Saul's kingship and contrasts with the complete obedience expected of a king in Israel.<p><b>and devoted the Amalekites to destruction.</b><br>The term "devoted to destruction" refers to the Hebrew concept of "herem," which means to completely destroy as an offering to God. This was a common practice in ancient Israel when dealing with certain enemies, signifying total consecration to God. Saul's incomplete obedience in this regard is significant because it demonstrates a failure to honor God's holiness and justice. This concept is echoed in other biblical narratives where incomplete obedience leads to negative consequences (<a href="/joshua/7.htm">Joshua 7:1-26</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Saul&#8217;s &#8220;but&#8221; pushes back against that charge.<p>&#8226; True obedience is measured by God&#8217;s standard, not ours (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). Claiming faithfulness while redefining it is self-deception (<a href="/1_john/2-4.htm">1 John 2:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul is echoing Israel&#8217;s pattern in Judges: &#8220;Everyone did what was right in his own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). By insisting he obeyed, Saul reveals how far his eyes have drifted from God&#8217;s clear command (<a href="/1_samuel/15-1.htm">1 Samuel 15:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I went on the mission that the LORD gave me</b><p>Here Saul rehearses the assignment as proof of loyalty.<p>&#8226; Mission language reminds us that God&#8217;s call is specific (<a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>; <a href="/acts/26-19.htm">Acts 26:19</a>). Partial completion is not mission accomplished.<p>&#8226; God had said, &#8220;Now go and attack Amalek and devote to destruction all that belongs to them&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>). Saul&#8217;s summary omits the word &#8220;all,&#8221; signaling selectivity.<p>&#8226; Jesus links love to full obedience: &#8220;If you love Me, you will keep My commandments&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>). Saul&#8217;s mission talk lacks that love; it centers on his effort, not God&#8217;s honor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I brought back Agag king of Amalek and devoted the Amalekites to destruction</b><p>With this admission Saul unwittingly proves his disobedience.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s command was to leave no survivor (<a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>). Sparing Agag contradicts that order.<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;brought back&#8221; shows Saul assumed authority to revise God&#8217;s plan, much like Uzzah later presumed to steady the ark (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6-7</a>). Both acts ended in judgment.<p>&#8226; Keeping Agag alive allowed the symbol of Amalek&#8217;s rebellion to linger. Centuries later Haman the Agagite rises against Israel (<a href="/esther/3-1.htm">Esther 3:1</a>), illustrating the long-term cost of unfinished obedience.<p>&#8226; Even Saul&#8217;s claim to have &#8220;devoted the Amalekites to destruction&#8221; is selective; verse 9 records that he and the people spared &#8220;the best of the sheep and cattle.&#8221; God sees the hidden exceptions (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/15-20.htm">1 Samuel 15:20</a> captures Saul&#8217;s self-justification. He frames partial compliance as full obedience, redefining God&#8217;s clear command to suit his reputation. The verse warns that doing &#8220;most&#8221; of what God says while reserving personal preferences is still disobedience. True allegiance submits without editing, trusts God&#8217;s wisdom above human reasoning, and obeys completely for His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Yea, I have obeyed . . .</span>--These and the words which follow are simply a repetition of the king's former excuse for his act: but they show us what was the state of Saul's mind: he evidently disbelieved in the power of the Eternal as a heart reader. If he could justify himself before Samuel, that was all he cared for. He asserted his own integrity of purpose and his great zeal for the public sacrifice to God, knowing all the while that low earthly reasons had been the springs of his conduct. He reiterated the plea that what he had done was in accordance with the voice of the people, conscious all the while that the plea was false.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20, 21.</span> - Saul's justifcation of himself is remarkable, as he seems entirely unconscious of having done anything wrong. His education had no doubt been defective (<a href="/1_samuel/10-12.htm">1 Samuel 10:12</a>), and his knowledge of the law was probably very small; but he must have listened to Samuel's injunctions in a very off hand way, and have troubled himself about very little more than that he was to make war upon the Amalekites. There may even have been the wish in his mind to let Samuel know that he was now king, and would carry on affairs after his own fashion. The very form of his answer requires notice; for the word rendered <span class="cmt_word">yea</span> is literally <span class="accented">in that</span>, or <span class="accented">because</span>, and may be paraphrased as follows: Do you reproach me thus because I have obeyed you? See, there is Agag in proof of our victory; and if the people have spared the cattle, it was with the best of intentions. The next clause, <span class="cmt_word">the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed,</span> reads in the A.V. like an ironical parenthesis. It is not so, but an important part of Saul's defence. These sheep and oxen were "the best of the devoted things," selected as the first fruits for sacrifice. Saul may not have known that such a sacrifice was forbidden (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-15.htm">Deuteronomy 13:15-17</a>). The words, <span class="cmt_word">to sacrifice unto Jehovah thy God,</span> imply that Samuel ought to be pleased at the victorious army doing this public homage to the Deity whose prophet he was.
