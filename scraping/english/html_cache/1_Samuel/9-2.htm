His name means "asked for" or "prayed for," which may reflect the Israelites' desire for a king. Saul's lineage is from the tribe of Benjamin, the smallest of the tribes, which is significant given the tribe's tumultuous history (Judges 20-21). This choice highlights God's sovereignty in selecting leaders, often choosing the unexpected or the least likely.<p><b>choice and handsome</b><br>Saul's physical appearance is emphasized, indicating that he was an ideal candidate for kingship by human standards. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, physical appearance was often associated with leadership qualities. This description sets the stage for the contrast between Saul and David, whose heart, rather than appearance, is highlighted by God (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><b>without equal among the Israelites</b><br>This phrase underscores Saul's exceptional qualities, setting him apart from his peers. It reflects the people's desire for a king who stands out, aligning with their request for a leader like those of other nations (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>). This also foreshadows the people's initial acceptance and later rejection of Saul as king.<p><b>a head taller than any of the people</b><br>Saul's height is a literal and symbolic representation of his stature among the Israelites. In a culture where physical prowess was valued, his height would have been seen as an advantage in leadership and battle. This physical attribute, however, contrasts with the spiritual qualities God values, as seen in David's selection. Saul's height also foreshadows his eventual downfall, as his reliance on physical attributes and human approval leads to his disobedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The son of Kish, described as an impressive young man, chosen by God to be the first king of Israel.

The verse grounds him in Kish&#8217;s respected family line (<a href="/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a>), fulfilling <a href="/deuteronomy/17-15.htm">Deuteronomy 17:15</a> that a king must be &#8220;from among your brothers.&#8221; Like Moses (<a href="/exodus/2-10.htm">Exodus 2:10</a>) and Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/1-20.htm">1 Samuel 1:20</a>), his very name foreshadows God&#8217;s answer to a national plea. The narrative invites readers to see God&#8217;s providence in ordinary genealogy&#8212;Kish&#8217;s son is the one the Lord will use, even as <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a> reminds that &#8220;the LORD directs&#8221; our paths.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Choice and handsome</b><p>Scripture notes Saul was &#8220;choice and handsome,&#8221; a phrase used for Joseph (<a href="/genesis/39-6.htm">Genesis 39:6</a>) and David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Choice&#8221; signals quality&#8212;Saul appears perfectly suited for leadership (<a href="/judges/8-22.htm">Judges 8:22</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Handsome&#8221; points to outward appeal, echoing <a href="/proverbs/31-30.htm">Proverbs 31:30</a> that beauty is inadequate without fear of the Lord.<p>God will later contrast this external attractiveness with His preference for inner devotion (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). In the short term, though, Saul&#8217;s looks satisfy Israel&#8217;s desire for a king &#8220;like all the nations&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/8-20.htm">1 Samuel 8:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Without equal among the Israelites</b><p>To the people, Saul is incomparable&#8212;an answer to their longing for a visible champion. Similar language appears of Job&#8217;s integrity (<a href="/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a>) and Solomon&#8217;s wisdom (<a href="/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>). Yet uniqueness can tempt pride (<a href="/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13</a>), foreshadowing Saul&#8217;s later downfall.

Saul&#8217;s height will not protect him when he turns from obedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/9-2.htm">1 Samuel 9:2</a> introduces Saul as the ideal king in human eyes&#8212;well-born, strikingly handsome, unmatched, and towering. Each description affirms God&#8217;s literal provision of a leader yet subtly warns that external greatness cannot replace wholehearted submission. The verse therefore sets up both hope and caution: God hears Israel and raises up Saul, but ultimate security rests not in appearance or stature, only in steadfast obedience to the Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">A choice young man, and a goodly.</span>--The Hebrew word which is rendered in English by "a choice young man" cannot signify both these epithets. The translators were probably influenced by the Vulg. (Latin) Version, which translates the Hebrew word by <span class= "ital">electus, </span>"chosen, or choice," the more common signification of the Hebrew word being avoided, owing to the fact that at this time Saul appears <span class= "ital">to </span>have had a son (Jonathan) who must have well-nigh reached his maturity. But the term young was not inappropriate to Saul, who was still in the full vigour of manhood as contrasted with the old age of Samuel, being about forty to forty-five years old. Translate then simply, "a young man," &c. In the childhood of nations heroic proportions were highly valued, and the gigantic stature and the remarkable beauty of the king, no doubt contributed to the ready acceptance on the part of the still semi-barbarous Israel of the young man Saul. (Comp. <span class= "ital">Herodotus, </span>3:20, 7:187; Aristotle, <span class= "ital">Polit., </span>4:29; and Virgil's description of Turnus, <span class= "ital">'neid, </span>7:650, 783; and Homer's words about Ajax, <span class= "ital">Iliad, iii.</span> 226.)<p><span class= "bld">The asses.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">And the she-asses. </span>At this period of Jewish history asses were much used by the people. The horse was forbidden by the Law. Asses were used not only for purposes of agriculture, but also for riding; so in the song of Deborah we find, "Speak, ye that ride on white asses" (<a href="/judges/5-10.htm" title="Speak, you that ride on white asses, you that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.">Judges 5:10</a>); and again we read of the thirty sons of Jair, the Gileadite judge, each one ruler of a city, who rode on thirty ass colts (<a href="/judges/10-4.htm" title="And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.">Judges 10:4</a>). These belonging to the farm of Kish, being probably kept for breeding purposes, were untethered, and so strayed from the immediate neighbourhood, and were lost.<p>The whole of this chapter and part of the following is full of picturesque details of the pastoral life of the people. In many of the little pictures we see how strongly at this early period the religion of the Eternal coloured almost all parts of the every-day life of Israel.<p><span class= "bld">One of the servants.</span>--The "servant," not "slave;" the Hebrew word for the latter would be different. The servant was evidently a trusty dependant of the house of Saul's father, and was on familiar terms with his young master. We hear of his giving wise advice in the course of the search (<a href="/1_samuel/9-6.htm" title="And he said to him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he said comes surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can show us our way that we should go.">1Samuel 9:6</a>)<span class= "ital">; </span>he was the one in charge of the money (<a href="/1_samuel/9-8.htm" title="And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.">1Samuel 9:8</a>); and this servant, we are especially told, was treated by Samuel the judge as an honoured guest at the sacrificial feast at Ramah. He was traditionally believed to have been Doeg the Edomite, afterwards so famous as one of the most ruthless of the great captains of King Saul. (See <a href="/1_samuel/22-18.htm" title="And the king said to Doeg, Turn you, and fall on the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell on the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.">1Samuel 22:18</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He had a son, whose name was Saul.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> <span class="accented">asked</span>, a name usually given to a firstborn son. <span class="cmt_word">A choice young man.</span> This is a double translation of the Hebrew word, and consequently one half or other must be wrong. It may either be a participle, <span class="accented">elect</span> or <span class="accented">choice</span>, and is so rendered by the Syriac and Vulgate; or an adjective, <span class="accented">young</span>, the rendering of the Chaldee, and virtually of the Septuagint, which gives <span class="accented">well grown.</span> This is the preferable translation; for the word constantly occurs coupled with virgin (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-25.htm">Deuteronomy 32:25</a>; <a href="/isaiah/62-5.htm">Isaiah 62:5</a>, etc.), for one in the full flower of manhood. Saul could not, therefore, have been the runner of <a href="/1_samuel/5-12.htm">1 Samuel 5:12</a>, though, as we read that Jonathan his son was a grown man two or three years afterwards (<a href="/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2</a>), he must have been at least thirty-five years of age, after making allowance for the early period at which the Jews married. His noble appearance and gigantic stature were well fitted to impress and overawe a semi-barbarous people, who were better able to form an estimate of his physical qualities than of the high mental and moral gifts possessed by Samuel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/9-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1493;&#1465;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#333;w-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
