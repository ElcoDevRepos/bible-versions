A weaver's beam was a large, sturdy piece of wood used in looms, suggesting that Goliath's spear was unusually thick and heavy. This detail underscores the physical challenge David faced, as Goliath's weaponry was beyond what a typical soldier would carry. The comparison to a weaver's beam also reflects the craftsmanship and resources available to the Philistines, indicating their advanced military technology. This imagery sets the stage for the miraculous nature of David's victory, as it contrasts the seemingly insurmountable odds against him.<p><b>and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels</b><br>The iron point of Goliath's spear weighing six hundred shekels (approximately 15 pounds or 6.8 kilograms) further illustrates the giant's strength and the threat he posed. Iron was a valuable and advanced material at the time, signifying the Philistines' technological superiority over the Israelites, who were still primarily using bronze. This detail not only highlights Goliath's might but also the Philistine advantage in warfare. The weight of the spearhead would have made it a devastating weapon, capable of piercing armor and causing significant damage. This aspect of the narrative emphasizes the divine intervention required for David's victory, as human strength and weaponry alone would not suffice.<p><b>In addition, his shield bearer went before him</b><br>The presence of a shield bearer indicates Goliath's status as a champion warrior, as only the most elite soldiers would have an attendant to carry their shield. This practice was common in ancient warfare, where a shield bearer would provide additional protection and support, allowing the warrior to focus on offense. The shield bearer's role also highlights the intimidation factor of Goliath's appearance, as he was not only heavily armed but also accompanied by an assistant, enhancing his imposing presence. This detail serves to heighten the contrast between Goliath and David, who faced the giant without armor or a shield bearer, relying solely on his faith in God. The shield bearer going before Goliath can also be seen as a type of the forerunner, a role fulfilled by John the Baptist in the New Testament, who prepared the way for Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/goliath.htm">Goliath</a></b><br>A Philistine giant from Gath, known for his immense size and strength, who challenged the Israelites and defied their God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd who later becomes the king of Israel, known for his faith in God and his victory over Goliath.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>An ancient people who were enemies of Israel, often at war with them during the time of the judges and early monarchy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, led by King Saul at this time, who were challenged by Goliath and the Philistines.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/valley_of_elah.htm">Valley of Elah</a></b><br>The location where the battle between the Israelites and the Philistines took place, and where David confronted Goliath.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god_vs._human_strength.htm">The Power of God vs. Human Strength</a></b><br>Goliath's impressive weaponry and armor symbolize human strength and intimidation.

A weaver&#8217;s beam was the thick, sturdy bar that held heavy fabric on a loom. By likening Goliath&#8217;s spear shaft to that beam, the text underlines how massive and unwieldy the weapon was.<p>&#8211; This is not the only time God&#8217;s Word uses the image. In <a href="/2_samuel/21-19.htm">2 Samuel 21:19</a> and <a href="/1_chronicles/11-23.htm">1 Chronicles 11:23</a>, other giants carry spears &#8220;like a weaver&#8217;s beam,&#8221; confirming that such weaponry belonged to men of extraordinary stature.<p>&#8211; The detail magnifies the human impossibility David faced. While Israel saw an unbeatable warrior, God saw an opportunity to remind His people that &#8220;the battle is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Its iron point weighed six hundred shekels</b><p>&#8211; Six hundred shekels equals roughly 15 pounds (about 7 kg). By comparison, modern Olympic javelins weigh just over 1 &#189; pounds. The verse states: &#8220;its iron point weighed six hundred shekels&#8221;, underscoring the lethal power behind every thrust.<p>&#8211; Iron itself was a mark of cutting-edge technology in Saul&#8217;s day (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19-22</a>). Goliath wielded the best metal, the greatest weight, and the most advanced armor&#8212;yet <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a> reminds us, &#8220;Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.&#8221;<p>&#8211; The sheer weight highlights the miracle: a shepherd armed only with a sling overcame a warrior whose spearhead alone outweighed David&#8217;s entire arsenal (<a href="/1_samuel/17-40.htm">1 Samuel 17:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In addition, his shield bearer went before him</b><p>&#8211; Elite soldiers employed an armor-bearer to carry a large shield (17:41). That shield would create a moving wall, covering the champion while he advanced.<p>&#8211; The detail points to strategy and intimidation. Goliath&#8217;s height (17:4), bronze armor (17:5-6), massive spear, and now a personal bodyguard presented a seemingly impenetrable force. Yet <a href="/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a> warns, &#8220;Woe to those who rely on horses&#8230; but do not look to the Holy One of Israel.&#8221;<p>&#8211; David faced not one opponent but two, and still declared, &#8220;You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD of Hosts&#8221; (17:45). The presence of a shield bearer only serves to heighten the glory that belongs to God when the giant falls.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a> piles detail upon detail so readers grasp the physical dominance of Goliath: a spear as thick as a loom&#8217;s beam, a spearhead heavier than most modern bowling balls, and an attendant shielding his every move. The verse is literal, historical fact, and its purpose is theological: to contrast human might with God&#8217;s might. In the face of overwhelming weaponry and manpower, God used a shepherd boy&#8217;s faith to deliver Israel, proving once again that &#8220;the LORD saves, for the battle is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221; (17:47).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The shaft</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1443;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
