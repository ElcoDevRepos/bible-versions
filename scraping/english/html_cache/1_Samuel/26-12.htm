The spear and water jug symbolize Saul's vulnerability and David's ability to take his life, yet he chooses not to. This act of mercy reflects David's adherence to God's command not to harm the Lord's anointed (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>). The spear, a weapon of war, contrasts with the water jug, a symbol of life and sustenance, highlighting the choice between violence and mercy. This event occurs in the Wilderness of Ziph, a region known for its rugged terrain, which provided David with strategic advantage and concealment. David's decision to take these items rather than harm Saul foreshadows Christ's teaching on loving one's enemies (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>).<p><b>No one saw them or knew about it, nor did anyone wake up;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the miraculous nature of David's escape. The fact that no one saw or knew about David's actions underscores the divine intervention at play. In a military camp, guards would typically be alert, yet here, they are unaware, highlighting God's protection over David. This scenario parallels other biblical instances where God blinds or confuses enemies to protect His chosen ones, such as in <a href="/2_kings/6-18.htm">2 Kings 6:18</a> when Elisha prays for the Arameans to be struck with blindness.<p><b>they all remained asleep, because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen on them.</b><br>The deep sleep is a divine act, reminiscent of the "deep sleep" God caused to fall on Adam in <a href="/genesis/2-21.htm">Genesis 2:21</a>. This supernatural slumber signifies God's direct involvement in the events, ensuring David's safety and the fulfillment of His purposes. It also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty over human affairs, as He can alter natural states to achieve His will. This divine intervention is a testament to God's faithfulness in protecting David, who is anointed to be king, and it prefigures the peace and security found in Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by God, who is being pursued by King Saul.

David&#8217;s lifting it without shedding blood shows that the kingdom is already in his grasp, yet he is waiting for God&#8217;s timing (<a href="/1_samuel/26-16.htm">1 Samuel 26:16</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/1-14.htm">2 Samuel 1:14&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; The water jug represents life-sustaining provision (<a href="/genesis/21-19.htm">Genesis 21:19</a>). By removing it, David demonstrates that Saul&#8217;s very life is in his hands, echoing the earlier cave incident where he only cut Saul&#8217;s robe (<a href="/1_samuel/24-11.htm">1 Samuel 24:11</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s restraint foreshadows Jesus&#8217; call to love enemies (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>) and models <a href="/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17&#8211;21</a>&#8212;overcoming evil with good.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they departed</b><p>&#8220;&#8230; and they departed.&#8221;<p>&#8226; David leaves quietly rather than engaging in combat.

David silently removes symbols of Saul&#8217;s power and sustenance, proving he could have ended Saul&#8217;s life yet chooses mercy. Their undetected departure underscores David&#8217;s trust in God&#8217;s timing. The entire episode is sealed by the LORD&#8217;s miraculous &#8220;deep sleep,&#8221; affirming that God guards His purposes, restrains violence, and honors those who refuse to take vengeance into their own hands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">No man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked.</span>--The Hebrew is more graphic: "And none saw, and none knew, and none awaked."<p><span class= "bld">A deep sleep from the Lord.</span>--The inference here, at first sight, certainly is that an unnatural, or rather, a supernatural drowsiness had fallen on the camp of Saul. Still, it is not absolutely necessary to suppose that a special miracle was wrought on this occasion. The memory of great carelessness and want of vigilance in the royal army was evidently in David's mind when he sarcastically reproves the royal general Abner, in <a href="/context/1_samuel/26-14.htm" title="And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answer you not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who are you that cry to the king?">1Samuel 26:14-16</a>. They were in a friendly district, and never dreamed of a surprise, and possibly the rough soldiers on duty had been carousing.
