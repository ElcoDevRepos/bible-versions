Keilah, a fortified city in Judah, is under threat from the Philistines. This action demonstrates David's role as a protector of Israel, foreshadowing his future kingship. The decision to aid Keilah reflects David's reliance on divine guidance, as he sought the Lord's counsel before acting.<p><b>fought against the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel during this period, often raiding and oppressing the Israelites. David's engagement with them at Keilah highlights his military prowess and leadership. This battle is part of the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Philistines, which is a recurring theme in the books of Samuel.<p><b>and carried off their livestock</b><br>Livestock was a valuable resource, essential for sustenance and economic stability. By seizing the Philistines' livestock, David not only weakens the enemy but also provides for his men and the people of Keilah. This act of taking spoils is common in ancient warfare and serves to reward those who fight.<p><b>striking them with a mighty blow</b><br>David's victory is described as decisive and powerful, emphasizing his effectiveness as a military leader.

This act of salvation prefigures the role of a king as a savior and protector of his people.
