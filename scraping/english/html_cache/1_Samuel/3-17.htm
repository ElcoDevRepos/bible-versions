This question follows a significant event where God calls Samuel during the night. Eli's inquiry reflects his awareness of the divine nature of the message, as he understands that God has chosen to communicate with Samuel. This moment marks a transition in leadership, as God begins to reveal His will through Samuel, foreshadowing Samuel's future role as a prophet. The question also highlights Eli's concern for the content of God's message, indicating his awareness of potential judgment due to his sons' sins (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Do not hide it from me.&#8221;</b><br>Eli's insistence that Samuel not hide the message underscores the importance of transparency and truthfulness in conveying God's word. This reflects a broader biblical principle seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>, which emphasizes the value of honesty. Eli's demand also suggests his recognition of the gravity of divine communication and his desire to know God's will, even if it involves difficult truths. This moment foreshadows the prophetic role Samuel will play, where he must deliver God's messages without fear or favor.<p><b>&#8220;May God punish you, and ever so severely, if you hide from me anything He said to you.&#8221;</b><br>Eli invokes a solemn oath, emphasizing the seriousness of withholding God's message. This reflects the cultural and religious context of ancient Israel, where oaths and curses were common ways to underscore the truthfulness and importance of statements (<a href="/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15-26</a>). Eli's words also reveal his desperation and perhaps a sense of impending judgment, as he is aware of the prophecy against his house (<a href="/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27-36</a>). The invocation of divine punishment highlights the sacred responsibility of a prophet to faithfully communicate God's word, a theme echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17-19</a>. This phrase also points to the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), underscoring the weight of divine revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A young boy serving under Eli in the temple, chosen by God to be a prophet.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli.htm">Eli</a></b><br>The high priest and judge of Israel, who mentors Samuel.

Just hours earlier Samuel prayed, &#8220;Speak, LORD, for Your servant is listening&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-9.htm">1 Samuel 3:9</a>), so there really is a message to report.<p>&#8226; Scripture always carries that same certainty: &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for instruction&#8221; (2 <a href="/titus/3-1.htm">Titus 3:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The question models a healthy eagerness for revelation; compare King Zedekiah&#8217;s private plea, &#8220;Is there a word from the LORD?&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/37-17.htm">Jeremiah 37:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Eli asked.</b><p>&#8226; Though the priest has failed to restrain his sons (<a href="/1_samuel/2-22.htm">1 Samuel 2:22-25</a>), he still seeks the Lord&#8217;s voice, showing humility.<p>&#8226; God sometimes chooses unexpected messengers&#8212;here, a boy; later, a fisherman (<a href="/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13</a>) or a shepherd (<a href="/amos/7-14.htm">Amos 7:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Eli&#8217;s willingness to hear, even if the news is hard, anticipates his later response, &#8220;He is the LORD; let Him do what is good in His eyes&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-18.htm">1 Samuel 3:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not hide it from me.</b><p>&#8226; Truth must be shared in full.

Eli invokes divine judgment to underscore the seriousness of prophetic truth.<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us that mishandling revelation has consequences; James later cautions, &#8220;Not many of you should be teachers&#8230; we who teach will be judged more strictly&#8221; (<a href="/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>if you hide from me anything He said to you.</b><p>&#8226; Withholding any part of God&#8217;s word is treated as sin.
