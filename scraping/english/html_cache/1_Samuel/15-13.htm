This meeting occurs after Saul's disobedience in the battle against the Amalekites. Samuel's role as a prophet is crucial, as he serves as God's mouthpiece, delivering divine messages and judgments. The journey to meet Saul signifies a divine appointment, emphasizing the seriousness of Saul's actions.<p><b>Saul said to him</b><br>Saul, the first king of Israel, addresses Samuel with a greeting. This interaction highlights Saul's attempt to maintain a facade of obedience and righteousness. Saul's kingship was established by God through Samuel, but his actions often reveal a lack of true submission to God's will.<p><b>May the LORD bless you</b><br>Saul's greeting is a customary blessing, invoking God's favor upon Samuel. This phrase can be seen as an attempt to appear pious and respectful. However, it contrasts with Saul's disobedience, as genuine blessings from God are contingent upon obedience and faithfulness.<p><b>I have carried out the LORD&#8217;s instructions</b><br>Saul claims to have fulfilled God's command, which was to completely destroy the Amalekites and all they possessed. This statement is misleading, as Saul spared King Agag and the best of the livestock. Saul's partial obedience is a significant theme, illustrating the importance of complete adherence to God's commands. This moment foreshadows the eventual rejection of Saul as king, as God desires obedience over sacrifice (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>). Saul's failure to fully execute God's instructions serves as a warning against self-deception and the consequences of disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel was a key figure in the transition from the period of judges to the establishment of the monarchy.

Samuel carries God&#8217;s word without compromise (15:1, 10&#8211;11).<p>- Saul has just returned from battling the Amalekites, a mission assigned in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a> and commanded in <a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>.<p>- The scene underscores accountability.

Jesus confronted similar lip service in <a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8</a>: &#8220;These people honor Me with their lips, but their hearts are far from Me.&#8221;<p>- Spiritual clich&#233;s can camouflage compromise. <a href="/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a> describes those who &#8220;claim to know God, but by their actions they deny Him.&#8221;<p>- Genuine blessing flows from obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-2</a>).

Saul&#8217;s hurried greeting, spiritual jargon, and claim of total obedience reveal a heart more concerned with appearances than with God&#8217;s explicit command. The verse warns that genuine faith shows itself in full obedience, not in well-timed words or religious posturing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Blessed be thou of the Lord.</span>--Saul must have been fully conscious that he had failed to carry out the will and command of the Eternal King of Israel. In the late war, undertaken for the definite and solemn purpose of exterminating a wicked and bloodthirsty people, whose continued existence worked terrible evil upon the adjacent countries, he, disregarding the express instructions of the prophet of the Lord for his own covetous purposes, had not destroyed all, but reserved some of the living spoil for himself. Conscious of all this, he still dared to come forward, and to congratulate the prophet upon the fulfilment of the Lord's command. But Saul's words of self-gratulation were evidently feigned; in his heart he knew he had been faithless.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed be thou of Jehovah.</span> Saul meets Samuel with all external respect, and seems even to expect his approval, saying, <span class="cmt_word">I have performed the commandment of Jehovah.</span> And so he had in the half way in which men generally keep God's commandments, doing that part which is agreeable to themselves, and leaving that part undone which gives them neither pleasure nor profit. Saul probably had thought very little about the exact terms of the command given him, and having successfully accomplished the main point of carrying out a vast foray against the Amalekites, regarded the captive king and the plundered cattle as proofs of his victory. The trophy at Carmel is a token of his own self satisfaction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/15-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Samuel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8050.htm">Strong's 8050: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samuel -- 'name of God', a prophet of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">reached</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
