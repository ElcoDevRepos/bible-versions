Nabal's death is seen as divine intervention, as David had previously refrained from taking vengeance into his own hands. This reflects the biblical principle of leaving judgment to God (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>). Nabal's sudden death can be seen as a fulfillment of divine justice, emphasizing God's sovereignty and timing.<p><b>David said, &#8220;Blessed be the LORD</b><br>David's immediate response is to praise God, acknowledging His role in the situation. This reflects a heart of gratitude and recognition of God's hand in his life. It aligns with the biblical theme of giving thanks in all circumstances (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-18.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:18</a>) and highlights David's reliance on God.<p><b>who has upheld my cause against the reproach of Nabal</b><br>David sees God's intervention as a defense of his honor and reputation. The term "reproach" indicates the insult and disrespect Nabal showed towards David. This phrase underscores the biblical theme of God as a defender of His people (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>), and it reflects the cultural importance of honor and reputation in ancient Israel.<p><b>and has restrained His servant from evil</b><br>David acknowledges that it was God's intervention that prevented him from committing violence against Nabal. This highlights the biblical principle of self-control and reliance on God to avoid sin (<a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>). It also shows David's awareness of his own potential for wrongdoing and his dependence on God for guidance.<p><b>For the LORD has brought the wickedness of Nabal down upon his own head</b><br>This statement reflects the biblical concept of retributive justice, where individuals reap the consequences of their actions (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>). Nabal's death is seen as a direct result of his own wickedness, emphasizing the moral order upheld by God.<p><b>Then David sent word to Abigail, asking her to become his wife</b><br>David's proposal to Abigail is significant both personally and politically. Abigail's wisdom and intervention earlier in the chapter had already impressed David, and her marriage to him would have strengthened his position. This action also reflects the cultural practices of the time regarding marriage and alliances. Abigail's role can be seen as a type of the Church, the bride of Christ, who acts with wisdom and discernment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by God, who is known for his heart after God.

Praise is offered first, reminding us that God&#8217;s glory&#8212;not personal victory&#8212;is the chief end of every deliverance (<a href="/ephesians/1-6.htm">Ephesians 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Who has upheld my cause against the reproach of Nabal&#8221;</b><p>Nabal&#8217;s insult (25:10&#8211;11) publicly shamed David, yet God &#8220;pleads my cause&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/9-4.htm">Psalm 9:4</a>; 43:1). Vindication came from heaven, not from retaliatory violence. <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a> reiterates: &#8220;It is Mine to avenge; I will repay, says the Lord.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;And has restrained His servant from evil&#8221;</b><p>Left to himself, David was ready to slaughter Nabal&#8217;s household (25:22).

David&#8217;s praise acknowledges the Lord as both Defender and Judge, while his restraint underscores reliance on divine timing. The verse calls believers to trust God with insults, refuse personal vengeance, and celebrate His faithful governance over every outcome.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 39-42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hath pleaded the cause of my reproach.</span> In the causes tried at the gate of an Israelite city the friends of the accused both pleaded his cause, defended him from wrong, and punished any who had wronged him. So God had avenged David, while preventing him by Abigail s interference from avenging himself (see <a href="/1_samuel/24-13.htm">1 Samuel 24:13</a>). As a widow's legal mourning seems to have lasted only seven days, David, on hearing of Nabal's death, sent messengers to Abigail at Carmel to ask her in marriage. He was probably moved to this not merely by her sensible conduct, but also by the news that Michal had been given to another. She expresses her willingness in true Oriental fashion by saying she was ready to perform the most abject menial duties, even for his servants, and at once with five maidens proceeds to join him. It is a proof that David considered himself practically secure against Saul's attempts that he thus married and allowed women to accompany his small force, as their presence would not only impede the rapidity of his movements, but also implies a certain amount of case and comfort for their maintenance.
