Understanding a person's background was crucial for determining their intentions and potential threat. This question also highlights David's leadership and discernment, as he seeks to gather intelligence about the Amalekite raid. In biblical narratives, knowing one's origin often reveals God's providential hand in events, as seen in the stories of Joseph and Moses.<p><b>&#8220;I am an Egyptian,&#8221; he replied,</b><br>The mention of Egypt connects this narrative to the broader biblical theme of Egypt as a place of both refuge and bondage. Egyptians were often seen as outsiders in Israelite society, yet God frequently used foreigners to fulfill His purposes, as seen with figures like Rahab and Ruth. This Egyptian's presence in the story underscores the diverse and interconnected nature of the ancient Near East.<p><b>&#8220;the slave of an Amalekite.</b><br>The Amalekites were long-standing enemies of Israel, first appearing in <a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17</a>. Their enmity with Israel is a recurring theme, symbolizing opposition to God's people. The fact that this Egyptian was a slave to an Amalekite highlights the complex social hierarchies and the harsh realities of servitude in the ancient world. It also sets the stage for David's eventual victory over the Amalekites, fulfilling God's judgment against them.<p><b>My master abandoned me three days ago when I fell ill.</b><br>The abandonment of the slave reflects the harsh and often inhumane treatment of servants in ancient times. This detail emphasizes the Amalekites' cruelty and lack of compassion, contrasting with David's later kindness. The "three days" timeframe is significant in biblical literature, often symbolizing a period of trial or transition, as seen in the resurrection of Jesus Christ after three days. This period of abandonment becomes a turning point, leading to the Egyptian's role in aiding David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, known for his leadership and heart after God.

His inquiry blends practical strategy with genuine concern, much like his earlier habit of &#8220;inquiring of the LORD&#8221; (30:8). By pausing to question&#8212;and to feed&#8212;the stranger, David models <a href="/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21</a> and foreshadows the mercy commended in <a href="/luke/10-33.htm">Luke 10:33-34</a>. Compassion and good intelligence gather in the same moment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;To whom do you belong&#8221;</b><p>In the ancient Near East, belonging defined a person&#8217;s security, authority, and future (<a href="/ruth/2-1.htm">Ruth 2:1</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/25-10.htm">1 Samuel 25:10</a>). David seeks to learn whether this man is friend or foe and under whose protection he travels. Spiritually, belonging marks every life: Paul could say, &#8220;the God to whom I belong&#8221; (<a href="/acts/27-23.htm">Acts 27:23</a>), and believers are reminded, &#8220;You are not your own&#8230; you were bought at a price&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>). David&#8217;s question touches that foundational reality.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and where are you from?&#8221;</b><p>Origin reveals loyalties and motives (<a href="/joshua/9-8.htm">Joshua 9:8-9</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/2-7.htm">Nehemiah 2:7</a>). David wants to trace the raiding party&#8217;s route back to Ziklag&#8217;s attackers. Scripture often pairs inquiries about origin with divine redirection&#8212;&#8220;Where have you come from, and where are you going?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/16-8.htm">Genesis 16:8</a>). Here, location will become the key for pursuit (<a href="/1_samuel/30-15.htm">1 Samuel 30:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I am an Egyptian,&#8221; he replied</b><p>The answer places the man outside the covenant people of Israel, yet God repeatedly uses outsiders for His purposes (<a href="/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-2.htm">2 Kings 5:2-3</a>). The Egyptian&#8217;s nationality also distances him from Amalekite identity, making his information more credible to David.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;the slave of an Amalekite&#8221;</b><p>The Amalekites, long-standing enemies of Israel (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-2.htm">1 Samuel 15:2-3</a>), were noted for predatory cruelty. That this Egyptian serves such a master confirms that the recent raid on Ziklag (30:1-2) came from the same ruthless tribe. Even as a slave, the man becomes the providential link to David&#8217;s victory (30:16-17).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My master abandoned me three days ago</b><p>Three days of abandonment underscore the Amalekite&#8217;s merciless character, contrasting sharply with the Lord who promises never to forsake His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-6.htm">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>). The &#8220;three-day&#8221; detail also mirrors the biblical pattern of decisive change on the third day (<a href="/genesis/22-4.htm">Genesis 22:4</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>; <a href="/luke/24-7.htm">Luke 24:7</a>)&#8212;here, the turning point leading to David&#8217;s restoration.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when I fell ill</b><p>Sickness made the slave disposable to his master, yet valuable to David. The episode highlights the biblical ethic of caring for the weak (<a href="/exodus/23-9.htm">Exodus 23:9</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-31.htm">Proverbs 14:31</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-36.htm">Matthew 25:36</a>).

David&#8217;s compassionate interrogation uncovers the identity of the raiders, displays a stark moral contrast between Israel&#8217;s future king and the Amalekites, and turns a discarded slave into the guide for Israel&#8217;s deliverance. The verse testifies that kindness and discernment, exercised together, open doors for God&#8217;s restorative plans (<a href="/1_samuel/30-18.htm">1 Samuel 30:18-20</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To whom belongest thou?</span> As he was probably unarmed, and his garb that of a slave, David asks who is his owner and what his country.
