After striking Goliath with a stone, David does not hesitate but runs towards the fallen giant. This action signifies his faith and confidence in God's deliverance. In the cultural context of ancient warfare, standing over a defeated enemy symbolized victory and dominance. David's actions here foreshadow Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_corinthians/15-57.htm">1 Corinthians 15:57</a>.<p><b>He grabbed the Philistine&#8217;s sword and pulled it from its sheath and killed him,</b><br>David's use of Goliath's own sword to kill him is significant. It demonstrates God's power to use the enemy's weapons against them, a theme seen throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/esther/7-10.htm">Esther 7:10</a>). The sword, a symbol of strength and power, becomes an instrument of divine justice. This act also prefigures Christ's victory over Satan using the very instrument of death, the cross, to bring salvation.<p><b>and he cut off his head with the sword.</b><br>The beheading of Goliath serves as a definitive end to the threat he posed. In ancient Near Eastern culture, displaying the head of a defeated enemy was a common practice to signify total victory. This act also serves as a type of Christ's ultimate triumph over evil, as seen in <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>, where Satan is finally defeated.<p><b>When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran.</b><br>The Philistines' reaction underscores the importance of Goliath as their champion. His death demoralizes them, leading to their retreat. This reflects the biblical theme of God using the weak to shame the strong (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>). The turning and running of the Philistines can be seen as a parallel to the ultimate defeat of evil at the end of times, as prophesied in <a href="/revelation/19-19.htm">Revelation 19:19-21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The young shepherd who would later become King of Israel.
