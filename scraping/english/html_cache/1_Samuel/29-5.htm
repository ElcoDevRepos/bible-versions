At this point in the narrative, David is living among the Philistines, having fled from King Saul. The Philistines recognize David's reputation, which underscores his significant impact on both Israelite and Philistine societies. David's identity and actions are central to the unfolding of God's plan for Israel, as he is anointed by God to be king, a man after God's own heart.<p><b>about whom they sing in their dances:</b><br>This part highlights the cultural practice of celebrating victories through song and dance, a common tradition in ancient Israel. These songs served as a form of oral history, preserving the deeds of significant figures. The reference to singing and dancing indicates the widespread recognition and admiration of David's achievements. This cultural expression also reflects the communal nature of Israelite society, where collective memory and identity were reinforced through such celebrations.<p><b>&#8216;Saul has slain his thousands,</b><br>This phrase is part of a well-known song that contrasts the military successes of Saul and David. Saul, the first king of Israel, was initially celebrated for his victories, but his disobedience to God led to his downfall. The mention of "thousands" acknowledges Saul's accomplishments but also sets the stage for the comparison with David. This comparison foreshadows the shift in divine favor from Saul to David, as God chooses David to lead His people.<p><b>and David his tens of thousands&#8217;?&#8221;</b><br>The hyperbolic nature of this phrase emphasizes David's superior military achievements and growing popularity. It reflects the divine favor upon David, as he is portrayed as a more effective leader and warrior than Saul. This comparison not only highlights David's prowess but also serves as a prophetic indication of his future kingship. David's victories are seen as a type of Christ, prefiguring the ultimate victory of Jesus over sin and death. The phrase underscores the theme of God's sovereignty in raising up leaders according to His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, known for his military prowess and deep faith in God.

He is not an obscure Hebrew mercenary but the champion who toppled Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45&#8211;50</a>) and whose name had become synonymous with victory (<a href="/1_samuel/18-30.htm">1 Samuel 18:30</a>).<p>&#8210; Their question drips with alarm: &#8220;Is this not the David&#8230;?&#8221; They are reminding King Achish that the very man he trusts is the same man who once devastated Philistine forces (<a href="/1_samuel/21-11.htm">1 Samuel 21:11</a>) and escaped Saul&#8217;s traps with God&#8217;s favor (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>).<p>&#8210; In context (<a href="/1_samuel/29-1.htm">1 Samuel 29:1&#8211;4</a>), they fear David will turn on them in battle, regain Saul&#8217;s approval, and leave Philistine ranks in ruins.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>About whom they sing in their dances</b><p>&#8210; Israel&#8217;s victory songs were public and memorable (<a href="/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6&#8211;7</a>). Joyful dancing accompanied triumph, just as Miriam led Israel in song after the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20&#8211;21</a>) and Jephthah&#8217;s daughter greeted her father with tambourines (<a href="/judges/11-34.htm">Judges 11:34</a>).<p>&#8210; Such celebrations fixed David&#8217;s exploits in the collective memory of both Israel and her enemies. The Philistines could not forget the jubilant processions that heralded their own defeats.<p>&#8210; Their recollection shows how fully David&#8217;s reputation had spread beyond Israel&#8217;s borders, making even pagan soldiers wary of him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Saul has slain his thousands</b><p>&#8210; The first half of the refrain honors Saul&#8217;s genuine military success: he rescued Jabesh-gilead (<a href="/1_samuel/11-11.htm">1 Samuel 11:11</a>), waged campaigns against surrounding nations (<a href="/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47&#8211;48</a>), and struck Amalek (<a href="/1_samuel/15-4.htm">1 Samuel 15:4&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8210; Yet the song subtly signals Saul&#8217;s limitations&#8212;&#8220;thousands,&#8221; not &#8220;tens of thousands.&#8221; This contrast fed Saul&#8217;s jealousy (<a href="/1_samuel/18-8.htm">1 Samuel 18:8&#8211;9</a>) and foreshadowed his decline.<p>&#8210; For the Philistines, the line reminds them that even a formidable king like Saul could not secure ultimate victory when David was on the field.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And David his tens of thousands</b><p>&#8210; Hyperbolic or not, the phrase captures David&#8217;s astonishing string of wins: Goliath&#8217;s defeat (<a href="/1_samuel/17-50.htm">1 Samuel 17:50&#8211;53</a>), repeated raids that &#8220;struck down the Philistines with great slaughter&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/19-8.htm">1 Samuel 19:8</a>), and relentless success that made his name &#8220;highly esteemed&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/18-30.htm">1 Samuel 18:30</a>).<p>&#8210; The lyric places David in a class of his own, eclipsing Saul and striking fear into enemy hearts&#8212;exactly what happens here in Gath (<a href="/1_samuel/29-4.htm">1 Samuel 29:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8210; By recalling this chant, the Philistines admit they believe the Lord who empowered David then could empower him now, turning the tide against them in an instant (compare <a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>; 7:9).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/29-5.htm">1 Samuel 29:5</a> records the Philistine commanders&#8217; uneasy memory of Israel&#8217;s famous victory song. Each phrase underscores David&#8217;s God-given reputation: the recognized warrior (&#8220;Is this not the David&#8221;), the celebrated hero of Israelite worship (&#8220;about whom they sing in their dances&#8221;), the contrast with Saul&#8217;s lesser exploits (&#8220;Saul has slain his thousands&#8221;), and the superlative measure of David&#8217;s triumphs (&#8220;and David his tens of thousands&#8221;). In context, the verse explains why the Philistines demand David&#8217;s dismissal from their ranks: they believe the same Lord who once gave him overwhelming victories could again turn him into their destroyer. The verse therefore highlights both David&#8217;s unmatched military record and the sovereign power of God that stands behind it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/29.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Of whom they sang.</span>--The folk-songs, which had originally excited Saul's jealousy of the young hero David, were current among the Philistines, who seem to have been a musical people.
