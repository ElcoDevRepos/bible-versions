The Ark, representing God's presence and covenant with Israel, was taken during a battle at Ebenezer. This event highlights Israel's spiritual decline and the consequences of their disobedience. The Philistines, a seafaring people from the Aegean region, were one of Israel's main adversaries. Their capture of the Ark symbolizes a temporary triumph over Israel, but it also sets the stage for God's power to be demonstrated among the Philistines.<p><b>they took it from Ebenezer</b><br>Ebenezer, meaning "stone of help," was a site near Aphek where Israel had previously set up camp. The name itself is ironic in this context, as the Israelites experienced defeat rather than divine assistance. This location is significant in Israel's history, as it later becomes a place of victory and remembrance when Samuel sets up a stone to commemorate God's help (<a href="/1_samuel/7-12.htm">1 Samuel 7:12</a>). The movement of the Ark from Ebenezer signifies a shift in the narrative from Israel's defeat to the unfolding of God's sovereignty.<p><b>to Ashdod</b><br>Ashdod was one of the five major Philistine cities, located along the coastal plain of modern-day Israel. It was a center of worship for the Philistine god Dagon. The transfer of the Ark to Ashdod is significant because it places the symbol of Israel's God in the heart of Philistine territory, directly challenging the power of their deities. This sets the stage for the events that follow, where God's supremacy is demonstrated through the plagues and the fall of Dagon's idol (<a href="/1_samuel/5-2.htm">1 Samuel 5:2-5</a>). The presence of the Ark in Ashdod foreshadows the eventual return of the Ark to Israel, emphasizing God's control over all nations and His ability to protect His honor.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A significant group of people in the Old Testament, often in conflict with Israel.

We can, however, from <a href="/context/psalms/78-60.htm" title="So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;">Psalm 78:60-64</a>, and two passages in Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/7-12.htm" title="But go you now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.">Jeremiah 7:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-9.htm" title="Why have you prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.">Jeremiah 26:9</a>), complete the story of the sanctuary city after the death of Eli. After the victory of Aphek, the Philistines, flushed with success, probably at once marched on Shiloh, where, from the words of the above quoted Psalm, they seem to have revenged themselves for past injuries by a terrible massacre, and then to have razed the sacred buildings of the city to the ground. The awful fate of the priestly city seems to have become a proverb in Israel. "This house shall be like Shiloh," wrote Jeremiah, hundreds of years later, and "this city shall be desolate, without inhabitant." Yet, in spite of this crushing blow, the national life of the Hebrew people was by no means exterminated; we shall soon hear of its revival under happier auspices. There were others in Israel like Samuel, who, as we have seen, with all their hearts trusted in that Lord who, "when Israel was a child, then He loved him;" others like that weak but still righteous judge Eli, who for one great weakness had paid so awful a penalty; many others, like the wife of Phinehas, the wicked priest, and Elkanah and Hannah, the pious father and mother of Samuel, who dwelt in "Ramah of the Watchers."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Philistines took the ark of God<span class="accented">.</span> </span>The silence of Scripture is often as remarkable as what it tells us. From <a href="/psalms/78-60.htm">Psalm 78:60-64</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/26-9.htm">Jeremiah 26:9</a>, we gather that from Aphek the Philistines marched upon Shiloh, and having captured it, put all whom they found there to the sword, and levelled the buildings to the ground. Especially their wrath fell upon the priests, in revenge for the bringing of the ark to the camp, by which the war was made a religious one, and the worst feelings of fanaticism aroused. Of all this the history says nothing, nor of the measures taken by Samuel under these trying circumstances. From his previous eminence, the government would naturally devolve upon him, especially as Eli's sons were both slain; and evidently he must have managed in some way to save the sacred vessels of the sanctuary, and the numerous records of the past history of the nation laid up at Shiloh. Whatever learning there was in Israel had its seat there; it was probably the only school wherein men were initiated in the knowledge brought out of Egypt; and it is one of the worst and most barbarous results of war that it destroys so much connected with human progress and civilisation, overthrowing with its violent hand as well the means of a nation's culture as the results thereof. Samuel evidently did all that was possible to counteract these evils; and as the Philistine army withdrew into its own country immediately after the destruction of Shiloh, probably to carry homo the rich spoils obtained there, he was apparently able to ward off the worst effects of the Philistine invasion, and by rapidly reorganising the government to save the people from utter demoralisation. But upon all this Scripture is silent, because it concerns the history of Israel on its temporal side, and not as it exemplifies God's spiritual dealings with nations and men. <span class="cmt_word">From Eben-ezer</span> (see on 1 Samuel 4:1) <span class="cmt_word">unto Ashdod.</span> This town, the Azotus of <a href="/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>, was with Ekron and other Philistine cities, assigned to the tribe of Judah (<a href="/joshua/15-47.htm">Joshua 15:47</a>) but never actually conquered. It lay near the sea, about thirty-two miles north of Gaza, and is now an unimportant village, still bearing the name of Esdud. Of the five Philistine capitals Ashdod and Gaza were of the most importance, as being the keys of Egypt, and the former was also enriched by the sale of the produce of Arabia, of which it was the emporium. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/5-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">After the Philistines</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;p&#772;&#601;&#183;li&#353;&#183;t&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
