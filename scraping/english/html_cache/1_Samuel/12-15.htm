Disobedience and rebellion against God's command are central themes throughout the Old Testament, often leading to divine judgment. The Israelites were repeatedly warned by prophets to adhere to God's laws (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>). The historical context here is Samuel's farewell address, where he reminds the people of their covenant obligations. Rebellion against God is seen as a serious offense, akin to idolatry (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>).<p><b>then the hand of the LORD will be against you</b><br>The "hand of the LORD" is a metaphor for God's power and intervention, often used to describe both His protection and His judgment. In this context, it signifies divine opposition and punishment. This phrase echoes the warnings given in the Mosaic Law, where blessings and curses were contingent upon Israel's obedience (<a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-17</a>). The imagery of God's hand against the people serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of disobedience.<p><b>as it was against your fathers</b><br>This refers to the historical experiences of the Israelites, particularly during the period of the Judges, when they repeatedly fell into cycles of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-19</a>). The mention of "your fathers" serves as a reminder of past judgments, such as the wilderness wanderings and the various captivities due to disobedience. It underscores the importance of learning from history to avoid repeating the same mistakes. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's faithfulness and the human tendency to stray, highlighting the need for repentance and reliance on God's grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel and a prophet who anointed the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David.
