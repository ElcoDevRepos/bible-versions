The exodus is a demonstration of God's deliverance and faithfulness, yet it also marks the beginning of a pattern of rebellion and disobedience among the Israelites. The reference to Egypt highlights the contrast between God's faithfulness and the people's recurring unfaithfulness. This pattern of behavior is seen throughout the wilderness wanderings, as recorded in Exodus and Numbers, where the Israelites frequently complained and turned away from God.<p><b>until this day</b><br>This indicates the continuity of Israel's disobedience from the time of the exodus to the present moment in the narrative of 1 Samuel. It underscores the persistent nature of their rebellion, suggesting a deep-seated issue within the nation. This ongoing disobedience is a theme throughout the Old Testament, as seen in the cycles of sin, judgment, and deliverance in the Book of Judges. It also sets the stage for the request for a king, as the people seek to replace divine leadership with human authority.<p><b>forsaking Me and serving other gods</b><br>This phrase highlights the core issue of idolatry, which is a recurring sin among the Israelites. The forsaking of God for other deities is a violation of the first commandment and reflects a spiritual adultery. The worship of other gods often involved adopting the practices of surrounding nations, which God had explicitly warned against. This idolatry is not only a rejection of God's sovereignty but also a breach of the covenant relationship established at Sinai. The prophets, such as Hosea and Jeremiah, frequently address this issue, calling the people to repentance and faithfulness.<p><b>so they are doing to you</b><br>Here, God is speaking to Samuel, indicating that the people's rejection of Samuel's leadership is consistent with their historical pattern of rejecting divine authority. This personalizes the narrative, showing that Samuel's experience is part of a larger story of Israel's rebellion. It also foreshadows the challenges that will come with the establishment of a monarchy, as the people's desire for a king is rooted in their desire to be like other nations, rather than a unique people under God's rule. This rejection is ultimately a rejection of God Himself, as later emphasized in <a href="/1_samuel/10-19.htm">1 Samuel 10:19</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel, a prophet, and a leader who was instrumental in transitioning Israel from a theocracy to a monarchy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel who demanded a king to rule over them, rejecting God's direct rule.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who brought the Israelites out of Egypt and established a covenant with them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>The land from which God delivered the Israelites, symbolizing bondage and oppression.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/other_gods.htm">Other gods</a></b><br>The false deities that the Israelites turned to, representing their unfaithfulness and idolatry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_forsaking_god.htm">The Danger of Forsaking God</a></b><br>Just as the Israelites turned away from God to serve other gods, we must be vigilant in our faith to avoid idolatry in any form, whether it be materialism, power, or other distractions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_rejecting_divine_leadership.htm">The Consequences of Rejecting Divine Leadership</a></b><br>Israel's demand for a king was a rejection of God's direct rule.

From Egypt to Samuel&#8217;s day, the pattern of forsaking the Lord and embracing other gods explains their latest demand for a king. The verse reminds us that persistent unbelief grieves God, yet He patiently discloses the issue so His people&#8212;and His servants&#8212;see sin for what it is and turn back to wholehearted loyalty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">According to all the works,</span> etc. They showed in this the same want of respect and affection for their own institutions and religious privileges which had marked all their history since the day when Jehovah brought them up out of Egypt. And therefore Samuel was to <span class="cmt_word">protest solemnly unto them, and show them.</span> The two verbs do not mean different things, but the same. "To protest" is to testify, to bear witness, and warn them of the danger they were incurring. And as they were asking not for the development and perfecting of their own institutions, but for a government modelled upon the institutions of the heathen round them, Samuel shows what are the dangers inherent in the establishment of a despot such as the kings of the heathen were. As a rule the kings of Judaea did not resemble the picture drawn by Samuel, but in spite of many blemishes remained tame to their allegiance to Jehovah as the supreme Ruler of the nation, and confined themselves within the limits marked out for them by the Mosaic law. <span class="cmt_word">Now therefore,</span> at the beginning of the verse, is in the Hebrew simply "And now."
