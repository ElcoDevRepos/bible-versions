The exact location of Racal is not definitively known, but it is considered to be a town in the southern part of Judah. This reflects David's strategic alliances and his efforts to maintain support among the tribes of Israel. The act of sending gifts to Racal and other towns demonstrates David's political acumen and his role as a unifying leader, foreshadowing his future kingship over all Israel.<p><b>and in the cities of the Jerahmeelites</b><br>The Jerahmeelites were a clan within the tribe of Judah, descended from Jerahmeel, the firstborn of Hezron. This connection to Judah highlights the importance of tribal affiliations in ancient Israel. By sending gifts to the cities of the Jerahmeelites, David strengthens his ties with his own tribe, ensuring loyalty and support. This action can be seen as part of God's providential plan to establish David's rule, as the tribe of Judah would later play a crucial role in his reign and the lineage of the Messiah.<p><b>and Kenites;</b><br>The Kenites were a nomadic group with historical ties to the Israelites, particularly through Moses' father-in-law, Jethro, who was a Kenite. Their presence among the recipients of David's gifts indicates the broader alliances David maintained beyond the immediate tribes of Israel. The Kenites' inclusion underscores the theme of God's inclusive plan, as they were not originally part of the Israelite tribes but were integrated into the community. This foreshadows the New Testament message of the Gospel being extended to all nations, reflecting the inclusive nature of God's kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/r/racal.htm">Racal</a></b><br>A location mentioned in the context of David's distribution of spoils.
