This phrase reflects the biblical theme of God's providence and blessing upon those He chooses. David's prosperity in his endeavors can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to be with him, similar to how God was with Joseph in <a href="/genesis/39-2.htm">Genesis 39:2-3</a>. The phrase also underscores the importance of obedience and faithfulness, as David consistently followed Saul's orders, aligning with the biblical principle that God blesses those who are faithful in their duties.<p><b>and Saul set him over the men of war</b><br>David's appointment as a leader over the men of war signifies his rising status and the trust Saul placed in him. This role is significant as it positions David in a place of military leadership, foreshadowing his future as a king who would lead Israel in battle. The historical context of ancient Israelite warfare involved tribal militias, and being set over the men of war indicates a high level of responsibility and honor. This appointment also reflects Saul's initial recognition of David's capabilities, despite the later jealousy that would arise.<p><b>And this was pleasing in the sight of all the people</b><br>David's acceptance by the people illustrates his growing popularity and the favor he found among the Israelites. This public approval is crucial in the narrative, as it sets the stage for David's eventual rise to kingship. The people's support is a recurring theme in David's life, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/18-16.htm">1 Samuel 18:16</a>, where it is noted that all Israel and Judah loved David. This widespread approval can be seen as a divine orchestration, preparing the way for David's future rule.<p><b>and of Saul&#8217;s officers as well</b><br>The approval of Saul's officers indicates that David's leadership and success were recognized not only by the general populace but also by those in positions of authority. This acceptance by the military leaders suggests that David's abilities and character were evident to those who worked closely with him. It also highlights the unity and harmony within Saul's ranks at this point in the narrative, before the eventual discord caused by Saul's jealousy. The officers' approval can be seen as a testament to David's God-given wisdom and leadership skills, which would later be crucial in his role as king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd who was anointed by Samuel to be the future king of Israel.

It was not only over Saul and his great son that he rapidly won influence, but in the case of his colleagues at the Court and in the army, all of whom he was rapidly outstripping in the race for honour and distinction, he seems to have disarmed all jealousy. His rapid rise to high position was evidently looked upon with general favour. This is still farther enlarged upon in the next and following verses.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David went out.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> went on military expeditions (comp. ver. 30). As the verb has thus a technical signification, it makes a complete sense, and the verse should be translated, "And David went forth (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> on warlike enterprises); whithersoever Saul sent him he prospered, and Saul set him over the men of war." These expeditions were not upon a very large scale; for it is not until ver. 13 that we read of David being made "captain over a thousand." Still, even while only a centurion in rank, yet, as being in constant attendance upon the king, he would often temporarily have the command of larger bodies of men, or would go on campaigns as one of the king's officers. As it is mentioned that his promotion caused no envy because of his great merits, it follows that it was rapid enough to have given occasion to ill will under ordinary circumstances. <span class="cmt_word">Behaved himself wisely.</span> This is the primary meaning of the verb; but as success is the result of wise conduct, it constantly signifies <span class="accented">to prosper.</span> This verse is a summary of events which may have occupied a very considerable space of time. It was only gradually that David's fame became so great as to rouse all the worst feelings in Saul's mind.
