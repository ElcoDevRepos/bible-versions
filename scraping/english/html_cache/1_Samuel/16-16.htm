In this context, "our lord" refers to King Saul, who was experiencing distress due to a troubling spirit. The servants' initiative to suggest a solution indicates their concern for Saul's well-being and their role in providing counsel. This reflects the cultural norm of servants being closely involved in the daily life and personal affairs of their master.<p><b>to seek out someone who can skillfully play the harp</b><br>Music played a significant role in ancient Near Eastern cultures, often used for worship, celebration, and therapeutic purposes. The harp, a stringed instrument, was commonly used in Israelite worship and is frequently mentioned in the Psalms. The request for a skilled harpist suggests an understanding of music's calming and restorative effects, which aligns with modern studies on music therapy. This also foreshadows David's introduction to Saul's court, as David was known for his musical talent and later composed many of the Psalms.<p><b>Whenever the spirit of distress from God is upon you</b><br>The "spirit of distress" indicates a troubling or harmful spirit that afflicted Saul, sent by God as a form of judgment or discipline. This reflects the belief in divine sovereignty, where God can use various means to accomplish His purposes, including allowing distress to bring about repentance or change. Theologically, this raises questions about the nature of God's involvement in human suffering and the purpose behind such afflictions. It also highlights the spiritual dimension of mental and emotional distress, which was often attributed to spiritual causes in the ancient world.<p><b>he is to play it, and you will be well.</b><br>The proposed solution of using music to alleviate Saul's distress underscores the therapeutic power of music, which was recognized even in ancient times. The expectation that Saul would be "well" suggests a belief in the efficacy of music to influence mood and mental state positively. This anticipates the role of David, whose harp playing would indeed bring relief to Saul, establishing a connection between David and Saul that would have significant implications for Israel's future. This also serves as a type of Christ, as David, the anointed king, brings peace and relief, prefiguring Jesus Christ, the ultimate source of peace and healing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places /

We have several instances in ancient Greek literature, where this influence is recommended to soothe the passions or to heal mental disease. Pythagoras, whenever he would steep his mind in Divine power, was in the habit before he slept of having a harp played to him; 'sculapius, the physician, would often restore such sick souls with music. (See reference from Censorinus, <span class= "ital">De die natali, </span>quoted by Keil.) <p>"Priests would call<p>On Heaven for aid: but then his brow would lower<p>With treble gloom. Peace! Heaven is good to all.<p>To all, he sighed, but one--God hears no prayers for Saul<p>At length one spake of <span class= "ital">music."--</span>HANKINSON.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A cunning player on an harp.</span> Literally, one skilful in striking the chords on the harp. In Saul's case music would have a soothing influence, and turn the current of his thoughts. His officers suggest, therefore, that search should be made for an expert musician, and Saul consents; whereupon one of <span class="cmt_word">the servants</span> recommended the son of Jesse. The word used here is not the same as that found in vers. 15, 16, 17. There we have Saul's <span class="accented">officers</span>; here it is <span class="accented">na'arim</span>, "young men." Thus it was a youth of David's own age, who had probably been with him at Naioth in Ramah, that described him to Saul. The description is full and interesting, but it has its difficulties. David is not only skilful in music, of which art he would have had ample scope to manifest his powers in the service of the sanctuary at Ramah, but he is also <span class="cmt_word">a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and prudent in matters,</span> or, rather, <span class="accented">intelligent in speech</span> (see margin), as well as handsome and successful. Nevertheless, in <a href="/1_samuel/17-33.htm">1 Samuel 17:33-36</a> David appears as a youth about to make his first essay in fighting; and though the two exploits mentioned there, of killing the lion and the bear, might justify his friend in calling him <span class="cmt_word">a mighty valiant man,</span> literally, "a hero of valour," they do not justify the words <span class="cmt_word">a man of war.</span> It is strange, moreover, that Saul should be so entirely ignorant of David's person and lineage as he is represented in the narrative in ch. 17, if thus David was court musician, though reference is made there to this visit of David to Saul in ver. 15. Possibly, however, David and this youth may have served together in repelling some marauding expedition of the Philistines, and though David may not have actually done much, - nothing, at all events, so well worth repeating to Saul as the combats with the wild beasts, - yet he may have achieved enough to convince his friend that he had in him the qualities of <span class="cmt_word">a man of war,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of a good soldier. For the rest, we must conclude that this first visit of David was a very short one, and that after playing before Saul and being approved of, he then returned home, ready to come again whenever summoned, but that Saul's malady did not immediately return, and so a sufficient interval elapsed for Saul not to recognise him when he saw him under altered circumstances. Saul's question, "Whose son is this stripling?" (<a href="/1_samuel/17-56.htm">1 Samuel 17:56</a>) seems to imply that he had a sort of confused idea about him, without being able exactly to recall who he was. The ultimate consequences of this introduction to Saul, as well as its immediate effect, are all narrated here after the usual manner of Old Testament history (see <a href="/1_samuel/7-13.htm">1 Samuel 7:13</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/16-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Let our lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1461;&#1433;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;n&#234;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
