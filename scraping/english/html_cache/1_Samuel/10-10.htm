It is situated a few miles north of Jerusalem. This location is historically significant as it was the site of a previous atrocity involving the Levite's concubine (Judges 19-20), which led to a civil war within Israel. Saul's arrival here marks the beginning of his transformation from a private individual to a public leader. The mention of his servant highlights the social structure of the time, where servants often accompanied their masters on journeys, indicating Saul's status and wealth.<p><b>a group of prophets met him</b><br>Prophets in ancient Israel were individuals chosen by God to deliver His messages to the people. This group of prophets signifies a community of individuals dedicated to worship and prophecy, possibly linked to the "schools of the prophets" mentioned elsewhere in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/2_kings/2-3.htm">2 Kings 2:3-5</a>). Their meeting with Saul was divinely orchestrated, fulfilling Samuel's earlier prophecy (<a href="/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5-6</a>) and serving as a sign of Saul's anointing as king. This encounter emphasizes the role of prophecy in confirming God's will and the importance of spiritual leadership in Israel.<p><b>Then the Spirit of God rushed upon him</b><br>The Spirit of God coming upon Saul signifies divine empowerment for leadership, a common theme in the Old Testament where God's Spirit equips individuals for specific tasks (e.g., <a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a> with Gideon). This rushing of the Spirit indicates a sudden and powerful transformation, enabling Saul to fulfill his role as king. It also foreshadows the New Testament outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (Acts 2), where believers are similarly empowered for ministry. This moment marks a pivotal change in Saul's life, aligning him with God's purposes.<p><b>and he prophesied along with them</b><br>Saul's prophesying with the prophets serves as a public confirmation of his new role and divine calling. This act of prophesying, often involving speaking or singing under divine inspiration, demonstrates Saul's temporary alignment with God's will. It also fulfills Samuel's earlier prediction, providing a sign to those around him of his anointing. This event prefigures the transformative work of the Holy Spirit in believers' lives, as seen in the New Testament, where prophecy is a gift of the Spirit (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>). Saul's participation in prophecy highlights the potential for spiritual renewal and the importance of obedience to God's calling.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, chosen by God and anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Earlier, Samuel had foretold that certain signs would confirm Saul&#8217;s anointing as king (<a href="/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2&#8211;7</a>). One of those signs was to meet a procession of prophets at Gibeah (<a href="/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a>). By stepping into the very location Samuel mentioned, Saul is walking straight into God&#8217;s appointed confirmation that the Lord&#8217;s word never fails (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8230;a group of prophets met him</b><p>These prophets were likely part of a recognized school or guild (<a href="/2_kings/2-3.htm">2 Kings 2:3</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>). Their role included worship, instruction, and declaring God&#8217;s message.<p>&#8226; Their presence underlines that God surrounds His chosen leader with spiritually mature voices&#8212;an important safeguard for Saul, just as David later relied on Nathan (<a href="/2_samuel/12-1.htm">2 Samuel 12:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Their arrival &#8220;met him,&#8221; not by chance but by providence, echoing how Philip &#8220;met&#8221; the Ethiopian eunuch through divine orchestration (<a href="/acts/8-29.htm">Acts 8:29&#8211;30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then the Spirit of God rushed upon him</b><p>Here is the transforming moment. The same Spirit who empowered Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>) and came mightily upon Samson (<a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>) now &#8220;rushes&#8221; upon Saul. Note:<p>&#8226; This is not mere emotion; it is supernatural enablement for leadership (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a> vs. 16:14).<p>&#8226; The verb signals sudden, overwhelming power&#8212;anticipating Pentecost when the Spirit &#8220;came suddenly&#8221; on the disciples (<a href="/acts/2-2.htm">Acts 2:2&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; God is publicly authenticating Saul before witnesses, just as the Spirit descending like a dove authenticated Jesus at His baptism (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16&#8211;17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he prophesied along with them</b><p>Saul&#8217;s spontaneous prophecy serves at least three purposes:<p>1. Confirmation &#8211; It fulfills Samuel&#8217;s sign precisely (<a href="/1_samuel/10-6.htm">1 Samuel 10:6</a>).<p>2. Humility &#8211; The king-to-be joins an existing prophetic band, showing that even the future ruler stands under God&#8217;s authority (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p>3. Testimony &#8211; Observers will later ask, &#8220;Is Saul also among the prophets?&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/10-11.htm">1 Samuel 10:11</a>), spreading news that God has indeed chosen him.<p>Cross references reinforce the pattern: when the Spirit fills believers, they speak God&#8217;s words&#8212;Moses&#8217; wish in <a href="/numbers/11-29.htm">Numbers 11:29</a> fulfilled in a measure here, echoed later when all believers prophesy by the Spirit in <a href="/acts/19-6.htm">Acts 19:6</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/14-31.htm">1 Corinthians 14:31</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a> records the exact, Spirit-driven sign Samuel promised: in Saul&#8217;s own town, prophets meet him, the Spirit rushes upon him, and he prophesies. Each detail underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness, the Spirit&#8217;s power to equip, and the need for God-dependent leadership. For Saul, this moment should have anchored lifelong obedience; for us, it testifies that the Lord still empowers His people to speak and live His truth when they yield to His Spirit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">To the hill.</span>--"To the hill:" more accurately rendered, <span class= "ital">to Gibeah. </span>This was the home of Saul; the estate of the house of Kish lay evidently in the immediate vicinity of Gibeah, henceforward to be known as Saul's royal city, "Gibeah of Saul." "As he walked, the Spirit of God came upon him," we read. The coming of the Spirit of God upon him may be looked on as the sequel of that Divine gift of the new heart bestowed on him in the early morning, when he left Ramah. The changed heart was a fit home for that Divine Spirit which came on him in the eventide, as he drew near to his ancestral city.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To the hill.</span> Hebrew, "to Gibeah," his home. <span class="cmt_word">He prophesied.</span> Took part in prophetic exercises (see on Ver. 5). On seeing this, the people of Gibeah, <span class="cmt_word">who knew him beforetime</span>, - Hebrew, "from yesterday and the day before," but equivalent to our phrase "for years," - asked in surprise, <span class="cmt_word">What is this that is come unto the son of Kish?</span> What makes him thus act in a manner unlike all our long past experience of him? <span class="cmt_word">Is Saul also among the prophets?</span> From this question two things are evident: the first, that the schools founded by Samuel already held a high place in the estimation of the Israelites; the second, that Saul had not shared in that education which so raised the prophets as a class above, the mass of the people. Probably also Saul s character was not such as would have made him care for education. A young man who, while living in his neighbourhood, knew so little about Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/9-6.htm">1 Samuel 9:6</a>), could not have had a very inquiring or intellectual frame of mind. Of course Samuel could not, by gathering young men together, and giving them the best education the times afforded, gain for them also the highest and rarest of gifts, that of direct inspiration. Even when Elisha, the friend and attendant upon Elijah, asked his master for an elder son's portion of the Divine spirit, Elijah told him that he had asked a hard thing (<a href="/2_kings/2-10.htm">2 Kings 2:10</a>). The disparity then that the people remarked between Saul and the prophets was that between a rich young farmer's son, who had been brought up at home, and cared only for rustic things, and these young collegians, who were enjoying a careful education (comp. <a href="/john/7-15.htm">John 7:15</a>). How good that education was is proved by the fact that at David's court all posts which required literary skill were held by prophets. No man could found schools of inspired men; but Samuel founded great educational institutions, which ended by making the Israelites a highly trained and literary people. Saul's prophesying was not the result of training, but came to him by a Divine influence, rousing the slumbering enthusiasm of an energetic but fitful nature. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/10-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When Saul and his servant arrived</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
