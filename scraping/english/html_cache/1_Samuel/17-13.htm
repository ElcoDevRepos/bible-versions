This reflects the cultural expectation for able-bodied men to serve in the army. Saul, as the first king of Israel, was leading the nation in battle, and the participation of Jesse's sons indicates their alignment with the king's cause. This also sets the stage for David's later involvement, as he initially remains at home, underscoring his youth and the responsibilities of his older brothers.<p><b>The firstborn was Eliab:</b><br>Eliab, as the firstborn, held a position of prominence and responsibility within the family. In ancient Israelite culture, the firstborn son often received a double portion of the inheritance and was expected to lead the family after the father's death. Eliab's presence in the battle suggests his role as a leader among his siblings. However, his later interactions with David (<a href="/1_samuel/17-28.htm">1 Samuel 17:28</a>) reveal a tension that contrasts with his expected role, highlighting the theme of God's choice versus human expectations.<p><b>The second was Abinadab:</b><br>Abinadab, the second son, follows Eliab in the line of succession. His mention here, along with his brothers, emphasizes the family's full commitment to the national cause. The order of their names reflects the traditional patriarchal structure, where each son has a defined role based on birth order. Abinadab's presence in the narrative serves to underscore the normalcy of the family's involvement in the battle, setting the stage for the extraordinary actions of David.<p><b>And the third was Shammah:</b><br>Shammah, the third son, completes the trio of Jesse's sons who are actively participating in the battle. His inclusion in the list reinforces the idea of a complete and unified family effort in support of Saul's kingship. The mention of these three sons, without further elaboration on their actions in the battle, contrasts with the detailed account of David's later heroics, highlighting the unexpected nature of God's choice in using the youngest and seemingly least significant son to achieve His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesse.htm">Jesse</a></b><br>The father of David and his brothers, a resident of Bethlehem.

The king was expected to lead and conscript warriors (see <a href="/1_samuel/8-20.htm">1 Samuel 8:20</a>; 14:52).<p>- By noting that Jesse&#8217;s three eldest &#8220;followed Saul,&#8221; the verse underlines their military eligibility. <a href="/numbers/1-3.htm">Numbers 1:3</a> required those twenty and older to serve; David, being the youngest (<a href="/1_samuel/17-14.htm">1 Samuel 17:14</a>), is not yet of that age.<p>- Their enlistment shows the family&#8217;s loyalty to Israel&#8217;s king, aligning with Saul&#8217;s ongoing practice of drawing the valiant into his ranks (again, <a href="/1_samuel/14-52.htm">1 Samuel 14:52</a>).<p>- This detail also sets the dramatic contrast that follows: while the seasoned brothers join the army, God will use the overlooked youngest to gain the victory (compare <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7 and 17</a>:45&#8211;50).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The firstborn was Eliab,</b><p>- Eliab&#8217;s name resurfaces from the anointing scene: &#8220;When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, &#8216;Surely the LORD&#8217;s anointed stands here&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-6.htm">1 Samuel 16:6</a>). His height and appearance impressed even the prophet, yet God rejected him, teaching that divine choice rests on the heart, not outward stature.<p>- Firstborn status carried special honor (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>). Eliab likely held family authority and natural leadership qualities, making his presence in Saul&#8217;s ranks expected.<p>- Later, Eliab&#8217;s reaction to David&#8212;&#8220;Why have you come down here? &#8230; I know your pride and the wickedness of your heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-28.htm">1 Samuel 17:28</a>)&#8212;reveals jealousy and a misjudgment that contrasts sharply with God&#8217;s earlier assessment of David&#8217;s heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the second was Abinadab,</b><p>- Abinadab also appeared during Samuel&#8217;s visit: &#8220;Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. But Samuel said, &#8216;The LORD has not chosen this one either&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-8.htm">1 Samuel 16:8</a>). His rejection, like Eliab&#8217;s, reinforces that divine election bypassed natural seniority.<p>- Abinadab&#8217;s name later re-emerges when the ark returns from Philistia and remains in his house&#8212;though that is a different Abinadab from Kiriath-jearim (<a href="/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1</a>), the shared name underlines its common use within Israel.<p>- His placement in the verse signals the orderly listing of Jesse&#8217;s sons (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-13.htm">1 Chronicles 2:13</a>), validating the historical accuracy of the narrative.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the third was Shammah.</b><p>- Shammah (also called Shimeah, <a href="/1_chronicles/2-13.htm">1 Chronicles 2:13</a>) completes the trio first presented in <a href="/1_samuel/16-9.htm">1 Samuel 16:9</a>, where Samuel again says, &#8220;The LORD has not chosen this one.&#8221; God consistently bypasses the visible strength of Jesse&#8217;s older three sons.<p>- While Scripture records no direct words or deeds of Shammah in this chapter, his mention highlights the completeness of Jesse&#8217;s representation in Saul&#8217;s army&#8212;three sons, enough to reflect family honor yet still powerless to defeat Goliath.<p>- The silence about Shammah&#8217;s exploits contrasts with the loud faith of David, emphasizing that divine victory does not depend on a warrior&#8217;s r&#233;sum&#233; (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/17-13.htm">1 Samuel 17:13</a> grounds the upcoming confrontation with Goliath in everyday realities: Jesse&#8217;s eldest sons do what any patriotic Israelites would&#8212;join Saul&#8217;s army. The verse affirms the historical precision of Scripture, lists the brothers in birth order, and quietly sets up the surprise of God&#8217;s choice. The strongest and most qualified according to human standards stand in the king&#8217;s ranks, yet none of them will secure the victory. God will work through the shepherd-boy left at home, proving once more that &#8220;the battle belongs to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The three</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1500;&#1465;&#1444;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;l&#333;&#183;&#353;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7969.htm">Strong's 7969: </a> </span><span class="str2">Three, third, thrice</span><br /><br /><span class="word">older</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1465;&#1500;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;g&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#333;&#183;l&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
