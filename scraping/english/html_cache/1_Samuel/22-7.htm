Saul's servants were likely his military and administrative officials, reflecting the centralized power typical of ancient Near Eastern monarchies. This moment occurs during a period of increasing paranoia and instability in Saul's reign, as he perceives threats to his kingship.<p><b>&#8220;Listen, men of Benjamin!</b><br>Saul's reference to the "men of Benjamin" underscores tribal loyalties, as Saul himself was from the tribe of Benjamin. This appeal to tribal identity suggests Saul's reliance on his kinsmen for support, reflecting the tribal dynamics of Israelite society. The Benjaminites were known for their warrior prowess, and Saul's kingship initially brought prestige to the tribe.<p><b>Is the son of Jesse</b><br>By referring to David as "the son of Jesse," Saul diminishes David's status, avoiding using his name and emphasizing his humble origins. This reflects Saul's growing jealousy and fear of David, who was gaining popularity and favor among the people and even within Saul's own household.<p><b>giving all of you fields and vineyards</b><br>Fields and vineyards symbolize wealth and prosperity in ancient Israel, representing the economic benefits that a king could bestow upon his followers. Saul's rhetorical question implies that David, unlike Saul, cannot offer such material rewards, attempting to undermine David's growing influence by highlighting his lack of resources.<p><b>and making you commanders of thousands or hundreds?</b><br>This phrase refers to military leadership positions, which were highly coveted and signified honor and authority. Saul is questioning whether David can provide such prestigious roles, contrasting his own ability to reward loyalty with positions of power. This reflects the military organization of ancient Israel, where leaders were appointed over units of varying sizes, and also highlights Saul's fear of losing control over his army to David.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who later becomes increasingly paranoid and jealous of David.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants_of_saul.htm">Servants of Saul</a></b><br>These are the men who serve King Saul, likely including his military leaders and advisors.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamites.htm">Benjamites</a></b><br>Members of the tribe of Benjamin, Saul's own tribe, whom he addresses in this passage.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David (Son of Jesse)</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who is currently on the run from Saul.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/fields_and_vineyards.htm">Fields and Vineyards</a></b><br>Symbols of wealth and prosperity, which Saul uses to question the loyalty of his men.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_jealousy.htm">The Danger of Jealousy</a></b><br>Saul's jealousy of David leads him to irrational behavior and paranoia.

It is no wonder that the heart of the people gradually was estranged from one of whom in earlier years they had been so proud. The suspicious and gloomy king had evidently--we have it here from his own mouth--gradually given all the posts of honour and dignity to men of his own tribe and family, or to strangers like Doeg. "Hear now, ye Benjamites<span class= "ital">"</span>--so the "fideles" were evidently men of his own favoured tribe; indeed, he refers to his own weak partiality as the reason why <span class= "ital">they </span>of all men should be loyal. "Who but a Benjamite," he says, "would only honour Benjamites?" Such a sovereign had surely forfeited his kingdom. The consequences of such a weak and shortsighted policy were plainly visible in the thin array he was able in his hour of bitter need to muster together on the fatal field of Mount Gilboa against his sleepless Philistine enemies.

He had begun well, and his great feat of delivering Jabesh Gilead by summoning the militia of all Israel together must have given them something of a corporate feeling, and taught them their power when united. Yet now we find him isolated, and this address to his officers seems to show that he had aggrandised his own tribe at the expense of the rest. Moreover, he appeals to the worst passions of these men, and asks whether they can expect David to continue this favouritism, which had given them riches and all posts of power. And then he turns upon them, and fiercely accuses them of banding together in a conspiracy against him, to conceal from him the private understanding which existed between his own son and his enemy. <span class="cmt_word">Hath made a league.</span> Hebrew, "hath cut."
