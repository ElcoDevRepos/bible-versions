Their subjugation marks a turning point in Israel's history, as they had previously dominated and oppressed the Israelites. This subduing of the Philistines is a fulfillment of God's promise to protect and deliver His people when they turn back to Him. The victory over the Philistines is attributed to divine intervention rather than military might, emphasizing God's sovereignty and faithfulness.<p><b>and they stopped invading the territory of Israel</b><br>This cessation of Philistine invasions indicates a period of peace and stability for Israel, which had been rare during the time of the Judges. The Philistines' retreat can be seen as a direct result of Israel's repentance and return to God, as described earlier in the chapter. This peace allowed Israel to focus on internal consolidation and spiritual renewal. The phrase also highlights the importance of territorial integrity in the ancient Near East, where land was a crucial aspect of identity and survival.<p><b>And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines</b><br>The "hand of the LORD" is a biblical expression denoting God's power and active involvement in human affairs. Here, it signifies divine judgment and opposition against the Philistines, ensuring their continued subjugation. This divine intervention underscores the theme of God's protection over Israel when they are faithful to Him. It also serves as a reminder of the consequences of opposing God's chosen people, a theme echoed throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>all the days of Samuel</b><br>Samuel, as a prophet, judge, and leader, played a crucial role in Israel's spiritual and national revival. His leadership marked a period of relative peace and prosperity for Israel. The phrase suggests that Samuel's influence and guidance were instrumental in maintaining the Philistines' subjugation. Samuel's life and ministry foreshadow the coming of Christ, who is the ultimate prophet, priest, and king. Samuel's role as an intercessor and leader points to Jesus' mediatory work and His establishment of a lasting peace for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A significant enemy of Israel, known for their military prowess and frequent conflicts with the Israelites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, often in conflict with surrounding nations, including the Philistines.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, instrumental in leading the people back to God and securing peace.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, whose power and presence were evident in the subduing of the Philistines.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/subduing_of_the_philistines.htm">Subduing of the Philistines</a></b><br>A pivotal event where the Philistines were defeated and ceased to invade Israel during Samuel's leadership.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_deliverance.htm">God's Sovereignty in Deliverance</a></b><br>The subduing of the Philistines demonstrates God's sovereign power over nations and His ability to deliver His people from their enemies.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_faithful_leadership.htm">The Role of Faithful Leadership</a></b><br>Samuel's leadership was crucial in turning Israel back to God and securing peace.

The verse assures believers that when the LORD fights for His people, victory is real, borders are secure, and His protecting hand endures.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">So the Philistines were subdued.</span>--The work of Samuel had been thorough. It was no mere solitary victory, this success of Israel at Ebenezer, but was the sign of a new spirit in Israel, which animated the nation during the lifetime of Samuel, and the reigns of David and Solomon and the great Hebrew kings. The petty jealousies had disappeared, and had given place to a great national desire for unity. In the several tribal districts it was no longer the glory and prosperity of Judah, Ephraim, or Benjamin, but the glory and prosperity of Israel that was aimed at. The old idol worship of Canaan, which corrupted and degraded every nationality which practised it, was in a great measure swept away from among the chosen people, while the pure religion of the Eternal of Hosts was no longer confided solely to the care and guardianship of the tribe of Levi, which had shown itself unworthy of the mighty trust. The Levites still ministered in the sanctuary, and when the Temple took its place, alone officiated in its sacred courts; and the chosen race of Aaron, in the family first of Ithamar, then of Eleazar, alone wore the jewels and the official robe of the high priest; but in religious matters the power of the priestly tribe was never again supreme in the Land of Promise. From the days of Samuel a new order--that of the Prophets, whose exact functions with regard to the ritual of the worship of the Eternal were undefined--was acknowledged by the people as the regular medium of communication with the Jewish King of Israel.<p><span class= "bld">The hand of the Lord was against the Philistines.</span>--The Philistines never entirely recovered their supremacy in Canaan. There was. it is true, a long fierce struggle, but with the exception of the short period which immediately preceded the election of Saul, and the temporary disasters of the children of Israel which were the punishments of that king's disobedience--from this time forward the power of the Philistines gradually decayed. while the strength of Israel steadily increased, until King David completely subdued them, and the old oppressors of Israel were absorbed into the subject races of Canaan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So the Philistines were subdued.</span> Not completely, for we find that they had garrisons in Israel when Saul was made king; but it was a thorough victory for the time, and was followed up, moreover, by an invasion of Philistia, in which Samuel recovered the towns which had been wrested from Israel upon the western borders of Judah and Benjamin. Moreover, the enemy <span class="cmt_word">came no more into the coast of Israel.</span> That is, all invasions ceased. <span class="cmt_word">And the hand of Jehovah was against the philistines all the days of Samuel.</span> This, of course, includes the reign of Saul, till within four years of his death; for Samuel continued to he prophet, and to a certain extent shophet, even when Saul was king. The words, moreover, imply a struggle, during which there was a gradual growth in strength on Israel's part, and a gradual enfeeblement on the part of the Philistines, until David completely vanquished them, though they appear again as powerful enemies in the days of King Jehoram (<a href="/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>). It is certain, however, that fifteen or twenty years after this battle the Philistines were again in the ascendant (<a href="/1_samuel/13-19.htm">1 Samuel 13:19-23</a>), and it was this which made the Israelites demand a king (<a href="/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16</a>). But it is the method of the Divine historians to include the ultimate results, however distant, in their account of an event (see on 1 Samuel 16:21; 17:55-58); and Israel's freedom and the final subjugation of the Philistines were both contained in Samuel's victory at Mizpah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/7-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the Philistines</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hap&#183;p&#601;&#183;li&#353;&#183;t&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
