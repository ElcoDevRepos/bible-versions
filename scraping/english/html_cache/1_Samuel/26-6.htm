Ahimelech the Hittite is mentioned here, indicating the diverse group of followers David had, including non-Israelites. The Hittites were an ancient people known from the time of Abraham (<a href="/genesis/23-10.htm">Genesis 23:10</a>). This inclusion highlights David's leadership and ability to unite people from different backgrounds, foreshadowing the inclusive nature of Christ's kingdom.<p><b>and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab&#8217;s brother</b><br>Abishai is introduced as the son of Zeruiah, David's sister, making him David's nephew. He is also the brother of Joab, who would later become the commander of David's army. This familial connection emphasizes the loyalty and trust within David's inner circle. Abishai's role in David's life is significant, as he often acts as a fierce warrior and protector, paralleling the protective nature of Christ over His church.<p><b>&#8220;Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?&#8221;</b><br>David's question reveals his boldness and faith. Despite being pursued by Saul, David chooses to confront the situation directly. This act of courage is reminiscent of David's earlier confrontation with Goliath (1 Samuel 17), demonstrating his reliance on God's protection. The phrase also foreshadows Christ's willingness to face danger and sacrifice for the sake of His mission.<p><b>&#8220;I will go with you,&#8221; answered Abishai.</b><br>Abishai's immediate response shows his loyalty and readiness to support David, even at great personal risk. This willingness to accompany David into the enemy's camp reflects the commitment and courage expected of Christ's followers. Abishai's actions can be seen as a type of the disciples' dedication to Jesus, willing to follow Him even unto death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, known for his faithfulness to God and his complex relationship with King Saul, who sought to kill him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahimelech_the_hittite.htm">Ahimelech the Hittite</a></b><br>A lesser-known figure in David's circle, possibly a foreigner who had joined David's band of followers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/abishai_son_of_zeruiah.htm">Abishai son of Zeruiah</a></b><br>David's nephew, known for his bravery and loyalty.

The conquering Israelites subdued, but did not exterminate them; and gradually, in the days of the weakness and divisions which succeeded the first conquest, the Hittites, in common with many other of the old tribes, seeem to have enjoyed the Land of Promise with the children of Israel in a kind of joint occupation. We find the Hittites ranking here among David's trusted faithful men; and later we hear of another Hittite, Uriah, the husband of Bathsheba, filling an important post in the royal army, and possessing a house and an establishment in the capital city of Jerusalem. We do not hear again of this Ahimelech in the sacred record.<p><span class= "bld">Abishai the son of Zeruiah.</span>--Zeruiah was David's sister. Abishai, later one of the famous generals of David, was brother to Joab, afterwards the captain of the royal host. Abishai was apparently nearly of the same age as David. There was a third younger brother also high in the favour of his kinsman David--Asahel, celebrated especially for his speed in running. Between these three sons of Zeruiah and Abner a blood feud seems to have existed. Abner, the near relative, and captain of the host of Saul throughout that monarch's reign, is closely associated with the fortunes of Saul. It has been supposed, and with some probability, that he was among the determined foes of David. Dreading the advent of the son of Jesse to the throne, he saw in his elevation the signal of the downfall of all Saul's family and friends. He, Abner, surely would no longer be captain of the host of Israel. The words of David to Abner in this chapter (<a href="/context/1_samuel/26-14.htm" title="And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answer you not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who are you that cry to the king?">1Samuel 26:14-16</a>) seem to point to the fierce hatred which existed between them. The bloody sequel to the feud between the great kinsman of Saul and the three brothers, the famous sons of David's sister, is strictly in accordance with what we should expect in these fierce, wild days. Some time after Saul's death Abner slew the young Asahel, who seems to have been passionately loved by his elder brother. Abner became reconciled to David, but the reconciliation saved not the friend of Saul and the slayer of Asahel from the vengeance of Joab and Abishai, who murdered the illustrious Abner in cold blood.<p><span class= "bld">And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.</span>--Ahimelech seems to have backed out of the perilous night enterprise, but Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, with the reckless gallantry and the intense devotion to David which, with all their pride and self will, ever characterised these famous warrior kinsmen of the king, at once volunteered to go with his loved chief.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ahimelech the Hittite.</span> Though a portion of this once powerful people (<a href="/genesis/15-20.htm">Genesis 15:20</a>; <a href="/judges/1-26.htm">Judges 1:26</a>) was reduced to the position of bondmen (<a href="/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20</a>), yet others had retained their independence, and their kings even are spoken of (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> 10:29; <a href="/2_kings/7-6.htm">2 Kings 7:6</a>). As Ahimelech is mentioned before Abishai, he must have held an honourable place with. David, as did subsequently another Hittite, Uriah (<a href="/2_samuel/11-3.htm">2 Samuel 11:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Abishai the son of Zeruiah.</span> Zeruiah is described in <a href="/1_chronicles/2-16.htm">1 Chronicles 2:16</a> as sister to Jesse's sons, but apparently only by adoption, as both she and Abigail seem to have been daughters of the king of Ammon (<a href="/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a>), whence probably the absence of any direct reference to their father. Abishai, who was probably about David's age, and his two brothers were high in rank among David's heroes (<a href="/1_chronicles/11-6.htm">1 Chronicles 11:6, 20, 26</a>), and apparently he was one of the three captains who, when David was in the cave of Adullam, broke through the host of the Philistines to fetch him water from the well of Bethlehem. <span class="cmt_word">Who will go down?</span> It is evident that David and his men remained upon the mountains, which extend from Maon far to the southwest. Saul's camp, being "by the way," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> near the road, would be on the lower ground. David having personally examined it, and seen that the watches were ill kept, asks which of the two will accompany him for the more hazardous enterprise of penetrating into it. Ahimelech seems prudently to have declined, but Abishai at once offers his services. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/26-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1436;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">asked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1448;&#1506;&#1463;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
