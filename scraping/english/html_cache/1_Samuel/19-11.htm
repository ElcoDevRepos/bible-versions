This reflects Saul's spiritual decline and the fulfillment of Samuel's prophecy that the kingdom would be torn from him. The use of "messengers" indicates Saul's authority and the seriousness of his intent. The act of watching suggests a premeditated plan, highlighting the danger David was in. This event takes place in Gibeah, Saul's capital, where David lived with Michal, Saul's daughter. The cultural context of the time allowed for such personal vendettas, especially from a king, to be carried out with little resistance.<p><b>But David&#8217;s wife Michal warned him,</b><br>Michal's intervention is significant as it shows her loyalty to David over her father, Saul. This act of warning is a pivotal moment in David's life, showcasing divine providence and protection. Michal's role is crucial, as women in biblical narratives often act as agents of salvation. Her actions can be seen as a type of the church, the bride of Christ, who supports and protects the anointed one. Michal's warning also reflects the tension within Saul's household, where loyalty is divided.<p><b>&#8220;If you do not run for your life tonight,</b><br>Michal's urgency underscores the imminent danger David faced. The phrase "run for your life" indicates the severity of the threat and the need for immediate action. This moment is a test of faith and trust in God's plan for David, who had been anointed as the future king of Israel. The night escape is reminiscent of other biblical figures who fled from danger, such as Jacob from Esau and Moses from Pharaoh, highlighting a recurring theme of divine deliverance.<p><b>tomorrow you will be dead!&#8221;</b><br>Michal's stark warning emphasizes the reality of the threat and the necessity of David's escape. The mention of "tomorrow" adds a sense of urgency and inevitability, reflecting the seriousness of Saul's intent. This phrase foreshadows the ongoing conflict between Saul and David, which would continue until Saul's death. It also highlights the precariousness of David's position and the constant need for vigilance and reliance on God's protection. This moment is a precursor to David's life as a fugitive, where he would learn to trust in God's provision and timing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who becomes increasingly jealous and hostile towards David, seeking to kill him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, known for his faithfulness to God and his close relationship with Saul's son, Jonathan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/michal.htm">Michal</a></b><br>Saul's daughter and David's wife, who plays a crucial role in saving David's life by warning him of her father's intentions.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/messengers.htm">Messengers</a></b><br>Agents sent by Saul to monitor David and execute Saul's plan to kill him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/david's_house.htm">David&#8217;s House</a></b><br>The location where the event takes place, serving as a temporary refuge for David.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_protection.htm">God's Protection</a></b><br>Despite human schemes, God&#8217;s plans for His anointed will prevail.
