This fear was rooted in Saul's awareness that the Lord was with David, as seen in previous chapters where David's victories and favor with the people were evident. Saul's fear can be linked to his own insecurity and the realization that his kingdom was being threatened, as Samuel had already prophesied that the kingdom would be torn from him (<a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>). This fear is a reflection of Saul's spiritual decline and his inability to trust in God's plan, contrasting with David's faithfulness and reliance on God. Saul's fear also foreshadows the eventual transfer of kingship to David, aligning with God's sovereign plan.<p><b>So from then on Saul was David&#8217;s enemy.</b><br>This marks a turning point in Saul and David's relationship, transitioning from a mentor-mentee dynamic to one of enmity. Saul's enmity towards David is not just personal but also spiritual, as Saul is opposing God's anointed future king. This enmity is a fulfillment of the tension between the house of Saul and the house of David, which is a recurring theme throughout the books of Samuel. Saul's hostility towards David can be seen as a type of the world's opposition to God's chosen ones, paralleling the opposition Jesus faced from the religious leaders of His time. Saul's enmity also sets the stage for David's trials and his eventual rise to the throne, demonstrating God's faithfulness in fulfilling His promises despite human opposition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Unrepentant hearts fear God&#8217;s anointed instead of submitting to God Himself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So from then on Saul was David&#8217;s enemy</b><p>The verse concludes, &#8220;So from then on Saul was David&#8217;s enemy.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Fear hardens into hostility. What began as jealousy over songs (<a href="/1_samuel/18-7.htm">1 Samuel 18:7&#8211;9</a>) now becomes settled enmity.<p>&#8226; Observable fallout:<p>&#8211; Saul twice hurls a spear at David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-11.htm">1 Samuel 18:11</a>; 19:10).<p>&#8211; He plots through marriage traps (<a href="/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8211; He orders outright assassination (<a href="/1_samuel/19-1.htm">1 Samuel 19:1</a>) and a nationwide manhunt (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>).<p>&#8211; Even a miraculous deliverance at Naioth (<a href="/1_samuel/19-23.htm">1 Samuel 19:23&#8211;24</a>) does not soften him; sin blinds.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently links fear of man to enmity with God&#8217;s purpose (<a href="/james/4-4.htm">James 4:4</a>). Saul sets himself against David, and therefore against the LORD, mirroring how the Sanhedrin later opposed Christ (<a href="/acts/7-52.htm">Acts 7:52</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet David refuses retaliation (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>; 26:9), modeling Christlike grace toward enemies (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>). Saul&#8217;s hatred cannot void God&#8217;s promise; the LORD&#8217;s anointed will reach the throne in God&#8217;s timing (<a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Saul&#8217;s escalating fear of David stems from recognizing God&#8217;s unmistakable favor on the younger man while knowing he has forfeited that favor himself. Instead of repenting, Saul chooses resentment, and fear crystallizes into lifelong enmity. The verse warns that unchecked jealousy breeds hostile opposition to God&#8217;s work, yet it also reassures that no human enmity can thwart the LORD&#8217;s sovereign plan.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/18-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">he</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">grew even more</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1505;&#1462;&#1507;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;sep&#772;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
