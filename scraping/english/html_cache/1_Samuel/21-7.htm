The presence of Saul's servant indicates the interconnectedness of events in David's life and Saul's reign. It foreshadows the potential for conflict, as Saul's servants were often involved in his pursuit of David. This moment is pivotal, as it leads to future consequences for the priests of Nob.<p><b>detained before the LORD</b><br>The phrase suggests a religious or ritualistic reason for Doeg's presence at Nob. Being "detained before the LORD" implies that Doeg was fulfilling a vow, undergoing purification, or participating in a religious observance. This highlights the religious practices of the time and the significance of the tabernacle at Nob as a center of worship and sacrifice.<p><b>And his name was Doeg the Edomite</b><br>Doeg's identity as an Edomite is significant, as the Edomites were descendants of Esau and often in conflict with Israel. His foreign origin may suggest a lack of loyalty to Israelite customs and people, which is later evident in his actions. This background provides insight into his character and foreshadows his role in the narrative.<p><b>the chief shepherd for Saul</b><br>As the chief shepherd, Doeg held a position of responsibility and trust within Saul's administration. This role indicates his influence and access to Saul, which becomes crucial in the unfolding events. Shepherding, a common occupation in ancient Israel, is often used metaphorically in the Bible to describe leadership and care, contrasting Doeg's later betrayal with the ideal shepherding qualities seen in figures like David and ultimately in Jesus Christ, the Good Shepherd.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/doeg_the_edomite.htm">Doeg the Edomite</a></b><br>A servant of King Saul, identified as the chief shepherd.

The verse reminds us that no detail escapes the Lord&#8217;s sovereign design, that proximity to sacred things does not equal devotion, and that authority must be exercised in covenant faithfulness lest it become an instrument of evil.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">A certain man.</span>--Among the personages who surround Saul in the Bible story appears incidentally the keeper of the royal mules, and chief of the household slaves, the "Comes stabuli," "the constable of the king," as appears in the later monarchy. "He is the first instance of a foreigner employed in a high function in Israel, being an Edomite, or Syrian, of the name of Doeg--according to Jewish tradition, the steward who accompanied Saul in his pursuit after the asses, who counselled him to send for David, and who ultimately slew him, according to the sacred narrative--a person of vast and sinister influence in his master's counsels." (Stanley, <span class= "ital">Lectures on the Jewish Church, </span>Lect. 21) Some traditions affirm that the armour-bearer who slew Saul on Mount Gilboa was not Doeg, but Doeg's son.<p>The Hebrew words rendered in the English Version, "the chiefest of the herdmen that <span class= "ital">belonged </span>to Saul," are translated in the LXX. by "feeding the mules of Saul;" and in accordance with this reading, in <a href="/1_samuel/22-9.htm" title="Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.">1Samuel 22:9</a> also, they have changed "Saul's servants" into "Saul's mules." The Vulg. and the other versions, however, translate as the English Version, "potentissimus pastorum," although in some of the Vulg. MSS. there is an explanatory gloss, evidently derived from the singular interpretation of the LXX., <span class= "ital">"</span>This (man) used to feed Saul's mules." There can be no foundation in tradition or otherwise for such a reading, as we never read until the days of King David of mules being used by royal princes. (See <a href="/2_samuel/13-29.htm" title="And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man got him up on his mule, and fled.">2Samuel 13:29</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/18-9.htm" title="And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode on a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.">2Samuel 18:9</a>.) Before David's time, the sons of princes used to ride on asses. (See <a href="/judges/10-4.htm" title="And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.">Judges 10:4</a>; <a href="/judges/12-14.htm" title="And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on three score and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.">Judges 12:14</a>.) Ewald, disregarding the current Jewish tradition respecting the ancient connection of Doeg with the house of Kish, considers that this influential chieftain of the king probably came over to Saul in his war with Edom. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - David's visit to Nob had probably been dictated simply by a desire to get food while a few attendants were being collected for him, and under ordinary circumstances would have remained unknown to Saul. Unfortunately there chanced to be a person present there who informed the king of it, and brought a second terrible catastrophe upon the house of Eli (see on 1 Samuel 2:33); by working too upon his jealousy he caused Saul to commit a crime which sets him before us as a hateful and remorseless tyrant. This man was <span class="cmt_word">Doeg, an Edomite,</span> who had, it seems, long been in Saul's service, as he was his chief herdsman. According to the Septuagint he had charge of the king's mules, but the other versions agree with the Hebrew. As herds would form the main part of Saul's wealth, his chief herdsman would be a person of importance. He was <span class="cmt_word">detained before Jehovah.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> shut up in close seclusion within the precincts of the tabernacle, either for some vow, or for purification, or perhaps as suspected of leprosy (<a href="/leviticus/13-4.htm">Leviticus 13:4</a>), or, as some think, as a proselyte. Ephrem Syrus thinks he had committed some trespass, and was detained till he had offered the appointed sacrifice.
