In <a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>, Saul was commanded to completely destroy the Amalekites, but he disobeyed by sparing King Agag and the best of the livestock. This disobedience is a direct violation of God's command, illustrating the consequences of failing to follow divine instructions. Obedience to God is emphasized in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's adherence to God's laws.<p><b>or carry out His burning anger against Amalek</b><br>The Amalekites were long-standing enemies of Israel, first attacking them in <a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17</a>. God's command to destroy them was a fulfillment of His promise to blot out their memory due to their opposition to Israel. Saul's failure to execute God's judgment on Amalek demonstrates a lack of reverence for God's justice and sovereignty. This act of disobedience is a significant factor in Saul's rejection as king, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>.<p><b>the LORD has done this to you today</b><br>The phrase indicates divine retribution and the fulfillment of God's judgment. Saul's loss of the kingdom and his eventual downfall are direct results of his disobedience. This serves as a warning that God's decrees are not to be taken lightly. The immediate context of <a href="/1_samuel/28.htm">1 Samuel 28</a> shows Saul seeking guidance from a medium, further illustrating his departure from God's ways. The consequences of Saul's actions are a reminder of the seriousness of sin and the certainty of divine justice, as echoed in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, "Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked.
