This event occurs during a period when Saul is pursuing David, who is anointed but not yet king. The location is the Wilderness of Ziph, a region known for its rugged terrain, providing natural hiding places. David's actions reflect his reliance on God's guidance, as he seeks to confront Saul without resorting to violence. This moment foreshadows David's future role as a wise and discerning leader.<p><b>He saw the place where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the general of his army, had lain down.</b><br>Abner, Saul's cousin and commander, is a significant figure in Israel's military hierarchy. His presence underscores the seriousness of Saul's pursuit of David. The mention of Abner highlights the organized and formidable nature of Saul's forces. This scene sets the stage for David's later interactions with Abner, emphasizing themes of loyalty and leadership. The relationship between David and Abner is complex, as Abner eventually supports David's rival, Ish-bosheth, before ultimately aligning with David.<p><b>Saul was lying inside the inner circle of the camp, with the troops camped around him.</b><br>Saul's position in the center of the camp indicates his status as king and the protection afforded to him by his men. This arrangement reflects ancient military practices, where leaders were safeguarded by their soldiers. The inner circle symbolizes Saul's authority and the loyalty of his troops, despite his declining mental state and erratic behavior. This scene contrasts with David's reliance on God's protection rather than human defenses. It also prefigures the vulnerability of earthly kingship compared to the divine kingship that David will embody.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by God, who is currently fleeing from King Saul.

(1 Samuel 26:15-16)</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does 1 Samuel 26:5 Mean</div><b>Then David set out and went to the place where Saul had camped</b><p>&#8211; David makes the first move, taking the initiative rather than hiding.<p>&#8226; Earlier, God had warned him to flee (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14&#8211;15</a>), yet here he approaches danger because he knows the Lord is his shield (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>).<p>&#8226; This action mirrors his earlier journey into Saul&#8217;s cave (<a href="/1_samuel/24-3.htm">1 Samuel 24:3&#8211;4</a>), showing consistent courage rooted in trust.<p>&#8226; By physically entering Saul&#8217;s territory, David demonstrates that his confidence is in God&#8217;s providence, not in distance or numbers (<a href="/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He saw the place where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the general of his army, had lain down</b><p>&#8211; David surveys the scene before acting, practicing godly wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Abner&#8217;s presence highlights Saul&#8217;s military strength; yet David realizes that even the best human protection is nothing if God removes vigilance (<a href="/psalms/127-1.htm">Psalm 127:1</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s careful observation sets up his later decision to spare Saul again (<a href="/1_samuel/26-9.htm">1 Samuel 26:9&#8211;11</a>), showing consistency with his earlier refusal to harm the Lord&#8217;s anointed (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Saul was lying inside the inner circle of the camp, with the troops camped around him</b><p>&#8211; The narrator stresses Saul&#8217;s seemingly secure position.<p>&#8226; A central, fortified spot guarded by soldiers suggests total safety&#8212;yet the next verses reveal every guard asleep (<a href="/1_samuel/26-7.htm">1 Samuel 26:7&#8211;12</a>). God alone grants true security (<a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast between Saul&#8217;s guarded circle and David&#8217;s vulnerable visit underscores God&#8217;s sovereign reversal: power belongs not to the outwardly protected king, but to the one walking in obedience (<a href="/1_samuel/24-15.htm">1 Samuel 24:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s posture&#8212;resting while plotting murder (<a href="/1_samuel/26-2.htm">1 Samuel 26:2</a>)&#8212;shows a dull conscience; David&#8217;s wakefulness reflects a heart sensitive to God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/26-5.htm">1 Samuel 26:5</a> sets the stage for a dramatic demonstration of God&#8217;s control. David willingly enters Saul&#8217;s camp, assesses the situation, and finds the king sheltered by human defenses. Yet the scene hints that no earthly arrangement can hinder the Lord&#8217;s purposes. David&#8217;s courage, restraint, and faith foreshadow God&#8217;s deliverance, reminding us that security is found not in position or numbers but in trusting and obeying the living God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">And David arose.</span>--Immediately after the scouts informed him of the purpose of Saul, and of the near proximity of the royal army David seems to have resolved upon that night adventure which resulted in the episode told in this twenty-sixth chapter.<p><span class= "bld">In the trench.</span>--The English Version (Margin) has, "in the midst of his carriages"; Keil renders, "by the wagon rampart"; The LXX. translate the Hebrew word by "covered chariots." The meaning is, no doubt, that the king lay down within the barricade or rampart formed by the baggage wagons.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David arose.</span> It seems as if David could scarcely believe that Saul would thus a second time pursue him; but when the scouts informed him that it was really so, he went in person to reconnoitre Saul's camp. From the opposite hill he was able to see that <span class="cmt_word">he lay in the trench,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the barricade formed by the wagons. At night Saul's place would be in the centre, with Abner near him, while the rest would lie sleeping around, but all of them within the rampart. When David reconnoitred them they would probably be arranging their wagons to form this barricade. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/26-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1431;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">set out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1511;&#1464;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;q&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
