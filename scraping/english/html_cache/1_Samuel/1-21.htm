The phrase "all his house" indicates the inclusion of his wives, children, and possibly servants, reflecting the patriarchal structure of ancient Israelite society. This communal aspect of worship underscores the importance of family unity in religious observance, as seen in other biblical narratives such as <a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>, where Joshua declares, "As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD."<p><b>went up to make the annual sacrifice to the LORD</b><br>The act of going "up" refers to the geographical ascent to Shiloh, where the tabernacle was located. This pilgrimage was part of the Israelites' religious duty, as prescribed in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>, which required males to appear before the LORD three times a year. The "annual sacrifice" likely refers to the Feast of Tabernacles, Passover, or the Feast of Weeks, which were times of communal worship and celebration. This practice highlights the centrality of sacrificial worship in maintaining the covenant relationship with God.<p><b>and to fulfill his vow</b><br>Vows were solemn promises made to God, often in times of distress or need, as seen in <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>. Elkanah's vow may have been related to his prayer for a child, as vows were commonly associated with requests for divine intervention. The fulfillment of vows was a serious obligation, reflecting one's faithfulness and integrity before God. This act of fulfilling a vow also prefigures the ultimate fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus Christ, who is the "yes" and "amen" of all God's promises (<a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elkanah.htm">Elkanah</a></b><br>A devout man from the hill country of Ephraim, Elkanah is the husband of Hannah and Peninnah.

It has been remarked that vows are characteristic of that particular age of the Judges; for instance, we have detailed accounts of Samson and Jephthan's vows, the oath in the Benjamite vow, &c.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Elkanah... went up.</span> When at the return of the year Elkanah went up as usual to Shiloh, Hannah remained at home, purposing to wait there till her son was old enough to be given to the Lord. This followed soon after his weaning, which in the East is delayed much longer than with us. In 2 Macc. 7:27 we find three years mentioned as the usual period of lactation, but the chief Jewish authorities make the time one year shorter. At three years old a child in the East would cease to be troublesome; but besides this, there was an order of women attached to the sanctuary (see on 1 Samuel 2:22), and probably regulations for the training of children devoted to the temple service. <span class="cmt_word">The yearly sacrifice,</span> lit. "sacrifice of days," would include among its duties the carrying to Shiloh of the tithes which were to be consumed before the Lord (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-17.htm">Deuteronomy 12:17, 18</a>), and the payment of those portions of the produce which belonged to Jehovah and the priests, and had become due during the year. <span class="cmt_word">His vow</span> shows that Elkanah had ratified Hannah's words, by adding thereto a thank-offering from himself. At Shiloh Samuel was to <span class="cmt_word">abide forever;</span> his dedication was to be for his whole life. And when Elkanah prays, <span class="cmt_word">Only the Lord establish his word,</span> it is evident that he and Hannah expected that a child born under such special circumstances would, like so many children of mothers long barren, be intended for some extraordinary work. The word of Jehovah referred to is that spoken by Eli in ver. 17, which contained not merely the assurance of the birth of a son, but a general confirmation and approval of all that Hannah had prayed for. In ver. 24 the Septuagint reads, "a bullock of three years old," probably on account of the one bullock mentioned in ver. 25; but as three-tenths of an ephah of flour formed the appointed meat offering for one bullock (<a href="/numbers/15-8.htm">Numbers 15:8-10</a>), the mention of a whole ephah confirms the reading three bullocks. Probably the one bullock in ver. 25 was the special burnt offering accompanying the solemn dedication of Samuel to Jehovah's service, while the other two were for Elkanah's usual yearly sacrifice, and the thank offering which he had vowed. At the end of the verse the Hebrews reads, "And the child was a child," the word in both places being <span class="accented">na'ar</span>, which may mean anything up to fifteen years of age. The child really was about three years old, and the Sept. is probably right in reading, "And the child was with them." Both the Vulgate, however, and the Syriac agree with the Hebrew. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/1-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Elkanah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1456;&#1511;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el&#183;q&#257;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_511.htm">Strong's 511: </a> </span><span class="str2">Elkanah -- 'God has created', the name of several Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
