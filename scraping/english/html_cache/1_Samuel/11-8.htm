Bezek is a location in the territory of Israel, possibly near the Jordan River, which served as a strategic gathering point. This act of numbering the troops reflects a common military practice in ancient times, emphasizing the importance of preparation and order before engaging in warfare. The gathering at Bezek signifies unity among the tribes under Saul's leadership, a crucial step in consolidating his kingship.<p><b>there were 300,000 Israelites</b><br>The large number of Israelites indicates a significant mobilization of the people, showing widespread support for Saul's leadership. This figure highlights the potential military strength of Israel when united. The mention of Israelites as a collective group underscores the unity among the northern tribes, which was essential for the defense against external threats. This unity is reminiscent of earlier times when the tribes came together under leaders like Joshua and the judges.<p><b>and 30,000 men of Judah</b><br>The specific mention of Judah, separate from the other tribes, reflects the distinct identity and prominence of the tribe. Judah's involvement is crucial, as it foreshadows the future importance of this tribe in Israel's history, particularly with the rise of David, who would come from Judah. The distinction between the Israelites and the men of Judah may also hint at the eventual division of the kingdom into Israel and Judah. This separation is significant in biblical prophecy and the lineage of Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the Lion of the tribe of Judah, fulfilling the messianic promise.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Saul, empowered by the Spirit, assembles Israel at Bezek, drawing 300,000 Israelites and 30,000 men of Judah into one formidable host. The verse underscores God&#8217;s faithfulness, the legitimacy of Saul&#8217;s kingship, and the strength that arises when God&#8217;s people stand together against oppression.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Bezek.</span>--Bezek was in the tribe of Issachar, in the plain of Jezreel, an open district, well adapted for the assembling of the great host which so promptly obeyed the peremptory summons of the war-signal of King Saul.<p><span class= "bld">The children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.</span>--It has been suggested that this verse was the addition of some late reviser of the book, who lived in the northern kingdom after the final separation of Israel and Judah, but such a supposition is not necessary to account for the separate mention of Judah and Israel, or for the apparently great disproportion in the numbers supplied by the great southern tribe. The chronicler, with pardonable exultation, specially mentions the splendid result of the young hero's first summons to the tribes, adding, with perhaps an undertone of sadness, that the rich and populous Judah to that great host only contributed 30,000. There is no doubt, as Dean Payne Smith well observes, that "as a matter of fact Judah always stood apart until there was a king who belonged to itself. Then, in David's time, it first took an active interest in the national welfare, and it was its vast power and numbers which made the shepherd-king, who sprang from Judah, so powerful." In the reign of King Asa of Judah, the numbers of the men of war of that proud tribe amounted to 300,000. It is, however, to be remembered that in the Old Testament Books, owing to the mistakes of copyists, <span class= "ital">numbers </span>are not always to be strictly relied upon.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He numbered them in Bezek</span>. This place was in the tribe of Issachar, and must be distinguished from that mentioned in <a href="/judges/1-3.htm">Judges 1:3, 4</a>, which was in Judah, and too remote from the scene of operations. And here Saul appears as the commander-in-chief; for the numbering included the forming of battalions, arranged in thousands, hundreds, and fifties, and the setting officers over them. These, naturally, were the chief men in each district. The result would be that, coming to Bezek, the appointed rendezvous, a disorderly multitude, they would leave it as an army arranged in order, and Saul, in the many difficulties that would arise, would have his first opportunity of showing his powers of command. <span class="cmt_word">Children of Israel,... men of Judah</span> - the distinction which ended in the disruption of the nation. Judah, too, with its 30,000 men, is but poorly represented, nor is it a sufficient explanation of the small number who came that the tribe had enough to do at home in making head against the Philistines. As a matter of fact, Judah always stood apart until there was a king who belonged to itself. Then, in David's time, it first took an active interest in the national welfare, and it was its vast power and numbers which made him so powerful. Had it been so nearly overpowered by the Philistines, it could not so suddenly have sprung forth with a might which made it well nigh a match for all the rest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/11-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And when [Saul] numbered them</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1511;&#1456;&#1491;&#1461;&#1430;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yip&#772;&#183;q&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#234;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
