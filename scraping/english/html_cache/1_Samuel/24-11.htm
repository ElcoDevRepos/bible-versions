The act of cutting the corner of Saul's robe is significant; in ancient Israel, the robe symbolized authority and identity. By holding the corner of the robe, David demonstrates that he had the opportunity to harm Saul but chose not to, highlighting his respect for God's anointed.<p><b>For I cut it off, but I did not kill you.</b><br>David's action of cutting the robe rather than harming Saul shows his restraint and respect for God's sovereignty. This act serves as a powerful symbol of David's integrity and his commitment to leaving vengeance to God. It also reflects the biblical principle of not repaying evil for evil, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-17.htm">Romans 12:17-19</a>.<p><b>Know and see that there is no evil or rebellion in my hands.</b><br>David asserts his innocence and loyalty to Saul, emphasizing that he harbors no ill intent or desire to usurp the throne. This statement is a plea for Saul to recognize David's righteousness and to dispel any false accusations against him. It reflects the biblical theme of God examining the heart, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>.<p><b>I have not sinned against you,</b><br>David maintains his innocence, underscoring his adherence to God's commandments and his respect for Saul's kingship. This declaration aligns with the biblical principle of maintaining a clear conscience before God and man, as seen in <a href="/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>.<p><b>even though you are hunting me down to take my life.</b><br>David acknowledges Saul's relentless pursuit, which highlights the unjust nature of Saul's actions. This situation parallels the persecution faced by many biblical figures, including Jesus Christ, who was pursued and unjustly condemned despite His innocence. David's response exemplifies the call to love and pray for one's enemies, as taught in <a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who is currently being pursued by King Saul.

So David calls himself Nabal's son (<a href="/1_samuel/25-8.htm">1 Samuel 25:8</a>). In the rest of the verse he contrasts his refusal to slay Saul, when it might have seemed as if it were Providence that had put him into his power, with Saul's determined pursuit of him. <span class="cmt_word">Thou huntest my soul to take it.</span> Thou perpetually usest every artifice and stratagem against me for the confessed purpose of killing me, and pursuest me as eagerly as the hunter pursues his game. Hence David commits his cause to Jehovah, in the sure confidence that he will avenge him, and with the firm determination never himself to raise his hand against one who, though his enemy, was also the king. In proof of the impossibility of his ever seeking the king's hurt, he quotes an ancient proverb, "From the wicked goeth out wickedness." Had David harboured evil intentions he would have executed them when so fair an opportunity offered, but as he has no such purposes "his hand will never be" upon Saul. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/24-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">See,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1428;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my father,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1489;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
