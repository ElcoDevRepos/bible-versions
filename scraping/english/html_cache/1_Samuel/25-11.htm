Bread and water symbolize basic sustenance, and withholding them from travelers or those in need was seen as inhospitable. In the broader biblical context, hospitality is a recurring theme, as seen in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a> with Abraham's welcome of the three visitors. Nabal's refusal contrasts with the generosity expected of God's people.<p><b>and the meat I have slaughtered for my shearers</b><br>The mention of meat slaughtered for shearers indicates a time of celebration and abundance, as sheep shearing was a festive occasion. This was a time when generosity was expected, especially towards those who had provided protection or service, as David's men had done for Nabal's shepherds. The cultural expectation was to share the abundance, as seen in the story of the prodigal son (<a href="/luke/15-23.htm">Luke 15:23</a>), where a feast is prepared to celebrate.<p><b>and give them to these men</b><br>Nabal's reference to "these men" shows his disdain and lack of recognition for David and his men. In the historical context, David was already anointed as the future king of Israel, and his men were not mere wanderers but warriors who had protected Nabal's flocks. This phrase highlights Nabal's ignorance or willful disregard of David's status and the protection provided.<p><b>whose origin I do not know?</b><br>This phrase underscores Nabal's dismissive attitude and lack of discernment. In the cultural context, knowing someone's origin was important for establishing trust and social connections. However, Nabal's claim of ignorance is likely disingenuous, as David's reputation was well-known. This echoes the rejection of Jesus in <a href="/john/1-10.htm">John 1:10-11</a>, where He came to His own, but they did not receive Him. Nabal's failure to recognize David's identity and role foreshadows the rejection of Christ by those who did not understand His true origin and mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nabal.htm">Nabal</a></b><br>A wealthy but harsh and surly man from Maon, whose name means "fool" in Hebrew.

Refusing hospitality violated the cultural norm seen when Abraham fed strangers (<a href="/genesis/18-1.htm">Genesis 18:1-8</a>).<p>- <a href="/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27</a> warns, &#8220;Do not withhold good from those who deserve it when it is within your power to act.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and give them to these men</b><p>- Nabal reduces David&#8217;s loyal warriors to faceless beggars, ignoring their service.<p>- Scripture commends honoring those who labor for our benefit: &#8220;The worker is worthy of his wages&#8221; (<a href="/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>).<p>- His attitude mirrors the rich fool who hoarded wealth instead of sharing (<a href="/luke/12-16.htm">Luke 12:16-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>whose origin I do not know?</b><p>- The slight is intentional; Nabal knows David&#8217;s identity (v. 10) yet chooses contempt.<p>- By branding God&#8217;s anointed as a nobody, he positions himself against the Lord&#8217;s purposes, echoing Pharaoh&#8217;s &#8220;Who is the LORD, that I should obey Him?&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>).<p>- <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a> urges, &#8220;Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing it.&#8221; Nabal&#8217;s rejection forfeits blessing and invites judgment (v. 38).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Nabal&#8217;s question exposes a heart ruled by selfishness, ingratitude, and contempt for God&#8217;s chosen servant. At a moment of plenty he withholds what is rightfully due, violating biblical commands to recognize God as provider, share generously, and honor those who work for our good. His words warn us that hoarding what the Lord has entrusted invites divine discipline, while openhanded generosity aligns us with God&#8217;s character and blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Unto men, whom I know not.</span>--In other words, "Shall I give largesse to the enemies of my king--to a band of rebel freebooters?"<p><span class= "bld">My water.</span>--The LXX., instead of "water," read "wine." This is one of the countless alterations this version arbitrarily makes in the original sacred text. The Greek translators were puzzled at Nabal's enumeration of "water" as one of the demands of David. Its mention, however, is a mark of the accuracy of the record. Water in many parts of the East is exceedingly precious. The words of <a href="/joshua/15-19.htm" title="Who answered, Give me a blessing; for you have given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.">Joshua 15:19</a> clearly indicate the especial want of this district of Palestine, when Caleb's daughter Achsah specially prayed her father for springs of water. Its mention, however, can scarcely, as Dean Payne Smith observes, "mark the abstemious habits of the people," considering in the same chapter we find the owner of all these flocks prostrate through intoxication.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/25-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Why should I take</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1511;&#1463;&#1495;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#257;&#183;qa&#7717;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
