Samuel was a judge, prophet, and leader who anointed the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David. His role as a prophet is crucial, as he serves as God's mouthpiece, delivering divine messages to the people and their leaders.<p><b>Although you were once small in your own eyes</b><br>This refers to Saul's humble beginnings and initial humility. Saul was from the tribe of Benjamin, the smallest of the tribes of Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/9-21.htm">1 Samuel 9:21</a>). His modesty is highlighted in his reluctance to assume leadership, as seen when he hid among the baggage during his anointing (<a href="/1_samuel/10-22.htm">1 Samuel 10:22</a>). This humility contrasts with his later disobedience and pride.<p><b>have you not become the head of the tribes of Israel?</b><br>Saul's rise to leadership is emphasized here. Despite his initial humility, God elevated him to be the king over all the tribes of Israel. This position of authority was significant, as it united the tribes under a single monarchy, transitioning from the period of the judges to a centralized kingdom.<p><b>The LORD anointed you king over Israel</b><br>The anointing of Saul as king was a divine appointment, signifying God's choice and empowerment for leadership. Anointing with oil was a symbolic act representing the Holy Spirit's presence and blessing. This act set Saul apart for his role, similar to the anointing of priests and later kings, including David. The concept of anointing also foreshadows the Messiah (meaning "Anointed One"), pointing to Jesus Christ, who fulfills the ultimate kingship over God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel who anointed Saul as the first king of Israel.

Back when he met the prophet, Saul said, &#8220;Am I not a Benjaminite from the smallest of Israel&#8217;s tribes, and isn&#8217;t my clan the least of all the clans of Benjamin?&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/9-21.htm">1 Samuel 9:21</a>).<p>&#8226; God delights to lift the humble&#8212;&#8220;He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has exalted the humble&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>). Saul&#8217;s initial self-view positioned him to receive God&#8217;s favor.<p>&#8226; Humility is not optional. &#8220;Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will exalt you&#8221; (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>). Pride reverses that process (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s later arrogance shows how quickly a heart can drift when it forgets its small beginnings. &#8220;Consider your calling, brothers: Not many were wise by human standards&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">1 Corinthians 1:26</a>). God&#8217;s choice confounds human boasting.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Head of the tribes of Israel</b><p>&#8226; Though once obscure, Saul now stands as leader over all twelve tribes. That rise is literal, historical evidence of God&#8217;s ability to elevate (<a href="/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16</a>; <a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; With elevation comes accountability. &#8220;From everyone who has been given much, much will be required&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>). Saul&#8217;s authority demanded obedience to God&#8217;s specific instructions about Amalek.<p>&#8226; Israel&#8217;s king was to model covenant faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-20</a>). Failure meant national consequences, as seen in the troops&#8217; plundering despite God&#8217;s ban (<a href="/1_samuel/15-19.htm">1 Samuel 15:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Civil leaders today still derive authority from God (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>). Saul&#8217;s story warns that position without obedience invites judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The LORD anointed you king over Israel</b><p>&#8226; Samuel&#8217;s earlier act&#8212;&#8220;Then Samuel took a flask of oil, poured it on Saul&#8217;s head&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>)&#8212;was a tangible sign that Saul belonged to God&#8217;s service. The anointing made his kingship sacred, not merely political.<p>&#8226; Anointing confers power but also binds the anointed to God&#8217;s word. David would later refuse to harm Saul because he was &#8220;the LORD&#8217;s anointed&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>).<p>&#8226; By ignoring God&#8217;s command to destroy Amalek, Saul treated the anointing lightly. Obedience, not ritual, validates calling (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers share an anointing in Christ (<a href="/1_john/2-20.htm">1 John 2:20</a>). Our consecration likewise calls for wholehearted obedience, not selective hearing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Samuel&#8217;s words trace Saul&#8217;s journey from humble obscurity to divinely anointed kingship. God raised a man who once felt &#8220;small&#8221; to lead all Israel, yet that very elevation required unwavering obedience. Forgetting humble beginnings and despising the sacred anointing led Saul into disobedience and eventual rejection. The verse stands as a literal, historical reminder that God exalts the humble, entrusts them with responsibility, and expects faithful submission to His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">When thou wast little in thine own sight.</span>--Kimchi's rendering of the Hebrew here is singular: "Though thou seemest to thyself too little and weak to curb the people, yet wast thou the head, and shouldest have done thy duty;" but this, as Lange observes, would imply that Samuel had <span class= "ital">accepted </span>Saul's excuse that it was the people's will to reserve the choicest spoil. The prophet's words, however, were simply to remind Saul that the Lord, whose clearly expressed will he had disregarded, had raised him in bygone days from a comparatively humble station to the proud position he was then occupying as chief of Israel. The old counsellor reminds the king that there had been a time when he judged himself unequal to this great work to which his God summoned him; but now, how strange the contrast! Flushed with success, he was trusting alone in his unaided strength, and openly disobeying the Divine commands.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When</span> - rather, Though - <span class="cmt_word">thou wast little in thine own sight.</span> Before his elevation to the royal dignity Saul had deemed himself altogether unequal to so heavy a task (<a href="/1_samuel/9-21.htm">1 Samuel 9:21</a>);
