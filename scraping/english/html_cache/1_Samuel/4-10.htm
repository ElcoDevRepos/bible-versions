Known for their military prowess and iron weaponry, they were a constant threat to Israel during the time of the Judges and early monarchy. This battle is part of a series of conflicts between Israel and the Philistines, highlighting the ongoing struggle for dominance in the region.<p><b>and Israel was defeated</b><br>This defeat is significant as it reflects Israel's spiritual state. The Israelites had brought the Ark of the Covenant into battle, believing it would ensure victory. However, their defeat underscores the futility of relying on religious symbols without true faith and obedience to God. This event marks a turning point, leading to a period of reflection and eventual repentance.<p><b>and each man fled to his tent</b><br>The phrase indicates a complete rout, with soldiers abandoning the battlefield in disarray. In ancient warfare, retreating to one's tent symbolized a return to personal safety and a withdrawal from collective responsibility. This reflects the demoralization and lack of unity among the Israelites, contrasting with the communal strength they were meant to embody.<p><b>The slaughter was very great</b><br>The magnitude of the defeat is emphasized by the term "very great," indicating not just a military loss but a devastating blow to the nation's morale and manpower. This serves as a divine judgment against Israel for their disobedience and misplaced trust in the Ark as a talisman rather than in God Himself.<p><b>thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell</b><br>The loss of thirty thousand soldiers is a staggering number, illustrating the severity of the defeat. This figure highlights the scale of the disaster and the vulnerability of Israel without divine favor. It also serves as a historical record of the consequences of Israel's spiritual decline, paralleling other biblical instances where disobedience led to national calamity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A significant enemy of Israel during the time of the Judges and early monarchy.

Earlier warnings had come through Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-11.htm">1 Samuel 3:11&#8211;14</a>), but Israel had ignored God&#8217;s Word and tried to use the ark as a good-luck charm (<a href="/1_samuel/4-3.htm">1 Samuel 4:3&#8211;4</a>). Scripture consistently shows that when people trust symbols instead of the Lord Himself, defeat follows (<a href="/numbers/14-40.htm">Numbers 14:40&#8211;45</a>; <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>). The Philistines&#8217; bold engagement confirms that God had removed His protective hand at this moment, exactly as He had said He would (<a href="/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Israel was defeated</b><p>The defeat is literal, total, and shame-filled. God&#8217;s covenant people, who had once watched Jericho&#8217;s walls fall (<a href="/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20</a>), now taste humiliation because of unrepentant sin. <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a> had warned, &#8220;The LORD will cause you to be defeated before your enemies.&#8221; The outcome in <a href="/1_samuel/4-10.htm">1 Samuel 4:10</a> is the fulfillment of that covenant warning. Victory is never automatic; it is tied to obedience and wholehearted faith (<a href="/1_john/5-4.htm">1 John 5:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and each man fled to his tent</b><p>The phrase paints a picture of personal panic. Instead of orderly retreat, every soldier thinks only of his own survival, echoing the fearful scattering in <a href="/judges/7-21.htm">Judges 7:21&#8211;22</a> and <a href="/1_kings/22-36.htm">1 Kings 22:36</a>. It also recalls <a href="/joshua/7-5.htm">Joshua 7:5</a>, after Achan&#8217;s sin, when &#8220;the hearts of the people melted.&#8221; Flight to one&#8217;s tent signals utter collapse of morale and leadership (compare <a href="/isaiah/22-3.htm">Isaiah 22:3</a>). The ark&#8217;s presence could not compensate for hearts estranged from God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The slaughter was very great</b><p>Scripture doesn&#8217;t exaggerate; the loss was staggering. &#8220;Very great&#8221; parallels phrases in <a href="/2_chronicles/28-5.htm">2 Chronicles 28:5-6</a> and <a href="/lamentations/2-5.htm">Lamentations 2:5</a> describing national calamity. Such language communicates divine judgment rather than mere military misfortune. God had told Eli that judgment on his house would make &#8220;ears tingle&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/3-11.htm">1 Samuel 3:11</a>); now the entire nation feels the weight of that prophetic word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell</b><p>The number is recorded as historical fact. Large-scale losses are also listed in <a href="/numbers/25-9.htm">Numbers 25:9</a> (24,000) and <a href="/2_samuel/24-15.htm">2 Samuel 24:15</a> (70,000), reminding readers that sin carries serious, measurable consequences. Earlier, 4,000 had died (<a href="/1_samuel/4-2.htm">1 Samuel 4:2</a>); the escalation to 30,000 shows that refusing to repent leads to deeper disaster (<a href="/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>). This figure also highlights God&#8217;s righteous standard: one man&#8217;s or one nation&#8217;s rebellion does not nullify His holiness (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/4-10.htm">1 Samuel 4:10</a> records a literal, devastating defeat brought on by Israel&#8217;s misplaced trust and unresolved sin.

As long as they clave to the invisible Preserver, and served Him with their whole heart and soul, and kept themselves pure from the pollution of the idol nations around them, so long was He in their midst, so long would they be invincible; but if, as now, they chose to revel in the impure joys, and to delight themselves in the selfish, shameless lives of the idolatrous world around them, and only carried the Ark on their shoulders, with no memory of Him whom the mercy-seat and the overshadowing cherubim of that Ark symbolised, in their hearts, then--to use the solemn words of the hymn of Asaph--"Then God was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel, and forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, and delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand." (See <a href="/context/psalms/78-59.htm" title="When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:">Psalm 78:59-61</a>, where the crushing defeat of Aphek and the signal victory of the Philistines is recounted in detail.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Israel fled every man into</span> - better <span class="accented">to</span> - <span class="cmt_word">his tent.</span> Their camp stood them this time in no stead.
