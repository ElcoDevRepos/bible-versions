This act signifies Saul's special status and foreshadows his anointing as king. The cook's role indicates the organized nature of sacrificial meals, reflecting the Levitical laws concerning offerings. The leg's presentation to Saul symbolizes God's provision and favor, aligning with the cultural practice of honoring guests with the best portions.<p><b>Then Samuel said, &#8220;Here is what was kept back.</b><br>Samuel's statement highlights the intentionality behind the meal's preparation. The portion was reserved specifically for Saul, indicating divine orchestration. This act of setting aside a portion parallels God's sovereign choice of Saul as king, emphasizing predestination and divine election. The phrase suggests that God had a plan for Saul even before he was aware of it, reflecting the biblical theme of God's foreknowledge and preparation.<p><b>It was set apart for you.</b><br>The concept of being "set apart" is significant in biblical theology, often associated with holiness and divine purpose. Saul's portion being set apart mirrors his calling to be king, a role that required consecration and dedication to God's service. This phrase connects to the broader biblical narrative of God setting apart individuals for specific purposes, such as the Levites for priestly duties or Israel as a chosen nation.<p><b>Eat, for it has been kept for you for this occasion,</b><br>The invitation to eat signifies acceptance and fellowship, a common theme in biblical hospitality. The meal marks a pivotal moment in Saul's life, symbolizing his transition from an ordinary man to the anointed king of Israel. The phrase "for this occasion" underscores the divine timing and purpose, suggesting that God orchestrates events according to His plan. This aligns with the biblical understanding of kairos, a moment of divine opportunity.<p><b>from the time I said, &#8216;I have invited the people.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>Samuel's reference to inviting the people indicates a communal aspect to Saul's anointing. It suggests that Saul's kingship is not only a personal calling but also a public office with responsibilities to the nation. The gathering of people for the meal reflects the communal nature of Israelite society and the importance of public recognition in leadership roles. This phrase also hints at the prophetic role of Samuel, who acts as God's mouthpiece in orchestrating Saul's rise to kingship.<p><b>So Saul dined with Samuel that day.</b><br>The act of dining together signifies a covenantal relationship and mutual respect. In biblical times, sharing a meal was a sign of peace and alliance. Saul dining with Samuel indicates his acceptance into the prophetic and leadership community of Israel. This moment foreshadows the future collaboration between prophets and kings in Israel's history. The meal serves as a tangible sign of God's blessing and the beginning of Saul's journey as Israel's first king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, chosen by God through the prophet Samuel.

Although the matter is not one of great moment, yet it is important and deeply interesting to notice the little details that the inspired historian has thought it right to preserve in connection with this whole transaction. There was, no doubt, a very early and authentic tradition of the circumstance of this anointing of the first king, which was, of course, often rehearsed in the sacred assemblies of Israel. "Samuel's name is not given in the Hebrew, and though inserted by the LXX. and Vulg., it is so only by a manifest error. The Syriac and Chaldee, like the Hebrew, make <span class= "ital">the cook </span>the speaker. The right translation is, And the cook lifted up the shoulder, with that which was upon it, and set it before Saul, and said, Behold that which hath been reserved is set (a participle, and not the imperative) before thee; eat, for it hath been kept for thee unto the appointed time, of which he (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>Samuel) spake, saying, I have invited the people. The word translated in the Authorised Version, "since I said," is one which means <span class= "ital">saying, </span>and nothing else; and as what goes before contains no verb to which <span class= "ital">saying </span>can refer, it is plain that there is an ellipse. But if the cook be the speaker, the meaning is plain, as follows:--When, on the previous day, the revelation was made to Samuel that Israel's future king would present himself on the morrow, the prophet at once made preparations to receive him with due solemnity, and for this purpose arranged a sacrifice, and invited thirty of the chief citizens of Ramah to assemble at the high place, and sit at the banquet with him. And then it was, when telling the cook of his invitation, that he gave orders that the portion of honour should be carefully reserved, to be set at the fitting time before the stranger. The chat of the cook is entirely after the manner of ancient times, and would show Saul how completely his coming had been foreseen and provided for."--Dean Payne Smith, in <span class= "ital">Pulpit Comm.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Samuel said.</span> Samuel's name is not given in the Hebrew, and though inserted by the Septuagint and Vulgate, it is so only by a manifest error.
