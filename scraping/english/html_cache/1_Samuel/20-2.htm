This phrase indicates Jonathan's disbelief and his desire to reassure David. Jonathan's character is marked by faithfulness and integrity, qualities that are evident in his covenant with David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>). His response also highlights the close relationship between Jonathan and David, which is a significant theme throughout the narrative.<p><b>&#8220;You will not die.&#8221;</b><br>Jonathan's assurance to David is a declaration of protection and trust. This statement is significant in the context of the covenant between Jonathan and David, where Jonathan pledged to support David against any threat, even from his own father, Saul. This promise foreshadows the eventual protection and deliverance David experiences throughout his life, aligning with God's overarching plan for David to become king.<p><b>Indeed, my father does nothing, great or small, without telling me.</b><br>Jonathan's assertion about his father's transparency with him underscores the close relationship he believed he had with Saul. This reflects the cultural expectation of familial loyalty and communication within royal households. However, it also reveals Jonathan's potential naivety or Saul's increasing unpredictability, as Saul's intentions towards David were becoming more hostile and secretive.<p><b>So why would he hide this matter from me?</b><br>Jonathan's rhetorical question suggests his surprise and confusion at the possibility of Saul concealing his plans. This reflects the tension between Jonathan's loyalty to his father and his friendship with David. It also highlights the theme of hidden intentions and the complexity of human relationships, which is prevalent throughout the narrative of 1 Samuel.<p><b>This cannot be true!&#8221;</b><br>Jonathan's emphatic denial indicates his struggle to reconcile his understanding of his father with the reality of Saul's actions. This phrase captures the internal conflict Jonathan faces as he navigates his dual loyalties. It also foreshadows the eventual realization and acceptance of Saul's intentions, which leads to Jonathan's continued support for David, aligning with God's plan for David's kingship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul and a close friend of David.

He further assures David that Saul would do nothing without telling him; literally, without uncovering his ear, without telling it him privately (see on 1 Samuel 9:15). The phrase is used again in ver. 12. For <span class="cmt_word">will do nothing</span> the written text reads "has done for himself," which the Kri properly corrects. The rashness of Saul's temper, and his frank talk about killing David recorded in <a href="/1_samuel/19-1.htm">1 Samuel 19:1</a>, confirm Jonathan's statement about the openness of his father's ways, and he therefore assures David that he may take his place in safety. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/20-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Far from it!&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;l&#238;&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection &#124;
