The use of "three arrows" is significant as it serves as a covert signal. In ancient warfare and hunting, arrows were common tools, and their use here symbolizes precision and intent. The number three often represents completeness or divine perfection in the Bible, seen in the Trinity and other scriptural instances.<p><b>to the side of it</b><br>Jonathan's plan involves shooting arrows to the side of a specific location, which is a prearranged signal for David. This indicates the need for secrecy and caution due to Saul's hostility. The phrase suggests a deliberate action to avoid direct confrontation, reflecting the wisdom and prudence required in dangerous situations. It also highlights the trust and understanding between Jonathan and David.<p><b>as if I were aiming at a target</b><br>This phrase implies a practice or skill in archery, a valued ability in ancient Israelite society. The act of aiming at a target suggests intentionality and focus, qualities that Jonathan exhibits in his loyalty to David. The metaphor of aiming at a target can also be seen as a reflection of God's guidance and purpose, as believers are called to aim their lives towards God's will, much like an archer aims at a target.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul and a close friend of David.

He is not guessing; he has already settled in his heart what he will do to help David discern Saul&#8217;s mindset. Scripture often portrays decisive action as evidence of faith and loyalty (<a href="/james/2-18.htm">James 2:18</a>; <a href="/ruth/1-16.htm">Ruth 1:16-17</a>). By saying &#8220;I will shoot,&#8221; Jonathan places himself in the role of faithful messenger, mirroring earlier moments where God&#8217;s servants carried out clear instructions without hesitation (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>three arrows</b><p>The number three frequently marks completeness in Scripture (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-12.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>). Jonathan&#8217;s choice of three arrows provides an unmistakable, complete sign to David. One arrow could be accidental; three arrows confirm intentionality. Likewise, Gideon asked for multiple signs to remove doubt (<a href="/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36-40</a>). Jonathan&#8217;s triple-arrow plan would erase any uncertainty for David about the message he must heed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the side of it</b><p>Jonathan chooses a location &#8220;to the side&#8221; of the stone Ezel (<a href="/1_samuel/20-19.htm">1 Samuel 20:19</a>). This keeps David hidden yet within earshot. In other narratives God positions His people in nearby but safe places while He reveals truth&#8212;Moses behind the rock (<a href="/exodus/33-21.htm">Exodus 33:21-22</a>) or Elijah in the cave (<a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11-13</a>). Jonathan honors David&#8217;s safety, proving love that &#8220;protects&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-7.htm">1 Corinthians 13:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as if I were aiming at a target</b><p>Jonathan will make the act look like ordinary target practice, masking the secret communication from any onlookers. Similar moments of discreet strategy appear when Rahab hides the spies under flax (<a href="/joshua/2-6.htm">Joshua 2:6</a>) or when Jesus tells His brothers He is not yet going up to the feast, then goes in secret (<a href="/john/7-8.htm">John 7:8-10</a>). The disguise of normal activity shields God&#8217;s servants until His timing unfolds.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jonathan&#8217;s simple sentence outlines a careful, faith-filled plan: decisive action, complete confirmation, protective positioning, and strategic secrecy. The three arrows ensure David knows exactly when to flee, preserving the lineage through which God&#8217;s promises will flow (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>). This verse reminds believers today that loyal friendship and obedience can employ practical, even covert means while remaining wholly aligned with God&#8217;s righteous purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">I will shoot three arrows.</span>--The two friends agree on a sign. It was a very simple one, and seems to speak of very early primitive times. Jonathan slightly varies from his original purpose. In <a href="/1_samuel/20-12.htm" title="And Jonathan said to David, O LORD God of Israel, when I have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then send not to you, and show it you;">1Samuel 20:12</a> it seems as though he meant to have sent a special messenger had the news been good, but now the arrangement is that in either event he should come himself out from the city into the solitary valley where it was agreed David should remain in hiding by the stone "Ezel." Dean Payne Smith rather strangely conceives that the arrows of the "sign" were to be aimed at the stone Ezel, but the description points to the "mark" as situated on the side of "Ezel," in or behind which David was to be concealed.<p>The prince agreed that after the feast he would leave the city, as though about to practise shooting at a mark, and that he would bring with him a servant--probably-one of his young armour-bearers--when, at the spot agreed upon in the neighbourhood of David's place of concealment near Ezel, he would post his servant in his place as marker, and then would shoot. After shooting, he would call out to his attendant, "the arrows are on this side of thee" (that is, between the mark and Jonathan himself), then David would know all was well; but if he cried "the arrows are beyond thee," that is, on the further side of the mark, David would understand that all was over, and that he must fly. Jonathan evidently took these precautions not knowing whether or no he would be accompanied by friends of his father from the city, in which case the "sign" agreed upon would be sufficient to tell David what had happened at the feast. As it turned out, Jonathan was able to escape observation, and to go alone with his servant to the place of meeting. He used the sign to attract his friend's attention, and then followed the last sorrowful parting, told in <a href="/context/1_samuel/20-41.htm" title="And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, until David exceeded.">1Samuel 20:41-42</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-23.</span> - The two friends now agree upon the sign. Jonathan was to shoot three arrows at this stone, Ezel, as his mark, and was then to send his servant to gather them up. When he bad gone some distance Jonathan was to shout to him, loud enough for David to hear. If Jonathan said that the arrows were on that side the mark, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> between it and Jonathan, David was to come forth boldly, as all was well. But if Jonathan said that the arrows were further on, then David must understand that he was to seek safety in flight. For <span class="cmt_word">there is peace to thee, and no hurt,</span> the Hebrew has "there is peace to thee, and it is nothing," a simpler and more idiomatic rendering. As touching the matter, etc. Rather, "As for the word that we have spoken, I and thou, behold, Jehovah is between me and thee forever." The <span class="accented">word</span> was the bond and covenant by which they had pledged their truth to one another. Though separated, their love was to continue, and Jehovah was to be their eternal centre of union, and the witness to their covenant. <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/20-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1429;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
