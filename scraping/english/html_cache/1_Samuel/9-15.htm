The timing is significant as it shows God's providence in the unfolding of Israel's monarchy. Saul's arrival was not coincidental but part of a divine plan. This reflects the biblical theme that God is sovereign over time and events, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/3.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>, which speaks of a time for every purpose under heaven.<p><b>the LORD had revealed to Samuel</b><br>The phrase highlights the role of divine revelation in guiding the prophet Samuel. Samuel, as a prophet, was the intermediary between God and the people of Israel. This revelation underscores the importance of prophetic insight in Israel's history, as seen in <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, which states that God does nothing without revealing His plan to His servants the prophets.
