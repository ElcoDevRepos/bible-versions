This act symbolizes the need for atonement and the importance of offering something valuable to God. The use of a suckling lamb also prefigures Christ, who is referred to as the "Lamb of God" in <a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>, symbolizing ultimate sacrifice and purity.<p><b>and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD.</b><br>The whole burnt offering was a common practice in ancient Israel, signifying complete dedication and surrender to God. By offering the entire animal, Samuel demonstrates total commitment and seeks to atone for the sins of the people. This act of worship and sacrifice is a precursor to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus, who offered Himself wholly for the sins of humanity, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>.<p><b>He cried out to the LORD on behalf of Israel,</b><br>Samuel's intercession for Israel highlights his role as a mediator between God and the people, similar to Moses. This act of crying out signifies earnest prayer and supplication, reflecting the deep spiritual need of the nation. It underscores the importance of intercessory prayer, a theme echoed in the New Testament where believers are encouraged to pray for one another (<a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>).<p><b>and the LORD answered him.</b><br>God's response to Samuel's prayer demonstrates His faithfulness and willingness to forgive and restore His people when they turn back to Him. This divine response is a testament to the power of sincere prayer and repentance. It also foreshadows the New Covenant promise that God hears and answers the prayers of His people, as affirmed in 1 <a href="/john/5-14.htm">John 5:14-15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel is a pivotal figure in the transition from the period of the judges to the establishment of the monarchy.
