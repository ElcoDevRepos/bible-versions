Discernment is a valued trait in biblical literature, often associated with the fear of the Lord (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). Abigail's discernment is seen as a divine gift, enabling her to act wisely and prevent bloodshed. Her actions reflect the biblical principle that wisdom and understanding are more valuable than physical strength or weapons (<a href="/proverbs/3-13.htm">Proverbs 3:13-18</a>).<p><b>and blessed are you</b><br>David's blessing upon Abigail highlights her role as a peacemaker. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, women often played crucial roles in mediating conflicts, though they were typically not in positions of power. Abigail's intervention is reminiscent of other biblical figures who acted as intercessors, such as Esther and Deborah. Her actions prefigure the New Testament teaching that peacemakers are blessed (<a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>).<p><b>because today you kept me from bloodshed</b><br>David acknowledges that Abigail's intervention prevented him from committing an act of bloodshed, which would have been contrary to God's law. The Torah explicitly prohibits murder (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>), and David's recognition of this shows his desire to remain obedient to God's commandments. This incident foreshadows David's later restraint in not killing King Saul, despite having the opportunity (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>).<p><b>and from avenging myself by my own hand</b><br>The concept of vengeance is addressed throughout Scripture, with God reserving the right to avenge (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>; <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>). David's acknowledgment that Abigail kept him from personal vengeance aligns with the biblical principle of leaving justice to God. This restraint is a type of Christ, who, when reviled, did not retaliate but entrusted Himself to God who judges justly (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>). Abigail's intervention serves as a reminder of the importance of trusting God's justice rather than taking matters into one's own hands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, who is on the run from King Saul.

Her blessed insight, blessed character, and peacemaking courage redirect the future king from personal vengeance back to trusting God&#8217;s justice. The verse reminds us that God often uses wise, courageous believers to keep His people from sin, steering them instead toward obedience, self-control, and reliance on the Lord to right every wrong.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">And blessed be thy advice.</span>--David, with his usual frank generosity, allows he has been in the wrong in giving way to wild, ungovernable passion, and openly confesses that if Abigail had not met him and reasoned with him, he would have carried out his purpose, and stained his fair fame for ever with a terrible crime. His dark purpose was to cut off, root and branch, the whole house of Nabal, amongst others the woman standing before him there. It is noticeable how, in this age of deeper religion and of higher culture, the old superstitious reverence for vows, taken in moments of frenzy or of extreme excitement, had given place to a calmer and more reasonable spirit. Never had a more solemn vow been taken than David's that morning, when he took a solemn oath that he would murder the whole house of Nabal; and yet, before the sun set he is convinced of the wickedness of his purpose, and sooner than carry it out he deliberately breaks the oath. Some years before, Saul--had he not been forcibly hindered by the people--would, by the murder of his son, the hero-prince Jonathan, have fulfilled the rash oath which he swore at the battle of Michmash (<a href="/1_samuel/14-24.htm" title="And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eats any food until evening, that I may be avenged on my enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.">1Samuel 14:24</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-45.htm" title="And the people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has worked this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has worked with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.">1Samuel 14:45</a>); and Jephthah, the judge of Israel, we know, in the person of his loved daughter, ruthlessly carried out his wild, useless oath (<a href="/judges/11-34.htm" title="And Jephthah came to Mizpeh to his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.">Judges 11:34</a>; <a href="/judges/11-40.htm" title="That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.">Judges 11:40</a>).<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/25-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Blessed [is]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;r&#363;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
