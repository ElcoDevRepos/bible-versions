Saul, the first king of Israel, is addressing David, who has gained favor in his eyes after defeating Goliath. This interaction is set against the backdrop of Saul's growing jealousy and fear of David's rising popularity and success. Saul's words are outwardly generous, but they conceal his ulterior motives.<p><b>&#8220;Here is my older daughter Merab.</b><br>Merab, Saul's eldest daughter, is mentioned here as part of Saul's plan. In ancient Israel, marriages were often used to form alliances and secure political power. Offering Merab to David could be seen as an honor, but it also serves Saul's strategic purposes. The mention of Merab highlights the cultural practice of arranged marriages and the importance of family alliances in maintaining power.<p><b>I will give her to you in marriage.</b><br>This offer of marriage is significant because it fulfills a promise Saul made earlier to the man who would defeat Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-25.htm">1 Samuel 17:25</a>). However, Saul's intentions are not purely to reward David; he uses this offer as a means to entrap him. The marriage proposal is a political maneuver, reflecting the complex dynamics of Saul's court and his attempts to control David.<p><b>Only be valiant for me and fight the LORD&#8217;s battles.&#8221;</b><br>Saul's request for David to be valiant and fight the LORD's battles is a manipulation of David's loyalty and faith. Saul appeals to David's sense of duty and his reputation as a warrior. The phrase "the LORD's battles" suggests a divine mandate, aligning Saul's desires with God's will. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israel's monarchy, where kings were expected to lead in accordance with God's commands.<p><b>But Saul was thinking,</b><br>This insight into Saul's thoughts reveals his duplicity. While he speaks of honor and duty, his internal motives are far from noble. This contrast between Saul's words and thoughts underscores the theme of deception and the corrupting influence of power. It also highlights the biblical principle that God sees beyond outward appearances to the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><b>&#8220;I need not raise my hand against him;</b><br>Saul's internal monologue reveals his desire to eliminate David without direct involvement. By not raising his own hand against David, Saul seeks to maintain a facade of righteousness while orchestrating David's downfall. This reflects the moral decline of Saul's character and his reliance on cunning rather than faithfulness to God.<p><b>let the hand of the Philistines be against him.&#8221;</b><br>Saul's plan is to use the Philistines, Israel's perennial enemies, as instruments of David's destruction. This reflects the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Philistines, a central theme in the narrative of 1 Samuel. Saul's reliance on external enemies to do his bidding illustrates his desperation and lack of trust in God's protection.

The king had said he would give his daughter in marriage to the hero who should slay the Philistine giant champion. For one cause or other he had declined, or at least postponed, the carrying out of his pledge; and the dark thought crossed his mind, Could he not endanger the hated life, while seeming to wish to keep the old promise? He speaks of the Philistine war as the Lord's battles. This was a feeling which inspired every patriotic Israelite. "He was," when fighting with the idolatrous nations, "warring for the Lord"--so David felt when he spoke of the Philistine giant as having defied the ranks of the living God, and alluded to the battle as the Lord's (<a href="/1_samuel/17-26.htm" title="And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?">1Samuel 17:26</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm" title="And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saves not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will give you into our hands.">1Samuel 17:47</a>). The same idea is expressed in the title of that most ancient collection of songs which has not been preserved to us--"Book of the Wars of the Lord" (<a href="/numbers/21-14.htm" title="Why it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,">Numbers 21:14</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 17, 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold my elder daughter Merab.</span> Saul had promised that he would give his daughter in marriage to whosoever should slay the giant (<a href="/1_samuel/17-25.htm">1 Samuel 17:25</a>); and not only was there in this the honour of a close alliance with the royal house, but, as it was usual to give large presents to the father in return for the daughter's hand, the gift had also a substantial value. After long delay Saul now refers to this promise, not so much with the intention of fulfilling it, as of leading David on to enterprises which might cost him his life. The marriage may have been deferred at first on account of David's youth; the subject is now revived, but with evil intentions. <span class="cmt_word">My eider daughter</span> is literally "my daughter, the great one," while Michal is "the little one," a way of speaking used only where there are but two daughters. <span class="cmt_word">Be thou valiant,</span> etc. This exhortation would be natural under the circumstances; but Saul hoped that David, in order to secure so great a prize, would be encouraged to undertake rash adventures. <span class="cmt_word">For Saul said.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> in himself; his purpose was to urge David to perpetual fighting, that so in some rash undertaking he might be slam. Thus Saul s malice grows, and though not prepared as yet to put David to death himself, he would have felt relief if he had died by the fortune of war. David answers modestly and discreetly that he is not worthy of so great an honour. We are not to suppose that he discerned Saul's treachery, which only came-to light afterwards. <span class="cmt_word">What is my life,</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> my condition, - <span class="cmt_word">or my father's family?</span> The <span class="accented">or</span> is not in the Hebrew, and the meaning is, What is my condition, even my father's family? etc. David's condition or rank in life was settled by the rank which his father held. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/18-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
