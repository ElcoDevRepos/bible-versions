Normally, cows would not leave their calves or follow a specific path without guidance. Beth-shemesh, a Levitical city in the territory of Judah, was an appropriate destination for the Ark of the Covenant, as it was a city of priests who could properly handle the Ark. This event underscores God's sovereignty and control over creation, as seen in other biblical instances where animals act under divine direction (e.g., Balaam's donkey in <a href="/numbers/22-21.htm">Numbers 22:21-33</a>).<p><b>staying on that one highway and lowing as they went</b><br>The cows' consistent lowing indicates their natural distress at being separated from their calves, yet they continue on the path set before them. This highlights the miraculous nature of their journey, as they do not deviate despite their instincts. The highway refers to a well-traveled road, suggesting that the path to Beth-shemesh was a known route, facilitating the return of the Ark to Israelite territory. This obedience to God's will, despite natural inclinations, can be seen as a parallel to the call for believers to follow God's path even when it is difficult.<p><b>never straying to the right or to the left</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the miraculous guidance of the cows, as they maintain a straight course without deviation. Biblically, the concept of not turning to the right or left is often associated with obedience to God's commands (<a href="/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32</a>, <a href="/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>). The cows' unwavering path serves as a metaphor for faithfulness and obedience, illustrating how God's purposes are accomplished without deviation.<p><b>The rulers of the Philistines followed behind them to the border of Beth-shemesh</b><br>The presence of the Philistine rulers indicates their desire to witness the outcome of their test to see if the calamities they experienced were indeed caused by the God of Israel. Their following the cows to the border of Beth-shemesh shows their acknowledgment of the power of the God of Israel, as they sought confirmation of His involvement. This event marks a moment of recognition of God's sovereignty by the Philistines, similar to other instances where foreign nations acknowledge the God of Israel (e.g., Nebuchadnezzar in <a href="/daniel/4-34.htm">Daniel 4:34-37</a>). The border of Beth-shemesh represents the transition from Philistine control back to Israelite territory, symbolizing the restoration of God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/cows.htm">Cows</a></b><br>Two milk cows were used by the Philistines to carry the Ark of the Covenant back to Israel.
