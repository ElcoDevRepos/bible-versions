Saul, the current king, acknowledges a divine revelation or understanding. This moment is significant as it marks a turning point in Saul's perception of David, moving from seeing him as a threat to recognizing his future role. This acknowledgment can be seen as a fulfillment of God's earlier anointing of David through the prophet Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>).<p><b>that you will be king</b><br>Saul's admission that David will be king is a prophetic acknowledgment of God's will. Despite Saul's previous attempts to kill David, he now concedes to the divine plan. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and the idea that His purposes will prevail despite human opposition. It also connects to the Davidic Covenant, where God promises David an everlasting dynasty (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>).<p><b>and that the kingdom of Israel</b><br>The reference to the "kingdom of Israel" highlights the united monarchy under Saul, which David will inherit and expand. This period is crucial in Israel's history as it transitions from a loose confederation of tribes to a centralized kingdom. David's reign will bring about significant political and religious developments, including the establishment of Jerusalem as the capital.<p><b>will be established in your hands</b><br>The phrase "established in your hands" signifies the stability and security that David's leadership will bring to Israel. It implies divine endorsement and empowerment, as seen in David's military successes and his role in unifying the nation. This stability is a precursor to the peace and prosperity experienced during Solomon's reign. David's kingship is also a type of Christ, foreshadowing Jesus' eternal reign as the King of Kings, bringing ultimate peace and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Anointed by God to be the future king of Israel, David is a central figure in this passage.

Confronted with such undeserved kindness, Saul&#8217;s doubts crumble, and he must admit what God has been declaring all along (<a href="/1_samuel/24-16.htm">1 Samuel 24:16&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; God sometimes places undeniable evidence before even hardened hearts. Just as Pharaoh&#8217;s magicians finally said, &#8220;This is the finger of God&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/8-19.htm">Exodus 8:19</a>), Saul can no longer deny God&#8217;s plan.<p>&#8226; This certainty fulfills earlier prophetic statements&#8212;Samuel had already told Saul, &#8220;The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to a neighbor of yours who is better than you&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that you will be king</b><p>&#8226; Saul explicitly recognizes David&#8217;s divine anointing first given in secret (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Others had acknowledged it&#8212;Jonathan (<a href="/1_samuel/23-17.htm">1 Samuel 23:17</a>) and Abigail (<a href="/1_samuel/25-30.htm">1 Samuel 25:30</a>)&#8212;but now the current monarch confesses it.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s choice overrides human lineage. Like Jacob over Esau (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>) or Judah over Reuben (<a href="/genesis/49-8.htm">Genesis 49:8&#8211;10</a>), David is elevated solely by grace, pointing forward to the ultimate King, Jesus, &#8220;the Son of David&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and that the kingdom of Israel</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Kingdom&#8221; here is national, not merely personal prestige. Saul foresees the whole covenant people flourishing under David, echoing God&#8217;s promise to Abraham of a nation through which blessing would flow (<a href="/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Later, Israel&#8217;s tribes will echo Saul&#8217;s words: &#8220;Indeed, you were the one who led Israel out and brought them in, and the LORD said to you, &#8216;You will shepherd My people Israel&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will be established</b><p>&#8226; The verb signals permanence. Saul&#8217;s shaky reign highlights the contrast&#8212;David&#8217;s throne will stand firm because God is its foundation (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; Stability comes only when leadership aligns with God&#8217;s covenant. Under David, worship is centralized, the Ark is honored (<a href="/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>), and justice becomes the norm (<a href="/2_samuel/8-15.htm">2 Samuel 8:15</a>).<p>&#8226; This foreshadows the unshakable kingdom we receive through Christ (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in your hands</b><p>&#8226; God often works &#8220;through the hands&#8221; of His servants: &#8220;The LORD gave victory to David wherever he went&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>). David&#8217;s military and administrative skills become instruments of divine purpose.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Hands&#8221; also imply stewardship. David will answer for how he wields this authority (<a href="/psalms/78-72.htm">Psalm 78:72</a>). His later failures underscore the need for a flawless ruler, fulfilled only in Jesus, &#8220;who will reign over the house of Jacob forever&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-33.htm">Luke 1:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Saul&#8217;s confession in <a href="/1_samuel/24-20.htm">1 Samuel 24:20</a> is more than an emotional outburst; it is a Spirit-endorsed acknowledgement that God&#8217;s plan is unstoppable. Despite Saul&#8217;s earlier resistance, he now concedes: David is God&#8217;s chosen king, Israel&#8217;s future rests on that choice, the kingdom will finally gain stability, and David will hold it as God&#8217;s steward. The verse invites us to trust the Lord&#8217;s sovereign appointments, recognize His faithfulness in establishing His kingdom, and look forward to its perfect fulfillment in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king.</span>--Clericus (in <span class= "ital">Lange</span>) says: "From this great magnanimity of David, Saul concluded that a man who was much superior in soul to kings could not but reign." This is a good comment, and doubtless expresses something of what was in Saul's mind on this occasion; but more must have been behind to have induced the king to make such a speech to David. Never had he for one moment forgotten his old friend's words--the words of Samuel, whom he too well knew was the prophet of the Most High--when he with all solemnity announced to him, as a message from heaven, that the Lord had rent the kingdom from him, and had given it to a neighbour that was better than he (<a href="/1_samuel/15-21.htm" title="But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal.">1Samuel 15:21</a>). Since that awful denunciation, the unhappy Saul was only too sensible that the blessing of Jehovah of Hosts no longer rested on his head, no longer blessed his going out and coming in, while the strange, bright career of the son of Jesse seemed to point him out as the neighbour on whom the choice of God had fallen. Rumours, too, of a mysterious anointing must have long ere this reached Saul; this, joined to the passionate advocacy of Jonathan, and the quiet, steady friendship of Samuel, no doubt convinced King Saul that in the son of Jesse he saw Israel's future monarch. Strong, therefore, in this conviction, and for the time humiliated and grieved at the sorry part he had been playing in this restless persecution of one destined to fill so great a position, the king positively entreats the outlaw to swear to him the strange promise contained in the next (21st) verse.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know well that thou shalt surely be king.</span> Jonathan had expressed a similar conviction (<a href="/1_samuel/23-17.htm">1 Samuel 23:17</a>), and probably there was a growing popular belief that David was the person in whom Samuel's prophetic words (<a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>) were to be fulfilled. Something may even have been known of the selection of David and his anointing at Bethlehem; not perhaps by the king, but in an indistinct way by the people. As for Saul himself, he must long have felt that God's blessing had departed from him, and, brooding perpetually over Samuel's words, it required but little discernment on his part to make him see that the kingdom which he had forfeited was to be bestowed upon one so worthy of it, and so manifestly protected and blessed by God. He therefore makes David swear that he will not <span class="cmt_word">cut off his seed after him</span> (see on 1 Samuel 20:15); and so they part. Saul returns to Gibeah, while <span class="cmt_word">David and his men gat them up unto the hold.</span> The word <span class="accented">gat up, mounted</span>, suggests that <span class="accented">the hold</span>, or fastness, was their previous haunt at Hachilah: They would go down to En-gedi, and the difficulty of obtaining food there for 600 men would be insurmountable, except for a very short period. On the other side of the desert they were in a pastoral country, and the large flock masters there probably from time to time sent them supplies. The position of David was thus improved for the present by Saul s reconciliation with him. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/24-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6258.htm">Strong's 6258: </a> </span><span class="str2">At this time</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I know</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1463;&#1428;&#1506;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3045.htm">Strong's 3045: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know</span><br /><br /><span class="word">for sure that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
