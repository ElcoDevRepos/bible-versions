Saul's jealousy and fear of David's rising popularity and God's favor have led him to plot against David. Jonathan, aware of his father's intentions, seeks to protect David. This reflects the broader biblical theme of familial conflict and loyalty, as seen in other relationships like Jacob and Esau or Joseph and his brothers. The phrase also underscores the moral dilemma Jonathan faces, torn between his loyalty to his father and his friendship with David.<p><b>then may the LORD punish me, and ever so severely</b><br>Jonathan invokes a solemn oath, calling upon the LORD to hold him accountable if he fails to warn David. This reflects the seriousness with which oaths were taken in ancient Israelite culture, where invoking God's name in an oath was binding and carried severe consequences if broken. The use of such an oath underscores Jonathan's commitment to truth and justice, aligning with the biblical principle that one's word should be trustworthy and reliable.<p><b>if I do not tell you and send you on your way in safety</b><br>Jonathan promises to inform David of any danger and ensure his safety. This commitment to protect David highlights the covenantal friendship between Jonathan and David, which is a central theme in their relationship. Their bond is reminiscent of other biblical covenants, such as those between God and Abraham or God and Israel, emphasizing loyalty, protection, and mutual support. Jonathan's actions foreshadow the protective role that Christ plays for believers, ensuring their spiritual safety.<p><b>May the LORD be with you, just as He has been with my father</b><br>Jonathan's blessing upon David acknowledges God's presence and favor, which had once been with Saul but is now with David. This reflects the biblical theme of divine favor and the transfer of God's blessing from Saul to David, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16</a> when David is anointed by Samuel. The phrase also serves as a prophetic acknowledgment of David's future as king, paralleling the way God's presence was with Saul during his early reign. Jonathan's words can be seen as a type of Christ, who embodies God's presence with His people, offering guidance and blessing.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul and a close friend of David.
