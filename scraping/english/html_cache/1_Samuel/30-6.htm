He had returned to Ziklag to find it burned and his family taken captive by the Amalekites. This moment of crisis highlights the vulnerability of even the most faithful servants of God. David's distress is not just personal but also communal, as he bears the weight of leadership and the responsibility for his men's families. This echoes the human experience of leaders throughout the Bible, such as Moses and Elijah, who also faced moments of deep distress.<p><b>because the people spoke of stoning him</b><br>The threat of stoning reflects the severity of the situation. In ancient Israel, stoning was a common form of capital punishment for serious offenses (<a href="/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/22-24.htm">Deuteronomy 22:24</a>). The people's anger and desperation are directed at David, whom they hold responsible for their loss. This mirrors other biblical instances where leaders are blamed for misfortunes, such as when the Israelites grumbled against Moses in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/17-4.htm">Exodus 17:4</a>).<p><b>because the soul of every man grieved for his sons and daughters</b><br>The grief of the men is profound, as they have lost their families to the Amalekite raid. This phrase underscores the deep emotional pain and sense of loss experienced by the people. The family unit was central to Israelite society, and the loss of children was particularly devastating. This grief is reminiscent of the sorrow expressed in other biblical narratives, such as the lamentations of Job (<a href="/job/1-18.htm">Job 1:18-19</a>) and the mourning of Rachel for her children (<a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>).<p><b>But David found strength in the LORD his God</b><br>In the midst of his distress, David turns to God for strength. This act of faith is a pivotal moment, demonstrating David's reliance on God rather than on his own abilities or the support of his men. It reflects a recurring biblical theme where true strength and encouragement are found in God alone (<a href="/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18:1-2</a>, <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>). David's response foreshadows the New Testament teaching of finding strength in Christ (<a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>). This reliance on God in times of trouble is a hallmark of David's life and leadership, setting an example for believers to seek divine strength in their own trials.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who at this time was leading his men while fleeing from King Saul.

Then David, we shall see, threw himself, with all his old perfect trustfulness, upon the mercy of his God.<p><span class= "bld">But David encouraged himself in the Lord his God.</span>--He encouraged himself in prayer, thus casting himself and his fortunes on the God who, years before, had chosen him to be "His anointed." It was this <span class= "ital">trust, </span>as we have before seen in his own case, in the case, too, of Jonathan, as it had been in old days with all the heroes of Israel--this perfect, childlike, implicit trust in the "Glorious Arm"--which had been the source of the marvellous success of the chosen people. When they forgot the invisible King, who for His own great purposes had chosen them, their fortunes at once declined; they fell to the level, and often below the level, of the surrounding nations. We have many conspicuous examples of this; for instance, in the lives of Samson and Saul, how, when with weeping and with mourning, they returned to their allegiance, and again leaned on the "Arm," success and victory returned to them. This is what happened now to David at Ziklag, while about the same time Saul, alone and distrustful, fought and fell on the bloody day of Gilboa. David, with the help of his God, on whose mercy he had thrown himself, obtained his brilliant success over Amalek, and restored his prestige not only among his own immediate followers, but through all the cities and villages of Southern Canaan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The soul of all the people was grieved.</span> Hebrew, "was bitter."
