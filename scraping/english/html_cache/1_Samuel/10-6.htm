This phrase indicates a sudden and powerful action by God, often associated with leadership or prophetic activity. The Spirit's rushing upon Saul is reminiscent of the Spirit's empowerment of the judges, such as Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-34.htm">Judges 6:34</a>) and Samson (<a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>), indicating God's direct intervention and support. This divine empowerment is crucial for Saul's new role as king, highlighting the necessity of God's presence for effective leadership.<p><b>and you will prophesy with them</b><br>Prophesying in this context involves speaking under divine inspiration, often in a group setting, as seen with the company of prophets Saul encounters. This act serves as a sign of Saul's new spiritual status and alignment with God's purposes. The ability to prophesy demonstrates a connection to God and His will, aligning Saul with the prophetic tradition in Israel, which includes figures like Samuel and Elijah. This moment foreshadows the New Testament outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>), where believers are similarly empowered to speak God's truth.<p><b>and you will be transformed into a different person</b><br>This transformation signifies a profound internal change, necessary for Saul to fulfill his role as king. It suggests a renewal of mind and spirit, aligning with the biblical theme of transformation seen in <a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>, where believers are called to be transformed by the renewing of their minds. Saul's transformation is a precursor to the New Covenant promise of a new heart and spirit found in <a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>. This change is essential for Saul to lead Israel according to God's will, though his later actions reveal the complexity of maintaining such transformation without continual reliance on God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel and a prophet who anointed Saul as the first king of Israel.
