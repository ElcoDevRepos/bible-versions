The utensils mentioned&#8212;pan, kettle, cauldron, and cooking pot&#8212;were common in ancient Israelite cooking and sacrificial practices. The use of these implements indicates the preparation of the sacrificial meat, which was meant to be boiled. This practice was part of the peace offerings, where portions were given to God, the priests, and the offerer. The priests' actions here deviate from the prescribed Levitical law, which specified that certain portions of the sacrifice were to be given to the priests, not taken at random. This reflects a corruption of the sacrificial system, highlighting the moral decline among the priesthood at the time.<p><b>And the priest would claim for himself whatever the meat fork brought up.</b><br>The priests' servants used a three-pronged fork to take meat from the pot, claiming whatever it brought up. This act symbolizes the greed and corruption of Eli's sons, Hophni and Phinehas, who served as priests. According to Levitical law, priests were entitled to specific portions of the sacrifices, such as the breast and the right thigh (<a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31-34</a>). However, the random taking of meat with a fork shows a blatant disregard for God's law and a self-serving attitude. This behavior is condemned in the narrative and serves as a backdrop for God's judgment against Eli's house. It also contrasts with the faithful service of Samuel, who would later restore integrity to the priesthood.<p><b>This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh.</b><br>Shiloh was the central place of worship in Israel before the establishment of the temple in Jerusalem. It housed the Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant, making it a significant religious center. The phrase indicates that the corrupt practices of the priests were widespread and affected all Israelites who came to offer sacrifices. This systemic abuse of power by the priests not only violated the sacrificial laws but also disrespected the worshippers and their offerings to God. The narrative sets the stage for the eventual downfall of Eli's house and the rise of Samuel as a righteous leader. The corruption at Shiloh serves as a warning against the misuse of religious authority and foreshadows the need for a faithful priesthood, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who perfectly mediates between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli's_sons.htm">Eli's Sons (Hophni and Phinehas)</a></b><br>The sons of Eli, the high priest, who were corrupt and abused their priestly duties.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/shiloh.htm">Shiloh</a></b><br>The religious center of Israel at the time, where the tabernacle was located and where the Israelites came to offer sacrifices.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel who came to Shiloh to worship and offer sacrifices to the Lord.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_practices.htm">Sacrificial Practices</a></b><br>The context of the verse involves the improper practices of the priests in taking portions of the sacrifices for themselves.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fork.htm">The Fork</a></b><br>A tool used by the priests to take meat from the sacrificial offerings, symbolizing their greed and disregard for God's laws.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_god's_instructions.htm">Respect for God's Instructions</a></b><br>God's instructions regarding worship and offerings are to be followed with reverence and obedience.

According to <a href="/leviticus/7-30.htm">Leviticus 7:30-35</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/18-3.htm">Deuteronomy 18:3</a>, the priest&#8217;s rightful portion was predetermined by the Lord&#8212;specific cuts, not a random grab. Scripture&#8217;s precision underscores that God cares about details of worship (cf. <a href="/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>).<p>-Placing the fork into the vessel signals the moment of taking what belongs to God, a moment that was meant to be orderly and reverent.<p>-By recording the action step-by-step, the text stresses the contrast between divine instruction and human corruption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Plunge it into the pan or kettle or cauldron or cooking pot</b><p>The variety of cookware (&#8220;pan &#8230; kettle &#8230; cauldron &#8230; cooking pot,&#8221;) reminds us that Israelites brought many kinds of fellowship offerings (<a href="/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11-15</a>). Whatever vessel held the meat, a priest was to regard it as holy, since it symbolized covenant fellowship (<a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6-7</a>).<p>-Each utensil represents a family&#8217;s act of worship; mishandling any of them dishonors every offerer.<p>-The repetition of cookware words drives home that the abuse was systemic, not an isolated lapse (compare <a href="/ezekiel/22-26.htm">Ezekiel 22:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the priest would claim for himself whatever the meat fork brought up</b><p>Instead of accepting the breast and right thigh assigned by law, Eli&#8217;s sons grabbed &#8220;whatever&#8221; the fork snagged. The random haul exposed their greed (<a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>) and their contempt for the Lord (<a href="/1_samuel/2-17.htm">1 Samuel 2:17</a>).<p>-The phrase &#8220;for himself&#8221; spotlights self-centeredness over God-centered service (<a href="/philippians/2-21.htm">Philippians 2:21</a>).<p>-&#8220;Whatever&#8221; rejects God&#8217;s ordained limits, echoing <a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a> where taking what was forbidden led to ruin.<p>-The abuse robbed worshippers of their fellowship meal portions, poisoning communal joy (<a href="/nehemiah/8-10.htm">Nehemiah 8:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh</b><p>The conduct was habitual and universal. Every pilgrim felt the sting, so national worship life suffered (<a href="/psalms/133-1.htm">Psalm 133:1</a>). Public faith is weakened when leaders misuse trust (<a href="/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a>).<p>-The statement &#8220;all the Israelites&#8221; shows no respecter of persons&#8212;abuse was indiscriminate (<a href="/isaiah/10-1.htm">Isaiah 10:1-2</a>).<p>-Shiloh, once a symbol of God&#8217;s dwelling (<a href="/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>), became a place of scandal, foreshadowing its later desolation (<a href="/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12-14</a>).<p>-The verse warns that sustained corruption invites divine judgment, as later verses reveal (<a href="/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/2-14.htm">1 Samuel 2:14</a> depicts priests who flouted God&#8217;s clear instructions, grabbing whatever meat their fork speared from any pot brought by worshippers. Their greedy ritual twisted holy service into personal gain, wounding every Israelite who came to Shiloh and setting the stage for God&#8217;s swift discipline. The passage reminds us that God&#8217;s ordained patterns for worship demand reverence, boundaries, and servant-hearted leadership&#8212;deviating from them harms both the community and the honor of the Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/2-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">and plunge [it]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hik&#183;k&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
