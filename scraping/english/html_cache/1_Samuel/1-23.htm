In a patriarchal society, a husband's approval was crucial for a wife's decisions. Elkanah's trust in Hannah's judgment highlights the mutual respect in their relationship. This phrase also underscores the importance of discernment and wisdom in decision-making, a theme echoed in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, where believers are encouraged to trust in the Lord and lean not on their own understanding.<p><b>&#8220;and stay here until you have weaned him.&#8221;</b><br>In ancient Israel, weaning typically occurred around the age of three, a practice supported by archaeological findings and historical records. This period was crucial for the child's development and survival, as infant mortality rates were high. The decision to stay and wean Samuel indicates the importance of maternal care and the nurturing role of mothers, which is a recurring theme in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a>, where God's care is compared to that of a nursing mother.<p><b>&#8220;Only may the LORD confirm His word.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase reflects a deep reliance on God's promises and faithfulness. The reference to "His word" likely pertains to the vow Hannah made to dedicate Samuel to the Lord's service (<a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>). It underscores the belief in divine sovereignty and the fulfillment of God's promises, a theme prevalent throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>, which emphasizes that God does not lie or change His mind. This reliance on God's word is a precursor to the New Testament understanding of Jesus as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>So Hannah stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him.</b><br>Hannah's obedience and dedication to her vow demonstrate her faithfulness and commitment to God. Her actions are a testament to the importance of fulfilling one's promises to the Lord, a principle that is echoed in <a href="/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:4-5</a>, which warns against making vows and not fulfilling them. Hannah's nurturing of Samuel until he was weaned also foreshadows the significant role Samuel would play as a prophet and leader in Israel, anointing the first two kings, Saul and David, and serving as a type of Christ in his role as a mediator between God and the people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hannah.htm">Hannah</a></b><br>A devout woman who prayed earnestly for a child and vowed to dedicate him to the Lord.

Then every mother who bore a son called him Samuel; but when they saw his actions, they said, This is not Samuel.
