In the context of ancient Israel, the king was seen as God's appointed leader, yet the people felt compelled to speak out, showing the tension between divine authority and popular opinion.<p><b>&#8220;Must Jonathan die&#8212;he who accomplished such a great deliverance for Israel?</b><br>Jonathan's actions in the battle against the Philistines were seen as divinely inspired and heroic. His victory was a significant military achievement, reminiscent of other deliverances in Israel's history, such as those by the judges. This phrase underscores the people's recognition of Jonathan's role as a deliverer, akin to figures like Gideon or Samson, who were also empowered by God to save Israel.<p><b>Never! As surely as the LORD lives,</b><br>This oath invokes the name of the LORD, emphasizing the seriousness and sincerity of the people's declaration. It reflects the cultural and religious practice of swearing by God's name to affirm truth and justice, a common practice in ancient Israelite society.<p><b>not a hair of his head will fall to the ground,</b><br>This expression is a Hebrew idiom signifying complete protection and safety. It is used elsewhere in Scripture to denote divine protection and assurance, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/1-52.htm">1 Kings 1:52</a> and <a href="/luke/21-18.htm">Luke 21:18</a>, indicating that Jonathan's life is under God's protection.<p><b>for with God&#8217;s help he has accomplished this today.&#8221;</b><br>The acknowledgment of God's help in Jonathan's victory highlights the theological belief that success in battle is attributed to divine intervention. This reflects the broader biblical theme that God is the true source of deliverance and victory for Israel, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>.<p><b>So the people rescued Jonathan, and he did not die.</b><br>The people's intervention to save Jonathan demonstrates a communal act of justice and mercy, overriding Saul's rash oath. This act of rescue can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the ultimate deliverer and rescuer of humanity.

Saul might feel bound by his rash oath, but the consciences of the people told them that an oath to commit a crime is an oath to be repented of as a sin, and not to be performed as a duty. They do not say, however, <span class="cmt_word">God forbid,</span> but "Far be it." The name of the Deity is constantly taken in vain in the A.V. without adding either beauty or energy to the word of God. But even if it did, what right have translators to add energy to the word of God? <span class="cmt_word">He hath wrought with God this day.</span> The argument of the people is wise and good. Jonathan's whole conduct on that day proved an especial presence of God with him. It would be morally wrong and an offence against religion to condemn that which God approved, and the people therefore set their oath against the king's oath, and prevail. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/14-45.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1436;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
