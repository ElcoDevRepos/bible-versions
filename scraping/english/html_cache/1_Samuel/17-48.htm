The Philistine, Goliath, represents the formidable enemy of Israel, both physically and spiritually. Historically, the Philistines were a significant threat to Israel, often engaging in battles for control of the land. Goliath's advance symbolizes the aggressive nature of evil and opposition to God's people. This moment is a pivotal point in the narrative, highlighting the courage required to face overwhelming odds. The Philistine's movement can be seen as a representation of the challenges and trials that believers face, requiring faith and reliance on God.<p><b>David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him</b><br>David's action is a demonstration of faith and courage. Unlike the rest of the Israelite army, who were paralyzed by fear, David's swift movement towards Goliath signifies his trust in God's deliverance. This act of running towards the battle line is symbolic of the believer's call to confront challenges head-on, armed with faith. David's confidence is rooted in his past experiences of God's faithfulness, as he previously recounted his victories over the lion and the bear. This moment foreshadows the ultimate victory of Jesus Christ over sin and death, as David, a type of Christ, defeats the giant with seemingly inadequate resources. David's approach to the battle line is a reminder of the spiritual warfare that Christians are called to engage in, with the assurance of God's presence and power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd boy, anointed by God to be the future king of Israel.

David, meanwhile, in his light equipment, <span class="cmt_word">ran towards the army,</span> Hebrew, "the rank," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the Philistine line, in front of which Goliath had been sitting. As the giant's helmet had no visor, that protection not having as yet been invented, and his shield was still carried by his armour bearer, his face was exposed to David's missiles. And in those days, before firearms were invented, men by constant practice "could sling stones at a hair-breadth, and not miss" (<a href="/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>). And even if David were not quite as skilful as those Benjamites, yet, as the giant could move only very slowly, the chances were that he would hit him with one or more of his five pebbles. As it was, he struck him at his first attempt upon the forehead with such force that Goliath was stunned, and fell down upon his face to the ground. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-48.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Philistine</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(hap&#183;p&#601;&#183;li&#353;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
