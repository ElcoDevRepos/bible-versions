This command to "Stop!" signifies a moment of divine intervention and authority. Samuel, as God's spokesperson, is about to deliver a message of great importance. The urgency in his voice reflects the seriousness of Saul's disobedience. This moment is pivotal, as it marks a turning point in Saul's reign. The use of "Stop!" indicates a halt to Saul's actions and a call to listen to God's word, reminiscent of other biblical moments where God intervenes directly, such as when God speaks to Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3).<p><b>"Let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night."</b><br>Samuel is about to convey a direct revelation from God, emphasizing the prophetic role he plays. The phrase "last night" suggests that God communicated with Samuel in a vision or dream, a common method of divine communication in the Old Testament (<a href="/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>). This highlights the immediacy and relevance of the message. The context here is Saul's failure to completely destroy the Amalekites as God commanded, which is a test of Saul's obedience. The LORD's message is a response to Saul's incomplete obedience, which is seen as rebellion against God's command.<p><b>"Tell me," Saul replied.</b><br>Saul's response, "Tell me," indicates a willingness to hear Samuel's message, though it may also reflect a lack of awareness of the gravity of his disobedience. Saul's openness to hear the message contrasts with his previous actions, where he rationalized his disobedience by sparing King Agag and the best of the livestock (<a href="/1_samuel/15-9.htm">1 Samuel 15:9</a>). This moment foreshadows the impending judgment and rejection of Saul as king. Saul's reply can be seen as a moment of tension, as he is about to receive a message that will have significant consequences for his kingship and Israel's future.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel is a key figure in the transition from the period of judges to the establishment of the monarchy.

Like Nathan&#8217;s &#8220;You are the man!&#8221; to David (<a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>), the prophet&#8217;s interruption halts self-justification and forces Saul to face truth.<p>&#8226; God often sends a decisive word to expose sin&#8212;think of Jesus&#8217; admonition &#8220;Go, and sin no more&#8221; (<a href="/john/8-11.htm">John 8:11</a>) or Peter&#8217;s rebuke to Ananias (<a href="/acts/5-3.htm">Acts 5:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The abrupt stop underscores that partial obedience (vv. 13-15) is still rebellion (v. 23).
