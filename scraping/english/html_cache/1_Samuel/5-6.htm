In biblical terms, God's "hand" often represents His authority and ability to execute judgment or deliverance (<a href="/exodus/9-3.htm">Exodus 9:3</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). Ashdod was one of the five major Philistine cities, located in the coastal region of what is now modern-day Israel. The Philistines had captured the Ark of the Covenant, and this act of desecration led to divine retribution. The "vicinity" indicates that the impact of God's judgment extended beyond the city itself, affecting the surrounding areas. This demonstrates the widespread nature of God's power and the seriousness of the offense against Him.<p><b>ravaging them</b><br>The term "ravaging" suggests a severe and destructive impact. This can be understood as a form of divine punishment for the Philistines' disrespect towards the Ark, which symbolized God's presence among His people. The use of such a strong term underscores the intensity of the affliction and serves as a warning to those who oppose or dishonor God. This act of ravaging can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to protect His covenant and His people, even when they are not present to defend themselves.<p><b>and afflicting them with tumors</b><br>The affliction of "tumors" is a specific form of suffering imposed by God. The Hebrew term used here can also be translated as "boils" or "swellings," indicating a painful and humiliating condition. This affliction is reminiscent of the plagues in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/9-9.htm">Exodus 9:9-11</a>), where God used physical ailments to demonstrate His power and compel obedience. The tumors served as a tangible sign of God's displeasure and a call to repentance. Some scholars suggest a connection to bubonic plague, as the symptoms described align with historical accounts of such outbreaks. This affliction highlights the seriousness of defying God's holiness and the consequences of possessing the Ark without reverence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The God of Israel, who demonstrates His power and sovereignty over the Philistines by afflicting them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/people_of_ashdod.htm">People of Ashdod</a></b><br>Inhabitants of one of the five major Philistine cities, who captured the Ark of the Covenant and experienced God's judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ashdod.htm">Ashdod</a></b><br>A Philistine city where the Ark of the Covenant was taken after being captured from the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest representing God's presence, captured by the Philistines in battle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tumors.htm">Tumors</a></b><br>Physical afflictions sent by God as a form of judgment upon the Philistines for possessing the Ark.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The passage highlights God's control over all nations, not just Israel.

The LXX. has an addition to the Hebrew text here which speaks of a terrible land plague which, apparently from subsequent notices, visited Philistia in addition to the bodily sufferings here spoken of. The Greek Version adds to <a href="/1_samuel/5-6.htm" title="But the hand of the LORD was heavy on them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with tumors, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof.">1Samuel 5:6</a> these words: "and mice were produced in the land, and there arose a great and deadly confusion in the city." In <a href="/1_samuel/6-4.htm" title="Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.">1Samuel 6:4</a>, &c, among the expiatory offerings sent by the idolators to Israel to appease what they imagined the offended Hebrew God, "golden mice" are mentioned: "images of the mice that mar the land." The mouse, according to Herodotus and the testimony of hieroglyphics, was an old symbol of pestilence. The Greek translators, however, failing to understand the meaning of the offering of golden mice, added the words--apparently in accordance with a received tradition--by way of explanation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the hand of Jehovah was heavy upon them of Ashdod.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> his power and might were exercised in smiting them with severe plagues. A question here arises whether, as the Septuagint affirms, besides the scourge of emerods, their land was desolated by swarms of field mice. It is certain that they sent as votive offerings golden images of "the mice that mar the land" (<a href="/1_samuel/6-5.htm">1 Samuel 6:5</a>); but the translators of the Septuagint too often attempt to make all things easy by unauthorised additions, suggested by the context; and so probably here it was the wish to explain why mice were sent which made them add, "and mice were produced in the land." Really the mouse was a symbol of pestilence (Herod., 2:141), and appears as such in hieroglyphics; and by sending golden mice with golden emerods the lords of the Philistines expressed very clearly that the emerods had been epidemic. This word, more correctly spelt haemorrhoids, has this in its favour, that the noun used here, <span class="accented">ophalim</span>, is never read in the synagogue. Wherever the word occurs the reader was instructed to say <span class="accented">tehorim</span>, the vowels of which are actually attached to the consonants of <span class="accented">ophalim</span> in the text of our Hebrew Bibles. In <a href="/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>. <span class="accented">tehorim</span> is mentioned as one of the loathsome skin diseases of Egypt, and though rendered "emerods" in the A.V., is possibly, as translated by Aquila, "an eating ulcer." <span class="accented">Ophalim</span> need only mean <span class="accented">turnouts, swellings</span>, its original signification being "a hill" (<a href="/2_chronicles/27-3.htm">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>); yet as the word was not thought fit for public reading in the synagogue, we may feel sure that it means some such tumours as the A.V. describes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/5-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the hand</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1463;&#1491;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(ya&#7695;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3027.htm">Strong's 3027: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was heavy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1447;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;ti&#7733;&#183;ba&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
