The pursuit of David is a recurring theme in 1 Samuel, highlighting the trials and tribulations he faced. This pursuit can be seen as a test of David's faith and reliance on God, similar to the trials faced by other biblical figures such as Joseph and Moses. The phrase also foreshadows the relentless pursuit of Jesus by the religious leaders of His time, who sought to take His life.<p><b>then the life of my lord will be bound securely by the LORD your God in the bundle of the living</b><br>This imagery of being "bound securely" suggests divine protection and preservation. The "bundle of the living" can be understood as a metaphor for God's covenant community, those who are under His care and protection. This reflects the biblical theme of God's faithfulness to His chosen ones, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/91.htm">Psalm 91:1-2</a>, which speaks of God's protection. The phrase also points to the eternal security believers have in Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's promise to protect and preserve His people.<p><b>But He shall fling away the lives of your enemies like stones from a sling</b><br>This phrase uses the imagery of a sling, which is significant given David's victory over Goliath with a sling and a stone (1 Samuel 17). It symbolizes God's power to defeat enemies and deliver His people. The act of flinging away enemies like stones suggests a swift and decisive victory, emphasizing God's sovereignty and justice. This imagery also connects to the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death, as He defeats the spiritual enemies of His people. The sling imagery serves as a reminder of God's ability to use seemingly insignificant means to achieve His purposes, as seen throughout biblical history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, who is being pursued by King Saul.

Yet it equally affirms that no enemy can move outside God&#8217;s sovereign oversight (<a href="/job/1-10.htm">Job 1:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase anticipates Jesus&#8217; warning that His followers will be persecuted (<a href="/john/15-20.htm">John 15:20</a>), reminding us that harassment does not cancel God&#8217;s plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>then the life of my lord will be bound securely by the LORD your God in the bundle of the living.</b><p>Abigail declares that David&#8217;s life is wrapped up, tied tight, and kept safe with God Himself&#8212;imagery of a treasured bundle carried close to the heart.<p>&#8226; Similar language appears in <a href="/deuteronomy/33-3.htm">Deuteronomy 33:3</a>, where the LORD &#8220;holds His people in His hands,&#8221; and in <a href="/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>, &#8220;He will conceal me in His shelter.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Bundle of the living&#8221; points forward to eternal assurance: believers are kept by God&#8217;s power (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28&#8211;29</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-5.htm">1 Peter 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; For David, this meant literal preservation until he would sit on Israel&#8217;s throne (<a href="/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4</a>). For us, it means our lives are hidden with Christ in God (<a href="/colossians/3-3.htm">Colossians 3:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Note the contrast: while men plot, the LORD protects; while enemies rage, the Shepherd encloses His sheep (<a href="/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But He shall fling away the lives of your enemies like stones from a sling.</b><p>Abigail invokes the very image of David&#8217;s victory over Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-49.htm">1 Samuel 17:49</a>), turning the memory into a promise: what God did once, He will keep doing.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s justice is active&#8212;He hurls the wicked away (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>; <a href="/psalms/9-5.htm">Psalm 9:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The picture of a stone leaving a sling highlights speed, force, and finality; enemies are removed decisively (<a href="/psalms/37-10.htm">Psalm 37:10</a>).<p>&#8226; This anticipates the ultimate triumph of Christ, who will &#8220;destroy all dominion, authority and power&#8221; opposed to Him (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; For David, it meant Saul&#8217;s schemes would fail (<a href="/1_samuel/26-21.htm">1 Samuel 26:21</a>). For believers, it guarantees that every adversary&#8212;sin, death, Satan&#8212;will be cast down (<a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10, 14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Abigail&#8217;s Spirit-guided words assure David&#8212;and us&#8212;that:<p>1.

It is now a favourite and common inscription on Jewish gravestones. Keil beautifully paraphrases the words of the original. "The words," he writes, "do not refer primarily to eternal life with God in heaven, but only to the safe preservation of the righteous on this earth in the grace and fellowship of the Lord. <span class= "ital">But whoever is so hidden in the gracious fellowship of the Lord in this life, that no enemy can harm him or injure his life, the Lord will not allow to perish, even though temporal death should come, but will then receive him into eternal life"--Keil.</span><p>The image, as so often in Eastern teaching, is taken from common every-day life--from the habit, as Dean Payne Smith remarks, of packing up in a bundle articles of great value or of indispensable use, so that the owner may carry them about his person. In India the phrase is common. Thus, a just judge is said to be bound up in the bundle of righteousness; a lover in the bundle of love. Among the striking references in the Babylonian Talmud to this loved and cherished saying of the wife of Nabal, we find how, in one of the Treatises of <span class= "ital">Seder Moed, </span>"Rabbi Ezra says, <span class= "ital">The souls of the righteous are hidden beneath God's glorious throne: </span>as it is said, The soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God."--Treatise <span class= "ital">Shabbath, </span>fol. 152, col. 2.<p>What student of this verse of the Book of Samuel, and the beautiful Talmud comments on the far-reaching words, can fail to see in them the original of St. John's well-known picture of the "souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held?" (<a href="/revelation/6-9.htm" title="And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:">Revelation 6:9</a>)--these souls of the righteous hidden beneath the glorious throne of God.<p>The thought is embodied in the following extract. <span class= "ital">"</span>The angel of death came and stood before Moses. Give me thy soul, said he; but Moses rebuked him, and said, thou hast no permission to come where he (Moses) was; and he departed crest-fallen. Then the Holy One--blessed be He !--took the soul of Moses, and hid it under His throne of glory: as it is said (<a href="/1_samuel/25-29.htm" title="Yet a man is risen to pursue you, and to seek your soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD your God; and the souls of your enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.">1Samuel 25:29</a>): 'And the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life.' But when He took it He took it by means of a kiss."--<span class= "ital">Avoth. of Rabbi Nathan, </span>1 Samuel 12.<p>In the <span class= "ital">Seder Moed, </span>again, in the same Treatise <span class= "ital">Shabbath, </span>there is a remarkable parable, founded on this saying of Abigail: a parable that reminds us of the framework of one of the well-known pictures of the Redeemer. A king once distributed royal robes among his servants; those that were wise folded them up and laid them by in a coffer, and those that were foolish wore them on their working days. When the king demanded back his robes, those given to the wise were returned free from stains, whilst those of the foolish were soiled. The king, pleased with the wise servants, ordered their robes to be deposited in his treasury, and then that they should depart in peace. But he manifested his displeasure at the foolish servants; he sent their robes to be washed, and dispatched them to prison. So the bodies of the righteous "enter into peace, and rest in their beds" (<a href="/isaiah/57-2.htm" title="He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.">Isaiah 57:2</a>), and their souls are bound up in the bundle of life; but with reference to the bodies of the foolish there is no peace, saith the Lord, and the wicked (<a href="/isaiah/57-21.htm" title="There is no peace, said my God, to the wicked.">Isaiah 57:21</a>) and their souls (quoting the next paragraph of this chapter of Samuel) are slung out, as out of the middle of a sling (<a href="/1_samuel/25-29.htm" title="Yet a man is risen to pursue you, and to seek your soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD your God; and the souls of your enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.">1Samuel 25:29</a>).--Treatise <span class= "ital">Shabbath, </span>fol. 152, col. 2. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29-31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Yet a man is risen.</span> Rather, "And should any one arise to pursue thee," etc. The reference is of course to Saul, but put with due reserve, and also made general, so as to include all possible injury attempted against David. <span class="cmt_word">Bound in the bundle of life.</span> Hebrew, "of the living." The metaphor is taken from the habit of packing up in a bundle articles of great value or of indispensable use, so that the owner may carry them about his person. In India the phrase is common; thus, a just judge is said to be bound up in the bundle of righteousness; a lover in the bundle of love. Abigail prays, therefore, that David may, with others whose life is precious in God's sight, be securely kept under Jehovah's personal care and protection. In modern times the two words signifying "in the bundle of the living" form a common inscription on Jewish gravestones, the phrase having been interpreted in the Talmud, as also by Abravanel and other Jewish authorities, of a future life. <span class="cmt_word">Shall he sling out,</span> etc. In forcible contrast with this careful preservation of David's life, she prays that his enemies may be cast away as violently and to as great a distance as a stone is cast out of a sling. The <span class="cmt_word">middle</span> is the hollow in which the stone was placed. <span class="cmt_word">Ruler</span>. i.e. prince. It is the word rendered <span class="accented">captain</span> in <a href="/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>, but its meaning is more correctly given here. <span class="cmt_word">Grief</span>. The word really means much the same as stumbling block, something which makes a person stagger by his striking against it unawares. Abigail prays, therefore, that when David has become prince, and so has to administer justice, this violent and revengeful act which he was purposing might not prove a cause of stumbling and an offence of heart to himself, by his conscience reproaching him for having himself done that which he had to condemn in others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/25-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And should someone</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_120.htm">Strong's 120: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ruddy, a human being</span><br /><br /><span class="word">pursue you</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1508;&#1456;&#1498;&#1464;&#1428;</span> <span class="translit">(lir&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;p&#772;&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124;
