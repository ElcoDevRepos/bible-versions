In the context of 1 Samuel, Eli's sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were abusing their priestly roles by taking portions of the sacrifices meant for God (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>). The term "kick" suggests rebellion and disrespect, akin to an animal kicking against its master. This behavior reflects a broader theme in Scripture where God condemns those who dishonor His holy ordinances (<a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6-14</a>).<p><b>that I have prescribed for My dwelling place?</b><br>God's dwelling place refers to the tabernacle, the central place of worship for Israel, where His presence was manifest. The sacrifices and offerings were not merely ritualistic but were divinely instituted to maintain a covenant relationship with God (<a href="/exodus/29-42.htm">Exodus 29:42-46</a>). The tabernacle was a precursor to the temple and ultimately points to Jesus Christ, who is the true temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>). The prescribed offerings were a means of atonement and fellowship with God, highlighting the seriousness of the priests' transgressions.<p><b>You have honored your sons more than Me</b><br>Eli's failure to discipline his sons demonstrates misplaced priorities, valuing familial ties over obedience to God. This reflects a broader biblical principle where allegiance to God must supersede all other relationships (<a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>). Eli's indulgence of his sons' sins led to God's judgment, illustrating the consequences of failing to uphold God's standards (<a href="/1_samuel/3-13.htm">1 Samuel 3:13</a>).<p><b>by fattening yourselves with the best of all the offerings of My people Israel.</b><br>The priests were entitled to a portion of the offerings (<a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31-34</a>), but Eli's sons took more than their share, exploiting their position for personal gain. This greed and corruption are condemned throughout Scripture (<a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-3</a>). The phrase "fattening yourselves" implies self-indulgence at the expense of God's commands, contrasting with the sacrificial nature of true worship. This behavior foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who gave Himself selflessly for humanity (<a href="/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli.htm">Eli</a></b><br>The high priest of Israel during the time of Samuel's birth.

The verse warns every believer&#8212;especially leaders&#8212;to treat God&#8217;s worship with reverence, guard the purity of His appointed ways, love Him above family ties, and steward His gifts selflessly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice.</span>--The imagery of the words are taken from <a href="/deuteronomy/32-15.htm" title="But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: you are waxen fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.">Deuteronomy 32:15</a> : "Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked . . . then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation." The image is one drawn from the pastoral life of the people: the ox or ass over-fed, pampered, and indulged, becomes unmanageable, and refuses obedience to his kind master.<p><span class= "bld">And honourest thy sons above me.</span>--Although Eli knew well what was right, yet foolish fondness for his sons seems in part to have blinded his eyes to the enormity of their wickedness. It is also probable that he was influenced not by feelings of weak affection, but also by unwillingness to divert from his own family the rich source of wealth which proceeded from the offerings of the pilgrims from all parts of the land. These considerations induced him to maintain these bad and covetous men as his acknowledged representatives in the national sanctuary of Shiloh. Eli then allowed things, which gradually grew worse and worse, to drift, and merely interfered with a weak rebuke; but the day of reckoning was at hand.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/2-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Why, then,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1464;&#1443;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#257;m&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">do you kick at</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1458;&#1496;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;i&#7687;&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7789;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1163.htm">Strong's 1163: </a> </span><span class="str2">To trample down, despise</span><br /><br /><span class="word">My sacrifice</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1494;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1495;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;zi&#7687;&#183;&#7717;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
