Samuel, a prophet and judge, represents God's authority and presence. His turning to leave signifies the withdrawal of divine favor and guidance from Saul. This act of turning away can be seen as a symbolic gesture of God's judgment and the end of Saul's divine appointment as king. The turning away of a prophet often indicates a significant shift in God's dealings with His people, as seen in other instances where prophets depart after delivering God's word (e.g., Elijah in <a href="/1_kings/19-3.htm">1 Kings 19:3</a>).<p><b>Saul grabbed the hem of his robe</b><br>The act of grabbing the hem of Samuel's robe is significant in ancient Near Eastern culture, where the hem or fringe of a garment often symbolized authority and identity. Saul's desperate action reflects his recognition of the loss of his kingdom and his attempt to hold onto the authority that is slipping away. In biblical times, touching the hem of a garment could also be seen as an appeal for mercy or favor, as seen in the New Testament when the woman with the issue of blood touches the hem of Jesus' garment (<a href="/matthew/9-20.htm">Matthew 9:20-22</a>). Saul's action is both a literal and symbolic grasp at retaining power and favor.<p><b>and it tore</b><br>The tearing of the robe is a prophetic act symbolizing the tearing away of the kingdom from Saul. In the biblical narrative, physical actions often accompany prophetic declarations to illustrate a spiritual truth. The tearing of the robe here is directly linked to Samuel's subsequent pronouncement that the Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from Saul and given it to a neighbor who is better than him (<a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>). This act of tearing is reminiscent of other biblical instances where garments are torn as a sign of mourning, distress, or judgment (e.g., <a href="/joshua/7-6.htm">Joshua 7:6</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/1-11.htm">2 Samuel 1:11</a>). The tearing signifies the irrevocable nature of God's decision and foreshadows the rise of David, who is described as a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel was instrumental in anointing the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David.

The scene urges us to embrace full obedience, for God&#8217;s word proves true whether spoken or enacted.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">He laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle.</span>--The king's passionate action indicates a restless, unquiet mind. Not content with intreating words, Saul, perhaps even with some violence, lays hold of the old man as he turns away, to detain him. What Saul laid hold of and tore was not the "mantle" (Authorised Version), but the hem, or outer border, of the "meil," the ordinary tunic which the upper classes in Israel were then in the habit of wearing. The Dean of Canterbury, in a careful Note in the <span class= "ital">Pulpit Commentary, </span>shows that the "mantle," which would be the accurate rendering of the Hebrew <span class= "ital">addereth, </span>the distinctive dress of the Hebrew prophets, was certainly not used in the days of Samuel, the great founder of the prophetic order. Special dresses came into use only gradually, and Elijah is the first person described as being thus clad. Long before his time the school of the prophets had grown into a national institution, and a loose wrapper of coarse cloth, made of camel's-hair, fastened round the body at the waist by a leathern girdle, had become the <span class= "ital">distinctive </span>prophetic dress, and continued to be until the arrival of Israel's last prophet, John the Baptist (<a href="/mark/1-6.htm" title="And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;">Mark 1:6</a>).<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/15-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As Samuel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8050.htm">Strong's 8050: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samuel -- 'name of God', a prophet of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">turned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1505;&#1468;&#1465;&#1445;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yis&#183;s&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
