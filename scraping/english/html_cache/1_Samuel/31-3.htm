The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel during Saul's reign, often engaging in warfare. The intensification of the battle suggests a shift in momentum, likely due to the Philistines' superior military tactics and weaponry, such as their use of iron chariots and advanced metallurgy. Saul's leadership had been faltering due to his disobedience to God, as seen in earlier chapters, which may have contributed to the Israelites' disadvantage. This moment fulfills Samuel's prophecy that Saul's kingdom would not endure (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>).<p><b>the archers overtook him</b><br>The mention of archers highlights the tactical advantage the Philistines had over the Israelites. Archery was a significant component of ancient warfare, allowing for attacks from a distance. The Philistines' ability to deploy skilled archers suggests their military prowess and strategic planning. This detail also underscores Saul's vulnerability and the dire situation for the Israelite forces. The use of archers may symbolize the inescapable judgment that Saul faced, as he could not evade the consequences of his earlier disobedience to God.<p><b>and wounded him critically</b><br>Saul's critical wounding signifies the beginning of the end for his reign and life. This moment is pivotal, as it leads to the eventual rise of David, whom God had chosen to be king. Saul's injury can be seen as a direct result of his failure to fully obey God's commands, particularly in his incomplete destruction of the Amalekites (1 Samuel 15). The critical nature of his wound also reflects the spiritual state of Israel at the time, as they were in need of a leader who would follow God's will wholeheartedly. Saul's demise foreshadows the coming of a new covenant under David, a type of Christ, who would establish a kingdom characterized by obedience and faithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Gradually weakened through loss of blood--perhaps with the words he had heard only a few hours before at En-dor from the dead prophet ringing in his ears, "To-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me"--the great undaunted courage at last failed him, and he turned to his armourbearer, who was still by his side.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The archers.</span> Literally, as in the margin, "shooters, men with bows."

In <a href="/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a> the verb is rendered "be in anguish." The meaning is that Saul, finding himself surrounded by these archers, and that he could neither escape nor come to close quarters with them, and die fighting, ordered his armour bearer to kill him, that he might be spared the degradation of being slain by "uncircumcised" heathen. <span class="cmt_word">Abuse me.</span> This verb is translated <span class="accented">mock</span> in <a href="/jeremiah/38-19.htm">Jeremiah 38:19</a>.
