Saul, the current king, perceives David as a threat to his throne. The mention of "this earth" underscores the temporal nature of human life and the earthly realm, contrasting with the eternal kingdom of God. David's presence is seen as a direct challenge to Saul's reign, highlighting the tension between God's chosen king and the people's current ruler.<p><b>neither you nor your kingdom shall be established</b><br>Saul is speaking to his son Jonathan, indicating that as long as David is alive, Jonathan's succession to the throne is in jeopardy. This reflects the cultural and historical context of dynastic succession in ancient Israel, where the king's son would typically inherit the throne. However, God's choice of David disrupts this expectation. This phrase also foreshadows the eventual establishment of David's kingdom, which is a type of the eternal kingdom of Christ, as David is an ancestor of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<p><b>Now send for him and bring him to me</b><br>Saul's command to bring David to him reveals his intent to eliminate the perceived threat. This reflects the political intrigue and personal vendettas common in ancient Near Eastern monarchies. The urgency in Saul's command underscores his desperation and fear of losing power. This moment is pivotal in the narrative, as it sets the stage for David's eventual rise and Saul's decline.<p><b>for he must surely die!</b><br>Saul's declaration of a death sentence on David highlights the king's determination to secure his dynasty at any cost. This reflects the harsh realities of ancient royal politics, where threats to the throne were often dealt with through execution. Theologically, this moment underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and protection over His anointed, as David is preserved despite Saul's intentions. This also prefigures the persecution and eventual triumph of Jesus Christ, who, like David, faced opposition and threats to His life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is speaking in this verse.

Believing that David&#8217;s existence threatens both his dynasty and Jonathan&#8217;s future, Saul orders David&#8217;s death. Yet every attempt to eliminate David only highlights the Lord&#8217;s faithfulness to His promise: the kingdom is moving to the man after His own heart. Jonathan recognizes this truth; Saul resists it. The verse therefore underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty over kings, the futility of opposing His purposes, and the certainty that His chosen ruler will be established despite human opposition.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(31) <span class= "bld">Thou shalt not be established.</span>--Here the king gives expression to the thought which was ever torturing that poor diseased brain of his--David, his own kind physician, his faithful soldier, and his son's dearest friend and loved companion, was plotting basely against that master for whom he had done so much, and the son whom he loved so well.<p>Saul, in his blind fury, goes on to betray his fell purpose when he exclaims, "he shall surely die." His command, "Send and fetch him unto me," tells us that the murder had been pre-arranged to take place at the feast. Doubtless those rough soldier chiefs sitting round the royal table would be ready at any moment to carry into effect their master's savage behest.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/20-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Every</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#257;&#183;m&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
