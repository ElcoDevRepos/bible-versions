Samuel, the last judge of Israel, had just anointed Saul as the first king of Israel. This act of anointing was a divine appointment, signifying God's choice and empowerment for leadership. The context here is crucial: Israel had demanded a king to be like other nations, and God granted their request through Samuel. The act of turning away from Samuel symbolizes Saul's transition from a private individual to a public figure chosen by God. This moment also reflects the biblical theme of divine calling and the human response to it, seen in other figures like Moses and David.<p><b>God changed Saul&#8217;s heart</b><br>This phrase indicates a divine transformation within Saul, preparing him for the role of king. In biblical terms, the heart often represents the center of will, emotion, and intellect. God's intervention here suggests a supernatural empowerment, equipping Saul with the necessary qualities for leadership. This transformation is reminiscent of the New Testament concept of regeneration, where believers are given a new heart and spirit (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). It also foreshadows the work of the Holy Spirit in the lives of believers, as seen in <a href="/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a> during Pentecost.<p><b>and all the signs came to pass that day</b><br>The fulfillment of the signs given by Samuel serves as confirmation of God's word and His sovereign plan. Earlier in the chapter, Samuel had provided Saul with specific signs that would occur, affirming his anointing as king. The immediate fulfillment of these signs underscores the reliability of God's promises and the prophetic office of Samuel. This aligns with the biblical principle that true prophecy is always fulfilled (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-21.htm">Deuteronomy 18:21-22</a>). The signs also serve to strengthen Saul's faith and the faith of those around him, similar to how miracles in the New Testament authenticate the message of Jesus and the apostles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, chosen by God and anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Saul&#8217;s first response is simply to turn and go&#8212;an act of humble obedience.<p>&#8226; Scripture often links blessing to immediate, trusting obedience. &#8220;So Abram departed, as the LORD had instructed him&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>). Likewise, Mary: &#8220;May it be unto me according to your word&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-38.htm">Luke 1:38</a>).<p>&#8226; Even the physical act of turning underscores that &#8220;A man&#8217;s heart plans his course, but the LORD determines his steps&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>). When God speaks, the right posture is to move forward, trusting He will accomplish what He has said.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>God changed Saul&#8217;s heart</b><p>&#8226; The change is God&#8217;s sovereign work, not self-improvement. &#8220;I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you&#8221; (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>).<p>&#8226; This inner transformation equips Saul for the calling just placed on him. &#8220;For it is God who works in you to will and to act on behalf of His good purpose&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-13.htm">Philippians 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; What happened to Saul prefigures every believer&#8217;s experience: &#8220;Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-17.htm">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>). When God appoints, He also empowers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All the signs came to pass that day</b><p>&#8226; Samuel had listed three precise signs (<a href="/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2-6</a>):<p>&#8211; Finding the missing donkeys confirmed (v. 2)<p>&#8211; Receiving bread from strangers (v. 3-4)<p>&#8211; Joining prophets and prophesying (v. 5-6)<p>&#8226; Their same-day fulfillment proved the word of the LORD unfailing. &#8220;God is not a man, that He should lie&#8230; Has He spoken, and will He not fulfill?&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p>&#8226; This pattern of promise followed by immediate confirmation threads through Scripture: Sarah conceives &#8220;at the time God had appointed&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/21-1.htm">Genesis 21:1-2</a>); every word of Jesus stands though &#8220;heaven and earth pass away&#8221; (<a href="/luke/21-33.htm">Luke 21:33</a>).<p>&#8226; Such fulfillment grounds faith. &#8220;So is My word that goes out from My mouth&#8230; it will accomplish what I please&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Saul&#8217;s simple step of obedience opened the door for divine empowerment; God literally replaced his old heart with one fit for a king, and then authenticated the whole encounter by bringing every promised sign to pass that very day. The sequence underscores the reliability of God&#8217;s word, the necessity of immediate obedience, and the certainty that when God calls, He also gives the heart and the confirmation needed to walk in that calling.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">God gave him another heart.</span> The Hebrew is remarkable: "When he turned his shoulder to go from Samuel, God also turned for him another heart," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> God turned him round by giving him a changed heart. He grew internally up to the level of his changed circumstances. No longer had he the feelings of a husbandman, concerned only about corn and cattle; he had become a statesman, a general, and a prince. No man could have gone through such marvellous events, and experienced such varied emotions, without a vast inward change. But it might have been only to vanity and self-complacency.
