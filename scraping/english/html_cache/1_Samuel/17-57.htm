This event occurs in the Valley of Elah, a significant location for Israel's battles against the Philistines. David's triumph is not just a personal victory but a national one, symbolizing God's deliverance of Israel. This moment foreshadows Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, as David, a type of Christ, defeats the giant, representing evil and oppression.<p><b>still holding his head in his hand</b><br>The act of holding Goliath's head is a powerful symbol of victory and divine justice. In ancient Near Eastern culture, displaying the head of a defeated enemy was a common practice to demonstrate triumph and instill fear in adversaries. This act signifies the complete and undeniable defeat of the Philistine threat. It also echoes the prophecy in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the seed of the woman will crush the serpent's head, pointing to Christ's ultimate victory over Satan.<p><b>Abner took him</b><br>Abner, the commander of Saul's army, plays a crucial role in the narrative. His involvement highlights the military and political implications of David's victory. Abner's actions suggest recognition of David's emerging leadership and God's favor upon him. This moment marks the beginning of David's rise to prominence in Israel, setting the stage for his future kingship.<p><b>and brought him before Saul</b><br>David's presentation to Saul signifies a turning point in his life. Saul, the current king, is confronted with the reality of David's divine anointing and favor. This encounter foreshadows the complex relationship between Saul and David, characterized by jealousy and conflict. It also underscores the theme of God's sovereignty in raising leaders according to His purpose, as seen throughout the biblical narrative. David's presence before Saul prefigures Christ's presentation before earthly authorities, emphasizing the divine mission and authority bestowed upon him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd who becomes a central figure in Israel's history.

The verse opens with David coming back from the battlefield immediately after God&#8217;s dramatic victory (<a href="/1_samuel/17-50.htm">1 Samuel 17:50</a>).<p>&#8226; This return signals the shift from combat to public recognition, echoing earlier moments when champions reported success to their leaders (<a href="/judges/7-15.htm">Judges 7:15</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47&#8211;48</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s swift movement underscores his humility&#8212;he does not linger to bask in applause but reports to proper authority, just as Joseph did when summoned by Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s deliverance is front-and-center: &#8220;The battle is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>), a truth consistently affirmed from the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13&#8211;14</a>) to Jehoshaphat&#8217;s day (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>still holding his head in his hand</b><p>&#8226; The grisly trophy is tangible proof that Goliath is permanently defeated (<a href="/1_samuel/17-54.htm">1 Samuel 17:54</a>).<p>&#8226; In ancient warfare, displaying an enemy&#8217;s head signified total conquest; here it publicly shames the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/31-8.htm">1 Samuel 31:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, the crushed head foreshadows the Messiah&#8217;s ultimate victory over the serpent (<a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>) and anticipates Christ&#8217;s triumph over principalities (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<p>&#8226;

God is quietly arranging relationships that will shape the nation: Abner will later negotiate David&#8217;s kingship (<a href="/2_samuel/3-6.htm">2 Samuel 3:6&#8211;21</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment also highlights submission to authority, a trait David retains even while on the run from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6&#8211;7</a>; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and brought him before Saul</b><p>&#8226; David now stands before the monarch who had promised riches, a daughter in marriage, and tax freedom to Israel&#8217;s champion (<a href="/1_samuel/17-25.htm">1 Samuel 17:25</a>).<p>&#8226;
