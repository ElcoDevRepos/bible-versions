Forgetting God often led to idolatry and disobedience, as seen in <a href="/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7</a>. This forgetfulness is not merely a lapse in memory but a willful neglect of God's commandments and covenant. It serves as a warning against complacency in faith, emphasizing the need for continual remembrance and worship of God.<p><b>and He sold them into the hand of Sisera the commander of the army of Hazor</b><br>Sisera was a Canaanite military leader defeated by Deborah and Barak in <a href="/judges/4.htm">Judges 4</a>. The term "sold" indicates God's judgment, allowing Israel to be oppressed due to their disobedience. Hazor was a significant Canaanite city, and its archaeological remains suggest it was a powerful center during this period. This event underscores God's sovereignty in using foreign powers to discipline His people.<p><b>and into the hands of the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel, often oppressing them as seen in <a href="/judges/13.htm">Judges 13-16</a>. They were a seafaring people who settled along the coastal regions of Canaan. Their conflicts with Israel highlight the struggle between God's people and pagan influences. The Philistines' oppression serves as a backdrop for the rise of Samson, who began to deliver Israel from their hand.<p><b>and the king of Moab</b><br>Moab was a neighboring nation east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel. The Moabites were descendants of Lot, and their interactions with Israel were marked by both hostility and kinship. In <a href="/judges/3.htm">Judges 3</a>, Eglon, the king of Moab, oppressed Israel until Ehud delivered them. This reflects the cyclical pattern of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance in Israel's history.<p><b>who fought against them</b><br>This phrase encapsulates the consequences of Israel's disobedience. The nations mentioned were instruments of God's judgment, used to bring Israel to repentance. The battles and conflicts serve as reminders of the spiritual warfare believers face, calling for reliance on God for deliverance. This struggle foreshadows the ultimate victory through Jesus Christ, who delivers from sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who delivered them from Egypt and established them in the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sisera.htm">Sisera</a></b><br>The commander of the Canaanite army under King Jabin of Hazor, who oppressed Israel until Deborah and Barak defeated him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A perennial enemy of Israel, known for their military prowess and frequent conflicts with the Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_of_moab.htm">King of Moab</a></b><br>A ruler of the Moabites, who were descendants of Lot and often in conflict with Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who repeatedly turned away from Him, leading to their oppression by surrounding nations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_forgetfulness.htm">The Danger of Forgetfulness</a></b><br>Forgetting God leads to spiritual and physical consequences.

The instances which are here adduced of the people being given up into the hands of strange hostile nations are prominent ones, quoted as they occurred to him, without any careful attention being paid to the order of events and times, which was here not necessary for the course of his argument. Three leading nations out of the neighbouring peoples are mentioned by him as having been allowed, in consequence of Israel's rebellion against the Eternal, to oppress and harass, for a season, the tribes of God's inheritance--the Canaanites, the Philistines, and the Moabites.<p><span class= "bld">Captain of the host of Hazor.</span>--Hazor is mentioned as the capital city of the Canaanites in <a href="/joshua/11-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,">Joshua 11:1</a>; <a href="/joshua/11-10.htm" title="And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.">Joshua 11:10</a>; <a href="/joshua/11-13.htm" title="But as for the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.">Joshua 11:13</a>, &c., and again as a royal residence in <a href="/judges/4-2.htm" title="And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelled in Harosheth of the Gentiles.">Judges 4:2</a>.

We have before compared their many strongholds and fastnesses to those robber nests which in the stormy middle ages disturbed the peace, and were the scourge of the commerce and trade, of Central Europe. It was owing especially to these Philistines that for so long a period such slow progress in wealth and the arts of civilisation was made in Israel. The advance of the Hebrew nation, from the days of Samuel, who first really checked these Philistine robbers, was singularly rapid. In an almost incredibly short period, from being a poor, half-barbarous people, the Israelites became a highly cultured, wealthy, and powerful nation. In great measure this strangely rapid progress was owing to the complete subjugation of the Philistines under the rule of Samuel, Saul, and David.<p><span class= "bld">The king of Moab.</span>--The king referred to here is Eglon, who was slain by Ehud.
