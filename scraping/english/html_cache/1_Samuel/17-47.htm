The confrontation between David and Goliath was witnessed by the armies of Israel and the Philistines, highlighting the importance of God's power being demonstrated before many. This public demonstration serves as a testimony to God's sovereignty and power, reinforcing the idea that God's actions are meant to be witnessed and acknowledged by all.<p><b>that it is not by sword or spear that the LORD saves;</b><br>This statement underscores the theme of divine intervention over human strength and weaponry. Throughout the Bible, God often chooses the weak and the unlikely to accomplish His purposes, as seen in Gideon's victory over the Midianites (Judges 7) and the fall of Jericho (Joshua 6). This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that salvation comes through faith and not by human effort (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><b>for the battle is the LORD&#8217;s,</b><br>This declaration affirms God's ultimate control over the outcome of events. It reflects the biblical principle that God is the true warrior who fights on behalf of His people, as seen in <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>, where Moses tells the Israelites, "The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still." This concept is a recurring theme in Scripture, emphasizing reliance on God's power rather than human might.<p><b>and He will give all of you into our hands.&#8221;</b><br>David's confidence in God's deliverance is evident here. This assurance is rooted in the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God promises to protect and deliver His people. The phrase also points to the prophetic nature of David's kingship, as he is a type of Christ, who ultimately defeats the spiritual enemies of sin and death. David's victory over Goliath prefigures Christ's victory over Satan, as seen in <a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>, where Christ disarms the powers and authorities, triumphing over them by the cross.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd who later becomes the king of Israel.
