In the context of <a href="/1_samuel/24.htm">1 Samuel 24</a>, David has the opportunity to kill King Saul, who is pursuing him unjustly. The rhetorical question highlights the rarity and unexpected nature of David's mercy. This act of sparing an enemy is countercultural and demonstrates a higher moral standard, aligning with later teachings of Jesus in the New Testament, such as loving one's enemies (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>). David's restraint can be seen as a type of Christ, who also showed mercy to those who opposed Him.<p><b>May the LORD reward you with good</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the belief in divine justice and reward. In the biblical narrative, David's actions are not just seen as morally right but are expected to be rewarded by God. This reflects the covenantal relationship between God and His people, where obedience and righteousness are met with divine favor. The idea of God rewarding good deeds is echoed throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/proverbs/11-18.htm">Proverbs 11:18</a> and <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>, reinforcing the principle that God honors those who act according to His will.<p><b>for what you have done for me this day.</b><br>Here, the focus is on the specific act of mercy David showed to Saul. This moment is pivotal in the narrative, as it demonstrates David's integrity and his respect for God's anointed king, despite Saul's unjust pursuit. It also serves as a testament to David's character, setting a precedent for his future reign as king. This act of mercy is a foreshadowing of the grace that Christ would later extend to humanity, offering forgiveness and reconciliation. The phrase also emphasizes the importance of individual actions and their impact on relationships and divine favor.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Anointed future king of Israel, known for his heart after God.

By every natural instinct, an enemy found at such disadvantage would be struck down.<p>&#8226; David refused because Saul was &#8220;the LORD&#8217;s anointed&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>).<p>&#8226; He trusted God to judge: &#8220;Vengeance is Mine; I will repay&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>; <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p>&#8226; He chose blessing over retaliation: &#8220;Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/3-9.htm">1 Peter 3:9</a>).<p>Because Scripture is historically accurate, this real&#8208;time restraint teaches that believers can rely on God&#8217;s justice rather than their own.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>May the LORD reward you with good for what you have done for me this day</b><p>Saul, momentarily clear-sighted, pronounces a blessing that reflects a core biblical truth: God rewards righteousness.<p>&#8226; &#8220;The LORD repays every man for his righteousness and faithfulness&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/26-23.htm">1 Samuel 26:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Ruth received a similar reassurance: &#8220;May the LORD repay your work, and may you receive a rich reward from the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/ruth/2-12.htm">Ruth 2:12</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;God is not unjust; He will not forget your work and the love you have shown&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>).<p>For David, that reward unfolded in:<p>&#8211; Preservation from Saul&#8217;s spear and armies.<p>&#8211; A throne established by covenant (<a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>).<p>&#8211; A legacy reaching its fulfillment in the Messiah, the Son of David (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32&#8211;33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/24-19.htm">1 Samuel 24:19</a> underscores literal, historical mercy that mirrors God&#8217;s heart.
