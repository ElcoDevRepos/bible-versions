Eli was the high priest and judge of Israel, and his sons were expected to follow in his footsteps. This context highlights the gravity of their actions, as they were in positions of spiritual leadership. Their behavior would have had significant implications for the religious life of Israel, as they were responsible for mediating between God and the people.<p><b>were wicked men;</b><br>The term "wicked" indicates a moral and spiritual corruption. In the Hebrew text, the phrase used is "sons of Belial," which implies worthlessness and lawlessness. This description sets the stage for understanding their actions as not just personal failings but as a direct affront to the covenantal relationship between God and Israel. Their wickedness is later detailed in the narrative, showing their abuse of priestly privileges and their exploitation of the sacrificial system.<p><b>they had no regard for the LORD</b><br>This phrase underscores their spiritual blindness and rebellion. The lack of regard for the LORD suggests a deliberate disregard for God's commandments and the sacred duties of their office. This is a serious indictment, as it implies a rejection of God's authority and a failure to honor the covenant. Their actions are contrasted with the faithful service expected of priests, as outlined in Leviticus and Deuteronomy. This disregard is a precursor to the judgment that will come upon Eli's house, as prophesied later in the chapter.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli.htm">Eli</a></b><br>The high priest of Shiloh and judge of Israel.

While the nation&#8217;s hope was quietly growing in a boy dedicated to God, the narrative shifts to a sobering contrast. This transition highlights how, in every generation, God sets before His people a choice between faithfulness and rebellion (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>; <a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the sons of Eli</b><p>&#8226;Hophni and Phinehas, introduced earlier as priests of the LORD (<a href="/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>), carried great privilege and responsibility.<p>&#8226;Their lineage traced back to Aaron, underscoring the seriousness of their conduct (<a href="/exodus/28-1.htm">Exodus 28:1</a>).<p>&#8226;Despite their heritage, they stand as a living reminder that spiritual pedigree cannot replace personal obedience (<a href="/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>; <a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were wicked men</b><p>&#8226;The renders it plainly&#8212;&#8220;wicked.&#8221; Scripture elsewhere labels such people &#8220;worthless fellows&#8221; or &#8220;sons of Belial&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:13</a>; <a href="/judges/19-22.htm">Judges 19:22</a>), pointing to lives bent away from God.<p>&#8226;Wickedness here is not a mild flaw but open defiance: they stole from the offerings (<a href="/1_samuel/2-13.htm">1 Samuel 2:13-16</a>) and seduced women at the tent of meeting (<a href="/1_samuel/2-22.htm">1 Samuel 2:22</a>).<p>&#8226;God&#8217;s standard for priests was holiness (<a href="/leviticus/10-3.htm">Leviticus 10:3</a>; 21:6).

Their wicked actions sprang from hearts that dismissed God&#8217;s authority. The verse warns that lineage and position cannot shield anyone from accountability; only genuine reverence and obedience matter. In sharp relief against their darkness, God&#8217;s light is already shining through young Samuel, proving that the LORD remains faithful to honor those who honor Him (<a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">Sons of.</span>--The word Belial is printed here and <a href="/1_samuel/1-16.htm" title="Count not your handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken till now.">1Samuel 1:16</a>, as though Belial were the name of some pagan deity, but it simply signifies "worthlessness." It is a common term in these records of Samuel, being used some nine or ten times. It is rarely found in the other historical books. "Sons of Belial" signifies, then, merely "sons of worthlessness," worthless, good-for-nothing men. The <span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary </span>ingeniously accounts for the use of Belial in the English Version here, and in other places in the Old Testament, by referring to the contrast drawn by St. Paul between Christ and Belial, as if Belial were the name of an idol. or the personification of evil (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-15.htm" title="And what concord has Christ with Belial? or what part has he that believes with an infidel?">2Corinthians 6:15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">They knew not the Lord.</span>--The whole conduct of these high priestly officials showed they were utter unbelievers. They used their sacred position merely as affording an opportunity for their selfish extortions; and, as is so often the case now, as it was then, their unbelief was the source of their moral worthlessness (see <a href="/1_samuel/2-22.htm" title="Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.">1Samuel 2:22</a>). "Hophni and Phinehas (the two sons of Eli) are, for students of ecclesiastical history, eminently suggestive characters. They are true exemplars of the grasping and worldly clergy of all ages.<p>"It was the sacrificial feasts that gave occasion for their rapacity. It was the dances and assemblies of the women in the vineyards and before the sacred feast that gave occasion for their debaucheries. They were the worst development of the lawlessness of the age, penetrating, as in the case of the wandering Levite of the Book of Judges, into the most sacred offices.<p>"But the coarseness of these vices does not make the moral less pointed for all times. The three-pronged fork which fishes up the seething flesh is the earliest type of grasping at pluralities and Church preferments by base means, the open profligacy at the door of the Tabernacle is the type of many a scandal brought on the Christian Church by the selfishness or sensuality of the ministers."--Dean Stanley, <span class= "ital">On the Jewish Churchy </span>Lecture 17, Part I.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> worthless men (see on 1 Samuel 1:16). <span class="cmt_word">They knew not Jehovah.</span> He had never been revealed to their consciences, and so his fear had no influence upon their lives. The next words, in ver. 13, are difficult, but lit. mean, "The legal right of the priests, towards, or as respects, the people." On this account the Vulgate and several commentators couple the sentence with what precedes: "they knew neither Jehovah, nor their own legal rights." But the word <span class="accented">also</span> in ver. 15 is incompatible with this rendering; for if what is mentioned there be illegal, so must also the practice be which is recorded here. But neither does <span class="accented">custom</span> give the sense; for the Hebrews has not priest's (sing.) as the A.V., but <span class="accented">of the priests</span>, of all priests generally, and not of Eli merely and his sons. The right translation is that given by the Sept., Syriac, and Chaldee, namely, "the due of the priests from the people," on which see <a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31-35</a>. In the original this is put absolutely "And as to the priests' due from the people, when," etc., but our language requires some insertion to make it read more smoothly. "And as to the due of the priests from the people, the manner of its exaction was as follows: When," etc. But besides the due and legal portion, which, nevertheless, they took in an illegal way, they demanded a part of the flesh reserved for the feast of the offerer, and to which they had absolutely no right (see <a href="/leviticus/8-31.htm">Leviticus 8:31</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/35-13.htm">2 Chronicles 35:13</a>). The legal due of the priest was the right shoulder and the wave breast; but before he took them they were to be consecrated to God by the burning of the fat upon the altar (<a href="/leviticus/3-5.htm">Leviticus 3:5</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31, 34</a>). It is worth observing that the people seem well acquainted with the words of the Law, and are indignant because the priests, its proper guardians, do not abide literally by them. This contempt of the Law distressed their religious susceptibilites, while the cupidity of Eli's sons offended their moral nature. And so <span class="cmt_word">men abhorred the offering of Jehovah.</span> Lit. it is the <span class="accented">minchah</span>, the unbloody sacrifice, or meat offering, but it is put here forevery kind of sacrificial offering. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/2-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
