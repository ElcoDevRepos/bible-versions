In the biblical narrative, Saul's reign is marked by disobedience to God, as seen in earlier chapters (<a href="/1_samuel/15-24.htm">1 Samuel 15:24</a>). His confession here echoes the broader biblical theme of repentance, though Saul's repentance often lacks the depth and sincerity seen in figures like David (Psalm 51).<p><b>Come back, David my son.</b><br>Saul's use of "my son" indicates a personal and familial relationship, highlighting the tragedy of their conflict. David was once a favored member of Saul's court and his son-in-law (<a href="/1_samuel/18-27.htm">1 Samuel 18:27</a>). This plea for David's return suggests a desire for reconciliation, though it is complicated by Saul's previous attempts on David's life (<a href="/1_samuel/19.htm">1 Samuel 19:1</a>).<p><b>I will never harm you again,</b><br>Saul's promise not to harm David is significant given his history of pursuing David out of jealousy and fear (<a href="/1_samuel/18-8.htm">1 Samuel 18:8-9</a>). This statement can be seen as an attempt to restore trust, though it is undermined by Saul's inconsistent behavior throughout the narrative.<p><b>because today you considered my life precious.</b><br>David's decision to spare Saul's life, despite having the opportunity to kill him, demonstrates his respect for God's anointed king (<a href="/1_samuel/26-9.htm">1 Samuel 26:9-11</a>). This act of mercy reflects David's character and foreshadows the teachings of Jesus on loving one's enemies (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>).<p><b>I have played the fool and have committed a grave error!&#8221;</b><br>Saul's admission of folly and error is a poignant moment of self-reflection. The term "fool" in biblical literature often denotes someone who acts contrary to God's wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). Saul's acknowledgment of his mistakes highlights the tragic nature of his kingship, which is marked by a failure to fully submit to God's will. This contrasts with David, who, despite his own sins, is described as a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

He seems to blame himself here, as the Dean of Canterbury well suggests, for putting himself again in David's power through overweening confidence in his own strength. He reproaches himself with the unguarded state of his camp, but he pledges himself to do no harm to David for the future. He even begs that he will return to his court. But in these words, and also in his blessing of David (<a href="/1_samuel/26-25.htm" title="Then Saul said to David, Blessed be you, my son David: you shall both do great things, and also shall still prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.">1Samuel 26:25</a>), there is a ring of falseness; and this was evidently the impression made on the outlaw, for he not only silently declined the royal overtures, but almost immediately removed from the dominions of Saul altogether, feeling that for him and his there was no longer any hope of security in the land of Israel so long as his foe, King Saul, lived.<p>Here the two whom Samuel had anointed as kings--the king who has forfeited his crown, and the king of the golden future--parted for ever. They never looked on each other's faces again; not even when the great warrior Saul by dead was his former friend able to take a farewell look at the face he once loved so well. The kindest services his faithful subjects of Jabesh Gilead could show to their king's dishonoured remains, for which they had risked their lives, was at once, with all solemnity and mourning, to burn the disfigured body, and to draw a veil of flame over the mutilated corpse of Saul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have sinned.</span> Saul's answer here is very different from that in <a href="/1_samuel/24-17.htm">1 Samuel 24:17-21</a>, where the main idea was wonder that David should with such magnanimity spare the life of an enemy so manifestly delivered into his hand. Here a sense of vexation seems uppermost, and of annoyance, not merely because his purpose was frustrated, but because his own military arrangements had been so unsoldierlike. <span class="cmt_word">I have played the fool.</span> His first enterprise had ended in placing his life in David's power, and it was folly indeed a second time to repeat the attempt. But though the words of Saul convey the idea rather of vexation with himself than of sorrow for his maliciousness, yet in one point there is a sign of better things. He bids David return, evidently with reference to the grief expressed with such genuine feeling by David at being driven away from Jehovah's land. It was of course impossible, as Saul had given David's wife to another, and David had himself married two other women, but at least it expressed a right and kindly feeling. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/26-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1448;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
