His death marked the end of an era of direct prophetic leadership in Israel. Samuel was instrumental in anointing the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David, and his death left a spiritual void. His role as a prophet was crucial, as he was a mediator between God and the people, and his absence would have been deeply felt. This sets the stage for the events that follow, highlighting the spiritual decline under Saul's leadership.<p><b>and all Israel had mourned for him</b><br>The mourning of all Israel indicates Samuel's widespread influence and respect among the people. Mourning customs in ancient Israel included weeping, fasting, and wearing sackcloth, reflecting the deep sorrow felt by the nation. Samuel's leadership was pivotal in uniting the tribes and guiding them spiritually, and his death would have been a national loss, emphasizing the gravity of the situation in Israel.<p><b>and buried him in Ramah, his own city</b><br>Ramah, located in the territory of Benjamin, was Samuel's birthplace and home. It served as a center for his prophetic ministry. The burial in his own city signifies the honor and respect given to him, as it was customary to bury individuals in their family tombs or places of significance. This also underscores the personal connection Samuel had with his community and his role as a local leader.<p><b>And Saul had removed the mediums and spiritists from the land</b><br>Saul's removal of mediums and spiritists was in obedience to the Mosaic Law, which prohibited such practices (<a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>). This action reflects an earlier commitment to uphold God's commandments, as these practices were associated with paganism and idolatry. However, the context of Saul's later actions reveals a contradiction, as he eventually seeks out a medium, indicating his spiritual decline and desperation. This phrase sets up the tension between Saul's initial obedience and his subsequent disobedience, highlighting the theme of incomplete faithfulness to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel was a pivotal figure in Israel's history, anointing both Saul and David as kings.

His death marked the end of a stabilizing spiritual influence.<p>&#8226; Without his counsel, Saul loses a faithful voice that once confronted his disobedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a> quietly underscores the reality: everyone faces death, even giants of faith like Samuel, affirming Scripture&#8217;s literal historical claim.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All Israel had mourned for him</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and all Israel had mourned for him&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Corporate mourning highlights Samuel&#8217;s nationwide impact, much like Israel mourning Moses thirty days (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-8.htm">Deuteronomy 34:8</a>) or Aaron (<a href="/numbers/20-29.htm">Numbers 20:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Mourning acknowledges loss but also honors God&#8217;s servant (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase shows unity: though factions existed, grief over Samuel briefly united the people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Buried him in Ramah, his own city</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;and buried him in Ramah, his own city.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Ramah was Samuel&#8217;s lifelong base (<a href="/1_samuel/7-17.htm">1 Samuel 7:17</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/1-19.htm">1 Samuel 1:19</a>). Burying him there keeps his legacy tied to the community he served.<p>&#8226; Burial in one&#8217;s hometown echoes <a href="/genesis/23-19.htm">Genesis 23:19</a> (Sarah in Hebron) and <a href="/2_kings/22-20.htm">2 Kings 22:20</a> (King Josiah in his tomb), affirming respect for heritage and covenant land.<p>&#8226; The verse shows tangible closure; Samuel&#8217;s work on earth is complete, yet his influence lingers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And Saul had removed the mediums and spiritists from the land</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;And Saul had removed the mediums and spiritists from the land.&#8221;<p>&#8226; At first glance this seems like an abrupt topic change, but it exposes a deeper tension: Saul once obeyed God&#8217;s law (<a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>) by expelling occult practitioners, yet will soon contradict himself at Endor (<a href="/1_samuel/28-7.htm">1 Samuel 28:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement legitimizes Scripture&#8217;s moral standard: God&#8217;s people are to reject occultism (<a href="/2_kings/23-24.htm">2 Kings 23:24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/8-19.htm">Isaiah 8:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse lays groundwork for a tragic irony: Saul&#8217;s desperation will override his earlier obedience, showing how far he has drifted without Samuel&#8217;s guidance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/28-3.htm">1 Samuel 28:3</a> serves as a pause before the dramatic encounter at Endor. It reminds us that Samuel&#8217;s death removed a vital prophetic voice, the nation honored him deeply, and Saul initially upheld God&#8217;s ban on occult practices. These details combine to highlight a spiritual vacuum in Israel and the inner conflict brewing in Saul&#8217;s heart&#8212;a conflict that will soon push him to violate his own decree and seek forbidden counsel, underscoring the consequences of drifting from God&#8217;s clear Word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Now Samuel was dead.</span>--A statement here repeated to introduce the strange, sad story which follows.

In other words, the compiler says: "Now Samuel, whom Saul was so anxious to see, was dead and buried, and the possessors of familiar spirits, whose aid Saul was about to invoke to carry out his purpose, had long since been put out, by his own order, from the land."
