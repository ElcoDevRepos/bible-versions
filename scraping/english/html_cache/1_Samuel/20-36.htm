The use of a boy or servant for such tasks was common in ancient Israelite society, reflecting the hierarchical structure and the roles assigned within households. This interaction highlights Jonathan's status and the trust placed in servants for carrying out important tasks.<p><b>&#8220;Run and find the arrows I shoot.&#8221;</b><br>Jonathan's instruction to the boy is part of a prearranged signal between him and David. This method of communication was necessary due to the dangerous political climate, as King Saul sought David's life. The use of arrows as a signal demonstrates the ingenuity required to convey messages secretly. This also reflects the broader biblical theme of God providing wisdom and protection to His chosen ones in times of peril.<p><b>And as the boy ran,</b><br>The boy's obedience and quick action are indicative of the loyalty and efficiency expected of servants. This moment underscores the urgency of the situation, as Jonathan and David's plan depended on precise timing and execution. The boy's role, though minor, is crucial in the unfolding of God's plan for David's safety and future kingship.<p><b>Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him.</b><br>Jonathan's action is both literal and symbolic. The arrow shot beyond the boy was the predetermined sign to David that he must flee, as Saul's intentions were hostile. This act of shooting the arrow can be seen as a type of Christ, where Jonathan, a prince, sacrifices his relationship with his father for the sake of his friend, foreshadowing Christ's sacrificial love. The arrow going beyond also symbolizes the idea of God's plans and purposes extending beyond human understanding and immediate circumstances.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul and a close friend of David.

Similar use of everyday actions for divine purposes appears when Gideon overhears Midianite dreams (<a href="/judges/7-13.htm">Judges 7:13&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; The urgency in the verb &#8220;Run&#8221; underscores the danger David faces and Jonathan&#8217;s determination to warn him swiftly (<a href="/psalms/141-9.htm">Psalm 141:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And as the boy ran</b><p>&#8226; Immediate obedience shows the servant&#8217;s trust, a trait praised throughout Scripture (cf. <a href="/2_kings/5-14.htm">2 Kings 5:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/8-9.htm">Matthew 8:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The running creates distance, ensuring the lad cannot overhear the conversation Jonathan soon intends for David alone&#8212;an example of prudent secrecy (<a href="/proverbs/11-13.htm">Proverbs 11:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him.</b><p>&#8226; By sending the arrow past the servant, Jonathan fulfills the prearranged sign of peril: David must flee (<a href="/1_samuel/20-37.htm">1 Samuel 20:37&#8211;38</a>).<p>&#8226; The arrow&#8217;s flight symbolizes truth cutting through danger, much like the &#8220;arrow&#8221; of God&#8217;s word exposing hidden intents (<a href="/psalms/45-5.htm">Psalm 45:5</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Jonathan&#8217;s action costs him personally&#8212;loyalty to David risks Saul&#8217;s wrath&#8212;yet he values covenant faithfulness over self-interest (<a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>; <a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jonathan turns a simple archery outing into a lifeline for David. Addressing his servant openly, he commands him to retrieve arrows, ensuring both a credible cover story and a vehicle for a covert signal. The servant&#8217;s swift compliance provides the space Jonathan needs; the arrow shot &#8220;beyond&#8221; the boy confirms to David that Saul&#8217;s hostility is real and immediate. Through this verse we witness loyal friendship, wise strategy, and God&#8217;s providence working through everyday actions to protect His chosen servant.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">He shot an arrow beyond him.</span>--This was the sign agreed on if all was over for David at the court of Saul. Expositors are in a little difficulty, though, here, as only <span class= "ital">one arrow </span>is mentioned, whereas "three" had to be shot according to the terms of the understanding. We cannot imagine, as some have suggested, that "Jonathan shortened the affair, and shot only once, considering that there was danger in delay," and that every moment was of consequence; had there been such need of haste, the parting scene would have been cut even shorter. It is better, with Keil, to assume that the "singular" here stands in an indefinite general way, the author not thinking it needful, after what he had before said, to state that Jonathan shot three arrows one after another.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/20-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
