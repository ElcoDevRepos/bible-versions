Saul's servants act as intermediaries, a common practice in ancient Near Eastern royal courts, where direct communication with the king was often mediated through trusted officials. This reflects the hierarchical structure of the society and the importance of protocol in royal matters.<p><b>he replied, &#8220;Does it seem trivial in your sight to be the son-in-law of the king?</b><br>David's response highlights his humility and awareness of the honor and responsibility associated with becoming part of the royal family. In ancient Israel, marriage alliances were significant, often used to secure political stability and alliances. David's rhetorical question underscores the gravity of the offer, contrasting his humble origins with the elevated status of being the king's son-in-law. This also foreshadows David's future as king, where he will continue to demonstrate humility and reliance on God.<p><b>I am a poor man and lightly esteemed.&#8221;</b><br>David acknowledges his low social standing and lack of wealth, which would typically disqualify him from marrying into royalty. This statement reflects the socio-economic realities of the time, where wealth and status were crucial for forming alliances. David's humility is a recurring theme in his life, aligning with biblical principles that God exalts the humble (<a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>). This humility is a type of Christ, who, though King of Kings, took on the form of a servant (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>). David's acknowledgment of his lowly status also sets the stage for God's providence and favor in elevating him to kingship, demonstrating that divine selection often defies human expectations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd who was anointed by Samuel to be the future king of Israel.

The king&#8217;s distance hints at hidden motives, contrasting with God&#8217;s transparent dealings with His people (<a href="/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>).<p>&#8226; David listens without suspicion, modeling the trust that later allows him to spare Saul twice (<a href="/1_samuel/24-4.htm">1 Samuel 24:4&#8211;7</a>; 26:9&#8211;11).<p>&#8226; The servants&#8217; role reflects an honor/shame culture: royal messages carry weight even when delivered by intermediaries, as seen earlier with Samuel&#8217;s prophetic words reaching Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/15-1.htm">1 Samuel 15:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he replied, &#8220;Does it seem trivial in your sight to be the son-in-law of the king?</b><p>&#8226; David asks a rhetorical question, highlighting how serious and weighty a royal marriage is. A covenant with the crown is never &#8220;trivial&#8221; (compare <a href="/1_samuel/18-18.htm">1 Samuel 18:18</a>).<p>&#8226; His humility mirrors Saul&#8217;s earlier self-view: &#8220;Am I not ... from the smallest of the tribes?&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/9-21.htm">1 Samuel 9:21</a>). Both men start low; only David stays humble.<p>&#8226; Reverence for God-given authority shines through. Later David refuses to &#8220;stretch out my hand against the LORD&#8217;s anointed&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>), proving this respect genuine.<p>&#8226; The question also exposes the servants&#8217; casual tone. Royal privilege can dull sensitivity, but David&#8217;s heart stays alert to the gravity of spiritual and civic covenants (<a href="/2_samuel/7-18.htm">2 Samuel 7:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I am a poor man and lightly esteemed.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Financial poverty: as a shepherd-warrior, David lacks the dowry a king would expect (<a href="/genesis/34-12.htm">Genesis 34:12</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/17-25.htm">1 Samuel 17:25</a>). Saul exploits this by demanding &#8220;a hundred Philistine foreskins&#8221; instead of silver (<a href="/1_samuel/18-25.htm">1 Samuel 18:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Social standing: David is &#8220;lightly esteemed,&#8221; still the youngest son from Bethlehem (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11</a>).

Later he dances &#8220;before the LORD with all his might&#8221; despite Michal&#8217;s contempt (<a href="/2_samuel/6-21.htm">2 Samuel 6:21&#8211;22</a>), showing the same disregard for human status.<p>&#8226; Foreshadowing the Messiah: Jesus is likewise &#8220;despised and rejected by men&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>) yet becomes the exalted King, fulfilling the pattern God sets with David.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David&#8217;s response in <a href="/1_samuel/18-23.htm">1 Samuel 18:23</a> reveals a humble heart aware of the immense honor and responsibility tied to royal covenant. He respects the king&#8217;s office, confesses his own poverty, and refuses to treat lofty privilege lightly. This humility prepares him for God&#8217;s elevation, illustrating the divine principle that &#8220;whoever humbles himself will be exalted&#8221; (<a href="/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">I am a poor man.</span>--David dwells upon this fact of his utter inability to give the expected costly offering for the princess.
