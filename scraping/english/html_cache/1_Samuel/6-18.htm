The gold rats were part of these offerings, symbolizing the plague that had afflicted them. The number of gold rats matched the number of Philistine cities, indicating a comprehensive acknowledgment of the impact across their territory. This reflects the Philistines' recognition of the power of the God of Israel and their attempt to make restitution.<p><b>belonging to the five rulers</b><br>The Philistines were organized into a pentapolis, a group of five city-states, each ruled by a lord. These cities were Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. The mention of the five rulers underscores the political structure of the Philistines and highlights the widespread nature of the affliction they faced. This structure is also seen in other ancient Near Eastern cultures, where city-states were common.<p><b>the fortified cities and their outlying villages</b><br>The fortified cities refer to the main urban centers of the Philistine pentapolis, which were well-defended and significant in terms of military and economic power. The outlying villages would have been smaller settlements that supported these cities. This distinction emphasizes the extent of the Philistine territory and the reach of the plague, affecting both major cities and rural areas.<p><b>And the large rock on which they placed the ark of the LORD</b><br>The large rock served as a makeshift altar or resting place for the Ark when it was returned to Israelite territory. This rock became a significant landmark, symbolizing the return of God's presence to His people. It also serves as a tangible reminder of God's power and the consequences of disrespecting the sacred.<p><b>stands to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh</b><br>Beth-shemesh was a Levitical city in the territory of Judah, strategically located near the border with Philistine lands. The mention of the rock standing "to this day" suggests the enduring memory of this event in Israelite history.

The rats matched &#8220;the number of Philistine cities,&#8221; symbolizing that every ruler&#8212;and every city under each ruler&#8212;shared responsibility for the sin of seizing the Ark (<a href="/1_samuel/5-8.htm">1 Samuel 5:8</a>; 6:17).<p>&#8226; The gift was a tangible confession: &#8220;What struck us in each city, we now return in likeness to the LORD.&#8221; Similar representative offerings show up elsewhere, such as the twelve stones for the twelve tribes in <a href="/joshua/4-3.htm">Joshua 4:3&#8211;7</a>.<p>&#8226; By noting the exact correspondence, the text underlines God&#8217;s fairness: one rat for every city, no city overlooked, no tribute withheld. Judgment had been total; restitution must be total (<a href="/numbers/5-6.htm">Numbers 5:6&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;the fortified cities and their outlying villages.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The verse zooms out to include both city centers and rural surroundings&#8212;every place the Philistine rulers governed. Like <a href="/psalms/48-12.htm">Psalm 48:12&#8211;13</a>, which calls Israel to &#8220;walk about Zion, count her towers,&#8221; this clause stresses that God sees every tower, every wall, every hamlet.<p>&#8226; Fortified cities boasted walls and armies, yet they could not resist God&#8217;s hand (<a href="/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6</a>). Even villages without walls felt the plague. As <a href="/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a> reminds us, &#8220;If calamity comes to a city, has not the LORD caused it?&#8221;<p>&#8226; The inclusiveness affirms the literal reach of the plague&#8212;and the offering. No Philistine could claim exemption; likewise, no part of our lives lies outside God&#8217;s rightful claim (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;And the large rock on which they placed the ark of the LORD stands to this day&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Scripture often points to enduring memorials (<a href="/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18</a>; <a href="/joshua/4-9.htm">Joshua 4:9</a>). Here, the rock remained visible when the book of Samuel was written, testifying that these events happened in real space and time.<p>&#8226; The public nature of the rock showed transparency: Israel could inspect where the Ark rested, just as the Philistines had publicly returned it.<p>&#8226; Its permanence also hints at God&#8217;s unchanging holiness&#8212;He who once judged the Philistines is the same &#8220;yesterday and today and forever&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Beth-shemesh, a priestly town in Judah (<a href="/joshua/21-13.htm">Joshua 21:13&#8211;16</a>), lay on the border with Philistia. God chose a Levitical field&#8212;an appropriate place&#8212;for the Ark&#8217;s first stop back in Israel.<p>&#8226; Naming &#8220;Joshua&#8221; roots the story in a known family, inviting readers then and now to verify the location (cf. <a href="/john/1-45.htm">John 1:45</a>, &#8220;We have found the one Moses wrote about&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The field setting contrasts with the tabernacle&#8217;s holy precincts; the Ark&#8217;s exile was not yet over. Yet even in a field, God&#8217;s glory demanded reverence, as the tragedy of the men of Beth-shemesh soon showed (<a href="/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every phrase of <a href="/1_samuel/6-18.htm">1 Samuel 6:18</a> underscores the same truth: God deals with nations and individuals in concrete, measurable ways. The Philistines&#8217; matching golden rats acknowledged universal guilt; listing cities and villages declared that no corner escaped His notice; the enduring rock and named field anchored the narrative in geography and history. Together, these details affirm the literal accuracy of Scripture and call us to the same full, transparent acknowledgment of God&#8217;s sovereignty today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18)<span class= "bld">And the golden mice.</span>--We have here a far greater number of "golden mice" mentioned as being offered in expiation than appear specified in the directions of the priests and diviners (<a href="/1_samuel/6-4.htm" title="Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him? They answered, Five golden tumors, and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.">1Samuel 6:4</a>). The truth was that whilst the human sickness was confined to the five cities, the plague of field mice no doubt extended over the whole country. The inhabitants of all the villages were anxious to do their part to propitiate the insulted Hebrew God, and to get rid of the plague which was devastating their fields and vineyards; hence this large offering, so much in excess of what was suggested by the diviners.<p><span class= "bld">The great stone of Abel.</span>--The LXX. Version reads here, "And this great stone on which they placed the Ark of Jehovah, which is in the field of Joshua the Beth-shemite, is a witness unto this day." With this reading the Chaldee Targum substantially agrees. The Hebrew text here is hopelessly corrupt; the copies which the Greek translators and the Chaldee Targumist apparently had before them, instead of the word "Avel" (Abel), which signifies mourning, read the word <span class= "ital">?ven, </span>a stone, and the punctuation of <span class= "ital">v'ad, </span>"and unto," in the last clause was evidently (<span class= "ital">v'ed</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>"and a witness." If the reading Avel be the true one ("even unto the great Avel"), then the conjecture of R. D. Kimchi is probably right, that this stone was known as the Great Avel (or Abel), "the great mourning," owing to the terrible judicial calamity, related in the next three verses (<a href="/context/1_samuel/6-19.htm" title="And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and three score and ten men: and the people lamented, because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter.">1Samuel 6:19-21</a>), which happened there. With this slight change a very good sense is obtained.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/6-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The number of gold</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1464;&#1431;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;z&#257;&#183;h&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
