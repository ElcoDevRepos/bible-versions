The Philistines were long-standing enemies of Israel, and David's presence in Gath was significant because he was fleeing from King Saul. Achish's role as a Philistine leader highlights the tension between Israel and the Philistines, a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament. This moment foreshadows David's complex relationship with the Philistines, as he later seeks refuge among them again.<p><b>Look, you can see that the man is insane!</b><br>David feigned madness to protect himself from potential harm, as he was recognized by the servants of Achish. In ancient Near Eastern culture, madness was often seen as a sign of divine displeasure or possession, and it could evoke fear or pity. David's behavior here is a strategic move to avoid being perceived as a threat. This act of feigned insanity is a testament to David's resourcefulness and survival instincts, which are evident throughout his life.<p><b>Why have you brought him to me?</b><br>Achish's question reflects his surprise and perhaps irritation at having a seemingly madman brought before him. In the context of the time, kings were often approached with matters of importance, and bringing someone who appeared insane would have been seen as a waste of the king's time. This question underscores the unexpected nature of David's presence in Gath and highlights the tension between David's true identity and his current predicament. The situation also illustrates the theme of God's providence, as David's ruse successfully leads to his escape from a potentially dangerous situation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, who is fleeing from King Saul and feigns madness to escape danger in Gath.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/achish.htm">Achish</a></b><br>The king of Gath, a Philistine city, who encounters David and questions his sanity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gath.htm">Gath</a></b><br>A Philistine city, known as the hometown of Goliath, where David seeks refuge.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/servants_of_achish.htm">Servants of Achish</a></b><br>They bring David to Achish, suspecting his identity and intentions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/feigned_madness.htm">Feigned Madness</a></b><br>David's act of pretending to be insane to avoid being recognized and harmed by the Philistines.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_protection_in_unlikely_ways.htm">God's Protection in Unlikely Ways</a></b><br>David's feigned madness is an example of God using unexpected means to protect His chosen ones.

He realizes his presence among the Philistines is dangerous, so he feigns madness. Verse 14 captures King Achish&#8217;s reaction. Compare <a href="/1_samuel/19-10.htm">1 Samuel 19:10&#8211;12</a>, where David&#8217;s life was first threatened, and <a href="/bsb/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>: title, which David later wrote about this episode.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Then Achish said to his servants&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The king publicly addresses his court, signaling an official assessment of David&#8217;s behavior.<p>&#8226; His words reveal political caution; harboring a perceived madman could undermine royal dignity (see <a href="/esther/1-15.htm">Esther 1:15&#8211;18</a>, where Persian nobles worry about precedent).<p>&#8226; Achish&#8217;s authority is on display, yet God is using even a pagan ruler to shield His chosen servant (cf. <a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Look, you can see that the man is insane!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Look&#8221; invites the servants to observe what Achish deems obvious, emphasizing the convincing nature of David&#8217;s act (cf. <a href="/genesis/26-8.htm">Genesis 26:8&#8211;9</a>, where Isaac&#8217;s actions reveal his ruse).<p>&#8226; By labeling David insane, Achish relieves himself of responsibility; a madman poses no military threat, allowing the king to dismiss him without provoking Saul (see <a href="/acts/26-24.htm">Acts 26:24</a>, where Festus calls Paul insane to avoid the force of his testimony).<p>&#8226; God turns David&#8217;s pretense into protection, fulfilling <a href="/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4</a>, &#8220;I sought the LORD, and He answered me and delivered me from all my fears.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Why have you brought him to me?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Achish rebukes his servants for admitting David, underscoring palace protocol and hinting at fear of divine or social contamination from madness (cf. <a href="/leviticus/13-45.htm">Leviticus 13:45&#8211;46</a> regarding isolation of the unclean).<p>&#8226; The question distances the king from any blame; he assigns responsibility to his servants while letting David slip away.<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s strategy succeeds because the Lord grants him favor even among enemies (<a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Implications for David</b><p>&#8226; David&#8217;s apparent weakness becomes his escape route&#8212;an example of God&#8217;s strength perfected in human frailty (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p>&#8226; This incident foreshadows later moments when David relies not on weaponry but on God&#8217;s guidance (<a href="/1_samuel/26-8.htm">1 Samuel 26:8&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; It also highlights David&#8217;s adaptability; he is willing to use unconventional means while trusting God for ultimate deliverance (<a href="/psalms/56-3.htm">Psalm 56:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Applications for believers today</b><p>&#8226; God can use unexpected methods&#8212;even misunderstood actions&#8212;to protect His people (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Humility and dependence on the Lord, rather than bravado, often mark true spiritual wisdom (<a href="/james/3-13.htm">James 3:13</a>).<p>&#8226; When falsely judged or labeled, believers can remember David&#8217;s experience and entrust their reputation to God (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Verse 14 shows Achish misreading David&#8217;s ruse as madness, a misunderstanding God turns into a shield for His anointed.

In old times, as now, in many parts of the East, the insane are looked upon as persons in some peculiar way possessed by, and therefore under the more immediate protection of, Deity. The life then of the hunted fugitive was perfectly safe from the moment the Philistines considered him mad.<p>There is a curious legend in the Talmud in which several events recorded in the Biblical account are confused. Part of it apparently refers to this strange choice of his of Phillstia as a place of refuge. "One day <span class= "ital">Satan </span>appeared to him (David) in the shape of a gazelle, which, eluding his pursuit, decoyed him into the land of the Philistines. 'Ah!' said Ishbi-benob, when he caught sight of him, 'art thou the man that slew my brother, Goliath?' So saying, he seized and bound him."--Treatise <span class= "ital">Sanhedrin, </span>fol. 95, cols 1, 2. The wild legend goes on to explain how, partly by miracle, partly with the aid of Abishai, David slew Ishbi-benob and escaped.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14, 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The man is mad.</span> Achish supposes that David's madness was real, and "drove him away" (<a href="/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, title). Here we have only his contemptuous words, declaring that he had madmen enough of his own, and needed no more. As madmen were looked upon in old time as possessed by the Deity, and therefore as persons who must not be interfered with, they probably presumed upon the liberty granted them, and gave much annoyance. <span class="cmt_word">In my presence.</span> Rather, "against me." Achish feared personal injury. <span class="cmt_word">Shall this fellow come into my house?</span> A strong negative taking the form of a question. It means, David shall not enter into my service (comp. <a href="/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, title).
