It was often observed with special sacrifices and feasts (<a href="/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10, 28</a>:11-15). The mention of the "second day" indicates the continuation of the New Moon festival, which could last multiple days. This context highlights the importance of the occasion and the expectation for David's presence, as he was a member of Saul's court.<p><b>David&#8217;s place was still empty,</b><br>David's absence is significant, as he was a key figure in Saul's court and a close friend of Jonathan. His empty place at the table symbolizes the growing tension and estrangement between David and Saul. This absence foreshadows David's eventual separation from Saul's household and his rise to kingship, as God had anointed him through Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>).<p><b>and Saul asked his son Jonathan,</b><br>Saul's inquiry to Jonathan underscores the close relationship between Jonathan and David. Jonathan's loyalty to David is a central theme in this narrative, contrasting with Saul's growing animosity. This interaction sets the stage for Jonathan's role as a mediator and protector of David, reflecting the covenantal friendship they shared (<a href="/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Why hasn&#8217;t the son of Jesse come to the meal</b><br>Referring to David as "the son of Jesse" rather than by name may indicate Saul's attempt to distance himself emotionally from David. This phrase also highlights David's humble origins, as Jesse was a Bethlehemite, emphasizing the theme of God choosing the unlikely and lowly to fulfill His purposes (<a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>).<p><b>either yesterday or today?&#8221;</b><br>Saul's concern over David's absence for two consecutive days suggests his growing suspicion and paranoia. This question reveals Saul's awareness of David's importance and his potential threat to Saul's throne. The repeated absence heightens the tension and foreshadows the impending conflict between Saul and David, as Saul's jealousy and fear continue to escalate (<a href="/1_samuel/18-8.htm">1 Samuel 18:8-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Anointed by God to be the future king of Israel, David is currently in hiding due to King Saul's jealousy and intent to kill him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who has become increasingly paranoid and hostile towards David, seeing him as a threat to his throne.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>Saul's son and David's close friend, who is caught between his loyalty to his father and his covenant friendship with David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/new_moon_festival.htm">New Moon Festival</a></b><br>A significant religious observance in ancient Israel, marking the beginning of the month with sacrifices and communal meals.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesse.htm">Jesse</a></b><br>David's father, often referred to by Saul as a way to diminish David's status.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_loyalty.htm">The Cost of Loyalty</a></b><br>Jonathan's loyalty to David, despite his father's hostility, teaches us about the cost and value of true friendship and loyalty.

The verse invites us to trust God&#8217;s timing, honor covenant loyalty, and recognize that rejecting God&#8217;s chosen servant ultimately reveals a heart resisting God Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">On the morrow.</span>--David's continued absence on the second day of the feast awoke Saul's suspicion, and he asked his son, who was sitting by him, what was the reason of his friend's absence, aware that no accident connected with ceremonial defilement would keep him away two following days.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 27-29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the morrow, which was the second day of the month.</span> Hebrew, "on the morrow of the new moon, the second day."
