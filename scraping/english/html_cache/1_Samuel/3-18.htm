Samuel, a young boy serving under Eli, receives a difficult message from God regarding Eli's household. Despite the challenging nature of the prophecy, Samuel faithfully conveys the entire message to Eli, demonstrating his commitment to truth and transparency. This act of honesty is significant in the biblical narrative, as it sets the tone for Samuel's future role as a prophet and leader in Israel. The phrase also reflects the biblical principle of speaking truthfully, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a>, which encourages believers to speak truthfully to one another. Samuel's willingness to deliver God's message without alteration or omission is a testament to his character and foreshadows his future as a trustworthy prophet.<p><b>&#8220;He is the LORD,&#8221; replied Eli.</b><br>Eli's response acknowledges the sovereignty and authority of God. By stating "He is the LORD," Eli recognizes God's ultimate control over the situation and submits to His will. This phrase reflects a deep understanding of God's nature as the supreme ruler and judge, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament. Eli's acceptance of God's judgment, despite its harshness, demonstrates a level of humility and resignation to divine authority. This acknowledgment of God's sovereignty is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>, where Job submits to God's will in the face of personal loss. Eli's response serves as a reminder of the importance of recognizing and submitting to God's authority in all circumstances.<p><b>&#8220;Let Him do what is good in His eyes.&#8221;</b><br>Eli's statement here is an expression of faith and trust in God's wisdom and justice. By saying "Let Him do what is good in His eyes," Eli submits to God's judgment, trusting that whatever God decides is ultimately for the best, even if it involves personal loss or suffering. This reflects a biblical understanding that God's ways and thoughts are higher than human understanding, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>. Eli's acceptance of God's will, despite the impending judgment on his household, is an example of surrendering to divine providence. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's goodness and righteousness, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>, which assures believers that God works all things for the good of those who love Him. Eli's response is a model of faith and submission to God's perfect will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A young boy serving under Eli in the temple, chosen by God to be a prophet.

His willingness models faithful obedience:<p>- Like Jeremiah, who was told, &#8220;Do not omit a word&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/26-2.htm">Jeremiah 26:2</a>), Samuel holds nothing back.<p>- Paul echoes this standard: &#8220;For I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God&#8221; (<a href="/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a>).<p>- Prophetic responsibility demands completeness; <a href="/ezekiel/3-18.htm">Ezekiel 3:18-19</a> warns that silence makes the watchman guilty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and did not hide a thing from him</b><p>Transparency safeguards both messenger and hearer. Samuel&#8217;s openness:<p>- Mirrors righteous Josiah&#8217;s reception of the entire book of the Law (<a href="/2_kings/22-10.htm">2 Kings 22:10-13</a>).<p>- Reflects <a href="/proverbs/27-5.htm">Proverbs 27:5</a>: &#8220;Better is open rebuke than hidden love.&#8221;<p>- Shows love that refuses to soften truth for comfort, anticipating New-Covenant candor such as Paul&#8217;s confrontation of Peter (<a href="/galatians/2-11.htm">Galatians 2:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;He is the LORD,&#8221; replied Eli</b><p>Eli immediately acknowledges divine authority:<p>- Job does the same after loss: &#8220;The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away&#8221; (<a href="/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a>).<p>- <a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a> grounds this posture: &#8220;The earth is the LORD&#8217;s, and all its fullness.&#8221;<p>- <a href="/isaiah/33-22.htm">Isaiah 33:22</a> declares, &#8220;The LORD is our Judge&#8230; our King; He will save us,&#8221; underscoring that ultimate rulership belongs to God alone. Eli&#8217;s words, though tinged with resignation, are a confession of that sovereignty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Let Him do what is good in His eyes&#8221;</b><p>Eli surrenders to God&#8217;s verdict, accepting both justice and goodness:<p>- David, facing Absalom, says similarly: &#8220;Let Him do to me what seems good to Him&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/15-26.htm">2 Samuel 15:26</a>).<p>- Jesus, the perfect Son, prays, &#8220;Yet not My will, but Yours be done&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-42.htm">Luke 22:42</a>).<p>- Peter urges suffering believers to &#8220;entrust their souls to a faithful Creator while doing good&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/4-19.htm">1 Peter 4:19</a>).<p>Such submission trusts that even severe discipline flows from a God who defines goodness (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/3-18.htm">1 Samuel 3:18</a> captures a complete prophetic exchange: Samuel fearlessly declares every word God gave; Eli humbly bows to the Lord&#8217;s sovereign judgment.

He saw how deeply he had failed in his high office, how he had allowed worldly considerations to influence his conduct, how he had been tried and found wanting; and now, without a murmur, he submits to the righteous judgment of his God, he leaves himself in God's hands, and never tries to justify himself and his past conduct. <span class= "ital">Now </span>it was probably too late to attempt any reformation in the priestly life. The influence and power of Hophni and Phinehas were too strong for his enfeebled will to set aside. Eli was probably in his last days little more than a puppet in their hands.
