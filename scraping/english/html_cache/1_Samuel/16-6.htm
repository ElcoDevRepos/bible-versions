The context is that God has rejected Saul as king and sent Samuel to anoint a new king from among Jesse's sons. Bethlehem, a small town in Judah, is significant as the birthplace of David and later Jesus Christ, fulfilling the prophecy of the Messiah's lineage (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>).<p><b>Samuel saw Eliab</b><br>Eliab is the eldest son of Jesse. In ancient Israelite culture, the firstborn son often held a place of prominence and expectation. Samuel, a prophet and judge, initially perceives Eliab as a likely candidate for kingship due to his appearance and stature, reflecting human tendencies to judge by outward appearances.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Surely here before the LORD is His anointed.&#8221;</b><br>Samuel's statement reveals his initial assumption that Eliab is God's chosen one. The term "anointed" refers to the practice of anointing with oil, symbolizing God's selection and empowerment for a specific role, often kingship. This moment foreshadows the anointing of David, a type of Christ, who is the ultimate Anointed One (Messiah). The narrative emphasizes that God's criteria for leadership differ from human expectations, as seen in the subsequent verses where God instructs Samuel not to consider outward appearance but the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, tasked by God to anoint the next king of Israel after Saul's disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/eliab.htm">Eliab</a></b><br>The eldest son of Jesse, initially assumed by Samuel to be God's chosen one due to his appearance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesse.htm">Jesse</a></b><br>The father of David and his brothers, residing in Bethlehem, from whose lineage the future king would be chosen.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethlehem.htm">Bethlehem</a></b><br>The town where Jesse and his family lived, significant as the birthplace of David and later, Jesus Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord's_anointed.htm">The LORD's Anointed</a></b><br>Refers to the person chosen by God to be king, highlighting the divine selection process beyond human judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_perspective_vs._human_perspective.htm">God's Perspective vs. Human Perspective</a></b><br>Humans often judge by outward appearances, but God looks at the heart.

Samuel has come to Bethlehem in obedience to God&#8217;s command (<a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; The simple phrase marks the precise moment God&#8217;s plan begins to unfold in Jesse&#8217;s household, showing that every step is under divine direction much like Abraham&#8217;s servant arriving at Rebekah&#8217;s well (<a href="/genesis/24-27.htm">Genesis 24:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Arrival after sacrifice preparations (<a href="/1_samuel/16-5.htm">1 Samuel 16:5</a>) reminds us that God often pairs worship with revelation, as He did when He met Moses at the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Samuel saw Eliab</b><p>&#8226;

First impressions can mislead even the most faithful servant, echoing how Jacob favored Joseph for his appearance and birth order (<a href="/genesis/37-3.htm">Genesis 37:3</a>).<p>&#8226; God permits Samuel&#8217;s initial reaction to expose the contrast between human sight and divine insight, preparing for the corrective word in the next verse (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Surely here before the LORD is His anointed.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226;

This moment teaches reliance on divine leading rather than human criteria, paralleling <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5</a> &#8211; &#8220;Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/16-6.htm">1 Samuel 16:6</a> captures Samuel&#8217;s arrival, his immediate impression of Eliab, and his confident yet mistaken conclusion that Eliab must be God&#8217;s chosen king. The verse exposes the limitation of judging by appearance and sets the stage for God&#8217;s declaration that He looks at the heart. Through it, we learn to await God&#8217;s assessment rather than our own, trusting that His choices&#8212;though sometimes surprising&#8212;perfectly fulfill His purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">He looked on Eliab.</span>--There was something in the tall and stately presence of the eldest born of Jesse which reminded the old man of the splendid youth of Saul. Eliab seemed to Samuel in all respects a fit successor to the great warrior whom the Lord rejected. But the Divine voice gave no reply back to the prophet's mute questioning; and the other sons of Jesse, an imposing band of gallant youths, passed in review before the old seer, and were severally introduced to him; but the Divine voice only warned the seer that these external advantages of mere human beauty and strength, were no mark of true greatness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6-10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When they were come.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> to the house of Jesse, apparently in the interval between the sacrifice and the feast. The latter we learn in ver. 11 did not take place until after David had been sent for. But many hours would elapse between the sacrifice and the feast, as the victim had to be skinned and prepared for roasting, and finally cooked. This interval was spent in Jesse's house; and when he saw there Eliab, the first born, and observed his tall stature and handsome face, qualities which Samuel had admired in Saul, he <span class="cmt_word">said</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in himself, felt sure, that the goodly youth was <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah's anointed</span> (see on 1 Samuel 2:10, 35; 10:1, etc.), but is warned that these external advantages do not necessarily imply real worth of heart; and as <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah looketh on the heart,</span> his judgment depends, not on appearances, but on reality.
