Saul's order reflects his spiritual decline and willingness to act against God's anointed servants. Doeg the Edomite, a foreigner and Saul's servant, is chosen to carry out this brutal act, highlighting Saul's desperation and the lack of loyalty from his own people. The priests were descendants of Eli, fulfilling the prophecy of judgment against Eli's house (<a href="/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31-33</a>).<p><b>And Doeg the Edomite turned and struck down the priests himself.</b><br>Doeg's identity as an Edomite is significant, as Edomites were often in conflict with Israel. His willingness to kill the priests shows his lack of reverence for Israel's God and his eagerness to gain favor with Saul. This act of violence against the priests, who were mediators between God and the people, underscores the spiritual crisis in Israel under Saul's leadership. It also foreshadows the eventual downfall of Saul's reign.<p><b>On that day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.</b><br>The linen ephod was a priestly garment, signifying their role in worship and service to God. The massacre of eighty-five priests is a devastating blow to the religious life of Israel, as these men were responsible for maintaining the sacrificial system and spiritual guidance. This event is a stark reminder of the consequences of Saul's disobedience and the chaos that ensues when leaders turn away from God's commands. The destruction of the priestly line at Nob also sets the stage for the rise of David, who will restore proper worship and leadership in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_saul.htm">King Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who has become increasingly paranoid and disobedient to God.

Earlier, Saul had accused the priests of conspiracy for aiding David (<a href="/1_samuel/22-13.htm">1 Samuel 22:13</a>). When his own guards hesitated to harm the clergy (22:17), Saul turned to Doeg, the opportunistic Edomite who had already informed on David (21:7; <a href="/psalms/52-1.htm">Psalm 52:1&#8211;4</a>). The moment exposes Saul&#8217;s deep descent: he had once feared disobeying God, yet now he disregards the sanctity of God&#8217;s servants. Contrast his selective mercy toward Agag the Amalekite (15:8&#8211;19) with this ruthless severity&#8212;highlighting how unchecked sin flips moral priorities (<a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>"You turn and strike down the priests!"</b><p>The order is personal and direct. Saul does not merely ask for justice; he commands murder. In Scripture, when a ruler orders the shedding of innocent blood, judgment follows (<a href="/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/22-3.htm">Jeremiah 22:3&#8211;5</a>). Saul&#8217;s words echo Pharaoh&#8217;s decree against Hebrew infants (<a href="/exodus/1-16.htm">Exodus 1:16</a>) and Herod&#8217;s slaughter at Bethlehem (<a href="/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16</a>), revealing a recurring pattern: leaders who oppose God&#8217;s purposes often target His representatives.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And Doeg the Edomite turned and struck down the priests himself</b><p>Doeg&#8217;s nationality matters. As an Edomite&#8212;descendant of Esau&#8212;he represents a long-standing hostility toward Israel (<a href="/genesis/27-41.htm">Genesis 27:41</a>; <a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10&#8211;11</a>). His readiness contrasts with the Israelite guards&#8217; refusal, underscoring the danger of outsiders embedded without covenant loyalty (<a href="/nehemiah/13-3.htm">Nehemiah 13:3</a>). <a href="/bsb/psalms/52.htm">Psalm 52</a>, written by David about this very act, calls Doeg a &#8220;mighty man&#8221; of evil whose tongue plots destruction, assuring that God will uproot him (<a href="/psalms/52-5.htm">Psalm 52:5</a>). Doeg&#8217;s swift compliance shows how ambition can override reverence for God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On that day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod.</b><p>The linen ephod identified them as legitimate priests (<a href="/exodus/28-40.htm">Exodus 28:40&#8211;41</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/2-18.htm">1 Samuel 2:18</a>). Slaying eighty-five ordained ministers is not only mass murder; it is a direct assault on Israel&#8217;s worship infrastructure. Yet even this atrocity fulfills God&#8217;s earlier word to Eli: &#8220;No one in your house will reach old age&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31&#8211;33</a>; 3:12&#8211;14). God&#8217;s sovereignty turns Saul&#8217;s sin into the very means of accomplishing prophetic judgment, while still holding the perpetrators accountable (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>). The massacre also sets the stage for Abiathar&#8212;the lone survivor (<a href="/1_samuel/22-20.htm">1 Samuel 22:20</a>)&#8212;to join David, ensuring priestly continuity with the future king (<a href="/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18</a> depicts Saul&#8217;s command, Doeg&#8217;s ruthless obedience, and the slaughter of eighty-five priests. The verse reveals Saul&#8217;s moral collapse, Doeg&#8217;s treachery, divine fulfillment of earlier prophecy, and the severe consequences of opposing God&#8217;s anointed. It warns that unchecked envy turns authority into tyranny, yet God&#8217;s purposes remain unthwarted, preserving a remnant for His future work.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">And Doeg the Edomite . . . fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons.</span>--No doubt, assisted by his own attached servants, Doeg carried out this deed of unexampled barbarity. For this act the Edomite servant of Saul has been execrated in the most ancient Jewish writings perhaps above any other of the famous wicked men who meet us in the Holy Scriptures. For instance, we read in the Babylonian Talmud how "Doeg the Edomite, after his massacre of the priests, was encountered by three destructive demons. One deprived him of his learning (concerning which see above, in Note on <a href="/1_samuel/22-9.htm" title="Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.">1Samuel 22:9</a>), a second burned his soul, and a third scattered his dust in the synagogues"--Treatise <span class= "ital">Sanhedrin, </span>fol. 106, Colossians 2. The Babylonian Talmud has a still more curious comment on the iniquity of Doeg, in which David is bitterly reproached by the Most High for being the cause of Doeg's great sin and its terrible consequences. "Rav Yehudah recorded that Rav had said . . . The Holy One, blessed be He! had said to David, How long shall this iniquity cling to thee? Through thee the priests of Nob were slain; through thee Doeg the Edomite became a reprobate; and through thee Saul and his three sons were slain."--Treatise <span class= "ital">Sanhedrin, </span>fol. 95, cols. 1, 2.<p><span class= "bld">A linen ephod.</span>--The ordinary priests appear to have worn a linen over garment, similar in form to the high priestly cape or ephod. They came probably from Nob to Gibeah (the distance was not great) clad in their official costume, out of respect to the king who sent for them.
