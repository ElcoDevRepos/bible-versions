The cultural context of the time viewed madness as a sign of divine displeasure or possession. Achish's rhetorical question suggests that he already has enough troublemakers or madmen in his court, indicating that David's feigned madness was convincing. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of mental illness and its social implications.<p><b>that you have brought this man to rave in my presence?</b><br>David, fleeing from Saul, pretends to be insane to avoid being recognized and killed by Achish. The act of raving or behaving irrationally was a common tactic to avoid danger, as madmen were often seen as harmless or under divine protection. This phrase highlights David's cunning and resourcefulness, as he uses the cultural perceptions of madness to his advantage. It also underscores the tension and danger David faced during his flight from Saul.<p><b>Must this man come into my house?&#8221;</b><br>Achish's question reveals his reluctance to allow David, whom he perceives as a madman, into his royal residence. In ancient times, a king's house was a place of order and authority, and the presence of a madman could be seen as a disruption. This phrase also foreshadows David's future as a king, contrasting his current lowly and desperate state with his eventual rise to power. The mention of "house" can symbolically connect to the "house of David," a term used for the Davidic dynasty, which is significant in biblical prophecy concerning the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, who is fleeing from King Saul and feigns madness to protect himself from King Achish of Gath.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/achish.htm">Achish</a></b><br>The king of Gath, a Philistine city, who encounters David and questions his sanity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gath.htm">Gath</a></b><br>A Philistine city where David seeks refuge, highlighting the tension between Israel and the Philistines.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The current king of Israel, whose pursuit of David forces him into precarious situations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>The people of Gath, representing a significant threat to Israel during this period.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_protection_in_unlikely_places.htm">God's Protection in Unlikely Places</a></b><br>David's escape to Gath, a city of his enemies, shows that God can provide safety even in unexpected circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_and_discernment.htm">Wisdom and Discernment</a></b><br>David's feigned madness demonstrates the importance of using wisdom and discernment in difficult situations to achieve God's purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_sovereignty.htm">Trust in God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Despite the danger, David's actions reflect a deep trust in God's sovereignty and plan for his life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_fear_and_faith.htm">The Role of Fear and Faith</a></b><br>David's fear of Saul and Achish is real, yet his faith in God allows him to navigate these fears effectively.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_humility.htm">The Power of Humility</a></b><br>David's willingness to humble himself by acting insane shows the power of humility in achieving God's will.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Samuel_21_15_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Samuel 21:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/David_s_reliance_on_God_in_1_Sam_21_15.htm">How does David's behavior in 1 Samuel 21:15 demonstrate reliance on God?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_on_God_s_protection_in_1_Sam_21_2.htm">What can we learn about God's protection from David's actions in 1 Samuel 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_21_15_link_to_Jesus_wisdom_innocence.htm">How does 1 Samuel 21:15 connect to Jesus' teachings on wisdom and innocence?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Use_David_s_1_Sam_21_15_strategy_today.htm">How can we apply David's strategy in 1 Samuel 21:15 to our challenges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_21_15_on_trusting_God_in_trials.htm">What does 1 Samuel 21:15 teach about trusting God's plan in difficult situations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_David_feign_madness_in_1_Sam_21_15.htm">Why did David pretend to be insane in 1 Samuel 21:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_21_15_Insights_on_David_s_traits.htm">How does 1 Samuel 21:15 reflect on David's character and leadership?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_1_Samuel_21_15_events.htm">What historical evidence supports the events described in 1 Samuel 21:15?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_samuel_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Samuel 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_reconcile_1_sam_16_7,_16_12_on_looks.htm">How do we reconcile 1 Samuel 16:7's emphasis on God looking at the heart with David's 'handsome' description in 16:12, suggesting external attributes mattered?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/is_swift_secret_messaging_in_2_sam_17_15-21_realistic.htm">How realistic is the swift exchange of secret messages in 2 Samuel 17:15-21, given the distance and security risks involved in ancient Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/does_god_change_his_mind_or_not.htm">Does God change his mind?
