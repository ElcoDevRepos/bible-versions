This reflects the biblical principle of valuing life, as seen in <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>, where God establishes the sacredness of human life. David's actions demonstrate his respect for God's anointed, aligning with the commandment "You shall not murder" (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>). This moment also foreshadows Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a> to love one's enemies.<p><b>so may the LORD value my life</b><br>David expresses his trust in God's justice and protection. This reflects the biblical theme of divine retribution and reward, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11-18.htm">Proverbs 11:18</a>, where righteousness leads to a sure reward. David's faith in God's valuation of his life parallels the assurance found in <a href="/psalms/139-13.htm">Psalm 139:13-16</a>, where God is intimately involved in the creation and value of each life. This also prefigures Christ's assurance of God's care for His followers in <a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29-31</a>.<p><b>and rescue me from all trouble.</b><br>David's plea for deliverance highlights his reliance on God as his protector, a recurring theme in the Psalms (e.g., <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>). This reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where God promises to be their deliverer (<a href="/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). The concept of divine rescue is fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who delivers believers from sin and death (<a href="/colossians/1-13.htm">Colossians 1:13-14</a>). David's trust in God's deliverance is a model of faith for believers, encouraging them to seek God's help in times of distress.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by God, who is currently being pursued by King Saul.

By refusing to strike the Lord&#8217;s anointed, he demonstrates reverence for God&#8217;s established authority.<p>&#8226; Earlier, David had made the same choice in the cave (<a href="/1_samuel/24-10.htm">1 Samuel 24:10-12</a>), showing a consistent pattern of honoring life and obeying the command, &#8220;You shall not murder&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment highlights the principle later echoed by Jesus: &#8220;Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>).<p>&#8226; Valuing Saul&#8217;s life affirms <a href="/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>, where God declares life sacred because humanity is made in His image.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so may the LORD value my life</b><p>&#8226; David places his future entirely in God&#8217;s hands, confident that the One who commands him to protect life will also protect him (<a href="/1_samuel/25-29.htm">1 Samuel 25:29</a>, &#8220;the lives of your enemies He will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Psalms composed by David echo this plea: &#8220;He brought me out into the open; He rescued me because He delighted in me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-19.htm">Psalm 18:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus assures believers of the same divine care: &#8220;You are worth more than many sparrows&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/10-31.htm">Matthew 10:31</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s statement is not presumptuous; it is the humble expectation that God faithfully honors obedience (<a href="/1_samuel/2-30.htm">1 Samuel 2:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and rescue me from all trouble</b><p>&#8226; David&#8217;s life is marked by repeated escapes&#8212;Keilah (<a href="/1_samuel/23-1.htm">1 Samuel 23:1-14</a>), the wilderness of Ziph (26:1-2), and countless skirmishes. Each deliverance reinforces God&#8217;s active guardianship.<p>&#8226; &#8220;The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears; He delivers them from all their troubles&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>). David lives that verse in real time.<p>&#8226; Paul later testifies in the same key: &#8220;The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into His heavenly kingdom&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a>).<p>&#8226; Trouble is certain, but so is the covenant-keeping God who answers with salvation (<a href="/psalms/91-15.htm">Psalm 91:15-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David&#8217;s words in <a href="/1_samuel/26-24.htm">1 Samuel 26:24</a> form a living confession: because he honors the life God has created, he trusts God to honor and preserve his own.
