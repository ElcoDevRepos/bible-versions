Abigail, the wife of Nabal, was a woman of discernment and took initiative in a critical situation. Her instruction to the young men indicates her leadership and resourcefulness. This phrase highlights the social structure of the time, where servants played a crucial role in the household and were often entrusted with important tasks.<p><b>&#8220;Go ahead of me.</b><br>Abigail's directive to the young men to go ahead of her demonstrates her strategic thinking. By sending them first, she ensures that David and his men are met with a gesture of goodwill before her arrival. This action reflects her wisdom and understanding of the importance of diplomacy and timing. It also shows her proactive approach in averting potential disaster, as David was on his way to confront Nabal for his insult.<p><b>I will be right behind you.&#8221;</b><br>Abigail's promise to follow closely behind her servants underscores her commitment to personally address the situation. Her willingness to face David herself reveals her courage and sense of responsibility. This phrase can be seen as a foreshadowing of her role as a peacemaker, akin to the intercessory role that Christ plays, stepping in to mediate and bring reconciliation.<p><b>But she did not tell her husband Nabal.</b><br>This decision not to inform Nabal of her actions is significant. Nabal is described earlier in the chapter as harsh and evil in his dealings, which justifies Abigail's choice to act independently. Her discretion in this matter highlights the tension within their marriage and the potential danger of involving Nabal, who might have obstructed her efforts. This phrase also reflects the biblical theme of wisdom prevailing over folly, as Abigail's actions ultimately save her household.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abigail.htm">Abigail</a></b><br>A wise and discerning woman, the wife of Nabal.
