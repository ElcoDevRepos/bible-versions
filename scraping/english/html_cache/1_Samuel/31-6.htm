His reign marked the transition from a theocratic rule by judges to a monarchy. Saul's kingship began with promise but was marred by disobedience to God's commands, leading to his eventual rejection by God (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>). His death signifies the end of his troubled reign and the divine judgment upon his disobedience.<p><b>his three sons</b><br>Saul's sons, Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, also perished in this battle. Jonathan, in particular, was a close friend of David and known for his loyalty and faithfulness (<a href="/1_samuel/18.htm">1 Samuel 18:1-4</a>). The death of Saul's sons not only marks the end of Saul's lineage but also clears the path for David's ascension to the throne, fulfilling God's plan for Israel's leadership.<p><b>his armor-bearer</b><br>The armor-bearer was a trusted military aide responsible for carrying the king's armor and providing protection. The death of Saul's armor-bearer alongside him highlights the loyalty and duty expected in such a role. This also reflects the tragic end of Saul's reign, as even his closest aides could not save him from his fate.<p><b>and all his men</b><br>The phrase indicates the complete defeat of Saul's forces by the Philistines. This loss underscores the consequences of Saul's disobedience and the fulfillment of Samuel's prophecy regarding the downfall of Saul's house (<a href="/1_samuel/28-19.htm">1 Samuel 28:19</a>). It also demonstrates the Philistines' military strength and the vulnerability of Israel without divine favor.<p><b>died together</b><br>The collective death of Saul, his sons, and his men signifies the totality of the defeat and the end of Saul's dynasty. This event is a turning point in Israel's history, paving the way for David's kingship. It also serves as a somber reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's commands.<p><b>that same day</b><br>The immediacy of the phrase emphasizes the sudden and complete nature of the defeat. It fulfills the prophecy given by Samuel to Saul, indicating that the events were part of God's sovereign plan (<a href="/1_samuel/28-19.htm">1 Samuel 28:19</a>). This timing also highlights the urgency of God's judgment and the swift transition of power to David, who was anointed as the future king of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Saul had once been anointed with promise (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>), yet repeated disobedience&#8212;offering unlawful sacrifice (13:13-14), sparing Amalek (15:23, 26), and consulting a medium (28:7-18)&#8212;set him on a collision course with God&#8217;s judgment. &#8220;The LORD has torn the kingdom from your hand&#8221; (15:28) now comes true on Mount Gilboa. <a href="/1_chronicles/10-13.htm">1 Chronicles 10:13</a> affirms why: Saul &#8220;died for his unfaithfulness to the LORD.&#8221; The verse begins with his name to remind us that leadership matters; when a leader turns from God, an entire nation feels the shock wave.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his three sons</b><p>Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua fall beside their father (<a href="/1_samuel/31-2.htm">1 Samuel 31:2</a>). Jonathan&#8212;David&#8217;s covenant friend (18:1-4; 20:16-17)&#8212;dies, illustrating that even the righteous sometimes share the immediate consequences of a leader&#8217;s sin (cf. <a href="/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>). Samuel&#8217;s prophecy had been blunt: &#8220;Tomorrow you and your sons will be with me&#8221; (28:19). The royal line through Saul effectively ends here, clearing the path for the house of David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>his armor-bearer</b><p>The nameless attendant who had refused Saul&#8217;s plea to take his life (31:4) demonstrates both reverence for the anointed king and a soldier&#8217;s loyalty. Armor-bearers shared their master&#8217;s fate in battle (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6-7</a> for Jonathan&#8217;s own armor-bearer). His death underscores how close service to a fallen leader can cost everything.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all his men</b><p>The defeat is not limited to the palace. Israel&#8217;s army is shattered, &#8220;the men of Israel fled&#8221; (31:7), and surrounding towns are abandoned. Samuel had warned, &#8220;The LORD will deliver Israel along with you&#8221; (28:19). A leader&#8217;s sin invites corporate loss, echoing <a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>: &#8220;When the wicked rule, the people groan.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>died together that same day</b><p>God&#8217;s word is fulfilled down to the hour. &#8220;Together&#8221; stresses the completeness of the judgment; &#8220;that same day&#8221; highlights its swiftness. <a href="/1_chronicles/10-6.htm">1 Chronicles 10:6</a> repeats the summary for emphasis. The scene anticipates the sober truth of <a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>: &#8220;For the wages of sin is death.&#8221; Yet it also sets the stage for hope, for David will soon be crowned (<a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>), showing that God&#8217;s purposes move forward even through tragedy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/31-6.htm">1 Samuel 31:6</a> compresses an entire theology of consequence into one sentence. Saul&#8217;s personal rebellion culminates in collective catastrophe&#8212;king, sons, servant, and soldiers perishing together exactly as God had foretold. The verse stands as a sober reminder that God&#8217;s word is always accurate, sin always bears fruit, and leadership carries weight. At the same time, the collapse of Saul&#8217;s dynasty clears the way for the promised Davidic king, reminding us that even in darkest moments, God&#8217;s redemptive plan marches on.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And all his men.</span>--We must not interpret this statement quite literally; <a href="/1_chronicles/10-6.htm" title="So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.">1Chronicles 10:6</a> explains it by "all his house."

The meaning is that all his <span class= "ital">"fideles," </span>his personal staff, as we should say, with his three sons fell fighting round him. The lines of the chivalrous Scottish ballad writer who with rare skill describes the devoted followers of King James V. falling round him at Flodden, well paints what took place on the stricken field of Gilboa round the hero king Saul:--<p>"No one failed him!
