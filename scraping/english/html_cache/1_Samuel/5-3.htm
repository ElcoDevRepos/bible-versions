The Philistines were a seafaring people, often in conflict with Israel. The early morning rising of the people suggests a routine or ritual, possibly related to their worship practices. This timing emphasizes the immediacy and surprise of the event that follows.<p><b>there was Dagon, fallen on his face before the ark of the LORD.</b><br>Dagon was a major deity of the Philistines, often associated with grain and fertility. His temple in Ashdod was a significant religious site. The image of Dagon fallen on his face is symbolic of submission and defeat, especially in the presence of the ark, which represented the presence and power of the God of Israel. This act of falling prophesies the ultimate defeat of false gods before the true God, echoing themes found in <a href="/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>, where every knee shall bow to God.<p><b>So they took Dagon and returned him to his place.</b><br>The Philistines' response to return Dagon to his place indicates their attempt to restore order and maintain their religious beliefs despite the clear sign of their god's impotence. This act of restoring Dagon can be seen as a denial of the power of the God of Israel, similar to how people often resist acknowledging divine truth. It also foreshadows the repeated futility of idolatry, as seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/44-9.htm">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>, where the folly of idol worship is highlighted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_ashdod.htm">The People of Ashdod</a></b><br>Inhabitants of one of the five major Philistine cities, known for their worship of the god Dagon.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/dagon.htm">Dagon</a></b><br>A major deity of the Philistines, often associated with grain and fertility.

(See St. Jerome on <a href="/isaiah/46-1.htm" title="Bel bows down, Nebo stoops, their idols were on the beasts, and on the cattle: your carriages were heavy laden; they are a burden to the weary beast.">Isaiah 46:1</a>.) The idol had a human head and hands, and the body of a fish. Philo derives the word Dagon from <span class= "ital">dagan, "</span>corn," and supposes the worship to have been connected with Nature worship. The true derivation, however, is from <span class= "ital">Dag, </span>a fish, which represents the sea from which the Philistines drew their wealth and power. In one of the bas-reliefs discovered at Khorsabad, and which, Layard states, represents the war of an Assyrian king--probably Sargon--with the inhabitants of the coast of Syria, a figure is seen swimming in the sea, <span class= "ital">with </span>the upper part of the body resembling a bearded man wearing the ordinary conical tiara of royalty, adorned with elephants' tusks, and the lower part re sembling the body of a fish. It has the hand lifted up, as if in astonishment or fear, and is surrounded by fishes, crabs, and other marine animals.<p>"There can be hardly any doubt," argues Keil, "that we have here a representation of the Philistine Dagon. This deity was a personification of the generative and vivifying principle of nature, for which the fish, with its innumerable multiplication, was specially adapted, and set forth the idea of the Giver of all earthly good."<p>This strange image the men of Ashdod, on the morrow of their triumphal offering of the Ark of the Lord before the idol shrine, found prostrate on the temple floor, before the desecrated sacred coffer of the Israelites.<p>They at once assumed that this had taken place owing to some accident, and they raised again the image to its place.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">On the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of Jehovah.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> he was in the attitude of adoration, and instead of triumphing over Jehovah, he was prostrate, as if compelled to worship. But his priests perhaps thought that it was an accident, and so they set the image in its place again. They also, we may be sure, took due precaution against any one entering his temple by stealth; but when early on the second morning they came with anxious minds to see whether any new prodigy had happened, they found their god not only prostrate, as before, but mutilated, and <span class="cmt_word">his head and both the palms of his hands were cut off</span> - not broken off by the fall of the image from its place, but severed with deliberate care, and placed contemptuously <span class="cmt_word">upon the threshold,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> upon the door sill, the place where all must tread. <span class="cmt_word">Only Dagon was left to him.</span> We cannot in English render the full contemptuousness of this phrase, because Dagon is to us a mere proper name, with no significance. In the original it conveys the idea that the head, the emblem of reason, and the human hands, the emblems of intellectual activity, were no real parts of Dagon, but falsely assumed by him; and, deprived of them, he lay there in his true ugliness, a mere misshapen fish; for <span class="accented">dag</span>, as we have seen, means a fish, and Dagon is here a diminutive of contempt. In spite of his discomfiture the Philistines were tree to their allegiance to their god, because, believing as they did in "gods many," he was still their own national deity, even though he had been proved inferior to the God of Israel, and would probably be rendered more particular and exacting as regards the homage due to him from his own subjects by so humiliating a defeat. For the gods of the heathen were jealous, fickle, and very ill tempered if any slight was put upon them. After all, perhaps they thought, he had done his best, and though worsted in the personal conflict, he had managed so cleverly that they had gained in fair fight a great victory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/5-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the people of Ashdod</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#353;&#183;d&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7695;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_796.htm">Strong's 796: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ashdodites -- an inhabitant of Ashdod</span><br /><br /><span class="word">got up early</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#353;&#183;ki&#183;m&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
