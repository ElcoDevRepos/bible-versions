Such gatherings were common in Israelite culture for important announcements or judgments. The act of presenting oneself before a leader or prophet often signified readiness to hear God's word or judgment, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-17.htm">Exodus 19:17</a> when the Israelites gathered at Mount Sinai.<p><b>so that I may confront you</b><br>Samuel intends to bring the people to account, highlighting the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces who often delivered messages of correction or rebuke. This confrontation is not merely a human endeavor but is done with divine authority, similar to how Nathan confronted David in <a href="/2_samuel/12-7.htm">2 Samuel 12:7</a>.<p><b>before the LORD</b><br>The presence of the LORD in this confrontation underscores the seriousness of the occasion. It reflects the theocratic nature of Israel, where God was the ultimate authority. This setting before the LORD is reminiscent of the covenant renewal ceremonies, such as in <a href="/joshua/24.htm">Joshua 24:1</a>, where the people reaffirmed their commitment to God.<p><b>with all the righteous acts</b><br>Samuel is about to recount the deeds of the LORD, emphasizing His faithfulness and justice. The term "righteous acts" refers to God's interventions on behalf of Israel, demonstrating His covenant loyalty. This is similar to the recounting of God's deeds in <a href="/psalms/78.htm">Psalm 78</a>, which serves as a reminder of His past faithfulness.<p><b>He has done for you and your fathers</b><br>This phrase connects the current generation with their ancestors, highlighting the continuity of God's faithfulness across generations. It serves as a reminder of the collective history of Israel, where God's actions in the past are meant to inspire trust and obedience in the present. This connection is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9</a>, where the people are urged to remember what God has done for their forefathers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel, a prophet, and a leader who anointed the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David.
