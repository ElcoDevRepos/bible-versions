Saul was known to the people as the son of Kish, a wealthy Benjamite, and not as a spiritual leader or prophet. His previous life was characterized by his role in his father's household and his search for lost donkeys, which is a stark contrast to his current prophetic activity. This transformation is significant as it marks the beginning of Saul's divine appointment as king, showing that God can change a person's role and identity for His purposes.<p><b>saw him prophesying with the prophets</b><br>Prophesying in this context refers to being filled with the Spirit of God and speaking under divine inspiration. The prophets were a group of individuals who were known for their spiritual fervor and connection to God. Saul's participation with them indicates a divine endorsement and empowerment, which was necessary for his future role as king. This event is reminiscent of the Spirit of the Lord coming upon other leaders in Israel, such as the judges, to equip them for their tasks.<p><b>they asked one another, &#8220;What has happened to the son of Kish?</b><br>The question reflects the surprise and disbelief of the people who knew Saul. It underscores the unexpected nature of Saul's transformation and the divine intervention in his life. This moment serves as a public sign of Saul's new calling and the beginning of his journey as Israel's first king. It also highlights the theme of God's sovereignty in choosing and equipping leaders, regardless of their past or social standing.<p><b>Is Saul also among the prophets?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question became a proverbial expression in Israel, indicating an unexpected or surprising change in someone's behavior or status. It points to the miraculous nature of Saul's transformation and the work of the Holy Spirit in his life. This phrase also foreshadows the complexities of Saul's reign, as his spiritual experiences did not always translate into faithful leadership. The question invites reflection on the nature of true spiritual transformation and the importance of ongoing obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The son of Kish, who was anointed by Samuel to be the first king of Israel.

It need not be assumed that the youth and early manhood of the future king had been wild and dissolute, but simply that the way of life had been rough and uncultured--a life spent in what we should call "country pursuits," in contradistinction to the pursuit of knowledge and of higher acquirements. It is evident from the statement here and in the following verse that a considerable respect for these schools had already grown up among the people.<p><span class= "bld">Is Saul also among the prophets?</span>--In <a href="/1_samuel/19-23.htm" title="And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.">1Samuel 19:23</a> we again find Saul, but under changed circumstances, under the influence of a Divine and coercing power, and uttering strange words, and singing hymns as one trained in the prophets' schools.
