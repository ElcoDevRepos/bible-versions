In the cultural context of ancient Israel, women often played significant roles in managing household affairs. Her urgency indicates the seriousness of the situation with David, who was on his way to confront Nabal, her husband. This haste can be seen as a parallel to the urgency of intercession, a theme found throughout Scripture, such as in Esther's swift actions to save her people (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>).<p><b>and took two hundred loaves of bread</b><br>Bread was a staple in the ancient Near Eastern diet, symbolizing sustenance and hospitality. Abigail's provision of bread signifies her intent to offer peace and sustenance to David and his men, reminiscent of Jesus feeding the multitudes with loaves (<a href="/matthew/14-19.htm">Matthew 14:19</a>).<p><b>two skins of wine</b><br>Wine was commonly used in celebrations and as a sign of blessing. Abigail's inclusion of wine in her offering could symbolize her desire to bring peace and joy, contrasting with Nabal's foolishness. Wine is also a symbol of the new covenant in Christ's blood (<a href="/luke/22-20.htm">Luke 22:20</a>).<p><b>five butchered sheep</b><br>Sheep were valuable livestock, and offering them indicates Abigail's generosity and the seriousness of her peace offering. This act of sacrifice can be seen as a type of Christ, the Lamb of God, who was sacrificed for the sins of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>five seahs of roasted grain</b><br>Roasted grain was a common food item, often used in offerings. The quantity reflects abundance and readiness to meet the needs of David's men. Grain offerings in the Old Testament were a way to honor God, paralleling Abigail's attempt to honor David, God's anointed.<p><b>a hundred clusters of raisins</b><br>Raisins were a source of energy and sustenance, often used by travelers. Abigail's provision of raisins shows her understanding of the needs of David's men, similar to how God provides for His people in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-31.htm">Exodus 16:31</a>).<p><b>and two hundred cakes of figs</b><br>Figs were another staple food, providing nourishment and energy. The cakes of figs symbolize abundance and care, echoing the provision of God to His people, as seen in the promised land described as a land of figs (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>).<p><b>She loaded them on donkeys</b><br>Donkeys were common pack animals in ancient Israel, used for transporting goods. Abigail's use of donkeys indicates her resourcefulness and the practical steps she took to ensure the delivery of her peace offering. This act of service and humility can be seen as a reflection of Christ's humility, who rode into Jerusalem on a donkey (<a href="/matthew/21-5.htm">Matthew 21:5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abigail.htm">Abigail</a></b><br>A wise and discerning woman, the wife of Nabal, who acts swiftly to prevent disaster.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nabal.htm">Nabal</a></b><br>A wealthy but foolish man, whose name means "fool" in Hebrew, known for his harsh and surly behavior.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, who is on the run from King Saul and has been protecting Nabal's shepherds.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/carmel.htm">Carmel</a></b><br>The location where Nabal's business and household are situated, and where Abigail prepares her offering.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_event.htm">The Event</a></b><br>Abigail's quick and generous response to David's impending attack due to Nabal's insult, showcasing her wisdom and peacemaking skills.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_in_action.htm">Wisdom in Action</a></b><br>Abigail's quick and thoughtful response demonstrates the importance of acting wisely and decisively in times of crisis.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/peacemaking.htm">Peacemaking</a></b><br>Abigail's intervention highlights the value of being a peacemaker, seeking to resolve conflicts and prevent violence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/generosity_and_provision.htm">Generosity and Provision</a></b><br>Her generous offering to David and his men shows the power of generosity in diffusing tension and building goodwill.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_and_initiative.htm">Courage and Initiative</a></b><br>Abigail's courage to act independently and take initiative in a male-dominated society is a model of bravery and leadership.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_providence.htm">God's Providence</a></b><br>Abigail's actions are part of God's providential plan to protect David and ultimately lead to her becoming his wife, showing how God works through individuals to fulfill His purposes.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Samuel_25_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Samuel 25:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Abigail_s_wise_proactive_response.htm">How does Abigail's response in 1 Samuel 25:18 demonstrate wisdom and initiative?

Abigail thinks ahead to the physical well-being of David&#8217;s band, not only to appeasing his wrath. Her care fulfills <a href="/proverbs/25-21.htm">Proverbs 25:21</a>: &#8220;If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat, and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Two hundred cakes of figs</b><p>Figs symbolize healing and prosperity (<a href="/2_kings/20-7.htm">2 Kings 20:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/24-5.htm">Jeremiah 24:5-7</a>). Abigail&#8217;s abundant gift foreshadows the reconciliation she seeks&#8212;restoring wholeness between David and her household (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She loaded them on donkeys</b><p>Donkeys were reliable pack animals (<a href="/genesis/45-23.htm">Genesis 45:23</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/16-20.htm">1 Samuel 16:20</a>). By personally overseeing the loading, Abigail guarantees safe, orderly delivery, reflecting diligence (<a href="/proverbs/31-13.htm">Proverbs 31:13</a>) and stewardship (<a href="/luke/19-13.htm">Luke 19:13</a>). Her logistical care underscores that peacemaking involves thoughtful action, not mere sentiment (<a href="/james/3-18.htm">James 3:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Every item Abigail hurriedly assembles in <a href="/1_samuel/25-18.htm">1 Samuel 25:18</a> serves a dual purpose: practical provision for David&#8217;s men and a tangible plea for peace. Her swift, generous, and costly response contrasts sharply with Nabal&#8217;s selfishness and exemplifies godly wisdom in crisis. Acting decisively, giving abundantly, and planning carefully, she models how faith expresses itself through concrete deeds that avert sin, satisfy need, and foster reconciliation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Five measures.</span>--The LXX. alter the measure into five ephahs, thinking the quantity in the text ridiculously small for such an host as followed David. Ewald too, would change 5 into 500; but the truth is that Abigail in her haste, thinking rightly that no time must be lost, as the danger was pressing, simply pro-provided a liberal present for David's own immediate followers, not for the whole force.<p><span class= "bld">An hundred clusters of raisins.</span>--That is, an hundred cakes of dried grapes--what in Italy is called "simmuki."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Five measures of parched corn.</span> The measure named here, the seah, contains about a peck and a half.
