This act of violence was ordered by King Saul and carried out by Doeg the Edomite. The massacre at Nob was a direct result of Saul's paranoia and anger towards David, whom he believed was conspiring against him. This event highlights the tragic consequences of Saul's disobedience to God and his descent into tyranny. The priests of Nob were innocent, serving God and the people, yet they suffered due to Saul's misguided wrath. This massacre is reminiscent of other biblical instances where innocent blood was shed, such as the slaughter of the innocents by Herod in <a href="/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16</a>.<p><b>with its men and women, children and infants</b><br>The complete destruction of Nob, including men, women, children, and infants, underscores the totality of Saul's vengeance and the extent of his moral decline. This indiscriminate killing is reminiscent of the herem warfare commanded by God in certain Old Testament contexts, such as the destruction of the Amalekites (1 Samuel 15), which Saul failed to fully execute. However, unlike those divinely sanctioned acts, this massacre was not commanded by God and stands as a stark contrast to the justice and mercy that God desires. It serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of human sin and the abuse of power.<p><b>oxen, donkeys, and sheep</b><br>The inclusion of livestock in the destruction of Nob indicates the thoroughness of the annihilation. In ancient Near Eastern culture, livestock were valuable assets, essential for agriculture, transportation, and sustenance. The destruction of these animals not only represents a loss of economic resources but also symbolizes the complete eradication of the community's livelihood. This act of total destruction is reminiscent of the judgment against the Amalekites, where everything was to be destroyed (<a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>). However, unlike the Amalekite judgment, this was not a divine command but rather an act of human cruelty. This phrase also echoes the comprehensive nature of divine judgment seen in other parts of Scripture, such as the plagues of Egypt, where both humans and animals suffered (<a href="/exodus/9-6.htm">Exodus 9:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who ordered the destruction of Nob.

The verse illustrates how unchecked jealousy and disobedience to God descend into wholesale violence. By contrasting Saul&#8217;s misuse of the sword with God&#8217;s righteous standards, the passage warns every generation: reject God&#8217;s word, and both people and creation suffer; submit to God&#8217;s authority, and life flourishes under His protection.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Nob, the city of the priests, smote he.</span>--The vengeful king, not content with striking the men, the heads of the priestly houses, in his insane fury proceeded to treat the innocent city where they resided as a city under the ban "cherem," as though it had been polluted with idolatry and wickedness, and therefore devoted to utter destruction. The only crime of Nob had been that its venerable chief citizen, Ahimelech the priest, had shown kindness to David, whom Saul hated with a fierce mad hate. In <a href="/2_samuel/21-1.htm" title="Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD. And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.">2Samuel 21:1</a> we read of a scourge in the form of a famine afflicting Israel during three years. The cause of this God-sent calamity is told us in the Lord's words: "It was for Saul and his bloody house, <span class= "ital">because he slew the Gibeonites." </span>Now, this slaughter of the Gibeonites--evidently a dark crime--is nowhere specially related in the Old Testament books. Was it not this awful sequel to the crime of Gibeah, where the hapless Ahimelech and his eighty-five priests were murdered, that was referred to in the above mentioned passage--the awful sequel when Saul smote Nob, the city of the priests, with the sword? In that terrible catastrophe, were not the Gibeonites, <span class= "ital">hewers of wood and drawers of water for the Tabernacle </span>(see <a href="/context/joshua/9-21.htm" title="And the princes said to them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water to all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.">Joshua 9:21-27</a>), slain? for we read how in the destruction of the ill fated city men, women and children, and all cattle perished. "Only once before had so terrible a calamity befallen the sons of Aaron, and that was when the Philistines destroyed Shiloh. But they were enemies, and had been provoked by the people bringing the Ark to battle; and even then the women and children seem to have escaped. It was left to the anointed king of Israel, who had himself settled the priests at Nob and restored Jehovah's worship there, to perpetrate an act unparalleled in Jewish history for its barbarity."--<span class= "ital">Dean Payne Smith.</span><p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/22-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He also put</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hik&#183;k&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5221.htm">Strong's 5221: </a> </span><span class="str2">To strike</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the sword</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1462;&#1428;&#1512;&#1462;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;e&#183;re&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2719.htm">Strong's 2719: </a> </span><span class="str2">Drought, a cutting instrument, as a, knife, sword</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Nob,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1465;&#1444;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#333;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5011.htm">Strong's 5011: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nob -- a priestly city, perhaps also a place North of Jerusalem</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the city</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#238;r-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5892.htm">Strong's 5892: </a> </span><span class="str2">Excitement</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the priests,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1469;&#1492;&#1458;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(hak&#183;k&#333;&#183;ha&#774;&#183;n&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
