This action reflects Saul's attempt to distance himself from David, whom he perceives as a threat to his throne. The context of this decision is rooted in Saul's earlier disobedience to God, which led to the loss of his divine favor and the anointing of David as the future king by the prophet Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>). Saul's actions are driven by insecurity and paranoia, as he recognizes the Lord's presence with David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-12.htm">1 Samuel 18:12</a>).<p><b>and gave him command of a thousand men.</b><br>By giving David command of a thousand men, Saul is both promoting David and attempting to control him. This military appointment is significant, as it places David in a position of leadership and responsibility, further proving his capabilities and earning him respect among the people and the army. Historically, a "thousand" was a common military unit size in ancient Israel, indicating a substantial force under David's command. This move can be seen as a test of David's loyalty and skill, as well as a strategic decision by Saul to keep David occupied and potentially expose him to danger on the battlefield.<p><b>David led the troops out to battle and back,</b><br>David's leadership in battle demonstrates his military prowess and God's favor upon him. His success in leading the troops "out to battle and back" highlights his strategic acumen and ability to protect and guide his men effectively. This phrase underscores David's role as a warrior and leader, foreshadowing his future as a king who would lead Israel to numerous victories. The repeated success in battle further cements David's reputation among the people and soldiers, increasing Saul's jealousy and fear. This aspect of David's life can be seen as a type of Christ, who leads His people to spiritual victory and safety. David's ability to lead and return safely also reflects God's protection and blessing over his life, aligning with the biblical theme of divine providence and guidance for those who are chosen by God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who becomes increasingly jealous of David due to his success and popularity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd anointed by God to be the future king of Israel, known for his faithfulness and military prowess.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/command_of_a_thousand.htm">Command of a Thousand</a></b><br>A military position given to David by Saul, which was both a promotion and a strategic move by Saul to distance David.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/troops.htm">Troops</a></b><br>The soldiers under David's command, whom he led successfully in battle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/battle.htm">Battle</a></b><br>The context in which David proves his leadership and gains further favor with the people of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_leadership.htm">God's Sovereignty in Leadership</a></b><br>Despite Saul's intentions, God uses David's military role to prepare him for future kingship.
