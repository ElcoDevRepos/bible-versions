This expression is often used in the Old Testament to denote the whole land of Israel (<a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20:1</a>, <a href="/2_samuel/3-10.htm">2 Samuel 3:10</a>). Dan was located near the sources of the Jordan River, while Beersheba was situated in the Negev desert. The phrase underscores the widespread recognition and acceptance of Samuel's role across the entire nation. It reflects the unity of Israel in acknowledging Samuel's prophetic authority, a significant development given the tribal divisions and frequent conflicts during the period of the Judges.<p><b>knew that Samuel was confirmed</b><br>The term "knew" implies a deep, widespread acknowledgment and acceptance among the people. Samuel's confirmation as a prophet was not just a private or local affair but was recognized by all the tribes of Israel. This confirmation was likely due to the fulfillment of his prophecies and the evident presence of God's Spirit upon him. The word "confirmed" suggests a formal recognition, possibly through signs or fulfilled prophecies, that validated Samuel's calling and role. This was a pivotal moment in Israel's history, as it marked the transition from the period of the Judges to the establishment of the prophetic office, which would play a crucial role in guiding the nation.<p><b>as a prophet of the LORD</b><br>Samuel's role as a prophet was significant because, during this time, prophetic voices were rare (<a href="/1_samuel/3.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a>). A prophet in Israel was a spokesperson for God, delivering His messages to the people. Samuel's prophetic ministry was characterized by his faithfulness to God's word and his leadership in guiding Israel back to covenant faithfulness. His role prefigures the ultimate Prophet, Jesus Christ, who perfectly reveals God's will to humanity (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, <a href="/acts/3-22.htm">Acts 3:22-23</a>). Samuel's life and ministry set a standard for future prophets and established the importance of prophetic leadership in Israel's spiritual and national life.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A significant prophet in Israel, dedicated to God by his mother Hannah.

This is not a private event tucked away in Shiloh; &#8220;all Israel&#8221; is in view (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/7-2.htm">1 Samuel 7:2-3</a> where &#8220;all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD&#8221;).<p>- From the tribes in the north to those in the south, the nation is portrayed as one people. This echoes earlier moments when the nation acted together, such as the assembly in <a href="/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1</a> or the celebration in <a href="/2_samuel/6-15.htm">2 Samuel 6:15</a>.<p>- God is signaling that what happens with Samuel carries national significance, not merely local interest.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>from Dan to Beersheba</b><p>- &#8220;Dan&#8221; marks Israel&#8217;s northern border, &#8220;Beersheba&#8221; its southern (see <a href="/1_kings/4-25.htm">1 Kings 4:25</a> for the same expression). By naming the extremes, Scripture emphasizes total geographic coverage.<p>- The phrase underscores how quickly authentic prophetic ministry can span distances without modern communication, reinforcing that the LORD Himself is spreading the news (compare <a href="/2_samuel/3-10.htm">2 Samuel 3:10</a>).<p>- It also hints at unity in a season when the judges&#8217; era had often been fragmented (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>knew</b><p>- This is more than intellectual awareness; it is settled conviction. When Solomon rendered wise judgment, &#8220;all Israel heard of the judgment &#8230; and they feared the king&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/3-28.htm">1 Kings 3:28</a>). A similar nationwide certainty settles here.<p>- The people recognize divine activity the way the crowds later recognized Jesus&#8217; authority (<a href="/luke/7-16.htm">Luke 7:16</a>).<p>- Such knowledge moves hearts, as seen at Pentecost when listeners were &#8220;pierced to the heart&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that Samuel was confirmed</b><p>- Verse 19 already said, &#8220;The LORD was with Samuel, and He let none of his words fall to the ground&#8221;. The consistency of fulfilled words is God&#8217;s stamp of approval (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-22.htm">Deuteronomy 18:22</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/28-9.htm">Jeremiah 28:9</a>).<p>- &#8220;Confirmed&#8221; signals established credentials. Samuel&#8217;s status isn&#8217;t based on lineage alone, though he is a Levite by birth&#8212;it rests on God&#8217;s public vindication (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>).<p>- This confirmation prepares Israel to heed Samuel&#8217;s later calls for repentance and renewal (<a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as a prophet of the LORD</b><p>- The title places Samuel in the line anticipated in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, pointing forward ultimately to Christ (<a href="/acts/3-24.htm">Acts 3:24</a>).<p>- Samuel&#8217;s role bridges eras: last of the judges, first named prophet after Moses, and anointer of kings. <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1-2</a> reminds us that God &#8220;spoke long ago to the fathers by the prophets,&#8221; and Samuel becomes a chief conduit in that chain.<p>- By identifying him &#8220;of the LORD,&#8221; Scripture clarifies the source of his authority; he is not a court seer hired by men but a mouthpiece for God Himself (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/3-20.htm">1 Samuel 3:20</a> communicates that the entire nation, from its northernmost to its southernmost point, became absolutely convinced that God had raised up Samuel as His authentic spokesman. The LORD Himself spread the news through Samuel&#8217;s unfailing words, uniting a fragmented people under fresh prophetic leadership and setting the stage for the transition from the chaotic period of the judges to the establishment of the monarchy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">A prophet of the Lord.</span>--Then from the northern to the southern cities of the land the fame of the boy-friend of the Eternal was established. The minds of all the people were thus gradually prepared when the right moment came to acknowledge Samuel as a God-sent chieftain. On this rapid and universal acknowledgment of the young prophet it has been observed, "that the people, in spite of their disruption, yet formed religiously an unit."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From Dan,</span> upon the north, <span class="cmt_word">to Beersheba,</span> upon the south, means "throughout the whole country." The phrase is interesting, as showing that, in spite of the virtual independence of the tribes, and the general anarchy which prevailed during the time of the judges, there was nevertheless a feeling that they all formed one people. <span class="cmt_word">Was established.</span> The same word used in <a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a> of Moses, and there translated <span class="accented">was faithful.</span> It is one of those pregnant words common in Hebrew, containing two cognate meaning. It says, first, that Samuel was faithful in his office; and, secondly, that because he was found trustworthy he was confirmed and strengthened in the possession of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/3-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1428;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from Dan</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1430;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(mid&#183;d&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
