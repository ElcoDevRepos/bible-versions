David's triumph over the Philistine giant is a demonstration of God's power working through unlikely individuals. This event marks the beginning of David's rise to prominence in Israel. The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel, and David's victory was a significant military and spiritual triumph. This victory also foreshadows the ultimate victory of Jesus Christ over sin and death, as David is a type of Christ, representing the unexpected deliverer chosen by God.<p><b>the women came out of all the cities of Israel</b><br>In ancient Israel, it was customary for women to celebrate military victories with music and dance. This public display of joy and gratitude highlights the communal nature of Israelite society and the role of women in celebrating God's deliverance. The mention of "all the cities" indicates the widespread impact of David's victory and the unity it brought to the nation. This celebration can be compared to the rejoicing in <a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20-21</a>, where Miriam and the women of Israel celebrated the defeat of the Egyptians.<p><b>to meet King Saul</b><br>King Saul was the reigning monarch of Israel at this time. The people's celebration was directed towards Saul as the leader of the nation, even though David was the one who achieved the victory. This reflects the hierarchical structure of Israelite society and the expectation that the king would lead and deliver the people. However, this moment also foreshadows the tension that will arise between Saul and David, as Saul's jealousy of David's success begins to grow.<p><b>with singing and dancing</b><br>Singing and dancing were common expressions of joy and celebration in ancient Israel. These activities were often part of religious and communal festivities, as seen in other biblical passages such as <a href="/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a> and <a href="/judges/11-34.htm">Judges 11:34</a>. The use of music and dance in worship and celebration underscores the importance of these art forms in expressing devotion and gratitude to God.<p><b>with joyful songs, and with tambourines and other instruments</b><br>The use of musical instruments like tambourines in celebrations is well-documented in the Bible. Instruments were used to enhance the expression of joy and to create a festive atmosphere. This celebration with music and instruments is reminiscent of other biblical events, such as the celebration of the Ark of the Covenant's return in <a href="/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>. The joyful songs and instruments signify the people's recognition of God's hand in their victory and their desire to honor Him through worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd who became a hero in Israel after defeating Goliath, the Philistine giant.

Evidently a series of victories after the fall of the dreaded champion--perhaps spread over a very considerable period--had for a time restored the supremacy of Israel in Canaan. In this war, David, on whom after his great feat of arms the eyes of all the soldiery were fixed, established his character for bravery and skill.<p><span class= "bld">Singing and dancing.</span>--This was on some grand occasion--probably the final triumph at the end of the war. The <span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary, </span>on the English rendering "singing and dancing," remarks that "the Hebrew text is probably here corrupt, and suggests that for <span class= "ital">vau, '</span>and,' we ought to read <span class= "ital">beth, '</span>with' and that then the sense would be to sing 'in the dance,' or 'with dancing.' The action was for the women to dance to the sound of the timbrel, and to sing the Epinicium with strophe and antistrophe as they danced and played." (Comp. <a href="/context/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20-21</a>; <a href="/judges/11-34.htm" title="And Jephthah came to Mizpeh to his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances: and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.">Judges 11:34</a>.)<p>We know that music and song were originally closely connected with dancing. David, for instance, when a mighty king, on one great occasion in Jerusalem actually himself performed dances before all the people (<a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm" title="And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David was girded with a linen ephod.">2Samuel 6:14</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/6-16.htm" title="And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in her heart.">2Samuel 6:16</a>). (See Note on <a href="/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine.</span> Or more probably, as in the margin, "of the Philistines." The allusion is not to the combat with Goliath, but to one of the expeditions referred to in ver. 5, in which David had gained some decisive victory. The women would not have described the slaughter of one champion as the slaying of ten thousand, nor would there have been any contrast between this act and the military enterprises of Saul. Probably he too would have looked with indifference upon this Oriental exaggeration of the daring bravery of a boy; but what galled him was David's continual success in repeated campaigns. <span class="cmt_word">The Philistine</span> means the whole people of that name; and as the war between them and Saul lasted all the days of Saul's life, and was his main kingly work, he saw with envy the rapid growth of David's reputation; and when, after some noble achievement, the women gave David an ovation, and declared in their songs that he had achieved a success ten times as great as Saul, an outburst of ill feeling was the result. Saul suddenly became aware that the young captain on whose shoulders he had devolved the chief labours of the war had supplanted him in the popular estimation, and hatred took the place of the good feeling which he had previously entertained towards him. <span class="cmt_word">The women came out of all cities of Israel... to meet king Saul.</span> It is evident that this refers to some grand occasion, and probably to the conclusion of a peace between the two nations. The battle in the valley of Elah was probably followed by several years of warfare, during which David developed those great military qualities which made him subsequently the founder of the wide empire over which Solomon reigned. It was unendurable for Saul, himself a great soldier, to find, when the war at last was over, that the people recognised in his lieutenant higher military qualities than they had discovered in himself. <span class="cmt_word">With tabrets.</span> See on 1 Samuel 10:5. <span class="cmt_word">With joy.</span> As this is placed between the names of two instruments of music, it must mean some kind of joyous shouting or singing to the sound of their tabrets. <span class="cmt_word">With instruments of music.</span> Hebrew, with triangles, a very ancient but effective instrument for an outdoor procession accompanied with dancing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/18-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As the troops</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
