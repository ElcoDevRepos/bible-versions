The number seven often symbolizes completeness or divine perfection in the Bible, as seen in the creation week in Genesis. Saul's waiting period is a test of his faith and patience, reflecting the importance of obedience to God's appointed leaders.<p><b>but Samuel did not come to Gilgal</b><br>Gilgal is a significant location in Israel's history, being the first campsite of the Israelites after crossing the Jordan River (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19-20</a>). It served as a base for military operations and a place of worship. Samuel's delay tests Saul's reliance on God's timing versus his own understanding. This situation foreshadows the tension between divine timing and human impatience, a recurring theme in Scripture.<p><b>and the troops began to desert Saul</b><br>The desertion of Saul's troops underscores the fear and uncertainty among the Israelites, who were facing the Philistine threat. This reflects the broader context of Israel's struggle for survival against its enemies. The troops' desertion also highlights Saul's leadership challenges and foreshadows his eventual downfall due to disobedience and lack of faith. This situation contrasts with the steadfastness expected of God's people, as seen in other biblical narratives like Gideon's army in <a href="/judges/7.htm">Judges 7</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Saul appears willing&#8212;at least at first&#8212;to do everything exactly as instructed.<p>&#8226; Waiting on God is a recurring test of faith: David urges, &#8220;Wait for the LORD; be strong&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>), and Isaiah promises renewed strength to those who &#8220;wait upon the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>). Saul&#8217;s story reminds us that starting well is only half the race.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the time appointed by Samuel</b><p>&#8226; Samuel&#8217;s timetable was not personal preference; it carried divine authority. When God&#8217;s prophet speaks, God is speaking (<a href="/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19&#8211;21</a>; 15:1).<p>&#8226; Obedience to clear command is non-negotiable. In the same way, Israel later suffered because King Saul chose his own timing in the Amalekite matter (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; A set &#8220;time&#8221; teaches that God&#8217;s directions are specific, not vague. Abraham learned this when Isaac came &#8220;at the very time God had promised&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/21-2.htm">Genesis 21:2</a>). The Lord&#8217;s clock never malfunctions, even when it tests human patience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but Samuel did not come to Gilgal</b><p>&#8226; From Saul&#8217;s perspective Samuel was late, but God often uses apparent delay to reveal what is in the heart (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel sinned when &#8220;the people saw that Moses delayed&#8221; on Sinai (<a href="/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1</a>); here a similar crisis of impatience rises.<p>&#8226; The Gospels record Jesus deliberately remaining where He was two extra days before raising Lazarus (<a href="/john/11-6.htm">John 11:6</a>)&#8212;divine delay that magnified glory. The principle stands: God&#8217;s seeming lateness is never lack of concern but a stage for greater purposes.<p>&#8226; For Saul the delay exposed shallow faith. Real trust waits until God clearly moves, regardless of ticking clocks.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the troops began to desert Saul</b><p>&#8226; Circumstances grew dire: earlier some Israelites were hiding &#8220;in caves and thickets&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/13-6.htm">1 Samuel 13:6</a>). Now those still present slip away, shrinking morale and military strength.<p>&#8226; Scripture often pictures shrinking numbers as God&#8217;s tool to highlight dependence on Him: Gideon&#8217;s army was trimmed from 32,000 to 300 (<a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2&#8211;7</a>), yet victory came.<p>&#8226; Saul allows human pressure to override divine directive. The fear of man again proves a snare (<a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Had Saul remembered Joshua&#8217;s words&#8212;&#8220;the LORD your God is He who fights for you&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/23-10.htm">Joshua 23:10</a>)&#8212;he could have stood firm. Instead, he trusted statistics, not the Savior, and within a single verse set the stage for the unlawful sacrifice of vv. 9&#8211;10.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8</a> captures the critical hinge of Saul&#8217;s reign: a king called to trust God finds himself counting soldiers and minutes instead. The verse teaches that obedience means waiting as long as God says, that perceived divine delay tests true allegiance, and that fear-driven shortcuts forfeit blessing. Trust lasts the whole seven days&#8212;and beyond&#8212;until God&#8217;s appointed help arrives.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And he tarried seven days.</span>--When was this "set time" appointed? It seems difficult at first to refer back to the day of Saul's mysterious prophetic consecration (<a href="/1_samuel/10-8.htm" title="And you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shall you tarry, till I come to you, and show you what you shall do.">1Samuel 10:8</a>), which took place at least some three or four years--perhaps much longer--before the event here related, especially as we know that Saul and Samuel had been together on one occasion certainly at Gilgal in the meantime (<a href="/context/1_samuel/11-14.htm" title="Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there.">1Samuel 11:14-15</a>); and yet the extraordinary solemnity of the warning of the seer at the time of the anointing at Ramah evidently pointed to some event which should in the future happen at Gilgal, and which would be a most important epoch in King Saul's career. All these conditions are satisfied in the meeting between the prophet and the king, here related. It is best, then, to understand this event as the one alluded to on the day of anointing at Ramah, and to conclude that this grave warning and positive direction had been repeated, probably more than once, since then by the seer to the king. (On the place Gilgal, and on the nature of the "sin of Saul," which was so terribly punished, see <span class= "ital">Excursus </span>E and F at end of this Book.) Saul, we read, waited seven days, but before the seventh expired, gave up waiting, and offered the sacrifice without the seer, and thus, as Josephus says, "he did not fully obey the command." His faith failed him under pressure at the last, and he acted on his own responsibility, quite irrespective of the positive command of God.<p><span class= "bld">The people were scattered from him.</span>--This trial of the king's faith was doubtless a severe one. The panic which pervaded all Israel was every hour thinning the host Saul had gathered round him at Gilgal. The martial king longed for a chance of joining battle: and this he was forbidden to do until the seer had offered sacrifice, and publicly inquired of the Lord; and the day passed by, and Samuel came not. An attack on the part of the Philistine army, encamped at no great distance, seemed imminent, and Saul's forces were rapidly melting away.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seven days, according, to the set time.</span> See on 1 Samuel 10:8. The lapse of time between Samuel's appointment of the seven days during which Saul was to wait for him to inaugurate the war of independence, and the present occasion, was probably not so great as many commentators suppose; for <a href="/1_samuel/13-1.htm">1 Samuel 13:1</a> is, as we have seen, wrongly translated, and everything else leads to the conclusion that the defeat of the Ammonites, the choice of the 3000, and Jonathan's attack on the garrison at Geba followed rapidly upon one another. As the Philistines would rightly regard Israel's choice of a king as an act of rebellion, we cannot suppose them to have been so supine and negligent as not at once to have prepared for war. <span class="cmt_word">Had appointed.</span> The Hebrew word for this has been omitted by some accident. It is given in the Septuagint and Chaldee and some MSS.
