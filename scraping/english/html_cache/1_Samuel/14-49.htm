His character is often highlighted for his bravery and faith, as seen in his attack on the Philistine garrison in <a href="/1_samuel/14.htm">1 Samuel 14</a>. Jonathan's relationship with David is a significant example of covenant friendship, reflecting themes of loyalty and sacrifice.<br><br>Ishvi: Ishvi is less mentioned in the biblical narrative, and some scholars suggest that Ishvi might be another name for Abinadab, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/31-2.htm">1 Samuel 31:2</a>. The name Ishvi means "equal" or "level," and while not much is detailed about him, his inclusion signifies his role in the royal family.<br><br>Malchishua: Malchishua, whose name means "my king is wealth," is also mentioned in the context of Saul's final battle against the Philistines, where he dies alongside his father and brothers (<a href="/1_samuel/31-2.htm">1 Samuel 31:2</a>). His death marks the end of Saul's lineage on the battlefield, emphasizing the tragic downfall of Saul's house.<p><b>His two daughters were named Merab (his firstborn) and Michal (his younger daughter).</b><br>Merab: Merab, Saul's firstborn daughter, was initially promised to David as a reward for his victory over Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17</a>). However, she was later given to Adriel the Meholathite. This switch in marriage arrangements reflects the political maneuverings and tensions within Saul's court. Merab's story also connects to the later narrative involving her children and the Gibeonites in <a href="/2_samuel/21.htm">2 Samuel 21</a>.<br><br>Michal: Michal, the younger daughter, is a significant figure due to her marriage to David. Her love for David is noted in <a href="/1_samuel/18-20.htm">1 Samuel 18:20</a>, and she plays a crucial role in helping David escape from Saul's attempts to kill him (<a href="/1_samuel/19-11.htm">1 Samuel 19:11-17</a>). Michal's relationship with David is complex, marked by love, political alliance, and later estrangement, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/6-16.htm">2 Samuel 6:16-23</a>. Her story highlights the personal and political challenges within the royal family and the broader narrative of David's rise to power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.
