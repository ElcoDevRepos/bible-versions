In the ancient Near East, early rising was often associated with important tasks or divine encounters, as seen with Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>) and Joshua (<a href="/joshua/3.htm">Joshua 3:1</a>). This phrase sets the stage for a significant event in Saul's life, marking the beginning of his journey as Israel's first king.<p><b>and just before dawn Samuel called to Saul on the roof</b><br>In ancient Israel, roofs were flat and often used as additional living space. Calling someone from the roof suggests a private and intimate setting, away from the public eye. This moment signifies a personal and direct communication from the prophet Samuel to Saul, highlighting the importance of the message. The timing, just before dawn, symbolizes a new beginning for Saul, as the light of day breaks, so does his new role.<p><b>&#8220;Get ready, and I will send you on your way!&#8221;</b><br>Samuel's command to "get ready" implies preparation for a significant mission. This phrase echoes the biblical theme of divine commissioning, where God prepares and sends individuals for His purposes, as seen with Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>). Samuel, as God's prophet, acts as the intermediary, emphasizing the divine authority behind Saul's impending kingship.<p><b>So Saul got ready</b><br>Saul's obedience in getting ready reflects his initial humility and willingness to follow God's direction through Samuel. This moment is pivotal, as it demonstrates Saul's acceptance of his calling, a theme that resonates with the biblical principle of readiness to serve God, seen in the lives of other leaders like David (<a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12-13</a>).<p><b>and both he and Samuel went outside together</b><br>The act of going outside together signifies unity and shared purpose between Saul and Samuel. It underscores the transition from private instruction to public action. This partnership between prophet and king is crucial in Israel's history, as it sets the tone for the relationship between divine guidance and earthly leadership. The unity here foreshadows the ideal relationship between God and His anointed leaders, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who perfectly embodies both roles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel is a key figure in the transition from the period of judges to the establishment of the monarchy.

Now the prophet passes along God&#8217;s summons to another.<p>&#8226; Saul, having slept under the prophet&#8217;s protection (<a href="/1_samuel/9-25.htm">1 Samuel 9:25</a>), is being drawn into a covenantal relationship with the Lord&#8217;s word.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Get ready, and I will send you on your way!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Get ready&#8221; matches Joshua&#8217;s charge: &#8220;Prepare provisions for yourselves, for in three days you will cross the Jordan&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/1-11.htm">Joshua 1:11</a>). Readiness precedes commissioning.<p>&#8226; &#8220;I will send you&#8221; echoes Jesus sending the Twelve two by two (<a href="/mark/6-7.htm">Mark 6:7</a>), underscoring that true authority comes from God through His chosen messenger.<p>&#8226; Samuel is about to anoint Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>); this is the prophetic green-light for his journey back to Gibeah and into kingship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So Saul got ready</b><p>&#8226; Immediate obedience marks the beginning of effective service.

Before sunrise, prophet and king rise, listen, prepare, and step out together. The rhythm&#8212;early rising, clear calling, ready obedience, shared movement&#8212;shows how God launches His servants into new chapters. Prompt responsiveness to His word, humble partnership with His messengers, and willingness to move from private preparation to public mission remain timeless marks of faithful discipleship.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">And they arose early.</span>--The English translation of this verse is misleading. It should run thus "And they arose early, namely, when the morning dawned. Samuel called for Saul upon the roof, Get up, that I may send thee, &c." The English rendering seems to suppose that they rose first, and afterwards, about the spring of the day (the morning dawn), Samuel called Saul--the fact being that, as is frequent in Hebrew narration, the second clause simply related the same event as the first clause had already done, only with greater detail. The sense then is obvious. Saul, evidently weary after the exciting scene and revelations of the day before, slept soundly, probably heavily, on his couch spread on the roof of the prophet's house. From this roof-top Samuel calls Saul in the early morning, wishing to conduct him himself out of the city, as he had a yet more important communication to make to his amazed and awe-struck visitor.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26, 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It came to pass about the spring of the day.</span> This is not a separate act from <span class="cmt_word">they arose early;</span> for the A.V. is wrong in translating the next clause, "Samuel called Saul to the top of the house." Saul had slept there, and, wearied out with his long wanderings and the excitement of the previous day, was fast asleep when Samuel came to him. The Hebrew is, "And they rose early; for at the spring of the day Samuel called to Saul upon the house top, saying," etc. And no sooner had Saul risen than they started upon his journey home, and as soon as they had left the city, at some fitting spot, Samuel bade the servant go forward, and as soon as he and Saul were alone he spake unto him <span class="cmt_word">the word of God.</span> And by that Divine word he who had left his father's house in search of lost asses was summoned to a post which, if one of the greatest dignity, was full also of danger, and burdened with solemn responsibility. And while on the human side Saul proved not unworthy of a royal crown, in his relation towards God he failed, because he let self-will and earthly policy prevail in his heart over obedience and trust in God. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/9-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They got up early in the morning,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1431;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#353;&#183;ki&#183;m&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
