Abinadab is Jesse's second son, following Eliab. The calling of Abinadab reflects the cultural practice of presenting sons in order of age or prominence, which was common in ancient Israelite society. This moment is set in Bethlehem, a small town with deep historical roots, later known as the birthplace of Jesus.<p><b>and presented him to Samuel</b><br>Samuel, the last judge and a prophet of Israel, is on a divine mission to anoint the next king of Israel. This presentation is part of a formal process, indicating the importance of the occasion. Samuel's role as a prophet is crucial, as he acts as God's representative, discerning God's choice for leadership. The act of presenting Abinadab highlights the expectation that the next king would be chosen from among Jesse's sons.<p><b>who said, &#8220;The LORD has not chosen this one either.&#8221;</b><br>Samuel's response underscores the divine nature of the selection process. It is not based on human criteria such as appearance or age, as seen earlier with Eliab. This phrase emphasizes God's sovereignty and His ability to see beyond outward appearances, a theme echoed in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>. The rejection of Abinadab, like Eliab, points to the unexpected choice of David, the youngest son, prefiguring the way God often chooses the unlikely or overlooked, a pattern seen throughout Scripture. This selection process foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, who was also not what many expected in a Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesse.htm">Jesse</a></b><br>The father of David and his brothers, a resident of Bethlehem.

He does not speculate or stall, modeling prophetic fidelity (<a href="/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19-20</a>).<p>- By speaking aloud, he keeps the entire family aware that the decision is the LORD&#8217;s alone, not his personal preference (cf. <a href="/numbers/24-13.htm">Numbers 24:13</a>).<p>- Each rejection sets up a rhythm that heightens anticipation for God&#8217;s unexpected choice (<a href="/romans/11-33.htm">Romans 11:33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;The LORD has not chosen this one either.&#8221;</b><p>- God&#8217;s selection criteria are moral and spiritual, not merely physical or cultural (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>).<p>- The repeated &#8220;not chosen&#8221; dismantles human confidence in r&#233;sum&#233; religion, preparing hearts to value inner character over external impressiveness (<a href="/proverbs/31-30.htm">Proverbs 31:30</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>).<p>- The phrase also highlights divine sovereignty: &#8220;chosen&#8221; belongs to the LORD, echoing Jesus&#8217; later words, &#8220;You did not choose Me, but I chose you&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-16.htm">John 15:16</a>).<p>- Abinadab&#8217;s rejection does not diminish his worth; it simply clarifies that a different, God-appointed role awaits him (<a href="/1_samuel/17-13.htm">1 Samuel 17:13</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/12-9.htm">1 Chronicles 12:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/16-8.htm">1 Samuel 16:8</a> records Jesse&#8217;s confident presentation of his second son, Samuel&#8217;s attentive listening, and God&#8217;s decisive &#8220;No.&#8221; The verse teaches that leadership in God&#8217;s kingdom is determined by His sovereign choice and by heart condition, not age, appearance, or human rank.
