This moment occurs after David arrives at the battlefield to deliver supplies and hears Goliath's challenge. Eliab's reaction may stem from jealousy or embarrassment, as David's presence and interest in the battle highlight Eliab's own inaction. This phrase underscores the tension between David and his brothers, reminiscent of Joseph's relationship with his brothers in <a href="/genesis/37-4.htm">Genesis 37:4</a>, where sibling rivalry and misunderstanding are evident. David's question also highlights his role as an outsider, not yet recognized as the future king, yet already demonstrating the qualities that God saw in him.<p><b>&#8220;said David.&#8221;</b><br>David, the youngest son of Jesse, is introduced in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16</a> as a shepherd and musician, chosen by God and anointed by Samuel to be king. His character is marked by faith, courage, and a heart aligned with God's will. This moment in the narrative foreshadows David's future leadership and his reliance on God rather than human strength. David's life is a type of Christ, as both are shepherds who become kings, and both face opposition from their own people. David's faith and reliance on God in this chapter prefigure Christ's trust in the Father during His earthly ministry.<p><b>&#8220;Was it not just a question?&#8221;</b><br>David's rhetorical question emphasizes his innocence and genuine curiosity about the situation with Goliath. It also highlights his courage and willingness to challenge the status quo, contrasting with the fear and hesitation of the Israelite army. This moment is pivotal, as it sets the stage for David's confrontation with Goliath, where he demonstrates his faith in God over the might of human warriors. The question also reflects a deeper spiritual truth: the importance of questioning and seeking God's perspective in the face of fear and doubt. David's inquiry can be seen as a precursor to his psalms, where he often questions and seeks understanding from God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The youngest son of Jesse, anointed by Samuel to be the future king of Israel.

He wants information, not glory.<p>&#8226; Asking good questions is wise: &#8220;He who answers a matter before he hears it, it is folly and shame to him&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/18-13.htm">Proverbs 18:13</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s question highlights his focus on God&#8217;s honor&#8212;&#8220;Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Zeal for God&#8217;s name fuels him (compare <a href="/psalms/69-9.htm">Psalm 69:9</a>), foreshadowing his declaration to Goliath: &#8220;I come against you in the name of the LORD of Hosts&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>).<p>&#8226; In Scripture, earnest inquiries often precede great acts of faith&#8212;Joshua sought the Commander of the LORD&#8217;s army (<a href="/joshua/5-13.htm">Joshua 5:13-15</a>), and Jehoshaphat sought the LORD before battle (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-3.htm">2 Chronicles 20:3-15</a>).

The verse reminds believers to maintain integrity when misunderstood and to keep asking faith-filled questions that magnify the honor of the living God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">Is there not a cause?</span>--David answers his jealous and over-bearing elder brother with all gentleness and forbearance, but he does not cease to make his inquiries of the soldiers respecting the giant, nor does he refrain from loudly expressing his astonishment at such a public insult to the God of Israel being allowed to continue for so many days. The Hebrew here would be more literally rendered, "Is it not a word," or "It was only a word," thus deprecating his elder brother's anger. "What have I done? It was but a mere word. I was only speaking with holy anger about this impious challenge of the Philistine; nothing more." The ancient versions thus understand this clause.<p>If we render as the Authorised Version, then the sense is quite clear. "You seem bitterly displeased with my zeal in this matter, but surely, is there not a good cause for my passionate emotion here--such an insult to our God?"<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;What</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(meh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have I done</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1513;&#1474;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#238;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">now?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1425;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;t&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6258.htm">Strong's 6258: </a> </span><span class="str2">At this time</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">David.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1428;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Was it not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1469;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1931.htm">Strong's 1931: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, self, the same, this, that, as, are</span><br /><br /><span class="word">just a question?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1445;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/1_samuel/17-29.htm">1 Samuel 17:29 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/1_samuel/17-29.htm">1 Samuel 17:29 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/1_samuel/17-29.htm">1 Samuel 17:29 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/1_samuel/17-29.htm">1 Samuel 17:29 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/1_samuel/17-29.htm">1 Samuel 17:29 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/1_samuel/17-29.htm">1 Samuel 17:29  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/1_samuel/17-29.htm">1 Samuel 17:29 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/1_samuel/17-29.htm">1 Samuel 17:29 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/1_samuel/17-29.htm">1 Samuel 17:29 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/1_samuel/17-29.htm">1 Samuel 17:29 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/1_samuel/17-29.htm">OT History: 1 Samuel 17:29 David said What have I now done?
