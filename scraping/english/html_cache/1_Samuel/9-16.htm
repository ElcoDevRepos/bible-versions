It highlights the divine orchestration in the selection of Saul as king, showing that God's plans are executed with precision.<p><b>I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin</b><br>The tribe of Benjamin was the smallest of the tribes of Israel, as noted in <a href="/judges/21-6.htm">Judges 21:6</a>. This choice underscores God's pattern of using the least likely individuals to fulfill His purposes, similar to His selection of David, the youngest son of Jesse, and later, Jesus, born in humble circumstances.<p><b>and you are to anoint him ruler over My people Israel</b><br>Anointing was a significant act in ancient Israel, symbolizing the setting apart and empowerment by God for a specific role. This act foreshadows the anointing of Jesus as the Messiah, the ultimate King and Savior. The term "ruler" indicates a leadership role, but it also implies responsibility and accountability to God.<p><b>he will save them from the hand of the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were a constant threat to Israel during this period, representing the external pressures and challenges faced by God's people. Saul's role as a deliverer is a type of Christ, who delivers His people from sin and spiritual oppression. This deliverance is both physical and spiritual, pointing to the ultimate salvation through Jesus.<p><b>For I have looked upon My people</b><br>This phrase reflects God's compassion and concern for His people, reminiscent of His response to the Israelites' cries in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>). It underscores the personal relationship between God and Israel, highlighting His role as a caring and attentive deity.<p><b>because their cry has come to Me</b><br>The cry of the Israelites signifies their distress and need for divine intervention. This mirrors the cries of humanity for redemption, which God answers through the sending of His Son, Jesus Christ.

The power of the Philistines was broken, but by no means destroyed, in the great battle of Mizpeh. We know that all through King Saul's reign, and in the early days of King David, these invasions were repeated with varying success. The statement of <a href="/1_samuel/7-13.htm" title="So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.">1Samuel 7:13</a> must be understood not as representing that the victory of Mizpeh once and for all destroyed the Philistine power, but that from that day the power of these determined enemies of Israel began to decline. The words of <a href="/1_samuel/7-13.htm" title="So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.">1Samuel 7:13</a> must be taken as including the <span class= "ital">ultimate </span>result of the great Hebrew victory. It is clear that the annoyance of these Philistine raids and incursions were the immediate cause of the prayer for a king. The desire for this form of government, no doubt, for a very long while had existed among the people, but this pressing need for a younger and more warlike leader than their old prophet. judge prompted the request to Samuel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines.</span> Though Samuel had lightened the yoke of the Philistines by his victory at Mizpah, yet he had by no means altogether broken their power. It is so constantly the habit of the historical books of the Bible to include the distant and ultimate results of an act in their account of it, that we must not conclude that what is said in <a href="/1_samuel/7-13.htm">1 Samuel 7:13-15</a> was the immediate consequence of Samuel's victory. Especially, when it said that "the hand of Jehovah was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel," it is plain that Soul's successful wars are included in the writer's summary of events, inasmuch as Samuel's life was prolonged until nearly the close of that monarch's reign. The words further show that Soul's office was essentially military, though this is too much emphasised in the A.V., which renders by <span class="cmt_word">captain</span> a word which really means <span class="accented">prince, chief.</span> Saul, as a Benjamite, belonged to the bravest and most warlike tribe of Israel, and one whose country was the seat of perpetual combat with the Philistines. <span class="cmt_word">Their cry is come unto me.</span> Plainly, therefore, Israel was again suffering from Philistine domination. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/9-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;At this time</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1506;&#1461;&#1443;&#1514;
