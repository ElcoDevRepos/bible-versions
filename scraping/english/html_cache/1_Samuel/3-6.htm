In the biblical context, God often calls individuals multiple times to ensure they understand His message, as seen with Moses (Exodus 3) and Gideon (Judges 6). The repetition underscores the significance of Samuel's future role as a prophet. The use of Samuel's name signifies a personal relationship, as God knows His chosen ones intimately.<p><b>So Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said, &#8220;Here I am, for you have called me.&#8221;</b><br>Samuel's response demonstrates obedience and respect for Eli, his mentor. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, young apprentices served under priests to learn and assist in temple duties. Samuel's willingness to serve reflects his humility and readiness to learn. This interaction also foreshadows Samuel's future role as a servant leader in Israel, paralleling Christ's servanthood (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><b>&#8220;My son, I did not call,&#8221; Eli replied.</b><br>Eli's response shows his paternal relationship with Samuel, addressing him affectionately as "my son." This reflects the familial structure within the temple, where Eli acted as a father figure. Historically, Eli was the high priest, and his guidance was crucial for Samuel's spiritual development. Eli's inability to recognize God's call initially may symbolize the spiritual decline in Israel, contrasting with Samuel's rising prophetic role.<p><b>&#8220;Go back and lie down.&#8221;</b><br>Eli instructs Samuel to return to rest, indicating a lack of awareness of the divine encounter. This phrase suggests a period of waiting and preparation, as God often calls individuals during times of rest or solitude (e.g., Jacob's dream in <a href="/genesis/28.htm">Genesis 28</a>). The instruction to lie down can also symbolize a return to a state of receptivity, preparing Samuel for further divine communication. This moment of waiting is akin to the patience required in spiritual growth and discernment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A young boy serving in the temple under Eli's guidance.
