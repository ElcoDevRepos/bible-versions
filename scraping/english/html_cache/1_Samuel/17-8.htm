The Philistines were a formidable enemy of Israel, often at war with them. Goliath, a giant from Gath, represents the peak of Philistine military might. His challenge is not just to the army but to the God of Israel, as the Philistines worshiped different deities. This moment sets the stage for a confrontation that is both physical and spiritual.<p><b>Why do you come out and array yourselves for battle?</b><br>Goliath's question is taunting, meant to undermine the morale of the Israelite army. The Israelites, led by King Saul, were encamped in the Valley of Elah, a strategic location for battle. The Philistines occupied one hill and the Israelites another, with the valley between them. Goliath's challenge questions the Israelites' readiness and capability, highlighting the psychological warfare common in ancient battles.<p><b>Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul?</b><br>Goliath emphasizes his identity as a Philistine, a people known for their advanced weaponry and military prowess. By referring to the Israelites as "servants of Saul," he diminishes their identity as God's chosen people, reducing them to mere followers of a human king. This reflects the Philistines' disdain for Israel and their God, and it challenges Saul's leadership, as Saul himself was chosen by God to lead Israel.<p><b>Choose one of your men and have him come down against me</b><br>This proposal of single combat was a common practice in ancient warfare, intended to decide the outcome of a battle without mass bloodshed. Goliath's challenge is a test of Israel's faith and courage. It foreshadows David's emergence as a type of Christ, a savior figure who confronts evil on behalf of God's people. This moment prefigures the ultimate victory of Christ over sin and death, as David, the future king, will defeat Goliath not by might, but by faith in God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/goliath.htm">Goliath</a></b><br>A giant Philistine warrior known for his immense size and strength, challenging the Israelites to send a champion to fight him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, led by King Saul, who were encamped in the Valley of Elah to face the Philistine army.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A group of people who were enemies of Israel, often in conflict with them during this period.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who was leading the Israelite army against the Philistines.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/v/valley_of_elah.htm">Valley of Elah</a></b><br>The location where the battle between the Israelites and the Philistines took place.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_identity_in_god.htm">Understanding Our Identity in God</a></b><br>Goliath's challenge questions the identity of the Israelites as "servants of Saul."

The Targum of Jonathan adds here the proud boast of the giant warrior that it was he who had slain Hophni and Phinehas (the sons of Eli, the high priest), and had carried the Ark to the temple of Dagon. This Targum, although comparatively a late compilation, doubtless embodied many ancient national traditions.<p><span class= "bld">And ye servants to Saul.</span>--Thus taunting the soldiers of Israel with the memory of the former glory of their king.

The same word is used throughout (see vers. 10, 20, 21, 22, 26, 45). <span class="cmt_word">Am not I a Philistine?</span> Hebrew, "the Philistine," the champion on their side. <span class="cmt_word">I defy the armies.</span> Hebrew, "I have cast scorn or insult upon the ranks of Israel this day." The sense is not so much that he defied them as that they were dishonoured by not accepting his challenge. <span class="cmt_word">They were dismayed.</span> That is, terrified, and made uncertain what to do (comp. Jeremiah 1:36). We have seen from Mr. Condor's account that each army held an impregnable position on the two sides of the ravine, which neither could cross without the certainty of being defeated in the attempt by the other side. Under such circumstances there seemed no way of deciding the contest except by a single combat. But though Saul and his warriors were too terrified at Goliath's appearance to venture to meet him, still they held their ground for forty days, inasmuch as it was evidently impossible for him to cross the ravine clad in such cumbrous armour, nor did the Philistines venture to make the attempt, us the Israelites would have taken them at a manifest disadvantage. DAVID'S VISIT TO THE CAMP (vers. 12-31). The Vatican codex of the Septuagint omits the whole of this section, and it was inserted in the Alexandrian copy by Origen. It is found, however, in the other versions; and possibly this treatment of David's history as of a person unknown, just after the account given of him in ch. 16, did not seem so strange to readers in old time as it does to us, with whom reading is so much more easy an accomplishment. It is, nevertheless, one of the many indications that the Books of Samuel, though compiled from contemporaneous documents, were not arranged in their present form till long afterwards. It was only gradually that Samuel's schools dispersed throughout the country men trained in reading and writing, and trained up scholars capable of keeping the annals of each king's reign. The Books of Kings were, as we know, compiled from these annals; but probably at each prophetic school there would be stored up copies of Psalms written for their religious services, ballads such as those in the Book of Jashar, and in the Book of the Wars of Jehovah, narratives of stirring events like this before us, and histories both of their own chiefs, such as was Samuel, and afterwards Elijah and Elisha, and also of the kings. There is nothing remarkable, therefore, at finding information repeated; and having had in the previous narrative an account of a passing introduction of David to Saul as a musician, which led to little at the time, though subsequently David stood high in Saul's favour because of his skill upon the harp, we here have David's introduction to Saul as a warrior. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And [Goliath] stood</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1502;&#1465;&#1431;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;m&#333;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
