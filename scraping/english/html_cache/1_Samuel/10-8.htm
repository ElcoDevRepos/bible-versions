It was the first campsite of the Israelites after crossing the Jordan River (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19-20</a>) and served as a base for their operations in the conquest of Canaan. The location symbolizes a place of new beginnings and covenant renewal. Samuel instructs Saul to go to Gilgal, indicating a return to foundational spiritual practices and obedience to God's commands. This directive underscores the importance of following divine instructions precisely, as Gilgal was a place where Israel reaffirmed their commitment to God.<p><b>and surely I will come to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings</b><br>Burnt offerings and peace offerings were integral parts of Israelite worship, symbolizing atonement and fellowship with God, respectively. The burnt offering was entirely consumed by fire, representing total dedication to God (Leviticus 1), while the peace offering was shared between the altar, the priests, and the offerer, symbolizing communion with God (Leviticus 3). Samuel's role in offering these sacrifices highlights his position as a prophet and priest, mediating between God and the people. This act also prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who fulfills and transcends these offerings through His atoning death and resurrection, establishing eternal peace with God (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>).<p><b>Wait seven days until I come to you</b><br>The instruction to wait seven days is a test of Saul's obedience and patience. The number seven often signifies completeness and divine perfection in the Bible, as seen in the creation week (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>). This waiting period is a divine appointment, emphasizing the need for Saul to rely on God's timing rather than his own understanding. It foreshadows the importance of waiting on the Lord, a theme echoed throughout Scripture (<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-31.htm">Isaiah 40:31</a>). Saul's failure to wait later in <a href="/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8-14</a> demonstrates the consequences of impatience and disobedience, contrasting with the faithfulness required of a king.<p><b>and show you what you are to do</b><br>This phrase indicates that Saul's kingship is to be guided by divine revelation and prophetic instruction. Samuel, as God's prophet, is the conduit through which God's will is communicated. This dependence on divine guidance is crucial for the success of Saul's reign and reflects the broader biblical principle that leaders should seek God's direction in all matters (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>). The need for divine instruction also points to the ultimate guidance provided by Jesus Christ, who is the "way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), offering perfect wisdom and direction for His followers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The prophet and last judge of Israel, who anointed Saul as the first king of Israel.

Gilgal was the first campsite in the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>), a place of covenant remembrance (<a href="/joshua/5-10.htm">Joshua 5:10</a>) and national gatherings (<a href="/1_samuel/11-14.htm">1 Samuel 11:14&#8211;15</a>). By sending Saul &#8220;before me,&#8221; Samuel keeps the spiritual authority in view: Saul leads militarily, yet he must move under prophetic direction, just as Israel had followed Moses at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-16</a>). The instruction reminds us that even kings answer to God&#8217;s word delivered through His servants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and surely I will come to you</b><p>Samuel promises his personal arrival, underscoring that Israel&#8217;s worship and warfare hinge on God-ordained leadership. Similar prophet-priest involvement appears when Moses stood on the hill while Joshua fought Amalek (<a href="/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9-13</a>). Saul must not presume to act alone; divine presence, mediated by the prophet, is essential.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings</b><p>Burnt offerings symbolize total consecration (<a href="/leviticus/1-3.htm">Leviticus 1:3-9</a>); peace offerings celebrate fellowship with God (<a href="/leviticus/3-1.htm">Leviticus 3:1-17</a>). The pairing teaches that victory and peace come from wholehearted surrender followed by joyful communion. By reserving these acts for Samuel, God safeguards proper worship, echoing the judgment on King Uzziah when he usurped priestly duties (<a href="/2_chronicles/26-16.htm">2 Chronicles 26:16-21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Wait seven days</b><p>Seven marks completeness in Scripture (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>). Saul must practice patient trust, just as the people circled Jericho for seven days before the walls fell (<a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2-5</a>). Waiting is not inactivity; it is active submission that tests whether Saul will rule by faith or by impulse.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>until I come to you and show you what you are to do</b><p>Guidance is progressive. Saul receives only the next step, mirroring Abraham, who set out &#8220;not knowing where he was going&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-8.htm">Hebrews 11:8</a>). Samuel will &#8220;show&#8221; further instruction, affirming <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>&#8212;God directs the paths of those who acknowledge Him. Tragically, in <a href="/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8-14</a> Saul will break this very command, proving that partial obedience is disobedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/10-8.htm">1 Samuel 10:8</a> calls Saul&#8212;and every believer&#8212;to obedient dependence on God&#8217;s revealed word: go where He sends, wait for His timing, worship His way, and let Him unfold the next steps. Gilgal&#8217;s lesson is clear: victory and blessing flow through humble submission, while impatience forfeits divine favor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And shew thee what thou shalt do.</span>--Considerable doubt exists among expositors as to the exact meaning and reference of these words of Samuel. In 1 Samuel 13., <a href="/1_samuel/10-8.htm" title="And you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shall you tarry, till I come to you, and show you what you shall do.">1Samuel 10:8</a> and following, a well-known and most important event in Saul's life and reign is related, in which the circumstances strangely fit in with the words of the warning of Samuel. Only between this first meeting of the seer and the future king and the Gilgal meeting, described in 1 Samuel 13., two years--perhaps even a much longer period--elapsed (the dates of this age are most uncertain); besides which, that famous meeting at Gilgal was not by any means the first meeting of Samuel and Saul at that place. Yet, in spite of these difficulties, it seems best to refer to this meeting between the prophet and king at Gilgal, related in 1 Samuel 13, as the trial of faith especially looked on to by Samuel here. The solemn warning here given was, doubtless, repeated in a much more detailed form by the prophet some time before the appointed Gilgal meeting. So much for the <span class= "ital">reference; </span>the signification of the warning is best explained in the following way:--Samuel had bidden the future king to advance along the paths of glory and difficulty which lay before him in all confidence and trust, acting in each emergency according to the dictates of his own heart--only in <span class= "ital">one </span>thing he must be ever on his guard. In his future great work for the regeneration and advancement of Israel, he must, for the sake of the faith of Israel, be on his guard against infringing the sacred privileges of the religion of the Eternal. In the plenitude of his kingly power, the day would come when the temptation would assault him to disregard the ancient sanctity of the sacrifice, and to assume as king, functions which belonged alone to men like Samuel set apart for the sacred office, and thus publicly to dishonour the commandments of God, and by his reckless example of unbelief in revelation to weaken the faith of the people.<p>Such a temptation presented itself to Saul, we believe, some two or more years from this time, when, as related in 1 Samuel 13, a solemn assembly of the people was summoned to Gilgal, before the commencement of the war of independence. This great enterprise for the people of the Lord must necessarily be begun with solemn religious rites and sacrifices. These the king was forbidden to officiate at without the presence of the Divinely appointed seer. We shall see how King Saul acted under the temptation to set himself and his royal power above the prophet of the Lord and the direct command of God. Whether or no King Saul with his own hand offered the Gilgal sacrifice is uncertain; at all events, the great sin he seemed to have been guilty of having committed, is to have declined to wait for the presence of the prophet of the Lord, although publicly required by the word of the Lord to do so. (See Notes on 1 Samuel 13)<p>The "heart" is mentioned as changed by God, because, according to the conception of the Divine writings, the <span class= "ital">heart </span>is represented as the centre of the whole mental and physical life--of will, desire, thought, perception, and feeling. It was one thing for Samuel the seer to put before the young Benjamite the brilliant destiny which lay before him, but it was another and different thing to transform one like Saul, brought up to merely agricultural pursuits, into a fit and worthy recipient of such honours and powers. We know how utterly incapable are all such things as wealth and rank and power in themselves of inspiring the heart with any noble patriotic aspirations, or with any high religious longings, or lofty patriotic aims; a higher influence is needed to awaken the heart, or to rouse it from merely earthly and sordid contemplations.<p>This is the work which God worked in the heart. of the young Saul as, in the early morning, he left "Ramah of the Watchers," his ears tingling with the burning words of the great seer all through that day and many succeeding days. In quiet humility, and, no doubt, with many a silent prayer, he watched and waited; when he returned home there was no sign of exultation visible in the man, no mark of impatience. His lips were sealed; he seems to have whispered to no one what the prophet had told him; he made no sign even when events came crowding thick about him--such as the popular assembly for the choice of a king, presided over by the prophet-judge, whose mind Saul alone in Israel knew: the drawing of the lots: the narrowing of the fateful circle: the designation of his tribe, his family, then himself. We see, indeed, God had changed his heart. Was there not in these early days a promise of a noble king--a man after God's own heart?<p><span class= "bld">And all those signs came to pass that day.</span>--Of the first two signs which were to meet him no further details are given; we are simply told that in the order predicted by Samuel Saul came across them. The third alone gives occasion for a special mention, because it had a great effect on the life of the future king.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal.</span> We find in <a href="/1_samuel/13-8.htm">1 Samuel 13:8-13</a> a meeting at Gilgal so exactly parallel to what is arranged here that we cannot help looking upon this, again, as a sort of sign to be fulfilled at a later period. It is no argument against it that Gilgal was the place where in the mean while Saul was solemnly inaugurated king; for he was appointed in order that he might deliver Israel from the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16</a>), and we may feel sure that this grand purpose would form the subject of conversation between the prophet and the soldier, either on the house-top or the next morning. In this conversation Gilgal would be selected as the place where Saul would assemble Israel for the war of independence (so Rashi and other Jewish interpreters); and so great an enterprise must necessarily be begun with religious rites, and Saul was to wait a full week for the prophet's coming, both to try his faith, which ought to have been confirmed by the fulfilment of the three appointed signs, and in order that the war might be undertaken under the same holy auspices as his own election to the kingdom. The two years' interval, were it really so long, would give time for Saul's character to develop under the forcing influences of royalty, and it would then be proved, when he felt himself every inch a king, whether he was still as amenable to the Divine authority as when he was first summoned from obscurity to mount a kingly throne. But, really, the words in <a href="/1_samuel/13-1.htm">1 Samuel 13:1</a> do not justify this conclusion, and most probably the occurrences mentioned in that chapter followed immediately upon Saul's confirmation as king. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/10-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And you shall go</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1512;&#1463;&#1491;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1443;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;ra&#7695;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
