The report reaching David signifies his growing reputation as a leader and protector of Israel, even while he is not yet king. This reflects the divine favor and anointing upon David, as he is seen as a deliverer by the people. The communication of such reports to David indicates the trust and hope placed in him by the Israelites.<p><b>&#8220;Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah</b><br>Keilah is a fortified city in the lowlands of Judah, strategically important due to its location. The Philistines, perennial enemies of Israel, often attacked border towns to weaken Israel's defenses and economy. This attack on Keilah highlights the constant threat the Philistines posed during this period. The mention of Keilah connects to the broader narrative of David's battles against the Philistines, which foreshadow his future role as king and protector of Israel.<p><b>and looting the threshing floors.&#8221;</b><br>Threshing floors were critical to the agricultural economy, as they were used for processing grain. By looting these, the Philistines aimed to cripple the food supply and economic stability of the region. This act of aggression underscores the Philistines' strategy of economic warfare. The looting of threshing floors also symbolizes the spiritual and physical oppression faced by Israel, which David, as a type of Christ, is called to alleviate.

Then David departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.">1Samuel 22:5</a>) had summoned David to return with his armed band to Judah. There was a great work ready to his hand in his own country at that juncture. Saul was becoming more and more neglectful of his higher duty--that of protecting his people; as time went on and his malady increased, his whole thoughts were concentrated on David's imaginary crimes, and the history of the latter part of his reign is little more than a recital of his sad, bewildered efforts to compass the young hero's destruction. The task of protecting the people from the constant marauding expeditions of the Philistines, and probably of the neighbouring nations, then was entrusted to David. To point this out to the son of Jesse was evidently the first great mission of Gad the seer. Samuel's mind was, no doubt, busied in this matter. It is more than probable that Gad was first dispatched to join David at the instigation of the aged, but still mentally vigorous, prophet.<p><span class= "bld">Keilah.</span>--"This town lay in the lowlands of Judah, not far from the Philistine frontier, some miles south of Adullam, being perched on a steep hill overlooking the valley of Elah, not far from the thickets of Hareth" (Conder; <span class= "ital">Tent Life in Palestine</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They told David,</span> etc. The return of David into his own land was quickly followed by exploits which not only increased his power, but turned the eyes of all the people towards him as their protector. His first success was the deliverance of the city of <span class="cmt_word">Keilah</span> from a body of Philistines who were plundering it of the produce of its harvest. This place lay a few miles south of the stronghold of Adullam, and itself occupied a defensible position, being perched on a steep hill overlooking the valley of Elah, not far from the thickets of Hareth (Condor, 'Tent Work,' 2:88). Being thus at no great distance from the Philistine border, a band of men started thence on a foray for the purpose of robbing the <span class="cmt_word">threshing floors</span>. As no rain falls in Palestine in the harvest season (<a href="/1_samuel/12-17.htm">1 Samuel 12:17</a>), the corn is threshed out in the open air by a heavy wooden sledge made of two boards, and curved up in front, with pieces of basalt inserted for teeth, drawn over it by horses, or it is trampled out by cattle. Conder ('Tent Work,' 2:259) describes the threshing floor as "a broad flat space on open ground, generally high. Sometimes the floor is on a flat rocky hill top, and occasionally it is in an open valley, down which there is a current of air; but it is always situated where most wind can be found, because at the threshing season high winds never occur, and the grain is safely stored before the autumn storms commence." As the grain after winnowing is made into heaps until it can be carried home, there is always a period when the threshing floors have to be watched to guard them from depredation, and this was the time chosen by the Philistines for a foray in force. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/23-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now it was reported</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yag&#183;gi&#183;&#7695;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5046.htm">Strong's 5046: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be conspicuous</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to David,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Look,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
