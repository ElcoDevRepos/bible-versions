The loss of donkeys would have been a significant concern for Kish, indicating his wealth and status. This event sets the stage for Saul's introduction, highlighting God's providence in using ordinary circumstances to fulfill His purposes. The wandering of the donkeys can be seen as a divine orchestration leading to Saul's anointing as king, illustrating how God works through everyday events.<p><b>and Kish said to his son Saul</b><br>Kish, a Benjamite, is introduced as Saul's father, establishing Saul's tribal identity. The tribe of Benjamin was the smallest of the tribes of Israel, which is significant in understanding Saul's initial humility and later rise to kingship. Saul's obedience to his father reflects the cultural importance of family hierarchy and respect for parental authority in ancient Israelite society.<p><b>&#8220;Take one of the servants and go look for the donkeys.&#8221;</b><br>Kish's instruction to Saul to take a servant underscores the social structure of the time, where servants played a crucial role in the household. The inclusion of a servant suggests Kish's wealth and the trust placed in Saul to handle family matters. This journey marks the beginning of Saul's path to kingship, as it leads him to Samuel, the prophet.
