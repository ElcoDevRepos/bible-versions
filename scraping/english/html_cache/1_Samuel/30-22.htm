In the biblical context, these terms often refer to those who act contrary to God's will and lack moral integrity. The presence of such individuals among David's men reflects the diverse nature of his followers, who included those in distress, debt, or discontented (<a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>). This diversity sometimes led to internal conflicts and challenges in leadership. The term "wicked and worthless" is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe those who oppose God's anointed, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12</a> regarding Eli's sons.<p><b>&#8220;Because they did not go with us,</b><br>This part of the verse reveals a sense of entitlement and exclusion among the men who fought with David. It reflects a common human tendency to value effort and contribution in tangible terms, often leading to division. The historical context shows that David's men had just returned from a successful mission to recover their families and possessions from the Amalekites. The men who stayed behind were likely exhausted or tasked with guarding supplies, a necessary role in any military campaign. This situation parallels the parable of the workers in the vineyard (<a href="/matthew/20.htm">Matthew 20:1-16</a>), where Jesus teaches about the kingdom of heaven and the equality of all who serve, regardless of their role or timing.<p><b>we will not share with them the plunder we recovered,</b><br>The refusal to share the plunder reflects a misunderstanding of communal responsibility and grace. In ancient Near Eastern culture, sharing spoils of war was a common practice, often dictated by the leader. David's leadership is tested here, as he must address the selfishness and division within his ranks. This moment foreshadows the New Testament teaching of sharing and unity within the body of Christ (<a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32-35</a>), where believers are called to hold all things in common and support one another.<p><b>except for each man&#8217;s wife and children.</b><br>This exception acknowledges the basic familial rights and responsibilities, even among those considered "wicked and worthless." It underscores the importance of family in biblical times, where the protection and provision for one's household were paramount. The restoration of families here can be seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where He restores and reconciles broken relationships (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<p><b>They may take them and go.&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "They may take them and go" suggests a dismissal and separation from the community, highlighting the tension between justice and mercy. David's response to this situation, which follows in the subsequent verses, demonstrates his wisdom and fairness as a leader. He insists on sharing the plunder equally, setting a precedent for future generations and reflecting God's inclusive nature. This decision aligns with the biblical principle of unity and equality among God's people, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for all are one in Christ Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, leading his men in battle and demonstrating leadership and fairness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/w/wicked_and_worthless_men.htm">Wicked and Worthless Men</a></b><br>A group among David's followers who displayed selfishness and a lack of compassion.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziklag.htm">Ziklag</a></b><br>The place where David and his men returned to find it raided by the Amalekites, prompting their pursuit and recovery mission.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/amalekites.htm">Amalekites</a></b><br>The enemy who raided Ziklag, taking captives and plunder, which David and his men pursued and recovered.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plunder.htm">The Plunder</a></b><br>The goods and captives recovered from the Amalekites, which became a point of contention among David's men.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_fairness.htm">Leadership and Fairness</a></b><br>David exemplifies godly leadership by ensuring fairness and unity among his men, teaching us the importance of equitable treatment in our communities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/selfishness_vs._generosity.htm">Selfishness vs. Generosity</a></b><br>The contrast between the wicked men and David highlights the Christian call to generosity and selflessness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_the_body_of_christ.htm">Unity in the Body of Christ</a></b><br>Just as David sought to maintain unity among his followers, we are called to foster unity and support within the church.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/grace_over_merit.htm">Grace Over Merit</a></b><br>David's decision reflects the biblical principle of grace, where blessings are shared not based on merit but on the grace of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/handling_conflict.htm">Handling Conflict</a></b><br>David's response to the conflict among his men provides a model for resolving disputes with wisdom and fairness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Samuel_30_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Samuel 30:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Samuel_30_22_Unity_s_importance.htm">How does 1 Samuel 30:22 illustrate the importance of unity among believers?

Two hundred soldiers were exhausted and stayed behind with the supplies at the Brook Besor, while four hundred pressed on, defeated the Amalekites, and recovered everything (30:9-20). Verse 22 records the immediate reaction of a faction within the victorious four hundred. Similar tension appears in <a href="/numbers/31-25.htm">Numbers 31:25-27</a>, where God commands equal distribution of spoils, reminding us that this is not a new dilemma for God&#8217;s people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Identifying the speakers: &#8220;all the wicked and worthless men&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Scripture labels them &#8220;wicked and worthless,&#8221; signaling that their viewpoint is morally corrupt.<p>&#8226; In <a href="/1_samuel/25-17.htm">1 Samuel 25:17</a>, the same word &#8220;worthless&#8221; (BSB: &#8220;worthless fellow&#8221;) described Nabal, another character driven by selfishness.<p>&#8226; Their presence among David&#8217;s troops shows that proximity to God&#8217;s anointed leader does not automatically produce godly character; transformation is always a matter of the heart (cf. <a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The heart of the complaint: &#8220;Because they did not go with us&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The grumbling soldiers see the two hundred as non-contributors.<p>&#8226; They elevate personal effort above covenant loyalty, ignoring that the weary troops served by guarding the supplies (30:24).<p>&#8226; <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a> reminds believers to &#8220;regard one another as more important than yourselves&#8221;.

David corrects this in verses 23-25, establishing a lasting ordinance of shared spoil that Jesus later echoes in <a href="/matthew/10-41.htm">Matthew 10:41-42</a>&#8212;everyone who supports the mission shares the reward.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/30-22.htm">1 Samuel 30:22</a> exposes a selfish faction within David&#8217;s army who wanted to deny equal spoil to comrades that stayed with the supplies. Their proposal reveals pride, a misplaced sense of ownership, and contempt for fellow believers. Scripture consistently teaches that victory comes from the Lord and that all who participate&#8212;whether on the front lines or in supportive roles&#8212;share equally in His provision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial.</span>--The scene here related chronicles an act of greed and of heartless covetousness--an act that has been many times repeated in the world's history. The wise compiler of the book chose it as part of the memoirs of David, which were to be preserved in the sacred volume, because it was another authoritative declaration on the part of the beloved king respecting a question which would crop up again and again on the conclusion of a campaign. The chronicler was justified in his selection, for this famous decision of David continued in force until the time of the Maccabees. (See <a href="//apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/8-28.htm" title="And after the sabbath, when they had given part of the spoils to the maimed, and the widows, and orphans, the residue they divided among themselves and their servants.">2 Maccabees 8:28-30</a>.) A somewhat similar law was enacted by Moses. (See <a href="/numbers/31-27.htm" title="And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war on them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:">Numbers 31:27</a>.) The dispute arose thus: The victorious troop with their enormous booty quickly re turned to the brook Besor, where the 200 that had broken down on the rapid march had been left to guard the baggage. David salutes these with all kindly courtesy; but the harmony which prevailed in the little camp is speedily broken owing to the highhanded claims of the 400 who had actually taken part in the rescue. These refused to share the booty with their comrades who had been left behind, only proposing just to restore to them their wives and those things of their own which had been recovered from the Amalekites. David, however, refused to listen to these iniquitous claims, and decided that all the fighting part of the force, and those men who had stayed behind and guarded the baggage at the brook Besor, should share alike.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/30-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">but all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the wicked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1443;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7451.htm">Strong's 7451: </a> </span><span class="str2">Bad, evil</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and worthless</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1431;&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;l&#238;&#183;ya&#183;&#8216;al)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
