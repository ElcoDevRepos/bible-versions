He had the opportunity to kill Saul, who was pursuing him unjustly, but chose to spare his life. This reflects David's respect for God's anointed and his trust in God's timing for his own kingship. It highlights the biblical principle of leaving vengeance to God (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p><b>went out of the cave</b><br>The cave is significant as a place of refuge and testing. En Gedi, where this event occurs, is a rugged area with many caves, providing a strategic hiding place. This setting underscores the theme of God providing protection and refuge, as seen in Psalms attributed to David, such as <a href="/psalms/57.htm">Psalm 57</a>, which is believed to be written during this period.<p><b>and called out to Saul</b><br>David's decision to reveal himself to Saul demonstrates his courage and faith. By calling out, David seeks reconciliation and demonstrates his innocence. This act of confronting Saul directly is reminiscent of Jesus' teaching on reconciliation in <a href="/matthew/5-23.htm">Matthew 5:23-24</a>.<p><b>&#8220;My lord the king!&#8221;</b><br>David's respectful address to Saul acknowledges Saul's current position as king, despite Saul's unjust actions. This respect for authority aligns with biblical teachings on honoring leaders (<a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a>) and reflects David's understanding of God's sovereignty in appointing leaders.<p><b>When Saul looked behind him</b><br>Saul's turning to look signifies a moment of realization and vulnerability. It is a pivotal moment where Saul is confronted with David's loyalty and integrity. This turning can be seen as a metaphor for repentance, a theme prevalent throughout scripture.<p><b>David bowed facedown in reverence</b><br>David's act of bowing shows humility and respect, not just for Saul as king, but for God's anointed. This gesture is a physical representation of David's heart posture, aligning with the biblical principle of humility before God and others (<a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-4</a>).

David chooses to act on what he knows is right instead of remaining hidden. Scripture often links decisive obedience to God&#8217;s will with a clear &#8220;after&#8221; moment&#8212;think of Noah stepping off the ark (<a href="/genesis/8-18.htm">Genesis 8:18</a>) or Jesus &#8220;after fasting&#8221; beginning His public ministry (<a href="/matthew/4-11.htm">Matthew 4:11-17</a>). Here, David&#8217;s timing is Spirit-led rather than self-protective, underscoring <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, where trusting the LORD directs paths.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>David got up</b><p>Rising signals resolve. David literally stands on convictions already formed in the cave: he will not take the kingdom by violence but will trust God&#8217;s promise (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>; 24:6). The motion echoes <a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>, &#8220;Whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin&#8221;. Getting up transforms inward conviction into outward testimony.<p>&#8226; Courage here is faith-based, not adrenaline-based (<a href="/psalms/27-1.htm">Psalm 27:1</a>).<p>&#8226; It counters Saul&#8217;s repeated &#8220;get up and pursue David&#8221; orders (<a href="/1_samuel/23-8.htm">1 Samuel 23:8</a>), showing that true initiative belongs to the righteous.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>went out of the cave</b><p>Stepping from darkness into daylight dramatizes integrity. <a href="/john/3-21.htm">John 3:21</a> says, &#8220;Whoever practices the truth comes into the light&#8221;. David has nothing to hide; he emerges so his motives are visible to Saul, his men, and&#8212;ultimately&#8212;the nation. Elijah&#8217;s similar exit from a cave to meet God and confront kings (<a href="/1_kings/19-13.htm">1 Kings 19:13-15</a>) underlines that caves are places of preparation, not permanent residence, for God&#8217;s servants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and called out to Saul, &#8220;My lord the king!&#8221;</b><p>David&#8217;s first words affirm Saul&#8217;s God-given office. <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a> commands submission to governing authorities, and <a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm">1 Peter 2:17</a> adds, &#8220;Honor the king&#8221;. By addressing Saul with royal honor, David models respect for position even when the person misuses it. This respectful appeal:<p>&#8226; Diffuses suspicion (<a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>, &#8220;A gentle answer turns away wrath,&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Reminds Saul and the watching soldiers of covenant order&#8212;kingship is God&#8217;s gift, not man&#8217;s spoil.<p>&#8226; Mirrors Jesus&#8217; &#8220;Friend&#8221; address to Judas (<a href="/matthew/26-50.htm">Matthew 26:50</a>), extending dignity amid betrayal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When Saul looked behind him</b><p>The literal turn pictures an opportunity for spiritual turnaround. Similar pivotal glances appear when Moses &#8220;turned aside&#8221; to the burning bush (<a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>) and when the Lord &#8220;turned and looked at Peter&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-61.htm">Luke 22:61</a>); in each case, a look invites repentance. Saul&#8217;s backward look exposes how close David had been, validating David&#8217;s words that follow (<a href="/1_samuel/24-11.htm">1 Samuel 24:11</a>). It also foreshadows Saul&#8217;s failure to keep his gaze forward on God&#8217;s plan, contrasting <a href="/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13</a>&#8217;s call to &#8220;forget what is behind.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>David bowed facedown in reverence</b><p>The bow combines humility before God and deference to Saul&#8217;s office.

Rising from the cave, stepping into the light, honoring authority, inviting repentance, and bowing in humility all reveal a heart anchored in trust that God alone establishes and removes kings (<a href="/daniel/2-21.htm">Daniel 2:21</a>). The verse teaches believers to couple conviction with courtesy, courage with restraint, and faith with visible integrity, certain that the LORD who sees every cave also vindicates those who surrender their cause to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">And cried after Saul.</span>--The outlaw suffered the king and his companion to proceed some little way--possibly down the deep ascent which led up to the cave's mouth--and then called after Saul, but with an address of the deepest reverence, accompanied too (see next clause) with an act of the profoundest homage which an inferior could pay to a superior. He would show Saul at least he was no rival king.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - Saul apparently had withdrawn from his men, and David seizes the opportunity of proving to him his innocence, and quieting the king's fears.

He also pays him the utmost reverence, bowing his face to the earth and making obeisance.
