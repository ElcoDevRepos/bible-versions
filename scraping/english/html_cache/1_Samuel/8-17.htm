In the ancient Near Eastern context, a tenth, or tithe, was a common form of taxation, often used to support the king's court and military. This mirrors the tithe that Israelites were already familiar with, as they were commanded to give a tenth of their produce to support the Levites and the temple (<a href="/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30-32</a>). The demand for a tenth of the flocks signifies the king's authority over the people's resources, contrasting with the theocratic system where God was the direct ruler. This imposition foreshadows the burdensome rule of future kings, such as Solomon, who heavily taxed and conscripted labor from the Israelites (<a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>).<p><b>and you yourselves will become his slaves</b><br>This phrase warns of the loss of freedom and autonomy under a monarchical system. Historically, kings in the ancient world often conscripted their subjects for labor, military service, or other duties, effectively reducing them to servitude. This warning is prophetic, as seen in the reign of Solomon, where the people were subjected to forced labor (<a href="/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13-14</a>). Theologically, this serves as a caution against rejecting God's direct rule in favor of human leadership, which can lead to oppression and loss of liberty. This also reflects the broader biblical theme of slavery to sin versus freedom in God, as seen in the New Testament (<a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16-18</a>). The Israelites' desire for a king, despite this warning, illustrates the human tendency to seek security in earthly systems rather than in divine provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel, a prophet who anointed the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David.

The repetition intensifies the certainty of royal expropriation.<p>&#8226; Israel is trading the direct rule of the LORD (<a href="/judges/8-23.htm">Judges 8:23</a>) for a human ruler like the surrounding nations (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>).

Here the king appropriates a portion comparable to the tithe, signaling that he will compete with God for the people&#8217;s resources.<p>&#8226; Earlier in the warning, the king also claims &#8220;a tenth of your grain and vintage&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/8-15.htm">1 Samuel 8:15</a>). This steady taxation foreshadows Solomon&#8217;s heavy levies that later provoke rebellion (<a href="/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail is literal: monarchs in the Ancient Near East commonly imposed a 10% tax.

Losing even a portion threatens family stability.<p>&#8226; By specifying flocks, the text underscores that the king&#8217;s reach extends into everyday subsistence, not just luxury goods (<a href="/amos/7-15.htm">Amos 7:15</a>).<p>&#8226; David himself later confirms this reality when he drafts shepherds like Doeg the Edomite (<a href="/1_samuel/21-7.htm">1 Samuel 21:7</a>) into royal service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you yourselves will become his slaves</b><p>&#8226; The warning moves from property to personal freedom.

How bitterly the nation, even in the successful and glorious reign of King Solomon, felt the pressure of the royal yoke, so truly foretold by their last judge, is shown in the history of the times which followed the death of Solomon, when the public discontent at the brilliant but despotic rule of the great king led to the revolution which split up the people into two nations.
