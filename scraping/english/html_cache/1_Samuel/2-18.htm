This highlights the early dedication of Samuel to God's service, a result of his mother Hannah's vow. The phrase "ministering before the LORD" indicates that Samuel's service was not just to Eli, the high priest, but directly to God. This sets a precedent for the importance of serving God from a young age and foreshadows Samuel's future role as a prophet and judge over Israel. His service contrasts with the corrupt practices of Eli's sons, Hophni and Phinehas, emphasizing the purity and dedication required in true worship.<p><b>a boy wearing a linen ephod</b><br>The linen ephod was a priestly garment, typically worn by those serving in the tabernacle. Although Samuel was not from the priestly line of Aaron, his wearing of the ephod signifies his special role and dedication to God. This garment symbolizes purity and service, and its mention here underscores Samuel's unique position and foreshadows his future leadership. The ephod also connects to the priestly garments described in Exodus, highlighting the continuity of worship practices. Samuel's wearing of the ephod can be seen as a type of Christ, who is both priest and prophet, serving God with purity and dedication.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A young boy dedicated to the Lord by his mother, Hannah, serving in the tabernacle under the priest Eli.

Service done before people can waver, but service done before the Lord is steady (<a href="/colossians/3-23.htm">Colossians 3:23-24</a>).<p>&#8226; The context heightens the contrast: while Eli&#8217;s corrupt sons were abusing their priestly office (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>), young Samuel was faithfully serving. God always preserves a remnant who honor Him (<a href="/romans/11-4.htm">Romans 11:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Samuel&#8217;s ministry fulfills his mother&#8217;s vow (<a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>) and foreshadows the prophet he will become, much like Moses who &#8220;served continually&#8221; in the tent of meeting (<a href="/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a boy</b><p>&#8226; God delights to use children.

Just as Josiah began seeking the Lord at eight (<a href="/2_kings/22-1.htm">2 Kings 22:1-2</a>), Samuel shows that tender hearts often respond quickest.<p>&#8226; Jesus later pointed to childlike trust as the model for kingdom greatness (<a href="/matthew/18-2.htm">Matthew 18:2-4</a>). Samuel embodies that trust long before the concept was verbalized.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>wearing a linen ephod</b><p>&#8226; The ephod was priestly attire (<a href="/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4</a>), normally reserved for Aaron&#8217;s descendants.

This ephod was an official garment, and consisted of two pieces, which rested on the shoulders in front and behind, and were joined at the top, and fastened about the body with a girdle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But Samuel ministered.</span> While the misconduct of Eli's sons was thus bringing religion into contempt, and sapping the nation's morals, Samuel was advancing in years and piety, and was gaining that education which made him fit to retrieve the evil of their doings.

In the sense of servant there is no limit of age; and as it is the word translated "young men" in ver. 17, it probably means there not Eli's sons, but the servants by whose instrumentality their orders were actually carried out. Samuel's dress, an ephod of white linen, was probably that worn by the Levites in their ordinary ministrations; for the ephod of the priests was richer both in material and colour (<a href="/exodus/28-6.htm">Exodus 28:6-8</a>). As being thus the simplest ministerial garment, it was apparently worn also by laymen when taking part in any religious service, as by David when he danced before the ark (<a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/2-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Samuel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1461;&#1429;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Noun -
