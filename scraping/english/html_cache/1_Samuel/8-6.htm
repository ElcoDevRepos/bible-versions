This request reflects their desire to be like other nations (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5, 20</a>), which was contrary to God's unique plan for Israel as a distinct people (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The demand for a king can be seen as a rejection of God's leadership, as He had been their judge and king through appointed leaders like Moses, Joshua, and the judges. This request also foreshadows the eventual establishment of the Davidic line, which is significant in biblical prophecy concerning the Messiah (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>their demand was displeasing in the sight of Samuel;</b><br>Samuel, as the last judge of Israel, was displeased because the request for a king represented a rejection of the system God had established. Samuel had faithfully served as a prophet and judge, and the people's demand implied dissatisfaction with his leadership and, by extension, with God's governance. This displeasure is rooted in the understanding that Israel's identity was to be distinct from other nations, relying on divine guidance rather than human monarchy. Samuel's reaction highlights the tension between human desires and divine will, a recurring theme in Scripture.<p><b>so he prayed to the LORD.</b><br>Samuel's response to the people's demand was to seek God's guidance through prayer, demonstrating his role as a mediator between God and Israel. This act of prayer underscores the importance of seeking divine wisdom in times of crisis or decision-making. Samuel's prayer reflects a pattern seen throughout the Bible, where leaders and prophets turn to God for direction (e.g., Moses in <a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>, Nehemiah in <a href="/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4-11</a>). It also emphasizes the importance of maintaining a relationship with God, even when faced with challenging or disappointing circumstances. Samuel's reliance on prayer serves as a model for believers to seek God's will above human inclinations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel was a pivotal figure in the transition from the period of judges to the establishment of the monarchy.

The verse invites believers to discern motives, grieve sin righteously, and seek God&#8217;s guidance before acting, confident that He hears and answers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">The thing displeased Samuel.</span>--It is clear that it was perfectly justifiable in the elders of the people to come to the resolution contained in their petition to Samuel. The Deuteronomy directions contained in <a href="/context/1_samuel/17-14.htm" title="And David was the youngest: and the three oldest followed Saul.">1Samuel 17:14-20</a> are clear and explicit in this matter of an earthly king for the people, and Moses evidently had looked forward to this alteration in the constitution when he framed the Law. No date for the change is specified, but from the terms of the Deuteronomy words no distant period evidently was looked on to. Then, again, though Samuel was naturally displeased, he at once, as prophet and seer, carried the matter to the God-Friend of Israel in prayer, and the Eternal King at once bids His old true servant to comply with the people's desire.<p>The displeasure of the prophet-judge was very natural. He felt--this we see from the comforting words his Master addressed to him (see <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm" title="And the LORD said to Samuel, Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you: for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.">1Samuel 8:7</a>)--that the people, notwithstanding the vast claims he possessed to their gratitude, craved another and a different ruler, and were dissatisfied with his government. Samuel too was conscious that Israel by its request declined the direct sovereignty of the Eternal. The change to an earthly sovereign had been foreseen, foretold, even arranged for, by Moses, but, in spite of all this, to one like Samuel it was very bitter. It seemed to remove the people from that solitary platform which they alone among nations had been allowed to occupy. They had found by sad experience, as Moses,--"their Rabbi," as the old teachers loved to style him--had predicted, that such a form of government was, alas! unsuited to them, and that they must descend <span class= "ital">here </span>to the level of ordinary peoples. But though all this was undisputably true, it was very bitter for the hero patriot to give up for ever the splendid Hebrew ideal that his people were the subjects of the Eternal King, ruled directly by Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But the thing displeased Samuel, and justly so.</span> For, in the first place, they had determined to have a king without consulting the will of God. Granting that it would give them the security necessary for the nation's welfare and progress, yet so weighty a matter ought not to have been decided without an appeal to Jehovah. Samuel did make it a matter of prayer; the elders were actuated solely by political motives. And, secondly, they undervalued their own religious privileges. They wanted a king such as the heathen had, whereas something far better and higher was possible for them, namely, a king who would be the representative of Jehovah, as the shophet had hitherto been. The nation's real need was not a new power, but the permanent organisation of what up to this time had been a casual authority. And it was Samuel's high office to give the nation this, while he also changed the outward form of prophecy, and made it too into an orderly institution. <span class="cmt_word">A king to judge us.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> to govern us, as the shophet or, judge had done, only in a more regularly constituted manner. <span class="cmt_word">And Samuel prayed unto Jehovah.</span> There had been no such submission to the will of God on the part of the elders; but deeply as Samuel must have been hurt by this determination of the nation to take the government out of the hands of himself and his sons, yet he leaves the decision to Jehovah. Moreover, we must note that it was as prophet that he thus acted as mediator between the people and God; and he gave them his services in this his highest capacity as faithfully when the question was one injurious to himself as he had ever done on more pleasing occasions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/8-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But when</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ka&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
