Judges in Israel were divinely appointed leaders who delivered the Israelites from oppression and led them in faithfulness to God. Samuel's role as a judge was unique because he also functioned as a prophet and priest, bridging the period between the judges and the monarchy. His leadership was marked by a return to the worship of Yahweh and a rejection of idolatry, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3-4</a>, where he calls Israel to put away foreign gods.<p><b>all the days of his life.</b><br>Samuel's lifelong commitment to judging Israel highlights his dedication and faithfulness to God's calling. Unlike other judges who served for limited periods, Samuel's influence extended throughout his life, indicating stability and continuity in leadership. His tenure as judge was significant in preparing Israel for the transition to monarchy, as he anointed both Saul and David as kings. Samuel's life and ministry foreshadow the eternal priesthood and kingship of Jesus Christ, who judges and leads His people with righteousness forever, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/7-24.htm">Hebrews 7:24-25</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet, priest, and judge of Israel, Samuel was dedicated to God by his mother, Hannah, and served under Eli the priest.

For a very long period--probably for at least twenty years after the decisive battle of Eben-ezer--Samuel, as "judge," exercised the chief authority in Israel. The time at length arrived when, convinced by clear Divine monition that it was best for the people that a king should rule over them, Samuel the seer, then advanced in years, voluntarily laid down his high office in favour of the new king, Saul; but his influence remained, and his authority, whenever he chose to exercise it, seems to have continued undiminished, and on momentous occasions (see, for instance, <a href="/1_samuel/15-33.htm" title="And Samuel said, As the sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.">1Samuel 15:33</a>) we find king and nation submitting to his counsel and expressed will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15, 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.</span> As long as Samuel lived there was no clear]imitation of his powers as shophet compared with those of Saul as king. In putting Agag to death (<a href="/1_samuel/15-33.htm">1 Samuel 15:33</a>) he even claimed a higher authority, and though he voluntarily left as a rule all civil and military matters to the king, yet he never actually resigned the supreme control, and on fitting occasions even exercised it. It was, however, practically within narrow limits that he personally exercised his functions as judge in settling the causes of the people; for <span class="cmt_word">Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh</span> were all situated in the tribe of Benjamin. Both Bethel and Mizpah were holy spots, and so also, probably, was Gilgal; and therefore we may conclude that it was the famous sanctuary of that name (see <a href="/1_samuel/11-14.htm">1 Samuel 11:14</a>), and not the Gilgal mentioned, in <a href="/2_kings/2-1.htm">2 Kings 2:1</a>; <a href="/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>. For this latter, situated to the southwest of Shiloh, near the road to Jerusalem, had no religious importance, and would not, therefore, attract so many people to it as one that was frequented for sacrifice. Probably, too, it was upon the occasion of religious solemnities that Samuel visited these places, and heard the people's suits. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/7-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So Samuel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8050.htm">Strong's 8050: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samuel -- 'name of God', a prophet of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">judged</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1496;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#353;&#183;p&#333;&#7789;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
