It was one of the cities designated for the priests, which is significant given the context of the Ark of the Covenant's return. The name "Joshua" here is not the famous leader who succeeded Moses, but likely a common name of the time. The arrival of the cart signifies the end of the Philistines' possession of the Ark, which they had captured in battle. This event fulfills the Philistines' plan to test whether the plagues they experienced were indeed from the God of Israel. The Ark's return to a Levitical city underscores the importance of proper worship and reverence for God's presence.<p><b>and stopped there near a large rock</b><br>The large rock served as a natural altar or platform, which was significant for the subsequent offering. In ancient times, rocks and altars were often used for sacrifices and offerings, symbolizing stability and permanence. The stopping of the cart at this specific location can be seen as divinely orchestrated, indicating God's control over the situation. This rock would later serve as a memorial of God's intervention and the return of the Ark.<p><b>The people chopped up the cart</b><br>The dismantling of the cart for use as firewood for the offering demonstrates the people's immediate response to honor God. It reflects the principle of using available resources to worship God, showing their gratitude and reverence. This act also signifies the end of the cart's purpose, as it was merely a vehicle for the Ark's return and not sacred in itself.<p><b>and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD</b><br>Offering the cows as a burnt offering was a significant act of worship and atonement. Burnt offerings were entirely consumed by fire, symbolizing complete dedication to God. The use of cows, which were unblemished and had never been yoked, aligns with the requirements for sacrificial animals in the Mosaic Law. This act of sacrifice highlights the people's recognition of God's holiness and their desire to atone for any offenses related to the Ark's capture and return. It also prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself wholly for the atonement of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua_of_beth-shemesh.htm">Joshua of Beth-shemesh</a></b><br>A resident of Beth-shemesh, a Levitical city in the territory of Judah.

After the Philistines placed the Ark on a new cart and hitched two nursing cows to it, &#8220;the cows went straight up the road to Beth-shemesh&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/6-12.htm">1 Samuel 6:12</a>). No driver guided them; the Lord Himself directed their steps to a Levitical town (<a href="/joshua/21-16.htm">Joshua 21:16</a>) where priests lived who could handle the Ark properly.<p>&#8226; The field belongs to Joshua, a common name, but its mention roots the account in real geography and real ownership, reinforcing Scripture&#8217;s historical reliability.<p>&#8226; The arrival scene mirrors earlier moments when God led the Ark to the exact place He chose (e.g., <a href="/joshua/3-13.htm">Joshua 3:13-17</a>). His presence is never random; He lands right where His people can recognize and respond to Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and stopped there near a large rock</b><p>&#8226; The journey ends &#8220;beside a large stone.&#8221; The narrative slows down, spotlighting the rock as a divinely prepared altar-platform (<a href="/1_samuel/6-15.htm">1 Samuel 6:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Stones often mark moments of covenant and remembrance&#8212;think of Jacob&#8217;s pillar at Bethel (<a href="/genesis/28-18.htm">Genesis 28:18</a>) or Samuel&#8217;s future Ebenezer stone (<a href="/1_samuel/7-12.htm">1 Samuel 7:12</a>). Here, the rock becomes both table and testimony: a visible reminder that the Holy God has returned to Israel.<p>&#8226; The stop itself underscores obedience. The cows refuse to turn aside despite lowing for their calves (<a href="/1_samuel/6-12.htm">1 Samuel 6:12</a>); once God&#8217;s mission is complete, they halt. Creation bows to its Creator&#8217;s timetable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The people chopped up the cart</b><p>&#8226; As soon as the Ark arrives, the men of Beth-shemesh dismantle the very vehicle that carried it. Nothing is too ordinary to be transformed into worship.<p>&#8226; Using the cart&#8217;s wood for fuel echoes Gideon tearing down his father&#8217;s altar and using the wood &#8220;of the Asherah pole&#8221; for a sacrifice to the Lord (<a href="/judges/6-26.htm">Judges 6:26</a>). David will later accept Araunah&#8217;s ox yokes and threshing sledges for the same purpose (<a href="/2_samuel/24-22.htm">2 Samuel 24:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The immediate act teaches a valuable pattern: when God delivers, His people respond without delay, offering up whatever resources are at hand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Burnt offerings symbolized total dedication; the entire animal was consumed on the altar (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>). By giving the very cows that pulled the cart, Israel declares, &#8220;Everything about this return is Yours, Lord.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The offering also answers the guilt offering the Philistines had just made (<a href="/1_samuel/6-3.htm">1 Samuel 6:3-5</a>). Where the pagans tried to appease God, Israel now worships Him in covenant grace.<p>&#8226; This sacrificial moment foreshadows Samuel&#8217;s later burnt lamb at Mizpah, when &#8220;the LORD answered him&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9</a>). Genuine surrender invites divine favor.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Verse 14 records more than a historical waypoint; it pictures a cascade of worship. God guides the Ark to a priestly field, halts it at a ready-made stone, inspires His people to surrender the cart&#8217;s wood, and receives the cows in a whole-burnt offering. Each detail highlights His control, Israel&#8217;s grateful obedience, and the truth that every circumstance can become an altar when the Lord is at the center.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">The field of Joshua, a Beth-shemite.</span>--The great stone--most likely a mass of natural rock rising from the soil--was the occasion of the cart being stopped there, Beth-shemesh and its suburbs being a city of the priests (<a href="/joshua/21-16.htm" title="And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and Bethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two tribes.">Joshua 21:16</a>). The presence of Levites, among whom were doubtless priests, is natural. These were, of course, the principal men of the city and its suburbs, and they were familiar with all sacrificial rites prescribed by the Law. The offering of these sacrifices at Beth-shemesh, although the Tabernacle never had been stationed there, was no transgression against the law, for now the Ark of the Covenant was present, the occasional throne of the glory-presence of the Eternal, before which the sacrifices were really offered.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Stood there, where there was a great stone.</span> Probably a mass of natural rock rising through the soil.
