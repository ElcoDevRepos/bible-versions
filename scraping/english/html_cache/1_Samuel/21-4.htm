The priest, Ahimelech, informs David that there is no ordinary bread available. This highlights the scarcity of resources and the urgency of David's situation. The absence of common bread emphasizes the sacredness of the location and the items within it, as the tabernacle was a place of worship and sacrifice.<p><b>&#8220;the priest replied,&#8221;</b><br>Ahimelech, the priest, serves as a mediator between God and the people, and his role is crucial in maintaining the sanctity of the tabernacle. His response to David reflects the tension between adhering to religious law and addressing human need. Priests were responsible for the care and distribution of the sacred items, including the showbread, which was typically reserved for the priests alone.<p><b>&#8220;but there is some consecrated bread&#8212;&#8221;</b><br>The consecrated bread refers to the showbread, also known as the "bread of the Presence," which was placed on a table in the Holy Place of the tabernacle. According to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>), this bread was to be set before the Lord continually and replaced every Sabbath. The old bread was then consumed by the priests. The mention of consecrated bread underscores the holiness of the items within the tabernacle and the strict regulations governing their use.<p><b>&#8220;provided that the young men have kept themselves from women.&#8221;</b><br>This condition reflects the requirement for ritual purity, especially when handling or consuming sacred items. Abstaining from sexual relations was a common practice for maintaining ceremonial cleanliness (<a href="/exodus/19-15.htm">Exodus 19:15</a>). This stipulation indicates the importance of purity in approaching holy things and aligns with the broader biblical theme of holiness and separation from sin.

The incident illustrates God&#8217;s faithful provision for His anointed, underscores the call to holiness, and foreshadows Christ&#8217;s teaching that mercy fulfils the law.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">There is no common bread.</span>--The condition of the priests in these days of Saul was evidently a pitiable one. The terrible massacre related in the next chapter seems not to have excited the wail of indignation and woe which such a wholesale murder of the priests of the living God should naturally have called out from the entire people. They were evidently held in little esteem, and their murder was regarded at the time, not as an awful act of sacrilege, but simply as an act of political vengeance--of punishment for what the king was pleased to style treason. Here the almost destitute condition of the ministers of the principal sanctuary of Israel appears from the quiet answer of the high priest to David, telling him they had positively no bread but the stale bread removed from before "the Presence" in the holy building.<p>This "hallowed bread," or shewbread, five loaves of which David petitioned for, consisted of twelve loaves, one for each tribe, which were placed in the Tabernacle fresh every Sabbath Day. The law of Moses was that this bread, being most holy, could only be eaten by the priests in the holy place. It is probable that this regulation had been relaxed, and that the bread was now often being carried away and eaten in the homes of the ministering priests, and on urgent occasions, perhaps, was even given to the "laity," as in this case, the proviso only being made that the consumers of the bread should be ceremonially pure. Our Saviour, in <a href="/matthew/12-3.htm" title="But he said to them, Have you not read what David did, when he was an hungered, and they that were with him;">Matthew 12:3</a>, especially uses this example, drawn from the Tabernacle's honoured customs, to justify a violation of the letter of the law, when its strict observance would stand in the way of the fulfilment of man's sacred duty to his neighbour.<p>The natural inference from this incident would be that such a violation of the Mosaic Law was not an uncommon occurrence, as Ahimelech at once gave him the hallowed bread, only making a conditional inquiry about ceremonial purity--a condition which came out so readily that we feel it had often been made before. The Talmud, however, is most anxious that this inference should not be drawn, and points out in the treatise <span class= "ital">Menachoth, </span>"Meat-offerings" (<span class= "ital">Seder Kodashim</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>that this bread was not newly taken out of the sanctuary, but had been removed on some previous day, and that as, after a week's exposure, it was stale and dry, the priests ate but little of it, and the rest was left. (See Treatise <span class= "ital">Yoma, </span>39.) It also points out that had such violation of the Levitical Law been common, so much importance would not have been attached to this incident.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/21-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;[There is] no</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1469;&#1497;&#1503;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;n-)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_369.htm">Strong's 369: </a> </span><span class="str2">A non-entity, a negative particle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">common</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1465;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2455.htm">Strong's 2455: </a> </span><span class="str2">Profaneness, commonness</span><br /><br /><span class="word">bread</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1462;&#1445;&#1495;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(le&#183;&#7717;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3899.htm">Strong's 3899: </a> </span><span class="str2">Food, bread, grain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1495;&#1463;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(ta&#183;&#7717;a&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8478.htm">Strong's 8478: </a> </span><span class="str2">The bottom, below, in lieu of</span><br /><br /><span class="word">hand,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
