His age suggests a lifetime of service, yet it also underscores the decline in his physical and spiritual faculties. In the context of ancient Israel, reaching such an age was notable, as life expectancy was generally lower. Eli's age also serves as a backdrop to the transition of leadership to Samuel, who represents a new era for Israel. The number ninety-eight, while not symbolically significant in itself, emphasizes the completion of Eli's life and the impending judgment on his house as prophesied in <a href="/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31-36</a>.<p><b>and his gaze was fixed because he could not see</b><br>Eli's blindness is both literal and metaphorical. Physically, his inability to see reflects the natural decline associated with old age. However, it also symbolizes his spiritual blindness and the failure to perceive the moral and spiritual decay within his own family and the nation. This blindness is a recurring theme in Scripture, often representing a lack of spiritual insight or understanding (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>, <a href="/matthew/15-14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>). Eli's condition contrasts with the spiritual vision of Samuel, who is called to be a prophet and seer for Israel. The fixed gaze may also imply a sense of resignation or helplessness, as Eli is unable to change the course of events that are unfolding, particularly the impending disaster of the Ark's capture and the death of his sons, as foretold in <a href="/1_samuel/3-11.htm">1 Samuel 3:11-14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli.htm">Eli</a></b><br>The high priest of Israel at the time, Eli was a judge and spiritual leader.

A dimmed lamp points to dulled discernment.<p>&#8226; Physical frailty does not diminish responsibility. <a href="/proverbs/20-29.htm">Proverbs 20:29</a> contrasts youthful strength with the &#8220;splendor of old men&#8221;&#8212;gray hair gained by righteous living. Eli&#8217;s fixed gaze hints that the splendor of righteous oversight had faded.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because he could not see</b><p>&#8226; The author clarifies the cause: blindness, not mere distraction. In <a href="/1_samuel/3-2.htm">1 Samuel 3:2</a> Eli&#8217;s eyes were already &#8220;growing dim.&#8221; This final note signals complete blindness.<p>&#8226; Blindness is never random in the narrative; it often accompanies spiritual darkness (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/5-21.htm">Jeremiah 5:21</a>; <a href="/matthew/15-14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>). Eli, once priest and judge, can no longer perceive either physically or spiritually.<p>&#8226; Yet even in blindness God can work: Isaac, Jacob, and Samson all encountered God&#8217;s purposes amid failing sight (<a href="/genesis/48-10.htm">Genesis 48:10</a>; <a href="/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21-22</a>). The verse reminds us that God&#8217;s plans proceed despite human weakness.<p>&#8226; Application: aging saints may lose physical faculties, but spiritual alertness can remain sharp if cultivated (<a href="/psalms/92-12.htm">Psalm 92:12-15</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/4-16.htm">2 Corinthians 4:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>1 Sam 4:15 records literal, historical details that also carry spiritual weight. At ninety-eight, Eli&#8217;s fixed, sightless gaze reveals both his physical decline and the culmination of neglected spiritual oversight. The verse prepares readers for the impending judgment while reminding us that physical age and limitation never excuse spiritual complacency.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Ninety and eight years old.</span>--The LXX. here reads "ninety" years, the Syriac Version "seventy eight." In the sacred text, where numbers are concerned we usually find these varieties of translation and interpretation. The present system of numerals was invented by the Arabs. The Hebrews use the letters of the alphabet to express numbers. Such a system was naturally fruitful in errors of transcription, and thus numbers, and dates especially, in the earlier books of the Old Testament are frequently confused and uncertain. Many of the difficulties which have given so much trouble to commentators have arisen out of the confusion of copyists substituting, through inadvertence, in Hebrew one letter for another. Instead of "his eyes were dim," the more accurate rendering would be <span class= "ital">his eyes were set</span>--were stiff, so that he could no longer see. This, as Keil observes, is a description of the so-called black cataract (amaurosis), which not unfrequently occurs at a very great age from paralysis of the optic nerves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Eli was ninety and eight years old.</span> Until the invention by the Arabs of the present system of numerals, all ancient nations had a most cumbrous system of expressing numbers. The Hebrew method was to attach a value to each of the letters of the alphabet, and then add them together, and thus the eighth and nineteenth letters would between them make up ninety-eight. Such a system led to constant mistakes in copying, and thus the numerals in the earlier parts of the Old Testament are beset with uncertainty. Here the Septuagint has <span class="accented">ninety</span>, and the Syriac <span class="accented">seventy-eight.</span> But as Eli was described already as "very old" in <a href="/1_samuel/2-22.htm">1 Samuel 2:22</a>, the Hebrew text is the most probable. Instead of <span class="cmt_word">dim</span> the Hebrew has <span class="accented">set, i.e.</span> Eli was now absolutely blind, as the word expresses the motionless state of the eye when obscured by cataract. In <a href="/1_samuel/3-2.htm">1 Samuel 3:2</a> a different word is used, rightly there translated "dim," as the disease is one which comes on gradually. In <a href="/1_kings/14-4.htm">1 Kings 14:4</a> we read that Ahijah was blind from the same cause, and the word is there correctly rendered "set." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/4-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Eli</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1500;&#1460;&#1429;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;&#234;&#183;l&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
