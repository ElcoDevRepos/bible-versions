This highlights the importance of vigilance and responsibility, especially for those in positions of authority. The phrase underscores the moral and ethical standards expected of leaders, reflecting the biblical principle that negligence in duty is a serious offense.<p><b>As surely as the LORD lives,</b><br>This oath emphasizes the certainty and seriousness of David's statement. Invoking the name of the LORD underscores the gravity of the situation and the truthfulness of David's words. It reflects the common practice in ancient Israel of swearing by God's name to affirm the truth, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/ruth/3-13.htm">Ruth 3:13</a> and <a href="/1_samuel/14-39.htm">1 Samuel 14:39</a>.<p><b>all of you deserve to die,</b><br>David declares that Abner and his men are worthy of death for their failure to protect Saul. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern understanding of the sacred duty to protect the king, who was considered God's anointed. The severity of the punishment underscores the seriousness of their negligence.<p><b>since you did not protect your lord, the LORD&#8217;s anointed.</b><br>The term "the LORD&#8217;s anointed" refers to Saul's divine appointment as king. This phrase highlights the sanctity of Saul's position, despite his personal failings. It also reflects the biblical theme of respecting God's chosen leaders, as seen in David's refusal to harm Saul in <a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>.<p><b>Now look around.</b><br>David challenges Abner to assess the situation, emphasizing the tangible evidence of their failure. This call to awareness is a common biblical motif, urging individuals to recognize their shortcomings and the reality of their circumstances.<p><b>Where are the king&#8217;s spear and water jug that were by his head?&#8221;</b><br>The missing spear and water jug serve as evidence of David's presence and his ability to harm Saul, yet choosing not to. The spear, a symbol of Saul's authority and military power, and the water jug, a symbol of life and sustenance, highlight the vulnerability of Saul and the mercy of David.

Where are the king&#8217;s spear and water jug that were by his head?</b><p>David offers physical evidence to prove both his innocence and their failure.<p>&#8226; Earlier that night, Abishai urged David to kill Saul with the very spear now missing (<a href="/1_samuel/26-8.htm">1 Samuel 26:8&#8211;11</a>).<p>&#8226; By sparing Saul yet seizing the spear and jug, David demonstrates righteousness without revenge (<a href="/proverbs/20-22.htm">Proverbs 20:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene foreshadows Christ&#8217;s call to overcome evil with good (<a href="/romans/12-21.htm">Romans 12:21</a>), showing mercy while exposing wrongdoing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/26-16.htm">1 Samuel 26:16</a> showcases David&#8217;s reverence for God&#8217;s authority, his commitment to righteousness, and the gravity of failing one&#8217;s duty. Abner&#8217;s lapse endangered the LORD&#8217;s anointed, meriting death under covenant standards. David&#8217;s oath, rebuke, and tangible proof combine to affirm that God&#8217;s standards are unchanging, that protecting ordained authority matters deeply, and that mercy can coexist with firm accountability.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/26-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1494;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(haz&#183;zeh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
