Saul, as the first king of Israel, relied on his servants for information and communication. This phrase highlights the role of servants in the royal court, who were privy to sensitive information and played a crucial role in the administration. The mention of Saul here is significant, as it sets the stage for the unfolding tension between him and David, a central theme in the narrative of 1 Samuel.<p><b>what David had said.</b><br>David's words, though not directly quoted in this verse, are pivotal in understanding the dynamics between him and Saul. At this point in the narrative, David is gaining favor and recognition, which stirs Saul's jealousy and fear. David's humility and wisdom in his speech often contrast with Saul's insecurity and paranoia. This interaction foreshadows the growing conflict between Saul and David, which is a recurring theme throughout the books of Samuel. David's character and actions are often seen as a type of Christ, exemplifying humility, faithfulness, and reliance on God, which are qualities that stand in stark contrast to Saul's disobedience and self-reliance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd who was anointed by Samuel to be the future king of Israel.
