The terms mentioned earlier in the chapter involve Saul's offer of his daughter Michal in marriage to David, with the condition of bringing back a dowry of one hundred Philistine foreskins. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern custom of bride price, which was a common practice. Saul's intention was to put David in harm's way, hoping the Philistines would kill him. This highlights Saul's growing jealousy and fear of David, who was gaining popularity and success.<p><b>he was pleased to become the king&#8217;s son-in-law</b><br>David's pleasure in becoming the king's son-in-law indicates his acceptance of the honor and the opportunity it presented. This marriage would elevate David's status and integrate him into the royal family, aligning with God's plan for David's future kingship. It also shows David's confidence in God's protection and his willingness to face the challenge posed by Saul's condition. This moment foreshadows David's eventual rise to power and the fulfillment of God's promise to him.<p><b>Before the wedding day arrived</b><br>This phrase sets the stage for the events that follow, emphasizing the urgency and immediacy of David's actions. In the cultural context, weddings were significant social events, often involving extended celebrations. The mention of the wedding day underscores the importance of the alliance between David and Saul's family. It also highlights the tension and anticipation surrounding David's mission to fulfill Saul's dangerous requirement, which he accomplishes with God's favor, further solidifying his reputation as a capable and divinely supported leader.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd who was anointed by Samuel to be the future king of Israel.

The nature also of the dowry fell in with his adventurous and war-loving disposition. <span class="cmt_word">The days were not expired.</span> Wherefore, etc. A difficulty arises here from the wrong division of the verses, and from our translators having rendered the clauses as if they were independent of each other.
