This phrase highlights the ongoing conflict between Saul and David, a central theme in 1 Samuel. Saul's pursuit of David is relentless, reflecting the spiritual decline of Saul and his disobedience to God. David's awareness of Saul's intentions demonstrates his vigilance and reliance on God for protection. This situation is reminiscent of the broader biblical theme of the righteous being pursued by the wicked, as seen in Psalms and other scriptures.<p><b>he said to Abiathar the priest</b><br>Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, is the sole survivor of Saul's massacre of the priests at Nob. His presence with David signifies the transfer of priestly support from Saul to David, symbolizing God's favor shifting towards David. Abiathar's role as a priest is crucial, as he provides spiritual guidance and access to divine counsel through the ephod. This relationship between David and Abiathar underscores the importance of seeking God's will in times of crisis.<p><b>&#8220;Bring the ephod.&#8221;</b><br>The ephod, a priestly garment, is used for seeking God's guidance, particularly through the Urim and Thummim, which are believed to be sacred lots or stones used for divination. David's request for the ephod indicates his desire to seek God's direction in response to Saul's threat. This act of seeking divine guidance contrasts with Saul's earlier disobedience and lack of reliance on God. The ephod's use here foreshadows the New Testament emphasis on seeking God's will through prayer and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. David's reliance on the ephod can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is our ultimate High Priest, providing access to God and His will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, currently on the run from King Saul.

The verse models alertness, discernment, respect for God-given authority, and wholehearted dependence on divine guidance&#8212;timeless steps for every believer facing opposition today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Secretly practised mischief.</span>--The idea of secrecy suggested in the English translation does not appear in the Hebrew; the accurate rendering would be, "was forging, or devising." It is likely enough that Jonathan contrived to keep his friend informed of these Court plots against him.<p><span class= "bld">Bring hither the ephod.</span>--It is quite clear that a different method of enquiry was used by David on this occasion. In <a href="/context/1_samuel/23-3.htm" title="And David's men said to him, Behold, we be afraid here in Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?">1Samuel 23:3-4</a> it is merely stated that he enquired of the Lord; here at Keilah his enquiry was prefaced, in <a href="/1_samuel/23-6.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.">1Samuel 23:6</a>, by a definite statement that Abiathar the priest, <span class= "ital">with the ephod, </span>had arrived here before he asked the question of God. The history tells us he directed Abiathar the priest to "bring hither the ephod," thus pointedly connecting the enquiry in some way with the ephod. In this ephod were set twelve precious stones, one for each of the twelve tribes. The names of the tribes were engraved on these gems, the Rabbis tell us, along with some other sacred words. On important solemn occasions--it seems perfectly certain during a considerable time--that these stones were allowed by the providence of God, who worked so many marvels for His people, to be used as oracles. It has been already stated that according to a most ancient tradition the use of the sacred gems was restricted to the high priest, who could only call out the supernatural power at the bidding of the king or the head of the State for the time being (such an one as Joshua, for instance). The Divine response given by the sacred gems seems to have been the visible response to earnest, faithful prayer.<p>The common belief is that the ephod stones gave their answer to the royal and high priestly questions by some peculiar shining. But a passage (quoted at length in the <span class= "ital">Excursus </span>M on the Urim and Thummim at the end of this Book) from the Babylonian Talmud (Treatise <span class= "ital">Yoma</span>)--apparently little known--tells us that the Rabbis had two other explanations traditionally handed down from the days when the ephod and its holy gemmed breastplate was questioned on solemn occasions by the high priest.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul secretly practised mischief.</span> This phrase is correctly translated "devised evil" in <a href="/proverbs/3-29.htm">Proverbs 3:29</a>; <a href="/proverbs/14-22.htm">Proverbs 14:22</a>. There is no idea of secrecy in the Hebrew verb, which literally means "to work in metals," "to forge." Saul's purpose was open enough, and when David heard of it he tells Abiathar to bring the ephod, and then offers earnest prayer to God for counsel and advice. In his prayer his two questions are put inversely to the logical order, but in accordance with their relative importance in David's mind, and no ground exists for altering the text. But when the ephod was brought forward the questions were of course put in their logical sequence. To the first question, "Will Saul come down to besiege Keilah?" the answer was, "He will." To the second, "Will the citizens of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul?" the answer also was, "They will. Whereupon he and his followers, now increased to 600 men, withdrew, <span class="cmt_word">and went whithersoever they could go.</span> Literally. "they went about whither they went about," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> without any fixed plan, as chance or their necessities dictated. As David was once again at large, Saul had no longer any reason for besieging Keilah, especially as its citizens had preferred his side, as that of the more powerful, to gratitude for the safety of their lives and property. <p> CHAPTER 23:14-29 <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/23-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1428;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">learned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1491;&#1463;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;&#7695;a&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
