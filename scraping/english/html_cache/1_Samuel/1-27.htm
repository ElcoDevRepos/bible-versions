In the cultural context of ancient Israel, barrenness was often seen as a source of shame and a sign of divine disfavor. Hannah's earnest prayer at the tabernacle in Shiloh reflects her deep desire for a child and her belief in God's power to change her circumstances. This phrase highlights the importance of prayer in the life of a believer, demonstrating that God hears and responds to the heartfelt petitions of His people. Hannah's prayer can be seen as a precursor to the New Testament teaching on prayer, such as in <a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>, which emphasizes the power of a righteous person's prayer.<p><b>and since the LORD has granted me</b><br>The acknowledgment of the LORD's role in granting her request underscores the sovereignty and faithfulness of God. In the historical context, the name "LORD" (YHWH) is significant as it denotes the covenant-keeping God of Israel. Hannah's recognition of God's hand in her situation is a testament to her faith and understanding of God's character. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God as the giver of life and blessings, as seen in <a href="/genesis/21.htm">Genesis 21:1-2</a> with the birth of Isaac to Sarah. It reflects the biblical principle that every good and perfect gift comes from above (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><b>what I asked of Him</b><br>Hannah's specific request for a son and God's fulfillment of that request illustrates the personal nature of God's relationship with His people. It shows that God is attentive to individual needs and desires, responding to the specific prayers of His followers. This phrase also highlights the importance of aligning one's requests with God's will, as seen in 1 <a href="/john/5-14.htm">John 5:14-15</a>, where believers are encouraged to ask according to His will. Hannah's vow to dedicate her son to the LORD's service (<a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>) demonstrates her commitment to honoring God with the answer to her prayer, setting a precedent for dedicating one's blessings back to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hannah.htm">Hannah</a></b><br>A devout woman who was initially barren.
