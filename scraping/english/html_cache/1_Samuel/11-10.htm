This city had historical ties to the tribe of Benjamin, as seen in <a href="/judges/21-8.htm">Judges 21:8-14</a>, where the men of Jabesh-gilead were spared during a conflict involving the tribe of Benjamin. Nahash was the king of the Ammonites, a people descended from Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-38.htm">Genesis 19:38</a>). The Ammonites were often in conflict with Israel, and Nahash's aggression towards Jabesh-gilead reflects ongoing hostilities.<p><b>&#8220;Tomorrow we will come out</b><br>This phrase indicates a strategic decision by the men of Jabesh. They had been besieged by Nahash and were seeking a way to avoid the brutal terms of surrender he had initially proposed, which included gouging out the right eye of every man (<a href="/1_samuel/11-2.htm">1 Samuel 11:2</a>). By saying "tomorrow," they were buying time, as they had secretly sent messengers to Saul for help (<a href="/1_samuel/11-3.htm">1 Samuel 11:3-4</a>).<p><b>and you can do with us whatever seems good to you.&#8221;</b><br>This statement is a form of submission, but it is also a ruse. The men of Jabesh were not truly surrendering; they were stalling for time until Saul could arrive with reinforcements. This tactic reflects the desperate situation they were in and their hope for deliverance. The phrase "whatever seems good to you" is a common biblical expression of submission, but in this context, it is part of a larger plan for salvation. Saul's subsequent victory over the Ammonites (<a href="/1_samuel/11-11.htm">1 Samuel 11:11</a>) is a foreshadowing of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, as Saul acts as a deliverer for his people, a type of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/men_of_jabesh.htm">Men of Jabesh</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead, an Israelite city under threat from the Ammonites.

The citizens of Jabesh-gilead speak as a unified body to the Ammonite king who has encamped against them (<a href="/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Their direct address confirms the real, historical tension: they are literally surrounded and facing mutilation (v. 2).<p>&#8226; Similar moments of threatened surrender appear in <a href="/judges/10-7.htm">Judges 10:7&#8211;9</a> and <a href="/2_kings/18-28.htm">2 Kings 18:28&#8211;32</a>, reminding us that Israel often stood on the brink until God intervened.<p>&#8226; By stepping forward together, they model communal resolve while trusting that a divinely raised deliverer&#8212;Saul&#8212;will arrive, as already hinted in <a href="/1_samuel/9-16.htm">1 Samuel 9:16 and 11</a>:6&#8211;8.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Tomorrow we will come out</b><p>&#8226; The promise of &#8220;tomorrow&#8221; echoes Saul&#8217;s message in the previous verse: &#8220;By the time the sun is hot tomorrow, you will be rescued&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/11-9.htm">1 Samuel 11:9</a>).<p>&#8226; This timing is no accident; it aligns perfectly with Saul&#8217;s battle plan (vv. 11-12), showing God&#8217;s sovereign orchestration, much like <a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-14</a> when salvation came at dawn.<p>&#8226; The phrase can sound like capitulation, yet it functions as strategic misdirection&#8212;comparable to Joshua&#8217;s feigned retreat at Ai (<a href="/joshua/8-4.htm">Joshua 8:4-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Faith and strategy are not at odds; the men trust God&#8217;s word through Saul while wisely keeping the enemy unsuspecting.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you can do with us whatever seems good to you</b><p>&#8226; On the surface, this reads as total surrender, paralleling the desperate offers in <a href="/judges/19-24.htm">Judges 19:24</a> or <a href="/jeremiah/40-4.htm">Jeremiah 40:4</a>.<p>&#8226; Ironically, what &#8220;seems good&#8221; to Nahash will never occur; instead, the Lord&#8217;s good purpose prevails (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>; <a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Their statement leaves Nahash complacent, buying crucial hours for Saul&#8217;s forces to arrive&#8212;an example of God using the weak and outnumbered to shame the strong (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse therefore highlights the clash between human intentions and divine deliverance: Nahash plans humiliation; God plans salvation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/11-10.htm">1 Samuel 11:10</a> shows the men of Jabesh-gilead speaking unitedly, scheduling their &#8220;surrender&#8221; for the very day Saul will strike, and offering themselves to Nahash in words that mask confident expectation of rescue. Their seeming submission is actually a step of faith and tactical wisdom, illustrating how God directs timing, strategy, and outcome to secure literal, historic deliverance for His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tomorrow we will come out unto you</span>.
