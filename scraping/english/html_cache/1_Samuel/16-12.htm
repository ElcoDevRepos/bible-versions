The youngest son, David, is tending sheep, a humble occupation that foreshadows his future role as a shepherd of Israel. This act of sending for David highlights the biblical theme of God choosing the least likely candidate, as seen with other figures like Joseph and Moses. David's role as the youngest son is significant in a culture where the eldest typically held the position of prominence and inheritance.<p><b>He was ruddy, with beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance.</b><br>David's physical description emphasizes his youth and vitality. "Ruddy" suggests a healthy, reddish complexion, possibly indicating his outdoor lifestyle. His "beautiful eyes" and "handsome appearance" are noted, yet it is important to recognize that God looks beyond outward appearances, as stated earlier in the chapter (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). This description contrasts with Saul, whose physical stature was initially a reason for his selection as king. David's appearance also prefigures the attractiveness of Christ, who, despite His humble origins, drew people to Himself.<p><b>And the LORD said, &#8220;Rise and anoint him, for he is the one.&#8221;</b><br>God's directive to Samuel to anoint David signifies divine election and empowerment. Anointing with oil is a symbolic act representing the Holy Spirit's presence and blessing, a practice seen throughout the Old Testament with priests and kings. This moment marks the beginning of David's journey to kingship, despite Saul still being on the throne. It foreshadows the anointing of Jesus as the Messiah, the ultimate anointed one, who fulfills the roles of prophet, priest, and king. David's anointing is a pivotal moment in salvation history, setting the stage for the Davidic Covenant and the eventual coming of Christ from David's lineage.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesse.htm">Jesse</a></b><br>The father of David, a Bethlehemite, who had eight sons.

Scripture records David&#8217;s attractiveness (also noted in <a href="/1_samuel/17-42.htm">1 Samuel 17:42</a>), yet the earlier verse clarifies that physical traits were not the basis of God&#8217;s choice.<p>&#8226; His ruddy complexion and bright eyes hint at vigor and sincerity, foreshadowing the passionate worshipper who would pen Psalms overflowing with devotion (for example, <a href="/psalms/27-4.htm">Psalm 27:4</a>).<p>&#8226; While God&#8217;s focus is the inner person, He is not indifferent to the outer; beauty is a gift when surrendered to Him (<a href="/genesis/39-6.htm">Genesis 39:6</a> concerning Joseph; <a href="/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3&#8211;4</a> on inner beauty).<p>&#8226;
