Saul's jealousy and fear of losing his throne drove him to seek David's life. This pursuit is a recurring theme in 1 Samuel, illustrating the conflict between Saul's declining kingship and David's rise. Saul's actions can be seen as a warning against allowing jealousy and fear to dictate one's actions, as they lead to destructive behavior.<p><b>When David was told about it,</b><br>David's awareness of Saul's movements indicates the presence of loyal informants and supporters who helped him evade capture. This reflects the providence of God in protecting David, who was chosen to lead Israel. It also underscores the importance of wise counsel and vigilance in times of danger, as seen throughout David's life.<p><b>he went down to the rock</b><br>The "rock" likely refers to a specific geographical feature that provided a strategic advantage for David. In the biblical narrative, rocks and strongholds often symbolize refuge and protection. This imagery is echoed in the Psalms, where God is frequently described as a rock and fortress (e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>). David's choice to go to the rock demonstrates his reliance on both natural defenses and divine protection.<p><b>and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon.</b><br>The Wilderness of Maon is located in the Judean Desert, a rugged and desolate area that offered natural concealment. This setting emphasizes David's status as a fugitive and the harsh conditions he endured. The wilderness experience is a common motif in Scripture, often associated with testing and preparation, as seen in the lives of Moses and Jesus. David's time in the wilderness prepared him for future leadership by teaching him dependence on God.<p><b>And when Saul heard of this,</b><br>Saul's intelligence network was also active, indicating the resources he had at his disposal as king. This phrase shows the ongoing cat-and-mouse dynamic between Saul and David, with each move countered by the other. It highlights the tension and uncertainty of the period, as well as the broader theme of God's sovereignty in guiding the events according to His purposes.<p><b>he pursued David there.</b><br>Saul's pursuit of David to the Wilderness of Maon demonstrates his determination to eliminate David as a threat. This relentless pursuit can be seen as a reflection of Saul's spiritual decline and his inability to accept God's will. The pursuit also foreshadows the eventual transition of power from Saul to David, as God orchestrates events to fulfill His promises. David's evasion of Saul's pursuit is a testament to God's faithfulness in preserving His chosen servant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is pursuing David out of jealousy and fear of losing his throne.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, who is fleeing from Saul to preserve his life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rock.htm">The Rock</a></b><br>A specific location in the wilderness of Maon where David sought refuge.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness_of_maon.htm">Wilderness of Maon</a></b><br>A desolate area in Judah where David and his men hid from Saul.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pursuit.htm">Pursuit</a></b><br>The ongoing chase by Saul to capture and kill David, highlighting the tension between the two.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_protection.htm">Trust in God's Protection</a></b><br>David's life exemplifies reliance on God's protection even when pursued by powerful enemies.

His pursuit is methodical&#8212;he marshals &#8220;his men,&#8221; the regular army of Israel, for a personal vendetta (24:2; 26:2).<p>&#8226; The verse underscores the real danger David faces; this isn&#8217;t a single rogue soldier but the king and his forces. Compare <a href="/1_samuel/24-14.htm">1 Samuel 24:14</a> where David later asks, &#8220;Whom have you come out to pursue? A dead dog? A flea?&#8221;&#8212;highlighting Saul&#8217;s disproportionate response.<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s determination reminds us that human authority, when separated from God&#8217;s guidance, easily slides into persecution of the righteous (<a href="/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When David was told about it</b><p>&#8226; David benefits from loyal informants&#8212;likely the people of Ziph mentioned in 23:19&#8212;but he has the discernment to act on that intelligence (23:1&#8211;12).<p>&#8226; Even with God&#8217;s promises of kingship (16:13), David doesn&#8217;t presume on divine protection; he responsibly gathers information and responds. Jesus later instructs a similar blend of wisdom and innocence in <a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>.<p>&#8226; Notice that David neither panics nor retaliates against Saul. He waits on the LORD (<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>), illustrating faith expressed through thoughtful action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He went down to the rock and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The rock&#8221; likely refers to a large outcropping that offers both concealment and a strategic viewpoint. David repeatedly uses natural strongholds&#8212;Adullam (22:1), Engedi (24:1)&#8212;while acknowledging that &#8220;The LORD is my rock, my fortress&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>).<p>&#8226; The Wilderness of Maon lies south of Hebron, a barren, maze-like terrain. In human terms it is inhospitable; in spiritual terms it becomes a classroom where David learns reliance on God alone (<a href="/bsb/psalms/63.htm">Psalm 63</a>, composed &#8220;in the wilderness of Judah&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Remaining there shows a measured stance: he doesn&#8217;t flee Israel altogether, honoring Saul&#8217;s kingship for now (24:6), yet he avoids needless confrontation&#8212;a model of living peaceably as far as it depends on us (<a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And when Saul heard of this, he pursued David there</b><p>&#8226; Saul adapts quickly, displaying the relentless nature of sin-driven jealousy (<a href="/james/3-14.htm">James 3:14&#8211;16</a>). Every time David gains distance, Saul closes it&#8212;an echo of <a href="/1_samuel/26-20.htm">1 Samuel 26:20</a> where Saul likens the chase to hunting partridge in the mountains.<p>&#8226; God allows the tension to escalate, setting the stage for dramatic deliverance in 23:26&#8211;28 when a Philistine raid forces Saul to retreat. The episode reminds us that the LORD &#8220;frustrates the plans of the peoples&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10</a>) while protecting His anointed.<p>&#8226; For believers, Saul&#8217;s pursuit pictures the adversary&#8217;s unending harassment, yet David&#8217;s survival foreshadows the truth declared in <a href="/2_thessalonians/3-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:3</a>: &#8220;The Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/23-25.htm">1 Samuel 23:25</a> captures a tense moment in the ongoing cat-and-mouse struggle between Saul and David. Saul&#8217;s aggressive search, David&#8217;s informed response, the strategic retreat to a rocky refuge, and Saul&#8217;s renewed chase all highlight the interplay of human responsibility and divine sovereignty. David acts wisely and courageously, yet ultimately trusts the LORD to be his true stronghold. The verse teaches that God&#8217;s promises do not negate prudent action; rather, they empower us to move forward with confidence, knowing He will guard His purposes and His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He came down into a rock.</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">sela'</span>, a cliff or precipice. In the next verse it is described as a mountain, on one side of which was David and his men, in full view of Saul and his army on the other. But as Saul's forces were much more numerous, they were preparing to separate, and so enclose David, while he <span class="cmt_word">made haste.</span> The word expresses anxiety and fear, and may be translated, "And David sought anxiously to go from before the face of Saul." Conder's description of the spot ('Tent Work,' 2:91) sets the whole scene most vividly before us. It is as follows: - "Between the ridge of El Kolah (the ancient hill of Hachilah) and the neighbourhood of Maon there is a great gorge called 'the Valley of Rocks,' a narrow but deep chasm, impassable except by a detour of many miles, so that Saul might have stood within sight of David, yet quite unable to overtake his enemy; and to this "cliff of division" the name Malaky now applies, a word closely approaching the Hebrew <span class="accented">Mahlekoth.</span> The neighbourhood is seamed with many torrent beds, but there is no other place near Maon where cliffs such as are to be inferred from the word <span class="accented">sela'</span> can be found. It seems to me pretty safe, therefore, to look on this gorge as the scene of the wonderful escape of David, due to a sudden Philistine invasion, which terminated the history of his hair-breadth escapes in the south country." This cliff in ver. 28 is called Sela-Hammahlekoth, "the cliff of divisions," or "of separations," <span class="accented">ham</span> representing the Hebrew article. Many other derivations have been suggested, but the above, which alone agrees with the ordinary meaning of the Hebrew verb, is proved to be right by Mr. Conder's researches. They enable us also to correct some small errors. Thus David did not come down <span class="cmt_word">into a rock,</span> but "to the cliff," the <span class="accented">sela</span> or precipitous gorge described above. Nor did he "descend the rock" (Erdmann) "in order to conceal himself in the low land, or in the caves at its base," but he went to it as being an impassable barrier between him and his pursuers. But "he hasted anxiously to get away" (ver. 26), because Saul would divide his army into two parts, and so David would only have the advantage of the few miles of detour which Saul must make. But for the news of the Philistine invasion his final escape would have been almost hopeless. The ordinary notion that David and his men were concealed from the sight of Saul by an intervening mountain is disproved, not only by no such mountain existing, but also by the clause, "Saul and his men were surrounding David and his men" (ver. 28). They had them in sight, and were forming in two divisions, so as to pass the gorge at the two ends and close upon the flanks of David's small band of followers.
