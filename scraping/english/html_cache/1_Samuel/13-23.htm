They were a sea-faring people who settled along the coastal regions of Canaan. Their military strength and advanced iron weaponry posed a constant threat to the Israelites. The presence of a Philistine garrison indicates their strategic control over key locations in Israel, which was a source of tension and conflict. This reflects the ongoing struggle for dominance in the region, as seen in earlier accounts of battles between Israel and the Philistines (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/4.htm">1 Samuel 4</a>).<p><b>had gone out</b><br>This phrase suggests a movement or deployment of troops, indicating a proactive military strategy by the Philistines. It implies that the Philistines were not merely defending their territory but were actively seeking to expand their influence and control. This movement could be seen as a tactical maneuver to assert dominance over the Israelites and to secure strategic locations.<p><b>to the pass at Michmash</b><br>Michmash was a strategically important location in the central highlands of Israel, north of Jerusalem. The pass at Michmash was a narrow and defensible route, making it a critical point for controlling movement between the northern and southern parts of the country. The geographical significance of Michmash is highlighted in other biblical narratives, such as the account of Jonathan's daring attack on the Philistine outpost in <a href="/1_samuel/14.htm">1 Samuel 14</a>. The control of such passes was crucial for military and trade purposes, and the Philistines' presence there underscores their intent to dominate the region.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A significant enemy of Israel during the time of Saul and David.

The purpose of this was to keep the route open, that so, when they pleased, they might send a larger body of troops up the defile in order to attack Saul. It would also keep a watch upon his movements, though they could have had no expectation that he would venture to attack them. It was this garrison which Jonathan so bravely attacked, and by his success prepared the way for the utter defeat of the enemy. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/13-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And a garrison</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1510;&#1468;&#1463;&#1443;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#7779;&#183;&#7779;a&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4673.htm">Strong's 4673: </a> </span><span class="str2">A fixed spot, an office, a military post</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the Philistines</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#601;&#183;li&#353;&#183;t&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6430.htm">Strong's 6430: </a> </span><span class="str2">Philistines -- inhabitants of Philistia</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had gone out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1510;&#1461;&#1488;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;&#7779;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3318.htm">Strong's 3318: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, bring, out, direct and proxim</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to the pass</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1463;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(ma&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4569.htm">Strong's 4569: </a> </span><span class="str2">A crossing-place, a transit, overwhelming</span><br /><br /><span class="word">at Michmash.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1469;&#1513;&#1474;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#7733;&#183;m&#257;&#347;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4363.htm">Strong's 4363: </a> </span><span class="str2">Michmash -- a city in Benjamin</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/1_samuel/13-23.htm">1 Samuel 13:23 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/1_samuel/13-23.htm">1 Samuel 13:23 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/1_samuel/13-23.htm">1 Samuel 13:23 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/1_samuel/13-23.htm">1 Samuel 13:23 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/1_samuel/13-23.htm">1 Samuel 13:23 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/1_samuel/13-23.htm">1 Samuel 13:23  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/1_samuel/13-23.htm">1 Samuel 13:23 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/1_samuel/13-23.htm">1 Samuel 13:23 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/1_samuel/13-23.htm">1 Samuel 13:23 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/1_samuel/13-23.htm">1 Samuel 13:23 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/1_samuel/13-23.htm">OT History: 1 Samuel 13:23 The garrison of the Philistines went out (1Sa iSam 1 Sam i sa) </a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="/1_samuel/13-22.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="1 Samuel 13:22"><img src="/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="1 Samuel 13:22" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="/1_samuel/14-1.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="1 Samuel 14:1"><img src="/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="1 Samuel 14:1" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="bot"><iframe width="100%" height="1500" scrolling="no" src="/botmenubhnew2.htm" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
