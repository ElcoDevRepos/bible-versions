The Philistines are preparing to attack, and God has stopped communicating with him through prophets or dreams. Saul's request to his servants indicates his reliance on human counsel rather than divine guidance, highlighting his spiritual decline. This moment contrasts with earlier in his reign when he sought God's will through Samuel.<p><b>&#8220;Find me a woman who is a medium</b><br>Saul's request for a medium, or necromancer, is significant because it directly contradicts God's law. <a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a> explicitly forbids consulting mediums, as it is considered an abomination. Saul himself had previously expelled mediums and spiritists from the land (<a href="/1_samuel/28-3.htm">1 Samuel 28:3</a>), making his request even more hypocritical and desperate. This act underscores Saul's departure from God's commands and his increasing reliance on forbidden practices.<p><b>so I can go and consult her.&#8221;</b><br>Saul's desire to consult a medium reflects his fear and uncertainty. He seeks guidance from the dead, specifically the prophet Samuel, whom he believes can provide the counsel he desperately needs. This action demonstrates Saul's lack of faith in God's sovereignty and his willingness to resort to pagan practices. It also foreshadows the tragic consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>&#8220;There is a medium at Endor,&#8221; his servants replied.</b><br>Endor was a town located in the territory of Issachar, near the Jezreel Valley. The mention of Endor is significant because it was outside the immediate control of Saul's kingdom, indicating the lengths to which he was willing to go to find a medium. The fact that his servants knew of a medium's location suggests that despite Saul's earlier ban, such practices continued in secret. This response highlights the spiritual decay within Israel and the failure to fully eradicate pagan influences.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who was anointed by the prophet Samuel.

God&#8217;s silence, rooted in Saul&#8217;s persistent rebellion, exposes a heart more interested in answers than in obedience. Ignoring clear commands against mediums, Saul proves that external reforms (expelling occultists) mean little without internal surrender. His request and his servants&#8217; response illustrate how readily sin supplies alternatives when faith refuses to wait on God.

Jewish tradition speaks of the "two men" who accompanied Saul as Abner and Amasa, and further mentions that the witch of En-dor was the mother of the great Abner. If this be true, it would account for her having escaped the general pursuit after witches mentioned above in the early days of Saul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit</span>.

The adventurous character of Saul's night journey is very striking when we consider that the Philistines pitched in Shunem on the southern slopes of the mountain, and that Saul's army was at Jezreel; thus, to arrive at Endor he had to pass the hostile camp, and would probably creep round the eastern shoulder of the hill, hidden by the undulations of the plain, as an Arab will often now advance unseen close by you in a fold of the ground." He proceeds to speculate upon the cave in which the sorceress may have lived, dismissing those in the town as too modern, but suggesting one on the hillside. But there is nothing in the narrative to suggest that she lived in a cave, but rather the contrary, and the idea may be dismissed as due to the imagination of painters. As the journey was very dangerous, Saul <span class="cmt_word">disguised himself,</span> and went <span class="cmt_word">by night,</span> accompanied only by two men; and nothing could more plainly set before us his mental anguish, and also his intense desire to pry into the secrets of futurity, than this strange journey. All faith and hope are gone, and a feverish excitement, ready to catch at any aid, however lawless and untrustworthy, had taken their place. In this state of mind he arrives at the woman's dwelling, and says, <span class="cmt_word">Divine unto me by the <span class="accented">ob</span>.</span> Though divination was strictly forbidden (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10, 14</a>), yet we find the <span class="accented">diviner</span> (A.V. prudent) in high popular estimation in <a href="/isaiah/3-2.htm">Isaiah 3:2</a>; and it was probably a lucrative profession, or this woman would not have been willing to incur so great a danger as was involved in its practice. <span class="cmt_word">Bring me him up,</span> etc. The fancy that we can see the spirits of the dead is a most natural and enduring superstition, and it seems generally assumed that they must have some knowledge not accessible to the living. It must be said for Saul that he did not become the victim of this folly until after his reason was disturbed, and as a punishment for heinous sins. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/28-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to his servants,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1506;&#1458;&#1489;&#1464;&#1491;&#1464;&#1431;&#1497;&#1493;</span> <span class="translit">(la&#183;&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-l &#124; Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5650.htm">Strong's 5650: </a> </span><span class="str2">Slave, servant</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Find</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1511;&#1468;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(baq&#183;q&#601;&#183;&#353;&#363;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Imperative - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1245.htm">Strong's 1245: </a> </span><span class="str2">To search out, to strive after</span><br /><br /><span class="word">me a woman</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1461;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#234;&#183;&#353;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who is a medium,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1428;&#1493;&#1465;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_178.htm">Strong's 178: </a> </span><span class="str2">A bottle (made from animal skin), a necromancer</span><br /><br /><span class="word">so I can go</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive imperfect Cohortative - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1980.htm">Strong's 1980: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go, come, walk</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and consult</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1462;&#1491;&#1456;&#1512;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;e&#7695;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;h-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Conjunctive imperfect Cohortative - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1875.htm">Strong's 1875: </a> </span><span class="str2">To tread, frequent, to follow, to seek, ask, to worship</span><br /><br /><span class="word">her.&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1425;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;There [is]</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1461;&#1435;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2009.htm">Strong's 2009: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lo!
