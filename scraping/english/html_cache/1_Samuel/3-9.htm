The act of lying down signifies a return to a state of rest and readiness, emphasizing the importance of being in a position to receive God's message. In biblical times, lying down was often associated with rest and reflection, a necessary posture for hearing God's voice.<p><b>he said to Samuel,</b><br>Eli, the high priest, recognizes that it is the LORD calling Samuel. This moment marks a pivotal transition in Samuel's life, as he moves from serving under Eli to becoming a prophet of God. Eli's guidance is crucial, as it helps Samuel discern the divine nature of the call. This interaction highlights the role of mentorship and spiritual guidance in understanding God's will.<p><b>and if He calls you,</b><br>The conditional "if" indicates the expectation of God's continued communication. It underscores the idea that God initiates the call, and it is not for Samuel to presume upon it. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and initiative in calling individuals to His service, as seen in the lives of other prophets like Moses and Isaiah.<p><b>say, &#8216;Speak, LORD,</b><br>This response is an acknowledgment of God's authority and a readiness to listen. The use of "LORD" (Yahweh) signifies a personal and covenantal relationship with God. It is a model of humility and submission, recognizing God's right to speak and the listener's duty to hear. This phrase echoes the attitude of other biblical figures who responded to God's call with reverence and openness.<p><b>for Your servant is listening.&#8217;</b><br>The term "servant" denotes a position of humility and readiness to obey. Listening implies more than just hearing; it involves an active engagement and willingness to act upon God's words. This phrase encapsulates the proper attitude of a believer towards God's revelation, aligning with the biblical principle that faith comes by hearing the word of God (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>).<p><b>So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</b><br>Samuel's obedience to Eli's instruction demonstrates his trust and readiness to receive God's message. Returning to his place signifies a return to his duties and responsibilities, highlighting the importance of faithfulness in one's current position while awaiting further direction from God. This act of obedience sets the stage for Samuel's future role as a prophet and leader in Israel, foreshadowing his significant impact on the nation's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli.htm">Eli</a></b><br>The high priest of Israel at the time, who served as a mentor to the young Samuel.
