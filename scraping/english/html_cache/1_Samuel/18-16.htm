This love for David can be seen as a fulfillment of God's favor upon him, as previously indicated in <a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a> when Samuel anointed him. The mention of both Israel and Judah underscores the later division of the kingdom, but at this time, David's influence and favor transcend tribal boundaries. His ability to unify the people foreshadows his future role as king over a united Israel. This love also prefigures the love and acceptance Jesus Christ would receive from those who recognized Him as the Messiah, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/12-13.htm">John 12:13</a>.<p><b>because he was leading them out to battle and back</b><br>David's role as a military leader is crucial in understanding his rise to prominence. His success in battle, as seen in his victory over Goliath (1 Samuel 17), established him as a capable and divinely favored leader. The phrase "leading them out to battle and back" indicates not only his military prowess but also his responsibility and care for the troops, ensuring their safe return. This mirrors the role of a shepherd, a theme prevalent in David's life and later in his writings, such as <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>. The imagery of a shepherd leading his flock safely is a type of Christ, who is referred to as the Good Shepherd in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, emphasizing His guidance and protection over His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd who became a warrior and was anointed by God to be the future king of Israel.

This isn&#8217;t hyperbole; Scripture records a literal, nationwide response.<p>- Earlier, David&#8217;s victory over Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-48.htm">1 Samuel 17:48&#8211;53</a>) had already captured Israel&#8217;s attention.<p>- His appointment by Saul &#8220;in command of the men of war&#8221; pleased &#8220;all the people&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/18-5.htm">1 Samuel 18:5</a>).<p>- Years later, the elders would recall this season, saying to David, &#8220;You were the one who led Israel out and brought them back&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a>). God used David to unify the northern tribes (Israel) and the southern tribe (Judah).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>loved David</b><p>Love here reflects genuine affection and loyalty, not merely admiration from afar.<p>- Saul&#8217;s servants first &#8220;loved him greatly&#8221; when he played the harp (<a href="/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21</a>). That circle of love now widens to the whole nation.<p>- <a href="/proverbs/16-7.htm">Proverbs 16:7</a> notes, &#8220;When a man&#8217;s ways please the LORD, He makes even his enemies live at peace with him.&#8221; David&#8217;s favor was evidence that God&#8217;s hand rested on him (<a href="/1_samuel/18-14.htm">1 Samuel 18:14</a>).<p>- This widespread love contrasts sharply with Saul&#8217;s growing jealousy (<a href="/1_samuel/18-8.htm">1 Samuel 18:8&#8211;9</a>), highlighting the difference between godly popularity and fleshly insecurity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because he was leading them</b><p>Israel and Judah loved David &#8220;because he was leading them.&#8221; Leadership is more than position; it&#8217;s proven care.<p>- Moses asked God for a successor who would &#8220;go out and come in before them&#8221; so the people wouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;like sheep without a shepherd&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>). David became the answer to that ancient prayer.<p>- The verb implies ongoing, hands-on guidance, echoing the shepherd imagery later applied to David&#8217;s greater Son, the Lord Jesus (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>out to battle</b><p>David didn&#8217;t send troops where he was unwilling to go. He marched at the front, modeling courage.<p>- His pattern began with Goliath when he &#8220;ran quickly toward the battle line&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-48.htm">1 Samuel 17:48</a>).<p>- God granted victory after victory; &#8220;David prospered in all his ways, for the LORD was with him&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/18-14.htm">1 Samuel 18:14</a>). Each triumph strengthened national confidence that the LORD, not just David, fought for them (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and back</b><p>A faithful leader also brings the people home. Coming back alive meant families were reunited and territories secured.<p>- The same phrase&#8212;&#8220;bring them in&#8221;&#8212;appears when God promises to protect Israel through obedient leaders (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-2.htm">Deuteronomy 31:2</a>).<p>- David&#8217;s consistency guarded morale: the nation could celebrate victories without fearing needless losses. This rhythm of safe return foreshadows the ultimate Shepherd who will &#8220;bring many sons to glory&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/18-16.htm">1 Samuel 18:16</a> shows a nation wholeheartedly devoted to David because he consistently, courageously, and safely led them in the LORD&#8217;s battles.

It is, however, clear from other notices (see, for instance, <a href="/1_samuel/11-8.htm" title="And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.">1Samuel 11:8</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/15-4.htm" title="And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.">1Samuel 15:4</a>, in this book) that at a period long anterior to the final disruption between the north and south a marked distinction between the two had begun to exist.<p>In David's case, however, although he was of Judah, the future king was equally popular with the northern tribes.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/18-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
