This position required loyalty and bravery. The armor-bearer&#8217;s actions reflect the deep bond and duty to his master, King Saul. The death of Saul, Israel's first king, marked a significant turning point in Israelite history, leading to the rise of David as king. Saul's death fulfilled the prophecy given by Samuel in <a href="/1_samuel/28-19.htm">1 Samuel 28:19</a>, where it was foretold that Saul and his sons would die in battle. The armor-bearer's reaction underscores the gravity of the moment and the loyalty expected in such roles.<p><b>he too fell on his own sword and died with him</b><br>The act of falling on one's sword was a method of suicide in ancient times, often seen as a way to avoid capture or disgrace. This action by the armor-bearer can be seen as an act of loyalty, choosing death over living without his master. It also reflects the cultural values of honor and loyalty prevalent in the ancient Near East. The armor-bearer's death alongside Saul signifies the end of an era and the tragic downfall of Saul's reign. This moment can be contrasted with the New Testament, where Jesus Christ, the ultimate King, offers life and hope through His resurrection, rather than death and despair. The armor-bearer's choice highlights the despair and hopelessness that can accompany the loss of a leader, contrasting with the hope found in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

While it does not endorse suicide, it faithfully narrates the consequences of Saul&#8217;s disobedience and the loyalty&#8212;though misguided&#8212;of the one who bore his armor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His armour bearer.</span> The Jewish tradition says that he was Doeg the Edomite, and that the sword on which Saul fell was that with which he had massacred the priests.

But Ishbosheth and Abner survived, and the meaning probably is not that his whole army, but that his personal attendants, all those posted round him, fell to a man, fighting bravely for their king, as the Scots fought round King James V. at Flodden Field. As suicide was very rare among the Israelites, the death of Saul is made more intensely tragic by the anguish which drove him thus to die by his own hand.
