The Israelites, emboldened by David's victory, chased the Philistines from the battlefield. This pursuit signifies a turning point in the conflict, as the Israelites, previously intimidated, now act with courage and determination. Historically, the Philistines were a significant threat to Israel, often engaging in battles for control of the region. The pursuit indicates a shift in power dynamics, with the Israelites gaining the upper hand. This event also foreshadows future victories under King David's leadership, as he would continue to defeat the Philistines and secure Israel's borders.<p><b>they plundered their camps</b><br>Plundering the enemy's camp was a common practice in ancient warfare, serving both as a reward for the victors and a means to weaken the enemy further. The Israelites' plundering of the Philistine camps would have involved taking weapons, supplies, and valuables, which not only enriched the Israelites but also deprived the Philistines of resources needed for future conflicts. This act of plundering can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to deliver the Philistines into Israel's hands, as seen in earlier scriptures where God assures victory to His people. Additionally, this event highlights the theme of divine justice and retribution, as the Philistines, who had oppressed Israel, now face the consequences of their actions. The plundering also serves as a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, where believers share in the spoils of His triumph.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were engaged in battle with the Philistines.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A significant enemy of Israel during this period, known for their military prowess and opposition to the Israelites.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/plundering_of_camps.htm">Plundering of Camps</a></b><br>After the defeat of Goliath and the Philistine army's retreat, the Israelites returned to the Philistine camps to take spoils.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_provision_in_victory.htm">God's Provision in Victory</a></b><br>Just as God provided for the Israelites through the plunder of the Philistine camps, He provides for us in our spiritual battles.

God&#8217;s people have seen the giant fall (<a href="/1_samuel/17-49.htm">1 Samuel 17:49&#8211;51</a>) and the enemy routed.<p>- Scripture often records a moment of regrouping after the Lord grants triumph&#8212;&#8220;Then all the people returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/10-21.htm">Joshua 10:21</a>). Such returns spotlight God&#8217;s protection: every soldier who went out under His banner makes it home.<p>- The scene underlines covenant faithfulness. Just as He promised, &#8220;The LORD your God&#8230; will give the enemies who rise up against you into your hand&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-7.htm">Deuteronomy 28:7</a>), so He now brings the troops safely back.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From their pursuit of the Philistines</b><p>- They were not satisfied with one dramatic blow; they chased the Philistines &#8220;all the way to the gates of Ekron&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-52.htm">1 Samuel 17:52</a>). Obedience meant finishing the task God had assigned.<p>&#8226; Similar aggressive follow-through appears when Jonathan&#8217;s victory sparks Israel to &#8220;pursue the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/14-22.htm">1 Samuel 14:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; David later writes, &#8220;I pursued my enemies and overtook them; I did not turn back until they were consumed&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-37.htm">Psalm 18:37</a>).<p>- The pursuit manifests holy courage. Fear had crippled Israel for forty days (<a href="/1_samuel/17-16.htm">1 Samuel 17:16</a>), but faith now propels them forward. God&#8217;s deliverance transforms timid spectators into active participants.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They plundered their camps</b><p>- Ancient warfare included gathering spoil after victory, yet this plundering is more than opportunistic looting; it is evidence of God&#8217;s provision. When Israel left Egypt, &#8220;They plundered the Egyptians&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/12-36.htm">Exodus 12:36</a>), receiving back pay for generations of slavery. Here, Israel collects weapons, food, and goods the Philistines once used against them.<p>- The plunder testifies that God reverses fortunes. The enemy&#8217;s resources become blessings for God&#8217;s people, echoing &#8220;The wealth of the wicked is stored up for the righteous&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/13-22.htm">Proverbs 13:22</a>).<p>- Later, King Jehoshaphat&#8217;s army will spend three days gathering spoil after God fights for them (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-25.htm">2 Chronicles 20:25</a>). In each case, the bounty reinforces the lesson: victory and its benefits come from the Lord.<p>- Properly handled, the spoil could support families, maintain the army, and equip future battles, illustrating stewardship of God-given gain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/17-53.htm">1 Samuel 17:53</a> shows Israel returning safely, finishing the chase, and enjoying the tangible rewards of God&#8217;s intervention. Their safe return highlights divine protection, their relentless pursuit demonstrates faith-driven obedience, and their plundering showcases the Lord&#8217;s generous provision. The verse invites trust that when God grants victory, He also secures His people and supplies every need that follows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-53.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the Israelites</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1121.htm">Strong's 1121: </a> </span><span class="str2">A son</span><br /><br /><span class="word">returned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1433;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#353;u&#183;&#7687;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
