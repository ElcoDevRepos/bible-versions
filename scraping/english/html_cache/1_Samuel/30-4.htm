These troops were not just soldiers but also included their families, making them a community. This group had been living in Ziklag, a Philistine territory, due to Saul's pursuit of David. The loyalty of these men to David is significant, as it foreshadows the unity and strength of David's future kingdom. The mention of "troops" highlights the military aspect of David's leadership, which is a recurring theme in his life and reign.<p><b>lifted up their voices and wept</b><br>The act of lifting up their voices and weeping indicates a profound expression of grief and despair. In the ancient Near Eastern culture, public displays of mourning were common, often involving loud cries and lamentations. This communal weeping signifies the deep bond and shared suffering among David and his men. The loss they experienced was not just personal but collective, as their families and possessions had been taken by the Amalekites. This moment of vulnerability contrasts with David's usual portrayal as a strong and decisive leader, showing his humanity and the emotional toll of leadership.<p><b>until they had no strength left to weep</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the depth of their sorrow and exhaustion. The physical depletion from weeping suggests a total emotional and spiritual crisis. In biblical narratives, moments of extreme weakness often precede divine intervention or a turning point. This mirrors other instances in scripture where God's people reach the end of their own strength and must rely on divine help, such as Elijah's despair in <a href="/1_kings/19.htm">1 Kings 19</a>. The exhaustion also sets the stage for David's subsequent actions, where he seeks strength in the Lord, highlighting the theme of reliance on God in times of distress.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, currently leading a group of men in exile.

This scene takes place at Ziklag, a city burned by the Amalekites, with every family member carried off (<a href="/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; By standing in the same sentence with his men, David models the shepherd-king heart later praised in <a href="/2_samuel/5-2.htm">2 Samuel 5:2</a> and echoed in <a href="/1_peter/5-2.htm">1 Peter 5:2-3</a> for church shepherds today.<p>&#8226; Scripture frequently ties a leader&#8217;s fate to the people he guides&#8212;think of Moses interceding for Israel (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>) or Nehemiah identifying with Jerusalem&#8217;s ruins (<a href="/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a>). Here David is not aloof; he feels what his men feel.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>lifted up their voices</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Lifted up&#8221; pictures an audible, united cry, not a silent tear.

In <a href="/1_samuel/30-6.htm">1 Samuel 30:6</a> David then &#8220;found strength in the LORD his God.&#8221; Human strength ends; God&#8217;s strength begins (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/22-44.htm">Luke 22:44</a> shows Jesus in Gethsemane sweating blood&#8212;ultimate human weakness preceding ultimate divine victory. The pattern repeats here: spent tears precede restored courage.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/30-4.htm">1 Samuel 30:4</a> paints a raw, collective sorrow: leader and followers together raise a loud, public cry, shed unashamed tears, and collapse in spent weakness.
