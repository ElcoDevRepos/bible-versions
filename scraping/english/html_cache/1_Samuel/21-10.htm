It follows the events where David, fearing for his life, fled from King Saul. The context is crucial as it highlights the ongoing tension and danger David faced, which is a recurring theme in his life.<p><b>David fled from Saul</b><br>David's flight from Saul is a significant turning point in his life. Saul's jealousy and fear of David's rising popularity and God's favor led to multiple attempts on David's life. This phrase underscores the intense persecution David faced, which is a common experience for many biblical figures who are chosen by God. It also foreshadows the trials and tribulations that David would endure before becoming king.<p><b>and went to Achish king of Gath</b><br>Gath was one of the five major Philistine cities, and Achish was its king. This move is surprising because Gath was the hometown of Goliath, whom David had slain. David's decision to seek refuge in enemy territory reflects his desperation and the complexity of his situation. Historically, this shows the political dynamics of the time, where allegiances could be fluid. Theologically, it can be seen as a test of faith and reliance on God's protection. This event also prefigures Christ's own experiences of rejection and seeking refuge, drawing a parallel between David's life and the life of Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, who is fleeing from King Saul due to Saul's jealousy and intent to kill him.

The verse highlights Saul&#8217;s escalating danger, David&#8217;s practical yet faith-filled response, and God&#8217;s hidden hand guiding His anointed&#8212;even into enemy territory&#8212;to preserve the royal line and advance the bigger redemptive story that culminates in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">And David arose and fled&#250;</span>--The cause of this sudden flight was, of course, the fear of Doeg, one of Saul's most trusted servants. Not an hour must be lost, thought David; my deadly foe will hear that I am here, and I shall be trapped like a hunted beast of prey. It seems at first sight strange that David should dare to go among the Philistines, who had such good cause to hate and fear him, but the son of Jesse ever thought lightly of himself, and had no idea that his person was so well known, or his story so generally current as it subsequently proved to be. (See <a href="/1_samuel/21-11.htm" title="And the servants of Achish said to him, Is not this David the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands?">1Samuel 21:11</a>.) Of David's humility, so conspicuously exhibited on this occasion, when he ventured among his foes, not dreaming how great a personage they considered him, the Babylonian Talmud strikingly writes:--"No man in Israel despised himself more than David where the precepts of the Lord were concerned, and this is what he said before God (<a href="/context/psalms/131-1.htm" title="Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor my eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.">Psalm 131:1-2</a>), 'Lord, my heart was not haughty when Samuel anointed me king, nor were mine eyes lofty <span class= "ital">when I slew Goliath </span>. . . as a child . . . have I likened myself before Thee in not being ashamed to depreciate myself before Thee for Thy glory.'"--Treatise <span class= "ital">Bamidbar, </span>chap 4.<p><span class= "bld">Achish the king of Gath.</span>--The title "king" is somewhat loosely used in this scene among the Philistines. Achish was one of the Philistine lords, perhaps the hereditary lord of Gath. Achish is called Abimelech in the title of Psalms 34, that apparently being the title, the "nomen dignitatis," of the hereditary (or elected) chief among the Philistines, like Agag among the Amalekites. It is quite possible that this Achish, although called king of Gath, was the supreme chief or king of the Philistine nation. Gath was the nearest Philistine city to the sanctuary of Nob where David then was.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David arose and fled that day.</span> The presence of Doeg at Nob was a most untoward circumstance; and though David could never have anticipated that Saul would visit upon the priests the unwitting assistance they had given him with such barbarous ferocity, yet he must have felt sure that an active pursuit would be at once instituted against himself. He therefore took a most unwise and precipitate step, but one which clearly shows the greatness of the danger to which he was exposed. For he flees to Achish, king of Gath, the first town upon the Philistine border, at the mouth of the valley of Elah (see on 1 Samuel 17:3). Achish is called Abimelech in the title of <a href="/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, written by David in grateful commemoration of his escape, that being the official title of the kings of Gath handed down through many successive centuries (see <a href="/genesis/26-1.htm">Genesis 26:1</a>). It has been objected that nothing could be more improbable than that David, the conqueror of Goliath, should seek refuge with a Philistine lord, and that this is nothing more than a popular tale, which has grown out of the real fact recorded in ch. 27. But when men are in desperate straits they take wild resolutions, and this meeting with Doeg, just after he had broken down with grief (<a href="/1_samuel/20-41.htm">1 Samuel 20:41</a>), evidently put David to his wits' end. As, moreover, Saul was degenerating into a cruel tyrant, desertions may have become not uncommon, and though only three or four years can have elapsed since the battle of Elah, as David was only about twenty-four years of age at Saul's death, yet the change from a boyish stripling to a bearded man was enough to make it possible that David might not be recognised. As for Goliath's sword, we have seen that it was not remarkable for its size, and was probably of the ordinary pattern imported from Greece. Even if recognised, Achish might welcome him as a deserter from Saul, the great enemy of the Philistines; for as a deserter never received pardon or mercy, he must now use his prowess to the very utmost against Saul. Finally, the historical truth of the narrative is vouched for by <a href="/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>, and the details are all different from those in ch. 27. David there is a powerful chieftain with a large following of trained soldiers, and feels so secure that he takes his wives with him; he asks for some place in which to reside, and occupies himself in continual forays. Here he is in the utmost distress, has no trained band of soldiers, and goes well nigh mad with mental anguish.
