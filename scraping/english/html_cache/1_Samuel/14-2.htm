The pomegranate tree is often associated with abundance and fertility in the Bible, but here it may symbolize a lack of decisive leadership. Saul's inactivity contrasts with Jonathan's proactive faith in the preceding verses. The pomegranate tree could also suggest a place of shade and rest, indicating Saul's hesitance or indecision during a critical time.<p><b>in Migron on the outskirts of Gibeah.</b><br>Migron is a location near Gibeah, Saul's hometown and the center of his early reign. The mention of Migron provides a geographical context, suggesting a strategic position near the Philistine threat. Gibeah, meaning "hill," was a significant location in Saul's life, serving as his base of operations. The proximity to Gibeah highlights Saul's connection to his roots and the tribal lands of Benjamin, emphasizing the local nature of his kingship at this point.<p><b>And the troops who were with him numbered about six hundred men,</b><br>The number six hundred is significant, as it reflects a small, perhaps insufficient, force compared to the Philistine army. This detail underscores the dire situation Israel faced and Saul's limited resources. The number also recalls previous instances in Israel's history where God delivered His people despite overwhelming odds, such as Gideon's three hundred men. This sets the stage for a demonstration of God's power and the importance of faith over numbers, a recurring theme in the biblical narrative.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Compare his later posture &#8220;under the tamarisk tree&#8221; with spear in hand, stewing in jealousy (22:6).<p>&#8226; The shade tree echoes Deborah&#8217;s judgment seat under her palm (<a href="/judges/4-5.htm">Judges 4:5</a>), but Saul offers no counsel or command; he merely lingers.<p>&#8226; His inactivity follows a pattern: earlier he delayed when Samuel had told him to wait seven days (13:8&#8211;12); now he waits when action is needed (14:18&#8211;19).<p>&#8226; The verse illustrates that spiritual leadership is measured by faith-driven movement, not comfortable positioning (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In Migron on the outskirts of Gibeah</b><p>Migron lies just north of Saul&#8217;s hometown, Gibeah (10:26).<p>&#8226; By remaining near familiar turf, Saul chooses safety over strategic advance toward the Philistine garrison at Michmash (14:5).<p>&#8226; Gibeah carries mixed memories: a place of royal beginnings (10:26) and past national shame (<a href="/judges/19-14.htm">Judges 19:14&#8211;30</a>). Staying here signals looking backward instead of forward.<p>&#8226; God often calls His people away from the edge of comfort into the field of battle&#8212;Abram leaving Haran (<a href="/genesis/12-1.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>), David stepping onto the valley floor against Goliath (17:40).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s location underscores the danger of dwelling on the margin of obedience rather than entering the center of God&#8217;s purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The troops who were with him numbered about six hundred men</b><p>Israel&#8217;s army had dwindled from 3,000 (13:2) to 600, the same number recorded right after Samuel left Saul at Gilgal (13:15).<p>&#8226; Fear, not strategy, thinned the ranks (13:6&#8211;7). Yet Jonathan&#8217;s later exploit will inspire deserting Israelites and even defected Hebrews to return (14:21&#8211;22).<p>&#8226; God often works through small remnants&#8212;Gideon&#8217;s 300 (<a href="/judges/7-6.htm">Judges 7:6&#8211;7</a>), the faithful &#8220;7000&#8221; in Elijah&#8217;s day (<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse reveals that numerical weakness cannot hinder divine victory when God&#8217;s people rely on Him (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s 600 contrasts with the Philistines&#8217; overwhelming force (13:5), stressing the need for faith rather than mere headcount (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/14-2.htm">1 Samuel 14:2</a> pictures Saul seated beneath a pomegranate tree near Gibeah with a shrinking force of 600.
