Saul feels isolated and perceives conspiracy among his servants and followers. Historically, Saul's reign was marked by increasing instability, and his mental state deteriorated as David's popularity grew. This question reveals Saul's fear and insecurity, which are common themes in his later life.<p><b>Not one of you told me that my own son had made a covenant with the son of Jesse.</b><br>Saul refers to the covenant between Jonathan, his son, and David, the son of Jesse. This covenant is a significant biblical event, highlighting Jonathan's loyalty to David despite his father's animosity. The covenant is a symbol of true friendship and loyalty, transcending familial ties. It also foreshadows the new covenant in Christ, where loyalty to God may require prioritizing spiritual kinship over biological relationships.<p><b>Not one of you has shown concern for me</b><br>Saul's lament here underscores his feeling of abandonment and lack of support from his closest advisors and servants. This reflects the cultural expectation of loyalty to the king, which Saul feels is being violated. His isolation is both a personal and political crisis, as he perceives a lack of empathy and allegiance from those around him.<p><b>or revealed to me that my son has stirred up my own servant to lie in wait against me,</b><br>Saul accuses Jonathan of inciting David against him, which is a misinterpretation of their relationship. This accusation shows Saul's distorted perception of reality, driven by jealousy and fear. Biblically, this reflects the theme of misunderstanding and miscommunication, which can lead to conflict and division. Saul's inability to see David's true intentions mirrors the spiritual blindness that can occur when one is consumed by sin.<p><b>as is the case today.&#8221;</b><br>Saul's statement indicates his belief that the threat from David is immediate and ongoing. This reflects the historical context of David's rise and Saul's decline, a period of transition in Israel's leadership. Saul's perception of David as a threat is contrasted with David's actual behavior, which is characterized by respect and restraint. This tension between perception and reality is a recurring biblical theme, illustrating the importance of discernment and trust in God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who feels betrayed and paranoid about his position and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David (son of Jesse)</a></b><br>Anointed by God to be the next king, David is seen as a threat by Saul.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan (Saul's son)</a></b><br>Loyal friend of David, who made a covenant with him, causing tension with his father, Saul.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nob.htm">Nob</a></b><br>The city where the priests were located, and where David received help, leading to Saul's wrath.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servants_of_saul.htm">The Servants of Saul</a></b><br>Those who are accused by Saul of conspiring against him by not informing him of Jonathan's covenant with David.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/paranoia_and_distrust.htm">Paranoia and Distrust</a></b><br>Saul's paranoia leads to irrational accusations and a breakdown in relationships.

paranoia fills the vacuum (<a href="/proverbs/28-1.htm">Proverbs 28:1</a>).<p>&#8226; The immediate context is Saul&#8217;s gathering of his Benjamite officials after learning that David has been helped by Ahimelech the priest (<a href="/1_samuel/22-6.htm">1 Samuel 22:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226;

the words respecting the covenant between the two being too pointed and marked to refer only to the well-known ancient friendship between the prince and the son of Jesse.<p><span class= "bld">There is none of you that is sorry for me.</span>--These words of the sad king--tormented as he was by an evil spirit, ever whispering doubt and jealous thoughts into the poor diseased mind--are here strangely real and pathetic.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/22-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Is that why all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1467;&#1500;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1462;&#1436;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(kul&#183;l&#601;&#183;&#7733;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
