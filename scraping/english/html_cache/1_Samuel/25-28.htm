In the cultural context of ancient Israel, seeking forgiveness was a significant act of humility and reconciliation. Abigail's approach reflects the biblical principle of intercession, similar to how Moses interceded for the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>). Her humility and wisdom are highlighted, serving as a type of Christ, who intercedes on behalf of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>).<p><b>for the LORD will surely make a lasting dynasty for my lord</b><br>Abigail's statement is prophetic, acknowledging God's promise to David of a lasting dynasty, which is later confirmed in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>. This promise is foundational to the Davidic Covenant, which ultimately points to the eternal reign of Jesus Christ, a descendant of David (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>). The concept of a "lasting dynasty" underscores God's faithfulness and the unfolding of His redemptive plan through history.<p><b>because he fights the LORD&#8217;s battles</b><br>David is recognized as a warrior for God, fighting not for personal gain but for the purposes of the LORD. This aligns with the biblical theme of divine warfare, where God empowers His chosen leaders to defeat His enemies (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-47</a>). David's battles prefigure the spiritual battles Christians face, as described in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, where believers are called to put on the full armor of God.<p><b>May no evil be found in you as long as you live</b><br>Abigail's blessing upon David is a call to righteousness and integrity. It reflects the biblical principle that leaders should be blameless and upright, as seen in the qualifications for church leaders in <a href="/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>. This phrase also foreshadows the sinless nature of Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of a blameless leader (<a href="/1_peter/2-22.htm">1 Peter 2:22</a>).

She seeks forgiveness, reminds David of God&#8217;s covenant, anchors his actions in divine warfare rather than personal revenge, and calls him to lifelong righteousness. Her insight keeps David from bloodshed, aligns him with God&#8217;s plan, and foreshadows the enduring dynasty ultimately fulfilled in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">The trespass of thine handmaid.</span>--Abigail again takes upon herself the wrong; the gracious act of forgiveness, of which she feels assured beforehand, she reminds David, will be shown <span class= "ital">to her. </span>Thus all the chivalry of David's character--if we may use a term which belongs to another age--was brought out by this wise and beautiful woman.<p><span class= "bld">For the Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house.</span>--Unconsciously, perhaps, without any very definite conception of their far reaching and magnificent meaning, the Israelitish lady repeats the words which she had heard perhaps in Samuel's "Naioth" by Ramah--possibly from some trained or inspired disciple of the prophet's school. She was thinking, perhaps, of the young captain then standing before her in all the pride of his early reputation, as the future hero-king of Israel, sitting on the throne of the insane and gloomy man--her evil husband's friend--King Saul, and it may be of his son reigning after him; but the unconscious prophetess, we may be sure, never dreamed of that glorious and holy One in whose person, far down the stream of ages, the Eternal would make good her words, and indeed found for that outlawed chieftain, before whom she was then kneeling, a sure house.<p><span class= "bld">The battles of the Lord.</span>--Abigail, in common with the pious Israelites of her time, looked on the wars waged by the armies of Israel against the idolatrous tribes and nations around them as the wars of Jehovah. We frequently in these early records meet with the expressions, "fighting the battle of the Lord," "the ranks of the living God," "the battle is the Lord's." We hear, too, of an ancient collection of songs--ballads, perhaps, would be a more accurate designation--now lost, entitled "The Book of the Wars of the Lord" (<a href="/numbers/21-14.htm" title="Why it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,">Numbers 21:14</a>). For several years now since his famous combat with the great champion of idolatry, Goliath, David had been the popular hero and the favourite subject of those folk-songs which ever loved to sing of these "Wars of Jehovah."<p><span class= "bld">Evil hath not been found in thee.</span>--<span class= "ital">Rauh, </span>"evil," here signifies not "wickedness," but "misfortune." The wife of Nabal means to say that all through that stormy, restless life of David's, the Lord had ever held him up. It had given him victory and crowned his efforts with splendid success; and in the later days of bitter persecution, the same invisible One had shielded him, and had turned what seemed to be the certain ruin of his prospects into a still more certain career of usefulness and popularity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Forgive the trespass of thine handmaid.</span> Reverting to her words in ver. 24, that the blame and punishment must rest on her, she now prays for forgiveness; but the intermediate words in ver. 26, emphasised in ver. 31, have raised her request to a higher level. Her prayer rests on the ground that she was saving David from a sin, and that in his thirst for vengeance he was bringing upon himself guilt. If the form of Abigail's address was most humble, the matter of it was brave and noble. <span class="cmt_word">A sure house.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> permanent prosperity (see on 1 Samuel 2:35). <span class="cmt_word">Because my lord fighteth.</span> Hebrew, "will fight." David was not fighting these battles now because he was not yet enthroned as the theocratic king. It was Saul's business at present to fight "Jehovah's battles," either in person or by his officers (<a href="/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17</a>). The words, therefore, distinctly look forward to the time when David as king will have the duty imposed upon him of protecting Jehovah's covenant people. <span class="cmt_word">Evil hath not been found in thee.</span> Hebrew, "shall not be found in thee," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when the time comes for thee to take the kingdom no one shall be able to allege against thee any offence by which thou hast lost thy title to the kingly office; nor afterwards as king shalt thou be guilty of any breach of thy duty to Jehovah, Israel's supreme Ruler, so as to incur rejection as Saul has done. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/25-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Please</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1430;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4994.htm">Strong's 4994: </a> </span><span class="str2">I pray', 'now', 'then'</span><br /><br /><span class="word">forgive</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(&#347;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5375.htm">Strong's 5375: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lift, carry, take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">your servant&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1502;&#1464;&#1514;&#1462;&#1425;&#1498;&#1464;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;m&#257;&#183;&#7791;e&#183;&#7733;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124;
