These locations were used for both legitimate worship of Yahweh and, at times, for idolatrous practices. In this context, the high place likely served as a legitimate site for worship and sacrifice, as Samuel, a prophet of God, was present. The descent from the high place into the city signifies a transition from a sacred space to a more communal setting, indicating the movement from worship to personal interaction. This movement also reflects the biblical theme of God&#8217;s presence moving from the sacred to the everyday life of His people.<p><b>Samuel spoke with Saul on the roof of his house</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, the roof of a house was often used as a place for private conversation, relaxation, and even sleeping, especially during warm weather. The flat roofs provided a secluded area away from the bustling activity of the city streets. Samuel's choice to speak with Saul on the roof suggests a desire for privacy and intimacy in their conversation. This setting underscores the importance of the message Samuel was about to convey to Saul, as it was a pivotal moment in Saul's life, marking the beginning of his journey to kingship. The rooftop conversation can be seen as a precursor to the private and personal nature of God's calling and anointing, similar to how Jesus often withdrew to solitary places to pray and communicate with His Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel is a pivotal figure in the transition from the period of judges to the establishment of the monarchy.

After sacrificial fellowship on the high place, Samuel leads Saul into the city, then onto his own roof, where prophetic conversation unfolds. The movement from public worship to private counsel emphasizes that leadership is birthed in God&#8217;s presence, confirmed through godly mentorship, and intended for service within the community.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">And when they were come down.</span>--After the public sacrificial meal at which such signal honours had been shown to the Benjamite stranger and his servant, the prophet-judge detained Saul from continuing his journey homewards, and persuaded him to remain as his guest that night at Ramah. He conducted him to the flat roof of his house, often the favourite locality in the East for quiet conversation or rest, and where frequently the honoured guest was lodged for the night: there the prophet had a long interview with his young guest, The conversation that evening probably did not turn upon the royal dignity, so soon to be conferred on Saul; of that Samuel spoke at length, we know, on the following morning. The solemn words of the old man that evening on the house-top in "Ramah of the Watchers" referred, no doubt, to the sad religious and political decline of the people of God, from which he (Samuel) had laboured, not unsuccessfully, to rescue them, "to the opposition of the heathen nations, the causes of the impotency of Israel to oppose their enemies, the necessity of a religious change in the people, and of a leader thoroughly obedient to the Lord."--Otto von Gerlach, quoted in <span class= "ital">Lange. </span>It has been suggested that this conversation was the connecting link between that on the height (<a href="/context/1_samuel/9-19.htm" title="And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up before me to the high place; for you shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let you go, and will tell you all that is in your heart.">1Samuel 9:19-20</a>) and the communication which Samuel made to Saul the following morning. The LXX. reads here, instead of "communed with Saul on the top of the house," "they strewed a couch for Saul on the top of the house, and he lay down." But the Chaldee and Syriac Versions agree with the Hebrew text. The strange LXX. variation is apparently a correction. These Greek translators could not understand a conversation of the prophet and Saul taking place in the evening, when the announcement of the crown was made so formally on the following morning. Why did Samuel not tell Saul of God's intention during that evening spent together?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - When the feast was over they went down from the high place, and, having entered the city, proceeded to Samuel's dwelling, where he <span class="cmt_word">communed with Saul upon the top of the house.</span> The Septuagint has a very probable reading, namely, "And they spread a bed for Saul upon the roof, and he lay down;" but the Syriac and Chaldee agree with the Hebrew. Without communicating to Saul that he was to be king, which was not revealed to him till the next day (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>), Samuel might be anxious to impress on Saul's mind the great principles of the theocratic government, and also the nature of the remedies necessary for Israel's recovery from its present misery. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/9-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And after they had come down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1512;&#1456;&#1491;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
