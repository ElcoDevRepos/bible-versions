This encounter takes place in the Valley of Elah, a significant location for battles between the Israelites and Philistines. David's boldness contrasts with the fear of the Israelite army, highlighting his faith and courage. This moment is pivotal, as it sets the stage for David's rise as a leader in Israel.<p><b>You come against me with sword and spear and javelin</b><br>Goliath's weaponry represents the might and technological advantage of the Philistines. The sword, spear, and javelin were standard military equipment, emphasizing Goliath's preparedness for battle. This phrase underscores the physical threat and intimidation posed by Goliath, who relies on human strength and weaponry.<p><b>but I come against you in the name of the LORD of Hosts</b><br>David's declaration shifts the focus from physical weapons to spiritual authority. "The LORD of Hosts" refers to God as the commander of heavenly armies, indicating divine power and sovereignty. This phrase reflects David's reliance on God's strength rather than human means, a recurring theme in biblical narratives where faith triumphs over might.<p><b>the God of the armies of Israel</b><br>This identifies the LORD as the protector and leader of Israel's forces. It reinforces the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God fights on behalf of His people. This connection is seen throughout the Old Testament, where God delivers Israel from their enemies when they trust in Him.<p><b>whom you have defied</b><br>Goliath's challenge is not just against Israel but against God Himself. Defiance here implies a direct affront to God's authority and honor. This echoes other biblical instances where defiance against God leads to downfall, such as Pharaoh in Exodus. David's statement highlights the spiritual battle underlying the physical confrontation, where Goliath's blasphemy against God seals his fate.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd boy, later to become King of Israel, who demonstrates profound faith and courage in confronting Goliath.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/goliath.htm">Goliath</a></b><br>A giant Philistine warrior who defies the armies of Israel and challenges them to send a champion to fight him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>An ancient people, often in conflict with Israel, representing opposition to God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>A title for God emphasizing His supreme command over the heavenly armies and His power to deliver His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_valley_of_elah.htm">The Valley of Elah</a></b><br>The location where the battle between David and Goliath takes place, symbolizing the battlegrounds of faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_over_fear.htm">Faith Over Fear</a></b><br>David's confidence in God overcomes the fear that paralyzes the Israelite army.

David shifts the confrontation from a clash of weapons to a contest of loyalties&#8212;will victory belong to flesh and blood or to the living God? By staking everything on the LORD of Hosts, David models fearless faith, exposes the emptiness of arrogant opposition, and reminds every generation that God&#8217;s honor is bound up with His people&#8217;s triumph.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 45-47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And with a shield.</span> Really, "a javelin" (see on ver. 6).
