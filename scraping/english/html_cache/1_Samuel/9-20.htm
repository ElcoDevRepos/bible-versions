The loss of donkeys would have been a significant concern for Kish, Saul's father. The mention of "three days ago" indicates a period of searching and concern, highlighting the urgency and importance of the situation. This timeframe also sets the stage for Saul's encounter with Samuel, showing divine orchestration in the timing.<p><b>do not worry about them, for they have been found</b><br>This assurance from Samuel demonstrates his prophetic insight and God's provision. It alleviates Saul's immediate concern, allowing him to focus on the more significant matters at hand. The finding of the donkeys symbolizes God's control over seemingly mundane affairs, pointing to His sovereignty and care for His people.<p><b>And upon whom is all the desire of Israel</b><br>This phrase suggests a shift from the immediate concern of the donkeys to a broader, more significant issue. "The desire of Israel" refers to the people's longing for a king, as they had requested in <a href="/1_samuel/8.htm">1 Samuel 8</a>. This desire reflects Israel's wish to be like other nations, despite God's warning about the implications of having a human king.<p><b>if not upon you and all your father&#8217;s house?</b><br>Samuel's words reveal Saul's divine appointment as the first king of Israel. This unexpected elevation from a humble background underscores God's ability to choose and use individuals according to His purposes. Saul's selection fulfills the people's desire for a king, yet it also sets the stage for the complexities of monarchy in Israel. Saul's lineage, from the tribe of Benjamin, is significant as it was the smallest tribe, highlighting God's pattern of using the least likely individuals for His plans.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The son of Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin, who is searching for his father's lost donkeys.
