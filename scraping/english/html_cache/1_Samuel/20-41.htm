The departure of the young man ensured privacy for the emotional meeting between David and Jonathan. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, such discretion was necessary to protect both David and Jonathan from Saul's wrath.<p><b>David got up from the south side of the stone</b><br>The stone, likely a large rock or landmark, served as a prearranged meeting point. The south side indicates David's position of hiding, emphasizing his fugitive status. Geographically, this setting underscores the wilderness areas where David often sought refuge from Saul.<p><b>fell facedown, and bowed three times</b><br>David's actions demonstrate deep respect and humility towards Jonathan, acknowledging Jonathan's royal status and their covenantal friendship. Bowing three times was a gesture of profound reverence, often seen in ancient Near Eastern cultures as a sign of loyalty and submission.<p><b>Then he and Jonathan kissed each other</b><br>The kiss was a customary greeting and farewell in the ancient Near East, symbolizing friendship and brotherly love. This act reflects the deep bond and covenant between David and Jonathan, transcending political alliances and familial ties.<p><b>and wept together</b><br>Their weeping signifies the emotional intensity of their friendship and the sorrow of impending separation. It also reflects the danger and uncertainty both faced due to Saul's hostility. This moment highlights the human element of biblical narratives, showing vulnerability and genuine affection.<p><b>though David wept more</b><br>David's greater weeping may indicate his awareness of the greater danger he faced as a fugitive. It also underscores his sense of loss, not only of Jonathan's companionship but also of his place at the royal court.

[The "arrow" sign would have been enough to have warned David; and had he not seen that Jonathan was alone and waiting for him, David would, from his place of hiding, have made his escape unseen.] The Chaldee here reads, "from the stone of the sign (or the stone Atha) which is on the south;" the LXX.
