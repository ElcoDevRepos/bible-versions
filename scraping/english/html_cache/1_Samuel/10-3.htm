Oaks were often used as meeting places or landmarks in ancient Israel, symbolizing strength and endurance. This particular oak may have been a well-known site for travelers. The mention of Tabor could refer to a region or a specific tree, not necessarily Mount Tabor, which is located in the northern part of Israel. The journey signifies a transition in Saul's life, moving from his private life to his public role as king.<p><b>Three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there,</b><br>Bethel, meaning "house of God," was a significant religious site in Israel's history. It was a place where patriarchs like Abraham and Jacob had encounters with God. The act of "going up to God" suggests a pilgrimage or religious duty, indicating the men's devotion. This encounter is divinely orchestrated, serving as a sign to Saul of God's guidance and confirmation of his anointing as king.<p><b>one carrying three young goats,</b><br>The three young goats could symbolize a sacrificial offering, as goats were commonly used in various sacrifices and religious rituals in Israel. The number three often signifies completeness or divine perfection in the Bible. This detail highlights the men's purpose and the sacred nature of their journey, reinforcing the theme of divine providence in Saul's path.<p><b>another carrying three loaves of bread,</b><br>Bread is a staple food and often represents sustenance and provision in biblical texts. The three loaves may symbolize the provision of God, both physically and spiritually. Bread is also significant in covenantal meals and offerings, pointing to fellowship and communion with God. This detail underscores the theme of God's provision and care for His people.<p><b>and another carrying a skin of wine.</b><br>Wine in the Bible is frequently associated with joy, celebration, and covenantal blessings. The skin of wine carried by the third man could symbolize the joy and abundance that comes from God's favor. Wine is also used in religious ceremonies, such as offerings and feasts, indicating the sacredness of the journey. This element of the narrative foreshadows the blessings and responsibilities that come with Saul's anointing as king.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The prophet who anointed Saul as the first king of Israel.

Saul&#8217;s first public encounter after anointing is with worshipers, not warriors, anchoring his reign in devotion (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Bethel (&#8220;house of God&#8221;) recalls Jacob&#8217;s ladder vision (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>; 35:1).

There was evidently a history, now lost, connected with the "terebinth of Tabor." Ewald suggests that "Tabor" is a different form for Deborah, and that this historic tree was the oak beneath which Deborah, the nurse of Rachel, was buried (<a href="/genesis/35-8.htm" title="But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.">Genesis 35:8</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Going up to God to Beth-el.</span>--This since the old patriarchal days had been a sacred spot. Samuel used to visit it as judge, and hold his court there annually, no doubt on account of the number of pilgrims who were in the habit of visiting it.

This is scarcely possible, and it is better to acknowledge that we know nothing of the site of this tree, except that it was on the road to Bethel. This was one of the places which Samuel used to visit as judge (<a href="/1_samuel/7-16.htm">1 Samuel 7:16</a>); but these men were on a pilgrimage thither because since the days of Jacob it had been a sacred spot, and a chief seat of the old patriarchal worship, for which see <a href="/1_samuel/9-12.htm">1 Samuel 9:12</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/10-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then you will go</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1495;&#1464;&#1500;&#1463;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;lap&#772;&#183;t&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
