Jonathan's initiative contrasts with his father's hesitance, showcasing his faith and courage. This event is part of a larger narrative where Israel is oppressed by the Philistines, and Jonathan's actions serve as a catalyst for a broader victory. The term "first assault" suggests a strategic and surprise attack, which is a common military tactic in ancient warfare.<p><b>Jonathan and his armor-bearer</b><br>Jonathan, a key figure in the narrative, is known for his bravery and deep faith in God. His armor-bearer, though unnamed, plays a crucial role, demonstrating loyalty and support. The relationship between a warrior and his armor-bearer was one of trust and dependence, reflecting the importance of companionship in battle. This partnership can be seen as a model of faith and action working together, reminiscent of the relationship between believers and Christ, who is our ultimate support and strength.<p><b>struck down about twenty men</b><br>The phrase highlights the effectiveness and precision of Jonathan's attack. The number twenty, while specific, also symbolizes a significant victory given the odds. This act of valor is reminiscent of other biblical accounts where God delivers victory through a few, such as Gideon's defeat of the Midianites with 300 men. It underscores the theme that God can achieve great things through those who trust in Him, regardless of their number or strength.<p><b>in about half an acre of land</b><br>The mention of "half an acre" provides a geographical context, emphasizing the confined space in which this victory occurred. This detail highlights the intensity and skill involved in the combat, as well as the miraculous nature of the victory. The small area suggests a close-quarters battle, which would have required great courage and tactical acumen. This setting serves as a reminder of how God can work powerfully in seemingly limited or constrained circumstances, much like He does in the lives of believers today.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul, known for his bravery and faith in God.

The LXX. either had here a different text before them, or else translated, as has been suggested, "conjecturally, what they did not understand;" their rendering is "about twenty men, with darts and slings and stones of the field." Ewald explains the Hebrew words as follows: "At the very beginning he strikes down about twenty men at once, <span class= "ital">as if a yoke of land were in course of being ploughed, </span>which must beware of offering opposition to the sharp ploughshare in the middle of its work." The simplest interpretation seems to be that twenty men were smitten down, one after the other, in the distance of half a rood of land. Bunsen considers this verse an extract from a poet.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Within as it were an half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.</span> The Hebrew for this long circumlocution is, "within about a half furrow of a yoke of land." The Septuagint translates, "with darts and slings and stones of the field," but the other versions give no support to this rendering. The Israelites, like most ancient nations, were accustomed to measure land by the quantity which a yoke of oxen could plough in a day, - something really less than an acre, - so that the A.V. gives the fight sense. When Jonathan made his attack, the garrison probably, not knowing bow few their assailants were, ran in confusion to the narrow tongue of land where the exit was, and getting in one another's way, were soon panic stricken and helpless. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/14-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">In that first</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;ri&#183;&#353;&#333;&#183;n&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
