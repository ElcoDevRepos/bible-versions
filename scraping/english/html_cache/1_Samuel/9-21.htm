The tribe of Benjamin was nearly wiped out in a civil war described in <a href="/judges/20.htm">Judges 20-21</a>, making its survival and continuation noteworthy. This background highlights Saul's humility and the improbability of his selection as king, given the tribe's diminished status.<p><b>from the smallest tribe of Israel,</b><br>Benjamin was indeed the smallest tribe, both in terms of population and influence, as a result of the events in Judges. This phrase underscores the theme of God choosing the unlikely or the least to fulfill His purposes, a recurring motif in Scripture, as seen with David, the youngest son of Jesse, and even Jesus, born in humble circumstances.<p><b>and is not my clan the least of all the clans of Benjamin?</b><br>Saul's reference to his clan being the least suggests a sense of insignificance and lack of prestige. This humility is contrasted with the later pride and disobedience Saul exhibits as king. It also reflects the biblical principle that God often elevates the humble, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/2-7.htm">1 Samuel 2:7-8</a>, where Hannah's prayer speaks of God raising the poor from the dust.<p><b>So why would you say such a thing to me?&#8221;</b><br>Saul's question reveals his surprise and disbelief at being chosen for a significant role. This reaction is similar to other biblical figures who expressed doubt or surprise at God's calling, such as Moses in <a href="/exodus/3-11.htm">Exodus 3:11</a> and Gideon in <a href="/judges/6-15.htm">Judges 6:15</a>.

This tribe had:<p>&#8226; Survived near-annihilation after the civil war recorded in <a href="/bsb/judges/20.htm">Judges 20&#8211;21</a>, leaving it numerically fragile.<p>&#8226; Produced courageous fighters (<a href="/1_chronicles/8-40.htm">1 Chronicles 8:40</a>) yet carried the stigma of past sin (<a href="/bsb/judges/19.htm">Judges 19&#8211;21</a>).<p>By stressing &#8220;Benjamite,&#8221; Saul highlights both his heritage and the tribe&#8217;s precarious history, underscoring how unlikely it seems that God would single him out (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From the smallest tribe of Israel</b><p>Benjamin&#8217;s numbers were drastically reduced (<a href="/judges/21-17.htm">Judges 21:17</a>), making it &#8220;the smallest tribe.&#8221; Saul&#8217;s words echo other biblical reminders that God delights to work through what appears insignificant:<p>&#8226; Israel was &#8220;the least of all peoples&#8221; when chosen (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Bethlehem, later David&#8217;s hometown, was called &#8220;little among the clans of Judah&#8221; (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>).<p>Samuel&#8217;s earlier assurance&#8212;&#8220;on whom is all the desire of Israel?&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/9-20.htm">1 Samuel 9:20</a>)&#8212;sets up a tension: the nation&#8217;s hope rests on someone from a tribe barely hanging on.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The least of all the clans of Benjamin</b><p>Within Benjamin, Saul&#8217;s family line (the clan of Matri, <a href="/1_samuel/10-21.htm">1 Samuel 10:21</a>) ranked low in prominence and wealth (<a href="/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1&#8211;4</a> hints they owned only a few donkeys). Like Gideon who protested, &#8220;my clan is the weakest&#8221; (<a href="/judges/6-15.htm">Judges 6:15</a>), Saul feels disqualified. His protest teaches that:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s calling rests on His sovereignty, not social status (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; Humility is the proper response to divine promotion (<a href="/proverbs/15-33.htm">Proverbs 15:33</a>).<p>Ironically, later failure will spring from abandoning this humility (<a href="/1_samuel/15-17.htm">1 Samuel 15:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why would you say such a thing to me?</b><p>Samuel had just revealed God&#8217;s favor (<a href="/1_samuel/9-20.htm">1 Samuel 9:20</a>).
