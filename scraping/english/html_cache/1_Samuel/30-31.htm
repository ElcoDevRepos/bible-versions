It is one of the oldest cities in the world, with archaeological evidence dating back to the early Bronze Age. Hebron was the site where Abraham settled and built an altar to the Lord (<a href="/genesis/13-18.htm">Genesis 13:18</a>). It is also where the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, along with their wives, are buried in the Cave of Machpelah. Hebron later became a Levitical city and a city of refuge (<a href="/joshua/21-13.htm">Joshua 21:13</a>). David's sending of spoils to Hebron is significant because it would later become his first capital when he was anointed king over Judah (<a href="/2_samuel/2.htm">2 Samuel 2:1-4</a>). This act of generosity may have helped solidify his support among the people of Judah.<p><b>and in all the places where David and his men had roamed</b><br>This phrase refers to the various locations where David and his men traveled during their time fleeing from King Saul. David's period of exile involved moving through the wilderness and various territories, including the Desert of Ziph, the strongholds of En Gedi, and the wilderness of Maon. These areas were often rugged and desolate, providing natural protection and concealment. David's interactions with the people in these regions, such as the Keilah and the Ziphites, were marked by both conflict and alliance. By sending gifts to these places, David was likely expressing gratitude and securing loyalty from those who had supported him during his time of need. This act of distributing spoils can be seen as a precursor to his role as a unifying leader, foreshadowing his future kingship over all Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, who at this time is leading a group of men while fleeing from King Saul.

By sending part of the Amalekite plunder to the elders of this city (<a href="/1_samuel/30-26.htm">1 Samuel 30:26</a>), David was:<p>&#8211; Acknowledging that victory came from the LORD, not from his own sword (<a href="/psalms/18-34.htm">Psalm 18:34&#8211;35</a>).<p>&#8211; Cementing loyalty among the people who would become his first subjects when Saul&#8217;s reign ended (<a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>).<p>&#8211; Modeling <a href="/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16</a>&#8212;&#8220;A man&#8217;s gift opens doors for him&#8221;&#8212;yet doing so for God-honoring fellowship, not manipulation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and in all the places</b><p>&#8226; The spoil went far beyond Hebron, reaching &#8220;all the places,&#8221; meaning every Judean village that had quietly backed David during his fugitive years (<a href="/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; This breadth shows David&#8217;s inclusive heart. He would not let one faithful supporter feel overlooked (compare <a href="/romans/12-10.htm">Romans 12:10</a>).<p>&#8226; By distributing the goods, David also fulfilled the principle later echoed in <a href="/2_corinthians/9-6.htm">2 Corinthians 9:6&#8211;8</a>: giving generously out of God&#8217;s provision brings praise to God and knits people together.<p>&#8226; The gifts preached a silent sermon: &#8220;We won because the LORD fought for us (<a href="/1_samuel/30-23.htm">1 Samuel 30:23</a>); now let His bounty strengthen you, too.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where David and his men had roamed</b><p>&#8226; For years these 600 men moved from cave to cave&#8212;Adullam, the wilderness of Ziph, En-gedi, Maon (<a href="/bsb/1_samuel/22.htm">1 Samuel 22&#8211;24</a>), even Philistine Ziklag (<a href="/1_samuel/27-1.htm">1 Samuel 27:1&#8211;7</a>).

It is now called El-Khalil ("friend of God"), owing to Abraham's residence there. During the early years of David's rule, which followed the death of Saul, Hebron was the residence and royal city of David. Beneath the building of the present Mosque of Hebron is the famous Cave of Machpelah, where Abraham and Sarah and the patriarchs Isaac and Jacob, and his wife Leah, are buried.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hebron</span>, destined soon to become David's capital (<a href="/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1</a>), lay about fourteen miles south of Jerusalem.

Such were Ira and Gareb, Ithrites from Jattir, Shama and Jehiel from Aroer; perhaps also Zabdi the Shiphmite (<a href="/1_chronicles/27-27.htm">1 Chronicles 27:27</a>) came from Siphmoth. We find David in this narrative acting justly as a soldier, generously to those who had been kind to him in his wanderings, and forming friendships which he retained and cherished long afterwards, when from being a fugitive he had become a king. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/30-31.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">to those</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;la&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-l &#124;
