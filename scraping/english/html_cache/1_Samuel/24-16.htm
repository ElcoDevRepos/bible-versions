This act of grace is significant in the biblical narrative, highlighting David's respect for God's anointed king despite Saul's pursuit to kill him. David's speech to Saul emphasizes his innocence and loyalty, contrasting with Saul's unjust actions. This moment foreshadows the New Testament teaching of loving one's enemies (<a href="/matthew/5-44.htm">Matthew 5:44</a>).<p><b>Saul called back</b><br>Saul's response indicates a moment of vulnerability and recognition of David's righteousness. This interaction occurs in the wilderness of En Gedi, a rugged area near the Dead Sea, known for its caves and strongholds. Saul's acknowledgment of David's voice signifies a temporary softening of his heart, a rare moment of clarity amidst his jealousy and paranoia.<p><b>&#8220;Is that your voice, David my son?&#8221;</b><br>Saul's use of "my son" reflects a complex relationship. Although Saul is David's father-in-law, his pursuit of David has been relentless. This phrase suggests a momentary return to familial affection and a recognition of David's rightful place. It echoes the earlier relationship they shared, where David was a favored member of Saul's court (<a href="/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21</a>).<p><b>Then Saul wept aloud</b><br>Saul's weeping indicates a deep emotional response, possibly a mix of regret, shame, and realization of his own failings. This public display of emotion contrasts with his usual kingly demeanor and suggests an internal conflict. Saul's tears can be seen as a moment of repentance, though not leading to lasting change. This scene parallels other biblical instances where individuals are confronted with their sin, such as Peter's weeping after denying Christ (<a href="/luke/22-62.htm">Luke 22:62</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who is currently fleeing from King Saul.

He knows the voice that just spared him (see <a href="/1_samuel/18-1.htm">1 Samuel 18:1-2</a> for earlier affection).<p>&#8226; Calling David &#8220;my son&#8221; echoes Saul&#8217;s earlier pledge at Ramah (<a href="/1_samuel/19-6.htm">1 Samuel 19:6</a>) yet contrasts with his murderous pursuit (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment exposes Saul&#8217;s conflicted heart&#8212;acknowledging David&#8217;s righteousness while still clinging to his throne (compare <a href="/luke/6-27.htm">Luke 6:27-28</a> for loving enemies).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then Saul wept aloud</b><p>&#8226; The weeping is loud, public, and emotional&#8212;signaling conviction. Saul realizes he has sinned against an innocent man (<a href="/1_samuel/24-17.htm">1 Samuel 24:17-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet his tears, unlike David&#8217;s later godly sorrow (<a href="/bsb/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>), do not lead to lasting repentance; Saul will again chase David (<a href="/1_samuel/26-1.htm">1 Samuel 26:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture illustrates that temporary remorse, though intense, is not the same as a surrendered heart (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David&#8217;s restraint and faith place Saul face-to-face with his own guilt. Saul recognizes David&#8217;s voice, calls him &#8220;my son,&#8221; and weeps, but the tears reveal conviction without true change. The verse underscores God&#8217;s justice, the power of mercy, and the difference between momentary remorse and genuine repentance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">These words.</span>--L. Philippson (in the Israelitish Bible, Leipzig) sums up strikingly the general effect of David's moving but natural words to Saul. "This appeal possesses so much natural eloquence, such warmth, such true earnestness, that no one who has any love for the simple beauties of the Bible can read it unmoved. There is a striking grandeur, too, in the whole scene. We see David standing on some peak in this wilderness of rocks, holding up the trophy of his romantic generosity, gazing at and addressing the melancholy Saul, whom he loved as a father, paid homage to as a king, and reverenced as the Lord's Anointed, but who, for his part, hated him without a cause, and hunted him down with a restless, murderous zeal; and (as David stood there and gazed on Saul) he seized the opportunity, and tried to touch his royal enemy's heart with words, hurried, indeed, and quickly spoken, but breathing the intense earnestness of his inward feeling. He was overwhelmed with the consciousness of a sorrow too deep for words, yet he spoke as one inspired with the knowledge of a noble deed just done."<p><span class= "bld">And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</span>--And for a time the words, but still more the forbearance, of David in the cave touched Saul to the quick. He not only spoke kindly to the hated David, but even wept. There is nothing strange in this sudden change of feeling in one so nervous and excitable as was Saul. It is clear that for the moment Saul meant to alter his conduct to David, but the sad sequel shows that the impression made was only transitory; and David, by his conduct, clearly saw this, for he made--as the last verse of the chapter shows us--no effort to return to his old home and position with Saul, but maintained his independent, though precarious, position as an outlaw.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - This address of David produced a lively effect upon Saul. Philippson says of it, "The speech of David has so much natural eloquence, such warmth and persuasiveness, that it can be read by no one who has any feeling for the simple beauties of the Bible without emotion. The whole situation, moreover, has much of sublimity about it. We see David, standing on the summit of some rock in the wilderness, raising on high the trophy of his magnanimity, while addressing the melancholy Saul, whom he loved as a father, obeyed as king, and honoured as the Lord's anointed, but who nevertheless hated him without reason, and followed him with unremitting energy to put him to death; using his opportunity of touching the heart of his enemy with words hurried, but expressive of his innermost feelings, and showing himself full of humility, oppressed by unutterable sorrows, bowed down by the feeling of his powerlessness, yet inspirited by the consciousness of a noble deed." So affected is Saul by David's words that he breaks into tears, affectionately addresses David as his son, and acknowledges his innocence and the uprightness of his cause. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/24-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1431;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had finished</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#7733;al&#183;l&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124;
