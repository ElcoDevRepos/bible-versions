The role of an armor-bearer was to carry the king's armor and assist him in battle, indicating a position of trust and loyalty. This moment highlights Saul's vulnerability and the breakdown of his leadership.<p><b>&#8220;Draw your sword and run me through with it,</b><br>Saul requests his armor-bearer to kill him to avoid capture. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern honor-shame culture, where being captured by enemies was seen as a fate worse than death. Saul's request also shows his fear of humiliation and torture at the hands of the Philistines.<p><b>or these uncircumcised men will come and run me through and torture me!&#8221;</b><br>The term "uncircumcised" is used to describe the Philistines, emphasizing their status as non-covenant people, contrasting them with the Israelites who were marked by the covenant of circumcision. This highlights the religious and cultural enmity between the two groups. Saul's fear of torture underscores the brutal practices of ancient warfare.<p><b>But his armor-bearer was terrified and refused to do it.</b><br>The armor-bearer's refusal can be seen as an act of reverence for the king, as well as fear of the consequences of killing the Lord's anointed. This reflects the deep respect for God's chosen leaders, despite Saul's failures. It also shows the moral dilemma faced by those serving under flawed leadership.<p><b>So Saul took his own sword and fell on it.</b><br>Saul's suicide marks a tragic end to his reign, fulfilling Samuel's prophecy of his downfall. This act of self-destruction is a culmination of Saul's disobedience and rejection by God. It contrasts with the hope and redemption found in Jesus Christ, who, unlike Saul, was obedient unto death and brought life through His sacrifice. Saul's death also sets the stage for David's rise to kingship, aligning with God's sovereign plan for Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Even David, hunted by Saul, would not raise a hand against the king.<p>&#8226; Fear also grips him: to kill the king could be viewed as regicide, drawing severe consequences (<a href="/2_samuel/4-10.htm">2 Samuel 4:10-12</a>).<p>&#8226; His terror stands in contrast to Jonathan&#8217;s armor-bearer, who once acted with bold faith (<a href="/1_samuel/14-13.htm">1 Samuel 14:13</a>).

Every detail underscores themes already woven through the book&#8212;God&#8217;s prophetic word stands, reverence for the Lord&#8217;s anointed matters, and human attempts to control outcomes end in futility when hearts stray from obedience. The verse serves as a sobering reminder that true security lies not in swords or human honor but in humble submission to the Lord who keeps His word without fail.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">His armourbearer.</span>--Jewish tradition tells us that this faithful armourbearer was Doeg<span class= "ital">, </span>the Edomite, and that the sword which Saul took apparently from the hand of the armourbearer was the sword with which Doeg had massacred the priests at Gibeon and at Nob.<p><span class= "bld">Lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me.</span>--"Even in Saul's dying speech there is something of that religious formalism which marked his character after his fall from God, and which is a striking sign of spiritual blindness. He censures the Philistines as 'uncircumcised.'"--<span class= "ital">Wordsworth.</span><p>Saul had a strong consciousness of the sacredness of his person as the Lord's anointed; as it has been well said of him, no descendant of a long line of so-styled Christian or Catholic sovereigns has held a loftier claim of personal inviolability.<p><span class= "bld">And abuse me.</span>--He remembered how these same Philistines in former years had treated the hero Samson when he fell into their hands.<p><span class= "bld">His armourbearer would not.</span>--Love and devotion to his master we can well imagine stayed his hand from carrying out his fallen master's last terrible command. If the armourbearer--as the Jewish tradition above referred to asserts--was indeed Doeg the Edomite, the two, the king and his confidential officer, had been fast friends for years. Some dread of the after consequences, too, may have weighed with the royal armour-bearer, as he was to a certain extent responsible for the king's life. What possibly he dreaded actually came to pass in the case of the Amalekite who told David that he was the one who inflicted the fatal stroke when the king was dying; as a guerdon for his act, David had him at once put to death for having put forth his hand to destroy the Lord's anointed.<p><span class= "bld">A sword.</span>--It was a heavy weapon, a war sword, answering to the great <span class= "ital">epee d'armes </span>of the Middle Ages. This he took from the reluctant hands of his faithful follower, and placing the hilt firmly on the ground, he threw the weight of his body on the point.<p>In <a href="/context/2_samuel/1-6.htm" title="And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance on mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned on his spear; and, see, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.">2Samuel 1:6-10</a> we have another account of the death. There an Amalekite bearing the royal insignia of the late king, the crown royal and the well-known bracelet of Saul, comes to David at Ziklag after the fatal fight, and recounts how, finding the king leaning on his spear--possibly, as Bunsen supposes, "lying on the ground propping his weary head with the nervously-clutched spear," exhausted and seized with "cramp" (this is the Rabbinical translation of the word rendered "anguish"), at his urgent request, slew him. Most commentators--for instance, Kiel, Lange, Bishop Hervey, &c.--regard the Amalekite's story as an invention framed to extract a rich gift from David, who, the savage Arab thought, would be rejoiced to hear of his great enemy's fall. If this be so, then we must suppose that the Amalekite wandering over the field of battle strewn with the slain on the night which succeeded the battle, came upon the body of Saul, and, attracted by the glitter of the golden ornaments, stripped off the precious insignia, and hastened with his lying story to David. Ewald, however, sees no reason to doubt the trustworthiness of the Amalekite's story; in fact, the two accounts may well be harmonised. Stanley graphically paints the scene <span class= "ital">after </span>he had fallen on his sword, and his faithful armourbearer had in despairing sorrow killed himself also. "His armourbearer lies dead beside him; on his head the royal crown, on his arm the royal bracelet; . . . the huge spear is still in his hand; he is leaning peacefully on it. He has received his death-blow either from the enemy (<a href="/1_samuel/31-3.htm" title="And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.">1Samuel 31:3</a>), or from his own sword (<a href="/1_samuel/31-4.htm" title="Then said Saul to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armor bearer would not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell on it.">1Samuel 31:4</a>). The dizziness and darkness of death is upon him. At that moment a wild Amalekite, lured probably to the field by the hope of spoil, came up and finished the work which the arrows of the Philistines and the sword of Saul himself had all but accomplished."--<span class= "ital">Jewish Church, </span>Lect. 21. The words of the next verse (5) do not contradict this possible explanation. The armourbearer, seeing the king pierced with the arrows and then falling on his own sword, may well have imagined his master dead, and so put an end to his own life. But Saul, though mortally wounded, may have rallied again for a brief space; in that brief space the Amalekite may have come up and finished the bloody work; then, after the king was dead, he probably stripped the royal insignia from the lifeless corpse. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/31-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
