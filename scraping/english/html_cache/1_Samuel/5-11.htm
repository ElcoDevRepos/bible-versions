The Philistines were a seafaring people who settled along the coastal regions of Canaan. The gathering of all the rulers indicates a significant crisis, as the Philistines were typically independent in their city governance. This unity among the rulers underscores the severity of the situation caused by the presence of the Ark of the Covenant.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Send away the ark of the God of Israel.</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant, representing the presence and power of Yahweh, had been captured by the Philistines in battle. However, instead of bringing them victory and blessing, it brought calamity. The Philistines recognized the Ark as belonging to the God of Israel, acknowledging His power even as they worshiped their own deities. This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over all nations and His ability to demonstrate His power to those who do not worship Him.<p><b>It must return to its place,</b><br>The Philistines desired to send the Ark back to Israel, recognizing that it did not belong among them. This phrase highlights the concept of sacred space and the importance of the Ark's rightful place among God's people. The Ark was central to Israel's worship and covenant relationship with God, symbolizing His presence and guidance.<p><b>so that it will not kill us and our people!&#8221;</b><br>The Philistines were experiencing severe afflictions, which they attributed to the presence of the Ark. This fear of death and destruction reflects the biblical understanding of God's holiness and the consequences of His presence being mishandled or disrespected. The Philistines' plea to send the Ark away shows their desperation and acknowledgment of the divine power at work.<p><b>For a deadly confusion had pervaded the city;</b><br>The term "deadly confusion" suggests chaos and panic among the people of Ekron. This could refer to a plague or other calamity that caused widespread fear and disorder. The biblical narrative often associates such confusion with divine judgment, as seen in other instances where God intervenes directly in human affairs.<p><b>the hand of God was very heavy upon it.</b><br>The "hand of God" is a biblical metaphor for His power and judgment. The heaviness of God's hand indicates the severity of the affliction experienced by the Philistines. This phrase emphasizes God's active role in the events, demonstrating His authority and the consequences of opposing Him. It serves as a reminder of God's justice and the reality of His intervention in the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A group of people who were enemies of Israel and had captured the Ark of the Covenant, believing it would bring them power and victory.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_the_god_of_israel.htm">Ark of the God of Israel</a></b><br>The sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence and covenant with Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/rulers_of_the_philistines.htm">Rulers of the Philistines</a></b><br>Leaders of the Philistine cities who were responsible for making decisions regarding the Ark after experiencing God's judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/city_of_ekron.htm">City of Ekron</a></b><br>One of the five major Philistine cities where the Ark was brought, leading to panic and suffering among the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hand_of_god.htm">The Hand of God</a></b><br>A metaphor for God's power and judgment, which was evident in the plagues and confusion that afflicted the Philistines.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The Philistines' experience with the Ark demonstrates that God's power cannot be manipulated or controlled by human hands.

The Philistines do so, but only externally.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/5-11.htm">1 Samuel 5:11</a> shows pagan leaders bowing&#8212;however reluctantly&#8212;to the undeniable authority of Israel&#8217;s God. Their council, plan, fear, chaos, and suffering all highlight one truth: when God&#8217;s holiness is violated, His heavy hand acts in judgment. The only safe response is to let God be God&#8212;return what is His, honor His rule, and seek mercy rather than merely relief.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Send away the ark.</span>--The lords of the Philistines were a long time before they could make up their minds to get rid of this deadly trophy of their victory. They had grown up with an undefined awe of the "golden chest," which, as they supposed, had so often in the days of the famous Hebrew conqueror, Joshua, led the armies of Israel to victory; and now at last it was their own. It was indeed a sore trouble for them to yield it up to their enemies again; to see the historical sacred treasure of Israel, so long veiled in awful mystery, at the feet of their fish-god idol, was a perpetual renewal for Philistia of the glorious triumph of Aphek, which avenged so many years of bitter humiliation. The plague and misery which afflicted the cities of Philistia in the day when the sacred Ark dwelt an unhonoured guest in their midst suggest many and grave thoughts. Is there not an unseen power ever protecting God's institutions, His ordinances, and His ritual, the sacred House dedicated to His solemn worship, the vessels of the sanctuary, the very lands and gold consecrated to His service, even though all these things, owing to the faults and errors of His servants, have lost apparently their holy and beneficial influence over the hearts and homes of men?<p>Does not this old loved story warn rash and careless souls against laying rough hands on <span class= "ital">any </span>ark of the Lord, though the ark in question <span class= "ital">seem </span>to be abandoned by God, and destitute of power and dignity?<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/5-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then [the Ekronites] assembled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1488;&#1463;&#1505;&#1456;&#1508;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#183;&#8217;as&#183;p&#772;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
