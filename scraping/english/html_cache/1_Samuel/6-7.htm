The use of a "new cart" signifies respect and reverence, ensuring that the cart was not previously used for mundane purposes. This reflects the biblical principle of offering God the best and the first, as seen in offerings and sacrifices throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>with two milk cows that have never been yoked</b><br>Milk cows, or cows that have recently calved, are typically not used for pulling carts, especially if they have never been yoked. This choice was intentional to demonstrate that the return of the Ark was an act of God, as these cows would naturally resist leaving their calves. The use of animals that have never been yoked also symbolizes purity and a new beginning, similar to the unblemished animals required for sacrifices.<p><b>Hitch the cows to the cart</b><br>This instruction was a test to see if the cows would act contrary to their nature. If they did, it would confirm that the calamities the Philistines experienced were indeed from the God of Israel. The act of hitching the cows to the cart is reminiscent of the yoke of Christ, which is easy and light, as mentioned in <a href="/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29-30</a>, symbolizing submission to divine will.<p><b>but take their calves away and pen them up</b><br>Separating the cows from their calves was a further test of divine intervention. Naturally, the cows would seek to return to their calves, but if they proceeded towards Israel, it would be a sign of God's hand at work. This separation can also be seen as a type of sacrifice, where something valuable is given up for a greater purpose, paralleling the sacrificial system and ultimately pointing to Christ's sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>The Philistines were a group of people who were often in conflict with the Israelites.

Purity in the objects that bear God&#8217;s presence matters (<a href="/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3</a> shows Israel later imitating this very practice).<p>&#8211; Practically, a sturdy, unused cart ensured the ark and the guilt offering would arrive safely without risk from worn equipment. God&#8217;s directives are both spiritually symbolic and practically wise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Two milk cows that have never been yoked</b><p>&#8211; Milk cows were gentle and strong, yet &#8220;have never been yoked.&#8221; They had no training to pull together. In normal circumstances they would resist the yoke or turn back to their calves.<p>&#8211; By choosing such unlikely animals, the Philistines set up a clear test: if these inexperienced cows, with no human driver, head straight toward Israel, God Himself is directing them. This echoes Gideon&#8217;s fleece in <a href="/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36&#8211;40</a>&#8212;another divinely permitted sign to settle doubt.<p>&#8211; Scripture often pairs &#8220;never yoked&#8221; with purity for special sacrifice (<a href="/numbers/19-2.htm">Numbers 19:2</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-3.htm">Deuteronomy 21:3</a>). Here it underlines that the journey of the ark is under divine, not human, control.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Hitch the cows to the cart</b><p>&#8211; The priests tell them to act on faith: hitch the untrained cows and let them go. Like Moses lifting his staff over the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-16.htm">Exodus 14:16</a>), obedience precedes the miracle.<p>&#8211; The scene foreshadows <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>&#8212;offering bodies as living sacrifices. The cows, pulled from ordinary life, become instruments in God&#8217;s plan.<p>&#8211; It also contrasts sharply with the later tragedy of Uzzah (<a href="/2_samuel/6-6.htm">2 Samuel 6:6&#8211;7</a>). There, failure to respect God&#8217;s precise instructions brought judgment. Here, meticulous obedience brings revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Take their calves away and pen them up</b><p>&#8211; Removing the calves heightens the test. Instinct would draw milk cows back to their young. If they head toward Israel anyway, only God could override that maternal pull (<a href="/1_samuel/6-12.htm">1 Samuel 6:12</a> explicitly records the cows going straight on the road, lowing all the way).<p>&#8211; The separation echoes Abraham placing Isaac on the altar (<a href="/genesis/22-9.htm">Genesis 22:9&#8211;12</a>). Sacrificial surrender often involves what is closest to the heart.<p>&#8211; It also anticipates Jesus&#8217; call in <a href="/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a> to love Him more than family ties. God sometimes asks for what we hold dearest to display His supremacy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/6-7.htm">1 Samuel 6:7</a> sets up a deliberate, observable test to prove the Lord&#8217;s hand in returning the ark. A brand-new cart, unyoked milk cows, and the removal of their calves combine to make any natural explanation impossible. When the cows walk straight to Israel, even pagan observers must acknowledge that &#8220;the LORD is the one who struck us&#8221; (v. 9). The verse teaches that God&#8217;s holiness demands purity, His instructions deserve exact obedience, and His power overrules the strongest natural instincts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Now therefore make a new cart.</span>--The note here in the <span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary </span>is interesting.

The transposition of the A.V. throws undue stress upon the verb <span class="accented">make</span>, whereas the Hebrew simply means that both the cart was to be new, and the heifers untrained and unbroken to the yoke. Both these were marks of reverence. Nothing was to be employed in God's service which had been previously used for baser purposes (comp. <a href="/mark/11-2.htm">Mark 11:2</a>). No animal was deemed fit for sacrifice which had laboured in the field. The separation of the kine from their calves was for the purpose of demonstrating whether the plague after all was supernatural, and it is remarkable what great care the Philistine priests take against confounding the extraordinary with the Divine. If, however, the kine act in a manner contrary to nature, their last doubt will be removed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/6-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now, therefore,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1506;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8216;at&#183;t&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
