The number "thirty" is often used symbolically in the Bible to denote maturity and readiness for leadership, as seen with Joseph (<a href="/genesis/41-46.htm">Genesis 41:46</a>) and David (<a href="/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4</a>). Saul's anointing as king marked a significant transition for Israel from a theocracy led by judges to a monarchy. This period was characterized by the Israelites' desire to be like other nations (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>), despite God's warnings through Samuel. Saul's kingship was a response to this demand, and his age at ascension suggests a time of vigor and potential for leadership.<p><b>and he reigned over Israel forty-two years</b><br>The duration of Saul's reign is debated due to textual variations. <a href="/acts/13-21.htm">Acts 13:21</a> mentions Saul's reign lasting forty years, which aligns with the general understanding of his rule. The number forty often symbolizes a period of testing or judgment in the Bible, as seen in the Israelites' forty years in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-33.htm">Numbers 14:33-34</a>) and Jesus' forty days of fasting (<a href="/matthew/4-2.htm">Matthew 4:2</a>). Saul's reign was marked by initial successes but ultimately characterized by disobedience to God, leading to his rejection as king (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26</a>). His reign set the stage for David, a type of Christ, who would establish a kingdom reflecting God's covenant promises. Saul's leadership serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of obedience and faithfulness to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Saul steps into kingship at the prime age of thirty, receives a substantial forty-two-year mandate, and becomes a living lesson in the blessings of obedience and the perils of self-reliance. The verse reminds believers that the Lord appoints leaders, measures their days, and weaves even imperfect reigns into His flawless redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(1) <span class= "bld">Saul reigned one year.</span>--The only possible literal translation of the Hebrew of this verse is, "Saul was the son of one year (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>one year old); he began to reign, &c." In several places in the Books of Samuel the numbers are quite untrustworthy (we have another instance of this in the 5th verse of this chapter). The present verse, however, is an old difficulty, the corruption or gap in the text dating from a far back period. The English translation is simply a probable, but conjectural, paraphrase. The Chaldee and some of the Rabbis thus strangely interpret it: "Saul was an innocent child when he began to reign"--that is, was as innocent as a one year old child, &c. The Syriac and others paraphrase much as our English Version. The LXX. omit the verse altogether. The <span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary </span>thus literally translates the Hebrew, marking with a--where a number probably originally stood: "Saul was--years old when he began to reign, and he reigned--and two years over Israel." On the whole, the usually accepted meaning is that Saul had reigned one year when the events related in the last chapter took place, and after he had reigned two years he chose out the 3,000 men, and did what is related in this chapter.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Saul's age and length of reign. <span class="cmt_word">Saul reigned one year</span>. This verse literally translated is, "Saul was one year old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years over Israel." In its form it exactly follows the usual statement prefixed to each king's reign, of his age at his accession, and the years of his kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/2-10.htm">2 Samuel 2:10</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4</a>; <a href="/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="/1_kings/22-42.htm">1 Kings 22:42</a>, etc.). The rendering of the A.V. is too forced and untenable to be worth discussing. As we have seen before, the numerals in the Books of Samuel are not trustworthy; but the difficulty here is an old one. The Vulgate translates the Hebrew literally, as we have given it; the Septuagint omits the verse, and the Syriac paraphrases as boldly as the A.V.: "When Saul had reigned one or two years." The Chaldee renders, "Saul was as innocent as a one-year-old child when he began to reign." In the Hexaplar version some anonymous writer has inserted the word <span class="accented">thirty</span>, rashly enough; for as Jonathan was old enough to have an important command (ver. 2), and was capable of the acts of a strong man (<a href="/1_samuel/14-14.htm">1 Samuel 14:14</a>), his father's age must have been at least thirty-five, and perhaps was even more. As regards the length of Saul's reign, St. Paul makes it forty years (<a href="/acts/13-21.htm">Acts 13:21</a>), exactly the same as that of David (<a href="/1_kings/2-11.htm">1 Kings 2:11</a>) and of Solomon (<a href="/1_kings/11-42.htm">1 Kings 11:42</a>); and Josephus testifies that such was the traditional belief of the Jews ('Antiq.,' 6:14, 9). On the other hand, it is remarkable that the word here for <span class="accented">years</span> is that used where the whole number is less than ten. The events, however, recorded in the rest of the book seem to require a longer period than ten years for the duration of Saul's reign; thirty-two would be a more probable number, and, added to the seven and a half years' reign of Ishbosheth (see <a href="/2_samuel/5-5.htm">2 Samuel 5:5</a>), they would make up the whole sum of forty years ascribed by St. Paul to Saul's dynasty. It is quite possible, however, that these forty years may even include the fifteen or sixteen years of Samuel's judgeship. But the two facts, that all the three sons of Saul mentioned in <a href="/1_samuel/14-49.htm">1 Samuel 14:49</a> were old enough to go with him to the battle of Mount Gilboa, where they were slain; and that Ishbosheth, his successor, was forty years of age when his father died, effectually dispose of the idea that Saul's was a very short reign.
