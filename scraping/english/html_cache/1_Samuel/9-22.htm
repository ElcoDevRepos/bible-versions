Samuel's role as a prophet and judge in Israel is significant, as he acts as God's representative. Saul, who is from the tribe of Benjamin, is being introduced to a new phase in his life, which will lead to his anointing as the first king of Israel. The presence of Saul's servant underscores the social norms of the time, where servants often accompanied their masters.<p><b>brought them into the hall</b><br>The hall likely refers to a place of gathering, possibly a dining area or a place for communal meetings. This setting indicates a formal occasion, suggesting that Samuel had planned this event with a specific purpose. The hall could be part of a larger complex used for religious or social gatherings, reflecting the communal nature of Israelite society.<p><b>and seated them in the place of honor</b><br>Seating Saul in the place of honor signifies his future role and the respect Samuel is showing him. In ancient Near Eastern culture, seating arrangements were a reflection of status and honor. This act foreshadows Saul's impending kingship and the divine selection that Samuel is about to reveal. It also demonstrates Samuel's recognition of God's choice, despite Saul's humble beginnings.<p><b>among those who were invited</b><br>The invited guests likely included elders, leaders, or other significant figures in the community. This gathering serves as a witness to the events unfolding, providing a communal acknowledgment of Saul's new role. The presence of these witnesses is important for the legitimacy of Saul's anointing and future reign.<p><b>about thirty in all</b><br>The number thirty may not have specific symbolic significance but indicates a sizable group, enough to represent the community or leadership. This detail emphasizes the public nature of the event and the importance of communal validation in ancient Israelite society.

This is more than courtesy; it signals God&#8217;s sovereign choice already revealed to Samuel earlier that day (<a href="/1_samuel/9-15.htm">1 Samuel 9:15-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul has not come seeking kingship&#8212;he is looking for lost donkeys&#8212;yet the Lord reaches for him first, echoing Jesus&#8217; words, &#8220;You did not choose Me, but I chose you&#8221; (<a href="/john/15-16.htm">John 15:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The inclusion of Saul&#8217;s servant underscores that when God calls, He graciously gathers all who are connected, much like Joshua assuring &#8220;as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Brought them into the hall</b><p>&#8226; The hall is a banquet room attached to the high place (<a href="/1_samuel/9-12.htm">1 Samuel 9:12-13</a>). In Scripture, entering a prepared meal often signifies fellowship with God&#8212;think of <a href="/psalms/23-5.htm">Psalm 23:5</a>, &#8220;You prepare a table before me,&#8221; or Jesus dining with Zacchaeus (<a href="/luke/19-5.htm">Luke 19:5-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul moves from the ordinary task of looking for animals to sharing in sacred fellowship, illustrating <a href="/revelation/3-20.htm">Revelation 3:20</a>: &#8220;If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in and dine with him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The moment anticipates Saul&#8217;s anointing in the next chapter (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>); before public appointment comes private communion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and seated them in the place of honor</b><p>&#8226; Samuel assigns Saul the chief seat. <a href="/proverbs/18-16.htm">Proverbs 18:16</a> explains, &#8220;A man&#8217;s gift makes room for him and brings him before great men,&#8221; and <a href="/luke/14-10.htm">Luke 14:10</a> advises, &#8220;Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The seat foreshadows Saul&#8217;s royal role. Though Saul feels insignificant (<a href="/1_samuel/9-21.htm">1 Samuel 9:21</a>), God exalts the humble&#8212;precisely as Hannah had prayed, &#8220;He raises the poor from the dust &#8230; to seat them with princes&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Honor here is God-given, not self-sought. By seating Saul first, Samuel publicly affirms what God privately declared.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>among those who were invited&#8212;about thirty in all</b><p>&#8226; The invited group, roughly thirty, forms reliable witnesses, paralleling &#8220;every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Thirty companions at a feast recall Samson&#8217;s wedding (<a href="/judges/14-11.htm">Judges 14:11</a>) and Jesus&#8217; banquet with Levi (<a href="/luke/5-29.htm">Luke 5:29</a>); both scenes mark turning points in leadership callings.<p>&#8226; The number is small enough for intimacy but large enough for recognition. God&#8217;s works are often unveiled in everyday settings before ordinary people, so none can claim the event was hidden or manipulated.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/9-22.htm">1 Samuel 9:22</a> shows Samuel intentionally guiding Saul from anonymity to honor. By taking Saul, bringing him into the hall, seating him foremost, and doing so before thirty witnesses, God publicly signals His choice of Israel&#8217;s first king. The verse teaches that divine calling originates with God, is affirmed in fellowship, is marked by honor that God Himself bestows, and is witnessed in community.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">And Samuel took Saul.</span>--The seer gave Saul no answer to this question, in which the young man's wonderment was expressed that one so insignificant should be chosen for so high a destiny. Samuel merely wished, in the first instance, to awaken new and grander thoughts and aspirations in this young heart, and without reply he proceeded to conduct his guests to the scene of the sacrifice on the high place. In the guest-chamber, where thirty of the most distinguished persons present at the solemn sacrifice were assembled. Samuel places Saul and his companion, no doubt to their great surprise, in the principal seats. "The parlour" is an unfortunate rendering of the Hebrew word here, which signifies the "cell," or "chamber" attached to the building on the high place, for such purposes as the present. These solemn sacrificial meals were the usual adjuncts of a solemn sacrifice.<p>Not only was Saul thus highly honoured in public as the future king, but his servant also. If, as tradition tells us, this servant was Doeg the Edomite, he, too, on this occasion had a foretaste of his future position, an earnest of the rank and power which he would receive when one of Saul's great officers of state.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 22, 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Into the parlour</span>. Strictly the cell or room attached to the chapel of the high place, now used as the <span class="accented">guest chamber</span>, wherein the thirty chief men, who came as invited guests, were to dine. The rest of the people would be in the open air. There Samuel not only placed Saul in the seat of honour, but also his servant, as representing the king's officers of state, and commanded the cook to set before him a <span class="cmt_word">portion</span> that had been reserved. This was the shoulder; but whether it was the left shoulder, of which the laity might eat, or the right shoulder, which was sacred, as belonging to the priest (<a href="/leviticus/7-32.htm">Leviticus 7:32</a>), is not mentioned. If the latter, it was Samuel s own share, and he may by his prophetic authority have assigned it to Saul, in token that the priesthood would be subject to the royal power. Be this, however, as it may, it was the portion of honour, and it seems that Samuel, on receiving intimation the previous day of Saul's visit (ver. 6), had given orders that it should be carefully reserved for him (ver. 24). He now orders it to be set before Saul, with that <span class="cmt_word">which was upon it,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> all the flesh and the fat not appointed to be burnt upon the altar. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/9-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Samuel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1461;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;m&#363;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8050.htm">Strong's 8050: </a> </span><span class="str2">Samuel -- 'name of God', a prophet of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1468;&#1463;&#1444;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;qa&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
