In the ancient Near Eastern context, sending a message through a messenger was a common practice for kings and leaders. This action shows Saul's authority and the importance of the message. Saul's communication with Jesse highlights the familial and tribal connections that were significant in Israelite society. Jesse, being from Bethlehem, is part of the tribe of Judah, which holds prophetic significance as the tribe from which the Messiah would come (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Let David remain in my service,</b><br>David had already been introduced to Saul's court as a skilled harpist to soothe Saul's troubled spirit (<a href="/1_samuel/16-14.htm">1 Samuel 16:14-23</a>). This phrase indicates Saul's desire to keep David close, recognizing his value beyond just musical talent. The term "service" suggests a role of servitude and loyalty, which is significant in understanding David's early relationship with Saul. This period in David's life serves as preparation for his future kingship, illustrating God's providential guidance. David's service to Saul can be seen as a type of Christ, who came to serve and not to be served (<a href="/mark/10-45.htm">Mark 10:45</a>).<p><b>for I am pleased with him.&#8221;</b><br>Saul's pleasure with David is noteworthy, as it reflects David's favor in the eyes of the king, despite Saul's later jealousy and hostility. This favor can be seen as a divine orchestration, as God had already chosen David to be the future king of Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>). The phrase underscores David's character and abilities, which earned him a place in Saul's court. This favor parallels the way Jesus found favor with God and man (<a href="/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>), highlighting David as a foreshadowing of Christ. Saul's initial approval of David sets the stage for the complex relationship that unfolds between them, marked by both admiration and enmity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.
