In the cultural context of ancient Israel, family loyalty was paramount, yet Jonathan's anger indicates a prioritization of righteousness over familial allegiance. This fierce anger can be seen as a reflection of righteous indignation, similar to Jesus' anger in the temple (<a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13-17</a>), where injustice and wrongdoing provoke a strong emotional response.<p><b>and did not eat any food that second day of the month</b><br>The mention of the "second day of the month" refers to the New Moon festival, a time of religious observance and communal meals (<a href="/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>). Jonathan's refusal to eat is a significant act of protest and mourning, aligning with biblical instances where fasting is used to express grief or repentance (<a href="/ezra/8-21.htm">Ezra 8:21-23</a>). This abstention underscores the gravity of the situation and Jonathan's deep distress over his father's actions.<p><b>for he was grieved by his father&#8217;s shameful treatment of David</b><br>Jonathan's grief highlights the covenantal friendship between him and David, which is a central theme in 1 Samuel. This friendship is a model of loyalty and selflessness, reflecting the biblical principle of loving one's neighbor (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>). Saul's treatment of David is described as "shameful," indicating a breach of both royal and divine duty. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of God's anointed being unjustly persecuted, a theme that finds its ultimate fulfillment in the life of Jesus Christ, who was also rejected and mistreated by those in authority (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul and a close friend of David.

The son of Saul left the presence, and appeared no more at that fatal feast. The hot anger was stirred up, first, no doubt, by the terrible insult offered him, the prince and heir to the throne, before the assembled great ones of Israel. The great spear uplifted to strike, following the harsh and bitter words spoken, was an act not likely soon to be forgotten by the spectators. And secondly, by the determined and relentless enmity of Saul against David, of whose stainless integrity and perfect loyalty Jonathan was firmly convinced. The bitter wrong done to David his friend no doubt affected Jonathan most.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/20-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Jonathan</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1464;&#1435;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#257;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3083.htm">Strong's 3083: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jonathan -- 'the LORD has given', the name of a number of Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">got up</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1447;&#1511;&#1464;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;q&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
