The choice of a king was a significant shift from the judges who had led Israel. This decision was influenced by the surrounding nations, as Israel wanted to be like them (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>). The people's choice indicates a lack of faith in God's unique governance and a desire for human leadership, which foreshadows the challenges and failures of human kingship.<p><b>the one you requested</b><br>The Israelites' request for a king was initially met with divine disapproval, as it represented a rejection of God's kingship (<a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>). Despite warnings about the potential tyranny and burdens a king would impose (<a href="/1_samuel/8-10.htm">1 Samuel 8:10-18</a>), the people persisted. This request reflects a deeper spiritual issue: a lack of trust in God's provision and protection. It also serves as a reminder of human tendency to seek security in earthly institutions rather than in divine sovereignty.<p><b>Behold, the LORD has placed a king over you</b><br>Despite the people's insistence, God allowed them to have a king, demonstrating His permissive will. Saul's anointing as king (<a href="/1_samuel/10.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>) was both a concession to the people's demands and a test of their faithfulness. This act illustrates God's sovereignty, as He remains in control even when granting human desires that deviate from His ideal plan. The placement of a king also sets the stage for the eventual rise of David, a man after God's own heart, and the establishment of a royal lineage leading to Jesus Christ, the ultimate King.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel and a prophet who anointed Saul as king.

In the very next verses Samuel warns both king and people to &#8220;fear the LORD and serve Him&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/12-14.htm">1 Samuel 12:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; The king stands under divine oversight, just as Israel does; God remains the true monarch (<a href="/psalms/99-1.htm">Psalm 99:1-2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/12-13.htm">1 Samuel 12:13</a> captures a tension that runs through all of Scripture: God&#8217;s people make real choices, yet God remains firmly in control.
