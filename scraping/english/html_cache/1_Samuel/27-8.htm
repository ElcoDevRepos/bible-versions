The Geshurites were a people living in the region of Geshur, possibly near the northeastern part of the Promised Land. The Girzites are less well-known, with little archaeological evidence, but they were likely a small group in the same general area. The Amalekites were long-standing enemies of Israel, first encountered in <a href="/exodus/17.htm">Exodus 17</a>. David's raids were strategic, eliminating threats and securing resources. This action reflects David's role as a warrior and protector of Israel, foreshadowing his future as king. It also highlights the ongoing conflict between Israel and these groups, fulfilling God's command to subdue the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>).<p><b>(From ancient times these people had inhabited the land extending to Shur and Egypt.)</b><br>The reference to "ancient times" indicates the long-standing presence of these groups in the region. Shur is a desert area east of Egypt, often associated with the wilderness where Hagar fled (<a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7</a>). The mention of Egypt situates these raids in a significant geographical context, as Egypt was a major power and cultural influence. This land was part of the broader territory promised to Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>). The historical context underscores the persistent challenge Israel faced in securing and maintaining control over the land, a theme throughout the Old Testament. David's actions can be seen as part of the divine mandate to establish Israel's presence in the Promised Land, aligning with God's covenant promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, currently living among the Philistines to escape King Saul's pursuit.

While outwardly serving Philistine interests, David actually safeguards God&#8217;s people, advances earlier divine commands, and prepares territory for the kingdom he will soon inherit. His actions contrast sharply with Saul&#8217;s disobedience, spotlighting David as the leader who takes God&#8217;s word seriously and acts on it without hesitation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">Went up.</span>--The expression is strictly accurate. The nomad tribes against whom his expeditions were directed dwelt on higher ground than David's home at Ziklag, apparently on the wide extent of the mountain plateau, that high table-land at the north-east of the desert of Paran.<p><span class= "bld">The Geshurites, and the Gezerites, and the Amalekites.</span>--These were all "Bedaween" tribes, the scourge of the Israelitish families dwelling on the south of Canaan. It is not easy to identify the first two named of these nomades against whom David directed his operations. We hear of these Geshurites in the neighbourhood of Bashan (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-14.htm" title="Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob to the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, to this day.">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>), and of another tribe of them in Syria (<a href="/2_samuel/15-8.htm" title="For your servant vowed a vow while I stayed at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.">2Samuel 15:8</a>). They were a widely scattered race of nomad Arabs. The Gezerites, or Gizrites, it has been supposed, were the remains of a once powerful race dispossessed by the Amorites. The third named, the Amalekites, were the remnant of that once powerful tribe destroyed by Saul in his famous war, when his disobedience incurred the wrath of Samuel.<p><span class= "bld">For those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even unto the land of Egypt.</span>--The grammar and construction of this sentence is confused and difficult. On the whole, the rendering and explanation of Erdmann in <span class= "ital">Lange </span>seems the most satisfactory: "David . . . invaded the . . . and the Amalekites (for these were inhabitants of the land, who inhabited it of old) as far as Shur and Egypt." Thus David's raids extended as far as the desert frontier of Egypt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Went up.</span> The Geshurites inhabited the high table land which forms the northeastern portion of the wilderness of Paran. Like the Kenites, they seem to have broken up into scattered tribes, as we find one portion of them in the neighbourhood of Bashan (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>), and another in Syria (<a href="/2_samuel/15-8.htm">2 Samuel 15:8</a>). Probably, like the Amalekites, they were a Bedouin race, and so great wanderers. Hence the verb translated <span class="cmt_word">invaded</span> is literally "spread themselves out" like a fan, so as to enclose these nomads, whose safety lay in flight. <span class="cmt_word">Gezrites</span>. The written text has <span class="accented">Girzites</span>, which the Kri has changed into Gezrites, probably from a wish to connect a name never mentioned elsewhere with the town of Gezer. But Gezer lay far away in the west of Ephraim, and the connection suggested in modern times of the Girzites with Mount Gerizim in Central Palestine is more probable. They would thus be the remains of a once more powerful people, dispossessed by the Amorites, but who were now probably a very feeble remnant. <span class="cmt_word">For those nations,</span> etc. The grammar and translation of this clause are both full of difficulties, but the following rendering is perhaps the least objectionable: "For these were (the families) inhabiting the land, which were of old, as thou goest towards Shur," etc. <span class="accented">Families</span> must be supplied because the participle <span class="accented">inhabiting</span> is feminine. What, then, the narrator means to say is that these three Bedouin tribes were the aboriginal inhabitants of the northwestern portion of the desert between Egypt and South Palestine. On the Amalekites see <a href="/1_samuel/15-2.htm">1 Samuel 15:2</a>. We need not wonder at finding them mentioned again so soon after Saul's expedition. A race of nomads would sustain no great harm from an expedition which soon began to occupy itself with capturing cattle.
