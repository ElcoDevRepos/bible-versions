This act of inquiring of the LORD was a common practice in ancient Israel, often involving the use of the Urim and Thummim, sacred lots used by the high priest to discern God's will (<a href="/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>). This highlights the role of the priesthood in mediating between God and man. Ahimelech's actions demonstrate his support for David, who was fleeing from King Saul. This inquiry signifies the importance of seeking God's guidance in times of uncertainty and distress.<p><b>and gave him provisions.</b><br>Ahimelech provided David with the consecrated bread, known as the Bread of the Presence, which was typically reserved for the priests (<a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>). This act of giving the holy bread to David underscores the principle that human need can take precedence over ceremonial law, a point later emphasized by Jesus in <a href="/matthew/12-3.htm">Matthew 12:3-4</a>. It also reflects the hospitality and support extended to David, who was in dire need during his flight from Saul.<p><b>He also gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.</b><br>The sword of Goliath, which David had previously used to behead the giant after defeating him (<a href="/1_samuel/17-51.htm">1 Samuel 17:51</a>), was kept as a trophy at Nob. By giving David this sword, Ahimelech not only provided him with a weapon but also a symbol of God's past deliverance and victory. This act serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the victories He grants to those who trust in Him. The sword represents the tangible evidence of God's power and David's anointing as the future king of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahimelech.htm">Ahimelech</a></b><br>The high priest at Nob who assisted David by providing him with provisions and the sword of Goliath.

In <a href="/1_samuel/23-9.htm">1 Samuel 23:9-12</a> David later asks the priest Abiathar to &#8220;bring the ephod,&#8221; showing that the ephod (with the Urim and Thummim) was the ordinary means God used for specific guidance.<p>- By seeking the LORD on David&#8217;s behalf, Ahimelech acknowledged David&#8217;s rightful place in God&#8217;s plan, contrasting sharply with Saul&#8217;s paranoia (<a href="/1_samuel/24-15.htm">1 Samuel 24:15</a>).<p>- The scene echoes <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>, assuring that God &#8220;will make your paths straight&#8221; when we trust Him.<p>- God&#8217;s willingness to give direction underlines His promise, &#8220;I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/32-8.htm">Psalm 32:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and gave him provisions</b><p>- These &#8220;provisions&#8221; are identified in <a href="/1_samuel/21-3.htm">1 Samuel 21:3-6</a> as the consecrated bread from the tabernacle. Jesus highlights this incident in <a href="/matthew/12-3.htm">Matthew 12:3-4</a> to show that God values mercy over ritual when lives are at stake.<p>- Meeting David&#8217;s physical need reveals the LORD as Jehovah-Jireh, the One who provides (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/34-10.htm">Psalm 34:10</a>).<p>- Ahimelech&#8217;s generosity cost him dearly (<a href="/1_samuel/22-16.htm">1 Samuel 22:16-18</a>), reminding us that obedience can invite earthly loss but eternal reward (<a href="/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10-12</a>).<p>- God&#8217;s provision through the priest demonstrates that&#8212;even when the anointed king is hunted&#8212;he is never outside the reach of divine care (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He also gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.</b><p>- The sword, stored behind the ephod (<a href="/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>), was a tangible reminder of the LORD&#8217;s past victory: &#8220;David ran and stood over the Philistine&#8230; he drew the sword&#8230;and cut off his head&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-51.htm">1 Samuel 17:51</a>).<p>- Receiving that weapon now would bolster David&#8217;s faith: the God who delivered him then would sustain him now (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>).<p>- The transfer of Goliath&#8217;s sword symbolically hands David his own history of triumph as a tool for present battles&#8212;much like <a href="/ephesians/6-17.htm">Ephesians 6:17</a> calls believers to wield &#8220;the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.&#8221;<p>- Saul&#8217;s later accusation that Ahimelech &#8220;conspired&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/22-13.htm">1 Samuel 22:13</a>) twists this gracious act into treason, yet the narrative affirms that righteous aid to God&#8217;s servant is never betrayal of God&#8217;s kingdom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Ahimelech&#8217;s threefold ministry&#8212;seeking God&#8217;s direction, supplying daily bread, and handing over a battle-tested sword&#8212;highlights the LORD&#8217;s comprehensive care for His chosen.
