This event marks the beginning of Abiathar's long association with David, eventually becoming his high priest. Abiathar's escape to David signifies a shift in the priestly support from Saul to David, foreshadowing David's future kingship. This moment also highlights the importance of communication and loyalty in times of crisis.<p><b>that Saul had killed</b><br>Saul's actions against the priests were driven by paranoia and fear of losing his kingdom, showcasing his spiritual decline. This act of violence against the priests was a grave sin, as they were consecrated to serve God. Saul's decision to kill the priests reflects his disobedience and further alienation from God's will, contrasting with David's growing favor with God.<p><b>the priests of the LORD.</b><br>The priests at Nob were descendants of Eli, fulfilling their sacred duties.

Striking them was tantamount to striking at the Lord Himself (<a href="/numbers/16-9.htm">Numbers 16:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Nob&#8217;s priests had earlier aided David in good faith (<a href="/1_samuel/21-6.htm">1 Samuel 21:6</a>), unaware of Saul&#8217;s hostility. Their death highlights the cost of associating with God&#8217;s anointed (<a href="/matthew/10-22.htm">Matthew 10:22</a>).<p>&#8226; This tragedy traces back to Eli&#8217;s house (<a href="/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31-33</a>). Abiathar, Eli&#8217;s descendant, alone escapes, fulfilling the prophecy that one would be spared to &#8220;weep his eyes out&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/2-33.htm">1 Samuel 2:33</a>).<p>&#8226; The loss of the priesthood at Nob drives David to seek God even more earnestly through Abiathar and the ephod (<a href="/1_samuel/23-9.htm">1 Samuel 23:9-12</a>; 30:7-8), illustrating how God provides ongoing access to Him despite human sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Abiathar&#8217;s report to David lays bare the widening gulf between Saul and the Lord. Saul&#8217;s massacre of the priests marks his final plunge into rebellion, while Abiathar&#8217;s flight to David signals God&#8217;s preservation of both priestly and royal lines.
