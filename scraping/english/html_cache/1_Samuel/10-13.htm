The act of prophesying here indicates that Saul was temporarily endowed with the ability to speak under divine inspiration, a sign of his anointing as king. This event fulfills the prophecy given by Samuel in <a href="/1_samuel/10-6.htm">1 Samuel 10:6</a>, where it was foretold that the Spirit of the Lord would come powerfully upon Saul, and he would prophesy. The act of prophesying in the Old Testament often involved speaking God's truth, sometimes predicting future events, and was a sign of divine favor and calling. Saul's participation in this prophetic activity was a public demonstration of his new role and the divine endorsement of his kingship.<p><b>he went up to the high place</b><br>High places in ancient Israel were often sites of worship, typically located on elevated ground. They were used for both legitimate worship of Yahweh and, at times, for idolatrous practices. In this context, the high place likely refers to a location where legitimate worship of God was conducted, possibly a place where sacrifices were offered and communal worship occurred. Saul's ascent to the high place signifies his participation in the religious life of Israel and his acceptance of his role as leader. It also connects him to the tradition of Israelite leaders who sought divine guidance and favor. The high place serves as a geographical and spiritual marker, indicating Saul's transition from a private individual to a public figure with divine responsibilities.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, chosen by God and anointed by the prophet Samuel.
