In the context of 1 Samuel, the priests were expected to follow the Levitical laws regarding sacrifices, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/7-28.htm">Leviticus 7:28-36</a>. However, the sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were corrupt and abused these customs for personal gain. This highlights the importance of adhering to God's commandments and the consequences of deviating from them.<p><b>When any man offered a sacrifice</b><br>Sacrifices were central to Israelite worship, serving as a means of atonement and fellowship with God. The sacrificial system was detailed in the Mosaic Law, with specific instructions for different types of offerings (Leviticus 1-7). This phrase underscores the communal aspect of worship, where individuals brought offerings to the tabernacle, symbolizing their devotion and obedience to God.<p><b>the servant of the priest would come</b><br>The presence of the priest's servant indicates a delegation of duties, which was common in the priestly system. However, in this context, it also suggests a misuse of authority, as the servants acted on behalf of the corrupt priests. This reflects the broader theme of leadership accountability found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>, where God condemns the shepherds of Israel for their failure to care for the flock.<p><b>with a three-pronged meat fork</b><br>The three-pronged fork was a tool used to extract portions of the sacrificial meat. While the Levitical law allowed priests to receive a portion of the offerings (<a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31-34</a>), the use of the fork here symbolizes the excessive and unlawful taking by Eli's sons. This act of greed contrasts with the sacrificial system's intent, which was to honor God and provide for the priests in a manner that respected the offerings' sanctity.<p><b>while the meat was boiling</b><br>Boiling the meat was part of the preparation process for certain sacrifices, such as the peace offering. The timing of the servant's arrival, while the meat was still boiling, indicates a premeditated act to seize the best portions before the offering was properly completed. This disregard for the sacrificial process highlights the corruption and disrespect for God's laws, serving as a warning against prioritizing personal desires over divine commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/priests.htm">Priests</a></b><br>The religious leaders of Israel, responsible for performing sacrifices and maintaining the temple.
