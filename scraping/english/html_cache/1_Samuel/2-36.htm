The prophecy indicates that Eli's lineage will suffer consequences, highlighting the importance of faithfulness and obedience in leadership roles. This judgment is a fulfillment of God's warning against those who dishonor His name.<p><b>will come and bow down to him</b><br>The act of bowing down signifies submission and desperation. In the context of ancient Israel, bowing was a gesture of respect and supplication. This phrase suggests a reversal of fortune for Eli's descendants, who once held positions of power and influence. It underscores the biblical principle that God humbles the proud and exalts the humble.<p><b>for a piece of silver or a morsel of bread</b><br>This imagery of poverty and need contrasts sharply with the previous wealth and privilege of the priestly family. It reflects the dire circumstances that Eli's descendants will face, emphasizing the severity of God's judgment. The mention of silver and bread symbolizes basic sustenance, indicating that they will be reduced to begging for their livelihood.<p><b>pleading, &#8220;Please appoint me to some priestly office</b><br>The plea for a priestly office reveals a desire to regain status and provision through religious service. It highlights the desperation of Eli's descendants, who seek any opportunity to restore their former position. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the consequences of sin and the loss of divine favor.<p><b>so that I can eat a piece of bread.&#8221;&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The focus on bread underscores the basic human need for survival, illustrating the depth of the family's fall from grace. This phrase serves as a sobering reminder of the cost of disobedience and the importance of maintaining a right relationship with God. It also foreshadows the ultimate provision found in Jesus Christ, the Bread of Life, who offers spiritual sustenance to all who come to Him in faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli.htm">Eli</a></b><br>The high priest of Israel during the time of Samuel's birth.

The word &#8220;everyone left&#8221; speaks of drastic culling&#8212;fulfilling v. 33: &#8220;the most of your house will die in the prime of life.&#8221; This literal thinning of Eli&#8217;s line occurs historically when Saul slaughters the priests at Nob, leaving only Abiathar (<a href="/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18-20</a>). Years later Solomon removes Abiathar from office, completing the prophecy (<a href="/1_kings/2-26.htm">1 Kings 2:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will come and bow down to him</b><p>The &#8220;him&#8221; points back to the &#8220;faithful priest&#8221; God promises to raise up (<a href="/1_samuel/2-35.htm">1 Samuel 2:35</a>). In the near term this is Zadok (<a href="/1_kings/2-35.htm">1 Kings 2:35</a>); in the ultimate sense every priestly line finds its perfection in Christ, the eternal High Priest (<a href="/hebrews/7-23.htm">Hebrews 7:23-25</a>). Eli&#8217;s descendants, once honored, must now prostrate themselves before another priest, acknowledging God&#8217;s reversal of fortunes (<a href="/luke/14-11.htm">Luke 14:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for a piece of silver or a morsel of bread</b><p>Priests were meant to live from holy offerings (<a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31-34</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8-20</a>). Because Eli&#8217;s house forfeited that privilege, its survivors will be reduced to begging for the smallest wage&#8212;&#8220;a piece of silver,&#8221; the day-laborer&#8217;s pay (<a href="/matthew/20-2.htm">Matthew 20:2</a>), or &#8220;a morsel of bread,&#8221; the humblest ration (<a href="/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>).

Former heirs of the sanctuary now beg merely to be assistants. They no longer request honor, only employment. This fulfills the warning in v. 30: &#8220;Those who despise Me will be despised.&#8221; Compare Esau, who &#8220;found no place for repentance, though he sought it with tears&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-17.htm">Hebrews 12:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that I can eat a piece of bread.&#8221;</b><p>Survival, not status, is now the motive. Bread was the basic covenant provision for priests (<a href="/leviticus/24-5.htm">Leviticus 24:5-9</a>). To crave the bare minimum underscores how far the line has fallen. Their plea echoes the prodigal&#8217;s longing to eat with the hired men (<a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17-19</a>). God&#8217;s judgment is thorough: the proud are laid low until they acknowledge dependence on His mercy alone (<a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm">1 Peter 5:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/2-36.htm">1 Samuel 2:36</a> depicts the final stage of God&#8217;s judgment on Eli&#8217;s corrupt priestly line: a handful of survivors, stripped of privilege, will grovel before the new faithful priest, seeking any role that will keep them alive. The verse underscores two lessons:<p>&#8226; Divine promises and warnings are literal; God fulfills both in history.<p>&#8226; Sin shatters honor and provision, while humble submission to God&#8217;s appointed priest brings life.<p>The passage assures us that God defends His holiness, exalts the faithful, and ultimately centers all priesthood in the perfect High Priest who never fails.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Piece of silver</span> is lit. a small silver coin got by begging and the word marks the extreme penury into which the race of Eli fell Gathered round the sanctuary at Shiloh, they were the chief sufferers by its ruin, and we have noticed how for a time they fall entirely out of view. During the miserable period of Philistine domination which followed, Samuel became to the oppressed nation a centre of hope, and by wise government he first reformed the people internally, and then gave them freedom from foreign rule. During this period we may be sure that he did much to raise from their misery the descendants of Eli, and finally Ahiah, Eli's grandson, ministers as high priest before Saul. Though his grandson, Abiathar, was deposed from the office by Solomon, there is no reason for imagining that the family ever again fell into distress, nor do the terms of the prophecy warrant such a supposition. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/2-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
