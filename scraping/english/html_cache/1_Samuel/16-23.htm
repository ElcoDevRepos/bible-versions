This spirit is often understood as a form of divine judgment, reflecting Saul's disobedience and rejection as king. Theologically, it highlights the sovereignty of God in using even distressing circumstances to fulfill His purposes. The concept of a spirit from God causing distress is unique and emphasizes the seriousness of Saul's spiritual decline.<p><b>David would pick up his harp and play</b><br>David's skill as a musician is introduced here, showcasing his talents beyond his future role as king. The harp, or lyre, was a common instrument in ancient Israel, used in both worship and personal expression. David's music had a soothing effect, which is significant in the cultural context where music was often used for emotional and spiritual healing. This also foreshadows David's role as the author of many Psalms, which continue to provide comfort and spiritual insight.<p><b>Then Saul would find relief and feel better</b><br>The relief Saul experienced indicates the power of music and its ability to influence the human spirit. This momentary respite suggests that while the spirit was from God, it was not beyond God's control to alleviate through David's playing. It also underscores the temporary nature of Saul's relief, pointing to the deeper spiritual issues that could not be resolved by music alone.<p><b>and the spirit of distress would depart from him</b><br>The departure of the distressing spirit upon David's playing highlights the spiritual authority and anointing that David carried, even before he became king. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who brings peace and relief to troubled souls. The temporary departure of the spirit also serves as a reminder of the ongoing spiritual battle and the need for true repentance and alignment with God's will. This narrative sets the stage for the growing contrast between Saul and David, as well as the unfolding of God's plan for Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who was tormented by an evil spirit sent by God due to his disobedience and rejection of God's commands.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The youngest son of Jesse, anointed by Samuel to be the future king of Israel.

A divinely permitted distressing spirit afflicts Saul because he rejected God&#8217;s commands. Whenever David worshipfully plays, the torment lifts, demonstrating the power of God-honoring music and the kindness of the Lord in extending mercy even to the disobedient.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">David took an harp, and played with his hand.</span>--"The music," beautifully writes F. D. Maurice, "was more than a mere palliative. It brought back for the time the sense of a true order, a secret, inward harmony, an assurance that it is near every man, and that he may enter into it. A wonderful message, no doubt, to a king or a common man, better than a great multitude of words, a continual prophecy that there is a deliverer who can take the vulture from the heart, and unbind the sufferer from the rock. . . . As the boy minstrel played, the afflicted monarch was refreshed, and the dark clouds rolled away."<p>"He is Saul, ye remember in glory--ere error had bent<p>The broad brow from the daily communion, and still, though<p>much spent<p>Be the life and the bearing that front you, the same God did<p>choose<p>To receive what a man may waste, desecrate, never quite<p>lose."--BROWNING: <span class= "ital">Saul.</span><p><span class= "bld">And the evil spirit departed from him.</span>--Many instances besides those recorded above (see note to <a href="/1_samuel/16-16.htm" title="Let our lord now command your servants, which are before you, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is on you, that he shall play with his hand, and you shall be well.">1Samuel 16:16</a>) might be quoted of the beneficial effects of music and singing upon a disturbed spirit, or on a mind diseased. The holy Elisha, we are told, when "disturbed in spirit," would call for a minstrel, and after listening to the sweet, soothing strains, would write and speak his prophetic utterances.<p>In modern times a well-known instance of this strange power over a troubled spirit is that of Philip V. of Spain, who, we are told, was restored from the deepest melancholy and depression by the sweet voice and words of Farinelli. Luther speaks of this power of music over the sick and weary soul as "one of the fairest and most glorious gifts of God, to which Satan is a bitter enemy, for it removes from the heart the weight of sorrow and the fascination of evil thoughts." Basil's words on this subject are worth quoting:--"Psalmody is the calm of the soul, the repose of the spirit, the arbiter of peace. It silences the wave, and conciliates the whirlwind of our passions. It is an engenderer of friendship, a healer of dissension, a reconciler of enemies. It repels demons, lures the ministry of angels, shields us from nightly terrors, and refreshes us in daily toil." . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/16-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And whenever</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1464;&#1497;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
