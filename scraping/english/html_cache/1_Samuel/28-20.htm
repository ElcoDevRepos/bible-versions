Saul's physical collapse reflects his spiritual and emotional state. In biblical context, falling to the ground often signifies despair or submission (e.g., <a href="/joshua/7-6.htm">Joshua 7:6</a>). Saul's fall can be seen as a culmination of his disobedience to God, as he had previously been rejected as king (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26-28</a>).<p><b>terrified by the words of Samuel</b><br>Saul's terror is rooted in the prophecy of his impending defeat and death, as relayed by the spirit of Samuel. This encounter with Samuel, who had been a prophet and judge over Israel, underscores the gravity of Saul's situation. The fear Saul experiences is reminiscent of the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>), yet Saul's fear is devoid of hope due to his estrangement from God.<p><b>And his strength was gone</b><br>Saul's physical weakness mirrors his spiritual depletion. Throughout his reign, Saul's reliance on his own strength rather than God's guidance led to his downfall. This moment highlights the consequences of a life lived apart from divine support, as seen in other biblical figures who faltered when they strayed from God (e.g., Samson in <a href="/judges/16-20.htm">Judges 16:20</a>).<p><b>because he had not eaten anything all that day and night</b><br>Saul's fasting, whether intentional or due to distress, leaves him physically vulnerable. In biblical times, fasting was often associated with mourning or seeking divine intervention (e.g., <a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>). However, Saul's fast lacks the spiritual focus seen in other scriptural examples, further emphasizing his isolation from God. This detail also foreshadows the physical and spiritual exhaustion that leads to his ultimate demise in battle.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is in a state of desperation and fear after hearing Samuel's prophecy of his impending defeat and death.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The prophet who, though deceased, is brought up by the medium at Endor to deliver a message from God to Saul.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/endor.htm">Endor</a></b><br>The location where Saul seeks out a medium to summon the spirit of Samuel, despite having previously banned such practices.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_medium.htm">The Medium</a></b><br>A woman at Endor who practices necromancy, which Saul had outlawed, yet he seeks her out in his desperation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>The enemy nation that Saul is preparing to fight, whose impending battle leads him to seek guidance through forbidden means.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Saul's fear and weakness are direct results of his disobedience to God.

Just as judgment came swiftly when Saul first disobeyed (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26-28</a>), here the consequence is equally sudden.<p>&#8226; Scripture often notes an instant response to divine or prophetic words&#8212;think of David when Nathan confronted him (<a href="/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a>) or Nineveh when Jonah preached (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5</a>). God&#8217;s Word pierces without lag time (<a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Saul fell flat on the ground</b><p>&#8226; Falling prostrate is the traditional posture of utter submission and fear: Joshua did it at Ai (<a href="/joshua/7-6.htm">Joshua 7:6</a>) and Ezekiel before God&#8217;s glory (<a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>).<p>&#8226; This collapse shows Saul&#8217;s recognition that the verdict is final; there&#8217;s no more bargaining, no more delay&#8212;much like John who &#8220;fell at His feet as though dead&#8221; before the risen Christ (<a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul had bowed before Samuel once before when begging pardon (<a href="/1_samuel/15-30.htm">1 Samuel 15:30</a>). Now he bows again, but it is too late for repentance; the prophetic sentence has been sealed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>terrified by the words of Samuel</b><p>&#8226; Samuel&#8217;s message was stark: the kingdom removed, Saul and his sons to die the next day (28:17-19). No wonder &#8220;terror&#8221; seized him.<p>&#8226; Fear grips those who know judgment is coming (<a href="/hebrews/10-31.htm">Hebrews 10:31</a>). Contrast Jonathan, who trusted the LORD (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>), with Saul, whose earlier courage evaporated into dread.<p>&#8226; The scene echoes how Felix trembled when Paul spoke of judgment (<a href="/acts/24-25.htm">Acts 24:25</a>); hearing truth without surrender produces terror, not peace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And his strength was gone</b><p>&#8226; Spiritual collapse often drains physical vigor. Samson experienced it when the LORD departed (<a href="/judges/16-20.htm">Judges 16:20, 30</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s inner emptiness&#8212;estranged from God, cut off from Samuel, abandoned by prophetic guidance (28:6)&#8212;leaves him powerless. David once said, &#8220;My strength fails because of my affliction&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/31-10.htm">Psalm 31:10</a>); Saul embodies that decline.<p>&#8226; The narrative contrasts earlier days: Saul once &#8220;stood head and shoulders above all&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/10-23.htm">1 Samuel 10:23</a>), but disobedience has hollowed him out.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>because he had not eaten anything all that day and night</b><p>&#8226; His long fast was self-induced; anxiety drove him. Similar grief-fasts appear when Israel mourned Saul&#8217;s death (<a href="/2_samuel/1-12.htm">2 Samuel 1:12</a>) or Ahab sulked over Naboth&#8217;s vineyard (<a href="/1_kings/21-4.htm">1 Kings 21:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, Saul&#8217;s rash oath kept his army from food (<a href="/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24</a>). Now his own body suffers from that same neglect.<p>&#8226; Physical weakness mirrors spiritual starvation; he had feasted on fear instead of trusting the LORD, unlike Jesus who reminded that &#8220;man shall not live on bread alone&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/28-20.htm">1 Samuel 28:20</a> captures the tragic climax of Saul&#8217;s decline: an immediate, total collapse driven by terror at God&#8217;s irrevocable word, compounded by the physical toll of prolonged neglect. His fallen posture, drained strength, and empty stomach symbolize a life that once held promise but now lies bankrupt because it ignored the LORD&#8217;s voice. The verse warns that disobedience ultimately strips courage, vitality, and hope, while affirming that God&#8217;s pronouncements stand firm&#8212;instantly, completely, and unavoidably.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth.</span>--Up to this period we must understand Saul listening to the prophet's words in that attitude of humble reverence which he assumed when he perceived that he was in the presence of Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/28-14.htm" title="And he said to her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man comes up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.">1Samuel 28:14</a>); but now, on hearing the words of awful judgment, crushed with terror and dismay, and previously weakened by a long fast and the fatigue of the rough night walk from Mount Gilboa to En-dor, he fell prostrate to the earth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 20-25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul fell straightway all along,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at full length, <span class="cmt_word">on the earth</span>. He fainted, partly from mental distress, partly from bodily exhaustion, as he had gone <span class="cmt_word">all the day</span> and <span class="cmt_word">all the night</span> without food. It was this long continued violent emotion of feeling which had driven Saul to this rash enterprise; but fasting and agony of mind were the worst possible preparation for a visit to one used to cajole her victims by pretended magical arts, and gifted, as people of her class usually are, with great shrewdness. But practised as she was in deceit, yet even in her triumph over her enemy she felt, when she saw him swoon away, a natural sympathy for his misery and weakness, and urged him to take food. Perhaps she saw that without it he could never have got back to the Israelite camp. At first he refused, but the necessity of it was so plain, that when the two men with him also urged it, he at last consented. <span class="cmt_word">So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.</span> During this colloquy he had remained prostrate upon the ground, but now he seated himself, not on a <span class="accented">bed</span>, but upon the raised bank, or divan, which runs along the wall of an Oriental house, and is furnished with carpets and cushions for men to sit or lie upon. There he rested, a prey, we may well believe, to bitter thoughts, while the woman hastily prepared a meal, killing a calf and baking unleavened cakes, as there was no time to leaven the dough. And so "they ate, and rose up, and departed that night." <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/28-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Immediately</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1492;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ma&#183;h&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
