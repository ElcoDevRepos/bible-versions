Morning is frequently associated with new beginnings or revelations. In this context, it marks the start of a crucial day for David and Jonathan, highlighting the urgency and importance of their meeting.<p><b>Jonathan went out to the field</b><br>Fields in ancient Israel were common meeting places, away from the prying eyes of city dwellers. This setting provides privacy for Jonathan and David, reflecting the need for secrecy due to Saul's hostility. Fields also symbolize openness and honesty, fitting for the covenantal relationship between Jonathan and David.<p><b>for the appointment with David</b><br>This appointment was prearranged, indicating the deep trust and communication between Jonathan and David. It underscores the seriousness of their situation, as they needed to confirm Saul's intentions. The concept of appointments in Scripture often involves divine timing and purpose, suggesting God's hand in their friendship and plans.<p><b>and a small boy was with him</b><br>The presence of a small boy serves a practical purpose, as Jonathan uses him to convey a message to David without arousing suspicion. This reflects the wisdom and caution required in dangerous circumstances. The use of a child also emphasizes innocence and the gravity of the situation, as even the young are unwittingly involved in the unfolding drama.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>The son of King Saul and a close friend of David.
