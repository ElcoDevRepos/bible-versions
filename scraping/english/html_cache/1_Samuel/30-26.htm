Ziklag, a Philistine town given to David by Achish, king of Gath, served as David's base during his time of exile from Saul. This location highlights David's strategic position between the Philistines and Israel, reflecting his complex political and military situation.<p><b>he sent some of the plunder</b><br>The act of sending plunder demonstrates David's leadership and generosity. In ancient Near Eastern culture, sharing spoils of war was a common practice to secure loyalty and support. This action also reflects David's understanding of the importance of maintaining alliances and rewarding those who supported him during his time of need.<p><b>to his friends, the elders of Judah</b><br>David's choice to send plunder to the elders of Judah indicates his intention to strengthen ties with his own tribe. The elders were influential leaders within the tribe, and by sharing the spoils, David was likely securing their allegiance and preparing for his future as king. This act foreshadows David's eventual rise to power over all Israel.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Here is a gift for you</b><br>The term "gift" suggests a voluntary offering rather than a mandatory tribute. This language emphasizes David's generosity and the goodwill he intended to foster. In biblical terms, gifts often symbolize grace and favor, reflecting God's provision and blessing.<p><b>from the plunder of the LORD&#8217;s enemies.&#8221;</b><br>By attributing the victory to the LORD, David acknowledges God's sovereignty and the divine mandate behind his military success. This phrase underscores the theological perspective that victories in battle were seen as acts of God, reinforcing David's role as the anointed leader chosen by God. It also connects to the broader biblical theme of God delivering His people from their enemies, a recurring motif throughout the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, who at this time was leading a group of men while fleeing from King Saul.

It was not improbably the main division of the great tribe, and they had with them the bulk of their flocks and herds, besides what they had just captured in their raid in southern Canaan.
