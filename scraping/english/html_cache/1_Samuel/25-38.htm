The ten-day period suggests a completion of divine patience and a period of grace given to Nabal. In biblical numerology, the number ten often symbolizes completeness or divine order, as seen in the Ten Commandments. This time frame allowed for the unfolding of God's justice in His perfect timing.<p><b>the LORD</b><br>The use of "the LORD" emphasizes the sovereignty and direct involvement of God in the events. It highlights the belief in God's active role in the lives of individuals and His ability to execute judgment. This is consistent with the biblical theme of God as the ultimate judge, as seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>, where God declares that vengeance is His.<p><b>struck Nabal dead</b><br>Nabal's death is portrayed as a direct act of divine judgment. Nabal's name means "fool," and his actions against David reflect a rejection of God's anointed. This event serves as a warning against pride and foolishness, echoing <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>, which warns that pride precedes destruction. The suddenness of Nabal's death underscores the seriousness of opposing God's purposes and aligns with the biblical principle that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nabal.htm">Nabal</a></b><br>A wealthy but foolish man whose name means "fool" in Hebrew.

God allowed a brief span to pass after Abigail&#8217;s intervention.<p>&#8226; This interval highlights divine patience that gives room for reflection and possible repentance, echoing how the Lord &#8220;is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p>&#8226; It also reminds us that judgment and harvest come &#8220;at the proper time&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-9.htm">Galatians 6:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Ten days underscore that David did not take vengeance; instead, he waited, much like <a href="/psalms/37-7.htm">Psalm 37:7</a> advises&#8212;&#8220;Be still before the LORD and wait patiently for Him.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the LORD</b><p>&#8226; The focus shifts squarely to God: &#8220;the LORD&#8221; acted, not chance or human force.<p>&#8226; His direct involvement mirrors passages such as <a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>&#8212;&#8220;Vengeance is Mine; I will repay,&#8221; and <a href="/psalms/103-19.htm">Psalm 103:19</a>&#8212;&#8220;The LORD has established His throne in heaven, and His kingdom rules over all.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By naming Him, the text affirms God&#8217;s sovereignty, showing that He sees injustice and intervenes righteously (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>; <a href="/hebrews/10-30.htm">Hebrews 10:30</a>).<p>&#8226; This reminds believers that ultimate accountability lies before the Lord, comforting the oppressed and warning the arrogant (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>struck Nabal dead</b><p>&#8226; The consequence is clear: &#8220;the LORD struck Nabal dead&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/25-38.htm">1 Samuel 25:38</a>).<p>&#8226; Nabal&#8217;s end illustrates that persistent folly and hard-heartedness reap ruin, aligning with <a href="/proverbs/29-1.htm">Proverbs 29:1</a>&#8212;&#8220;A man who remains stiff-necked after many rebukes will suddenly be destroyed&#8212;without remedy.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Similar sudden judgments appear with Pharaoh in <a href="/exodus/12-29.htm">Exodus 12:29</a>, with Uzzah in <a href="/2_samuel/6-7.htm">2 Samuel 6:7</a>, and with Ananias and Sapphira in <a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1-11</a>, underscoring that God defends His holiness.<p>&#8226; David is vindicated without lifting a hand, paralleling <a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>, where Christ &#8220;entrusted Himself to Him who judges justly.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The event cautions against despising God&#8217;s appointed king and mistreating His people (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-10.htm">1 Corinthians 10:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>God waited ten days, proving His patient mastery over time; then He Himself acted, proving His sovereign justice; and He struck Nabal, proving that unrepentant arrogance meets swift judgment.
