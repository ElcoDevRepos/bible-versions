This reflects a common practice in ancient Israel where leaders and individuals sought divine direction. However, Saul's inquiry is marked by desperation rather than genuine faith, as his previous disobedience and rejection of God's commands have led to his current predicament. This highlights the importance of a consistent relationship with God rather than seeking Him only in times of crisis.<p><b>but the LORD did not answer him</b><br>God's silence is significant here. Throughout the Old Testament, God's communication with His people is contingent upon their obedience and faithfulness. Saul's earlier disobedience, such as his failure to completely destroy the Amalekites (1 Samuel 15), has led to his rejection as king. This silence serves as a divine judgment and a fulfillment of Samuel's prophecy that the kingdom would be torn from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>).<p><b>by dreams</b><br>Dreams were one of the ways God communicated with His people, as seen with figures like Joseph (Genesis 37) and Daniel (Daniel 2). The absence of dreams indicates a severed line of communication between Saul and God, emphasizing Saul's spiritual decline and the gravity of his situation.<p><b>or Urim</b><br>The Urim and Thummim were priestly tools used for divination, often associated with the high priest's breastplate (<a href="/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>). They were a means for the Israelites to discern God's will. Saul's inability to receive guidance through the Urim suggests a breakdown in the religious order, possibly due to his own actions, such as the massacre of the priests at Nob (1 Samuel 22).<p><b>or prophets</b><br>Prophets were God's messengers, and Samuel had been a key prophetic figure in Saul's life. With Samuel's death (<a href="/1_samuel/25.htm">1 Samuel 25:1</a>), Saul loses his primary prophetic connection. This absence underscores the void left by Samuel and the lack of any other prophetic voice willing or able to guide Saul, further isolating him spiritually and politically.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is seeking guidance from the Lord but receives no answer.

Earlier he had sought the LORD&#8217;s counsel in battles (<a href="/1_samuel/14-37.htm">1 Samuel 14:37</a>; 23:2). God had proven faithful to direct His people whenever they humbly asked (<a href="/2_samuel/5-19.htm">2 Samuel 5:19</a>). Yet this scene shows Saul treating the LORD more like a last-minute resource than the first source of help.<p>&#8226; The verb &#8220;inquired&#8221; reminds us that God invites His people to seek Him (<a href="/psalms/34-4.htm">Psalm 34:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The pattern throughout Scripture is clear: those who approach earnestly, believing, receive direction (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but the LORD did not answer him</b><p>Silence from heaven is never arbitrary. <a href="/psalms/66-18.htm">Psalm 66:18</a> warns that cherished sin blocks fellowship; <a href="/isaiah/59-2.htm">Isaiah 59:2</a> says iniquities &#8220;have hidden His face.&#8221; Saul had slain the priests of Nob (<a href="/1_samuel/22-17.htm">1 Samuel 22:17-19</a>) and persisted in disobedience regarding Amalek (15:23-26).

Saul&#8217;s closed line of communication shows that supernatural dreams are not mechanical guarantees; they flow from relationship. <a href="/jeremiah/23-28.htm">Jeremiah 23:28</a> contrasts true dreams from God with the self-generated claims of the disobedient. Saul received none because fellowship was broken.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or Urim</b><p>The Urim and Thummim, kept in the high priest&#8217;s breastpiece (<a href="/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>), provided yes-or-no direction (<a href="/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>). Earlier, Saul had relied on this means (<a href="/1_samuel/14-41.htm">1 Samuel 14:41</a>). But after ordering the massacre of the priests, he had effectively destroyed his own access. <a href="/ezra/2-63.htm">Ezra 2:63</a> notes that without a legitimate priesthood &#8220;they could not eat of the most holy things until a priest stood up with the Urim and Thummim.&#8221; Saul&#8217;s earlier violence left him without the ordained mediator needed for this sacred consultation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or prophets</b><p>God &#8220;spoke to our fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a>). Samuel had once been Saul&#8217;s trusted prophet (<a href="/1_samuel/9-19.htm">1 Samuel 9:19</a>; 12:19-25). Saul&#8217;s repeated dismissal of Samuel&#8217;s words (15:24-35) culminated in permanent separation. Later prophets rebuked kings who refused to listen (<a href="/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13-14</a>). Now no prophet stands beside Saul; the silence underscores estrangement from God&#8217;s appointed messengers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a> spotlights the tragedy of a king who once tasted God&#8217;s guidance yet forfeited it through persistent disobedience. Every normal channel&#8212;dreams, priestly Urim, prophetic word&#8212;falls silent because Saul had severed the very relationship those channels presuppose. The verse warns that seeking God is not a ritual but a relational privilege; ongoing rebellion silences the answers we crave, while humble obedience keeps every avenue of divine direction open.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">And when Saul enquired of the Lord.</span>----The question has been asked, How was the enquiry made? for since the massacre at Nob, the high priest, or, at least, the priest in possession of the sacred ephod and the breastplate, with the Urim and Thummim, was, we know, in the camp of David, and we shall soon hear of a solemn use being made of the sacred gems. (See <a href="/context/1_samuel/30-7.htm" title="And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray you, bring me here the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.">1Samuel 30:7-8</a>.) It has been suggested by eminent Biblical scholars that after the murder of Ahimelech and the flight of Abiathar to David, Saul removed the national Sanctuary from desecrated Nob, and established it at Gibeon, where, during the first year of David's reign, we find the Tabernacle, with Zadok, son of Ahitub, of the house of Eleazar, acting as high priest--probably placed in that office by Saul. This would account for the frequent reference in the time of David to two high priests, Zadok and Abiathar: Zadok, the high priest appointed by Saul, for a considerable period alone in charge of the Tabernacle; and Abiathar, who fled from Nob with the ephod and the sacred Urim, acknowledged by David as high priest, when the kingdom was restored eventually under one head. These two seemed to have divided the honours and responsibilities of the high priesthood. (See <a href="/2_samuel/8-17.htm" title="And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;">2Samuel 8:17</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-24.htm" title="And see Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.">2Samuel 15:24</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-29.htm" title="Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.">2Samuel 15:29</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/15-35.htm" title="And have you not there with you Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever you shall hear out of the king's house, you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.">2Samuel 15:35</a>;
