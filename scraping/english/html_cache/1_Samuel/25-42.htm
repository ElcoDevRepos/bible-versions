Her urgency reflects the importance of the situation, as she transitions from being the wife of Nabal, a foolish man, to aligning herself with David, the anointed future king of Israel. This haste can be seen as a reflection of the urgency with which believers are called to respond to God's call.<p><b>and got on a donkey,</b><br>The donkey was a common mode of transportation in ancient Israel, often used by those of wealth and status. Abigail's use of a donkey signifies her readiness to travel and her willingness to humble herself in service, much like Jesus' entry into Jerusalem on a donkey, symbolizing peace and humility.<p><b>and attended by five of her maidens,</b><br>The presence of her maidens indicates Abigail's status and wealth, as well as her preparedness for the journey. The number five can symbolize grace in biblical numerology, suggesting that Abigail's actions are underpinned by divine favor. Her maidens also serve as witnesses to her transition from Nabal's household to David's.<p><b>she followed David&#8217;s messengers</b><br>Abigail's decision to follow David's messengers signifies her acceptance of David's proposal and her submission to his leadership. This act of following is reminiscent of the call to discipleship, where believers are invited to follow Christ, the ultimate King. It also highlights the role of messengers in biblical narratives as bearers of important news and divine will.<p><b>and became his wife.</b><br>Abigail's marriage to David marks a significant turning point in her life and in the narrative of David's rise to kingship. This union not only elevates Abigail's status but also strengthens David's position by aligning him with a wise and discerning woman. Abigail's role as David's wife can be seen as a type of the Church, the bride of Christ, who is called to wisdom and discernment in her relationship with the Savior.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abigail.htm">Abigail</a></b><br>A wise and discerning woman, previously the wife of Nabal, who becomes David's wife.
