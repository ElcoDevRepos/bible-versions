His presence among the soldiers highlights his obedience and concern for his family. The men standing with him were likely seasoned soldiers, contrasting with David's youth and inexperience in warfare. This setting underscores David's courage and curiosity, as he engages with those more experienced in battle.<p><b>&#8220;What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel?</b><br>David's question reveals his awareness of the reward promised by King Saul for defeating Goliath, which included wealth, the king's daughter in marriage, and tax exemption for his family. The term "disgrace" indicates the shame and humiliation Israel felt under Goliath's taunts. This reflects the cultural importance of honor and reputation in ancient Israelite society, where a single warrior's challenge could represent the fate of an entire nation.<p><b>Just who is this uncircumcised Philistine,</b><br>By referring to Goliath as "uncircumcised," David emphasizes the Philistine's status as an outsider to the covenant community of Israel. Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's descendants, marking the Israelites as God's chosen people. This distinction highlights the spiritual battle underlying the physical confrontation, as David sees Goliath not just as a military threat but as a defiler of God's covenant.<p><b>that he should defy the armies of the living God?&#8221;</b><br>David's rhetorical question underscores his faith and perspective. Unlike the Israelite soldiers who saw Goliath as an insurmountable giant, David views the situation through the lens of faith in the "living God." This term contrasts the God of Israel with the lifeless idols of the Philistines, emphasizing God's active presence and power. David's confidence foreshadows his role as a type of Christ, who would later confront and overcome the ultimate enemy, sin, through faith and divine authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd who later becomes the king of Israel.

By asking openly, he exposes the atmosphere of fear that has paralyzed the troops (17:11).<p>&#8226; Scripture often highlights godly people who first &#8220;observe&#8221; before they act&#8212;Nehemiah did the same in surveying Jerusalem&#8217;s walls (<a href="/nehemiah/2-11.htm">Nehemiah 2:11-15</a>).<p>David models a faith-filled curiosity that refuses to accept the status quo.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel?&#8221;</b><p>David&#8217;s twofold concern&#8212;reward and reproach&#8212;reveals both practicality and passion:<p>&#8226; &#8220;What will be done&#8230;&#8221;&#8212;he acknowledges the king&#8217;s incentive (17:25).

Similar language appears when Joshua lamented Israel&#8217;s &#8220;disgrace&#8221; after Ai (<a href="/joshua/7-9.htm">Joshua 7:9</a>).<p>&#8226; David links victory with honor to God&#8217;s name; this mirrors Moses&#8217; intercession, appealing to God&#8217;s reputation among the nations (<a href="/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Just who is this uncircumcised Philistine,&#8221;</b><p>David&#8217;s description isn&#8217;t an ethnic slur; it&#8217;s a covenant statement:<p>&#8226; Circumcision marked Israel&#8217;s special relationship with God (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>). By calling Goliath &#8220;uncircumcised,&#8221; David underlines that the giant is outside God&#8217;s covenant protection.<p>&#8226; Earlier judges had used the same label for Philistines (<a href="/judges/14-3.htm">Judges 14:3</a>; 15:18). David stands in that tradition, viewing the battle through covenant lenses, not military odds.<p>&#8226; In the New Testament, Paul contrasts &#8220;circumcised&#8221; and &#8220;uncircumcised&#8221; to highlight inclusion in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-13</a>).

David believes God still fights for His people just as He did at the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; By calling Israel &#8220;armies of the living God,&#8221; David reminds the soldiers of their true identity; fear had reduced them to spectators, but faith reconnects them to their divine Commander (<a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase anticipates David&#8217;s proclamation to Goliath: &#8220;The battle is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221; (17:47). Confidence flows from knowing Who stands behind the ranks.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David&#8217;s single verse reveals a heart captivated by God&#8217;s honor. He engages the fearful troops, weighs the promised reward, invokes covenant identity, and anchors everything in the reality of the living God. The boy from Bethlehem is already a shepherd-king, teaching Israel&#8212;and us&#8212;that faith evaluates every threat in light of God&#8217;s power and promises, not in light of human odds.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">And David spake . . .</span>--Very vividly does the historian here depict the scene that morning in the "front:" the dismayed soldiers of King Saul watching and listening to the boastful, impious words, as the giant champion shouted them across the narrow ravine which parted the outposts of the two armies; the enthusiastic shepherd boy, glowing with religious fervour, going from group to group of the advanced guard in the front, as they stood gloomily leaning on their spears, asking questions, and gleaning all the information possible about this insulter of his God.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1431;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">asked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
