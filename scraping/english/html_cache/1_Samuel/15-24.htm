In the biblical context, confessing sin is a crucial step toward repentance and restoration with God. This phrase echoes the confessions of other biblical figures, such as David in <a href="/psalms/51.htm">Psalm 51</a>, who also recognized their sins before God. Saul's confession, however, lacks the depth of genuine repentance seen in David's life.<p><b>I have transgressed the LORD&#8217;s commandment and your instructions,</b><br>Saul's transgression refers to his failure to completely destroy the Amalekites and their possessions as commanded by God through Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>). This disobedience highlights the importance of following divine instructions precisely, as partial obedience is considered disobedience in the biblical narrative. The reference to both the LORD's commandment and Samuel's instructions underscores the role of prophets as God's mouthpieces, whose words carry divine authority.<p><b>because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.</b><br>Saul's fear of the people reveals a critical flaw in his leadership: prioritizing human approval over divine command. This fear contrasts with the biblical ideal of fearing God above all else, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a>, which warns against the snare of fearing man. Saul's decision to obey the people's voice rather than God's commandment demonstrates a failure to lead with integrity and faithfulness, a theme that recurs throughout his reign. This moment foreshadows the eventual loss of his kingdom, as God seeks leaders who prioritize His will above all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

The verse highlights the seriousness of ignoring God&#8217;s clear word, the danger of people-pleasing, and the necessity of wholehearted obedience. True repentance listens to God above all, takes full responsibility, and chooses consistent faithfulness over public approval.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">I have sinned.</span>--The grave condemnation of the prophet appalled the king. The grounds of the Divine rejection evidently sank deep into Saul's heart. Such a thought as that, in the eyes of the Invisible and Eternal, he ranked with the idolators and heathen sinners around, was, even for one sunk so low as Saul, terrible.<p><span class= "bld">Because I feared the people.</span>--He, with stammering lips, while deprecating the Divine sentence, still seeks to justify himself; but all that he could allege in excuse only more plainly marked out his unfitness for his high post. He could, after all, only plead that he loved the praise of men more than the approval of his God; that he preferred--as so many of earth's great ones have since done--the sweets of transient popular applause to the solitary consciousness that he was a faithful servant of the Highest.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - The words of Samuel struck Saul with terror. The same authority which had first given him the kingdom now withdraws it from him, and pronounces his offence as equal in God's sight to crimes which Saul himself held in great abhorrence. He humbles himself, therefore, before Samuel, acknowledges his sin, and frankly confesses that the cause of it had been his unwillingness to act in a manner contrary to the wishes of the people; and we must fairly conclude that the sparing of the spoil had been the people's doing. But was it not the king's duty to make the people obedient to Jehovah's voice? As the theocratic king, he was Jehovah's minister, and in preferring popularity to duty he showed himself unworthy of his position. Nor can we suppose that his confession of sin arose from penitence. It was the result simply of vexation at having his victory crossed by reproaches and disapproval from the only power capable of holding him in check. It seems, too, as if it were Samuel whom he feared more than Jehovah; for he speaks of <span class="cmt_word">thy words,</span> and asks Samuel to pardon his sin, and to grant him the favour of his public presence with him at the sacrifice which was about to be celebrated in honour of their triumph. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/15-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
