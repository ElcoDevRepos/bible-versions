This marks a pivotal moment in Israel's history, transitioning from a theocracy to a monarchy. The Israelites' demand for a king reflects their desire to be like other nations (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>), which indicates a lack of faith in God's unique leadership. This moment foreshadows the challenges and consequences of human leadership over divine guidance.<p><b>the LORD said to Samuel.</b><br>The LORD's communication with Samuel underscores the prophet's role as God's intermediary. Samuel, a judge and prophet, is a key figure during this transitional period. His relationship with God is reminiscent of Moses, who also received direct guidance from the LORD. This divine instruction highlights God's sovereignty and His willingness to allow human agency, even when it diverges from His ideal plan.<p><b>&#8220;Appoint a king for them.&#8221;</b><br>God's directive to appoint a king is both a concession and a judgment. While it fulfills the people's request, it also serves as a test of their faithfulness. The appointment of a king is prophesied in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-20</a>, where God provides guidelines for a king who would lead according to His laws. This moment foreshadows the coming of Jesus Christ, the ultimate King, who perfectly embodies God's will and reigns with justice and righteousness.<p><b>Then Samuel told the men of Israel,</b><br>Samuel's role as a leader and prophet is evident as he communicates God's decision to the people. His obedience to God's command, despite his personal reservations (<a href="/1_samuel/8-6.htm">1 Samuel 8:6</a>), demonstrates his faithfulness. This act of communication is crucial in maintaining the covenant relationship between God and Israel, as Samuel serves as the bridge between divine will and human action.<p><b>&#8220;Everyone must go back to his city.&#8221;</b><br>This instruction signifies the conclusion of the assembly where the demand for a king was made. It reflects the decentralized nature of Israelite society at the time, where people lived in tribal territories. The dispersal to their cities indicates a return to daily life, but with the anticipation of a significant change in governance. This moment sets the stage for the anointing of Saul as the first king, which will bring both unity and challenges to the nation of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1.

said to Samuel.<p>&#8226; The request for a king was not a passing whim; it reflected Israel&#8217;s determination to be &#8220;like all the other nations&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>).<p>&#8226; God had already foreseen this day and allowed for it in <a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14-15</a>, proving that nothing surprises Him.<p>&#8226; By telling Samuel to listen, the LORD grants the people what they insist on, yet it is a sober concession, much like <a href="/psalms/106-15.htm">Psalm 106:15</a> describes: &#8220;So He gave them what they asked, but sent a wasting disease among them.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/hosea/13-11.htm">Hosea 13:11</a> later echoes this moment: &#8220;I gave you a king in My anger and took him away in My wrath,&#8221; underscoring that permission is not always approval.<p>&#8226; The literal narrative shows God respecting human choice while still reigning sovereign over its outcome.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Appoint

Samuel 9:17</a>), proving the LORD&#8217;s hand guides even a reluctant plan.<p>&#8226; Yet this step also advances His redemptive timeline; the monarchy leads to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>), and ultimately to Christ, &#8220;the Son of David&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a> notes, &#8220;In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.&#8221; The rise of a king addresses that chaos, though it cannot cure the deeper issue of the heart (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s instruction is literal: Israel will have a flesh-and-blood ruler, but the Lord remains King above all (<a

stands between God and the people&#8212;prophet as mediator.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a> reminds that a prophet must &#8220;speak whatever I command you.&#8221; Samuel does exactly that, even when the message grieves him (<a href="/1_samuel/8-6.htm">1 Samuel 8:6</a>).<p>&#8226; His transparency allows the nation to understand the gravity of their request and the steps to

He tells Samuel to listen, appoint, announce, and dismiss. The passage highlights divine sovereignty, human responsibility, and the unfolding path toward the ultimate King, Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Hearken unto their voice.</span>--And for the third time (see <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm" title="And the LORD said to Samuel, Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say to you: for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.">1Samuel 8:7</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/8-9.htm" title="Now therefore listen to their voice: however, yet protest solemnly to them, and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them.">1Samuel 8:9</a>) the voice of the Eternal, which Samuel the seer knew so well, used the same expression, bidding the reluctant and indignant old man comply with the request of the people. God had allowed His servant to remonstrate, well knowing all the time what would be the result of his remonstrances.<p>So now, with the self-same words with which He had spoken to the seer when at the first he laid the petition of Israel before the eternal throne, He finally directs Samuel respecting the course of action he was to pursue on this momentous occasion.<p><span class= "bld">The men of Israel.</span>--That is, to the elders. The words which follow, "Go ye every man unto his city," show that these elders were in truth a representative body, drawn from the chief centres of the land.<p>Attention has already been drawn to the perfect trust which the Eternal must have placed in Samuel the judge, seeing that He entrusted him with all the arrangements connected with this vital change in the Hebrew constitution, although his own downfall from power was necessarily involved in it. The confidence of the God-Friend of Israel in their upright judge was evidently shared in by the people. It was to their ruler, to the earthly head of their republic, that they in the first instance carried, through their representative chiefs, their request, which in other words said, "Let kings for the future, and not judges like yourself, rule over us." The elders of Israel seem to have listened respectfully to the urgent remonstrances of their great judge, and to have deliberated carefully over them, and then, still respectfully, but firmly, to have reiterated their first request, which asked for a king instead of a judge. Again they watched him go alone into the presence of the Eternal, and after the seer's solitary prayer, the "elders," at the bidding of their judge, dispersed quietly, each one journeying to his own city. They loved and trusted the patriot Samuel, and though they were ready to depose him, they waited till he should give them a sign.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hearken unto their voice.</span> The Divine consent is now given for the third time to their request (see vers. 7, 9). For the will of God ever leaves the will of man free, even when overruling it to the carrying out of some higher and fore ordained purpose. Everything was ripe in Israel for the change, but it was due to the moderation and disinterestedness of Samuel that the revolution was made without bloodshed or armed struggle. Ordinary rulers too often resist a popular demand, and stem back the flowing current of thought till it breaks through the opposing barrier, and sweeps with resistless violence all opposition away. Samuel yielded, and the nation trusted him so thoroughly that they left the choice of the king entirely to him, permitted him to settle the terms and limits of the monarchy, or, as we should say, to give the nation a constitution (<a href="/1_samuel/10-25.htm">1 Samuel 10:25</a>), and treated him throughout the rest of his life with the deepest respect. He was deprived neither of his prophetic rank nor of his judicial functions, for "Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life" (<a href="/1_samuel/7-15.htm">1 Samuel 7:15</a>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he remained to the last a coordinate power by the side of a king so self-willed and energetic even as Saul. <span class="cmt_word">Go ye every man unto his city.</span> Prudence forbade a hasty choice. It would be well to let the agitation subside, or otherwise some busy intriguer among the elders might have managed to get himself selected by the popular voice. We gather from <a href="/1_samuel/10-27.htm">1 Samuel 10:27</a> that there were leading men who felt aggrieved when the choice fell on none of them. But how wonderful is the confidence reposed in Samuel by the nation, when thus it left to the ruler whom virtually it was setting aside the choice of the person to whom he should cede his powers. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/8-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Listen</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1502;&#1463;&#1443;&#1506;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#601;&#183;ma&#8216;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8085.htm">Strong's 8085: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear intelligently</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to their voice,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1511;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#601;&#183;q&#333;&#183;w&#183;l&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b &#124;
