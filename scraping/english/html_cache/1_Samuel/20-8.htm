In the context of David and Jonathan's relationship, it underscores the deep bond and mutual commitment they share. The request for kindness is rooted in the covenant they have made, which is a solemn and binding agreement. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's covenant with His people, where He shows steadfast love and mercy.<p><b>for you have brought me into a covenant with you before the LORD</b><br>The covenant between David and Jonathan is not merely a personal agreement but is made "before the LORD," indicating its sacred nature. Covenants in the ancient Near East were serious commitments often sealed with sacrifices and oaths. This covenant is a type of the New Covenant in Christ, where believers are brought into a relationship with God through Jesus. The mention of the LORD highlights the divine witness and accountability in their agreement, emphasizing the spiritual dimension of their bond.<p><b>If there is iniquity in me, then kill me yourself</b><br>David's statement here is a testament to his integrity and trust in Jonathan. He is willing to face the ultimate consequence if he has wronged Jonathan or his family. This reflects the biblical principle of justice and personal accountability. It also foreshadows the sacrificial nature of Christ, who was without sin yet took upon Himself the iniquity of humanity. David's willingness to be judged by Jonathan alone shows the depth of trust and the seriousness with which he regards their covenant.<p><b>why should you bring me to your father?</b><br>David questions the need for Jonathan to involve King Saul, highlighting the tension and danger he faces. Saul's animosity towards David is well-documented, and David's plea underscores his vulnerability. This situation is a microcosm of the larger narrative of David's rise to kingship amidst opposition. It also reflects the theme of divine protection and providence, as God ultimately preserves David's life and fulfills His promises. The question reveals David's reliance on Jonathan's loyalty and the precariousness of his situation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, and a man after God's own heart.

The verse highlights the weight of covenant loyalty, the demand for righteous justice, and the courage required to stand with God&#8217;s anointed even against hostile authority.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">A covenant of the Lord with thee.</span>--It may at first sight seem strange that we have these last meetings of David and Jonathan told us in such detail--the speaker's very words quoted, and so many apparently trivial circumstances related.<p>The question, too, might be asked: Whence did the compiler of the book derive his intimate acquaintance with what took place at these meetings, when David was <span class= "ital">alone </span>with Jonathan? But the difficulties are only surface ones, for we must never forget how intensely interesting to the chosen people were all the circumstances connected with their loved king's life--never lose sight of the deathless interest with which they would hear and read the particulars of David's rise through great suffering and long trial to the throne; and this period here related in such detail was the turning-point of a grand career. From this moment, David's way diverged from the every-day life of ordinary duty and prosperity, and became, during a long and weary period, for him the way of almost uninterrupted suffering. The way of suffering and of trial is in all ages the royal road to true greatness. As to the <span class= "ital">source </span>whence the compiler of the book derived his knowledge of what passed at these last meetings of the two friends, Ewald suggests that when in after years David drew to his Court the posterity of Jonathan, <span class= "ital">he often told them himself of these last events before their separation </span>(events with which no one but the two friends could be acquainted).<p><span class= "bld">Slay me thyself.</span>--"This supposes that Jonathan had the right to inflict capital punishment for crimes against his father as king."--<span class= "ital">Lange. </span>This was David's last earnest request to the prince. If Jonathan felt there was any truth in the charges brought against him by Saul--if <span class= "ital">he </span>deemed his friend a traitor to the reigning dynasty--let him slay the betrayer himself there and then.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of Jehovah with thee.</span> As the friendship between Jonathan and David had been cemented by the invocation of the name of Jehovah, it was one firm and assured, and David might look not merely for one act of kindness, but for constant truth and help.
