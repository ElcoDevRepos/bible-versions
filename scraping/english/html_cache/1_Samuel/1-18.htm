The term "maidservant" indicates her submission and servitude, a common cultural expression of humility in ancient Israel. This phrase echoes the language of other biblical figures who sought divine favor, such as Mary in <a href="/luke/1-38.htm">Luke 1:38</a>. Hannah's request for favor is a turning point, showing her faith in God's ability to change her circumstances.<p><b>Then she went on her way,</b><br>This indicates a shift in Hannah's demeanor and actions. After her prayer, she leaves the temple with a sense of peace and resolution. The act of going on her way signifies a release of her burdens to God, trusting in His sovereignty. This mirrors the biblical principle of casting one's cares upon the Lord, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>.<p><b>and she began to eat,</b><br>Hannah's decision to eat again signifies a restoration of her spirit and hope. Previously, her grief had been so intense that she could not partake in the sacrificial meal (<a href="/1_samuel/1-7.htm">1 Samuel 1:7</a>). Her renewed appetite symbolizes her faith that God has heard her prayer, similar to how fasting and feasting are used in the Bible to denote mourning and celebration, respectively.<p><b>and her face was no longer downcast.</b><br>The change in Hannah's countenance reflects an inner transformation. Her faith and trust in God have replaced her sorrow and despair. This transformation is reminiscent of the joy and peace that believers experience when they trust in God's promises, as described in <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a>.
