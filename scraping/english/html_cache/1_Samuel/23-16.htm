Despite being the heir to the throne, Jonathan demonstrates remarkable loyalty and friendship to David, recognizing God's anointing on him. This relationship is a profound example of covenant friendship, reflecting the biblical theme of selfless love and loyalty. Jonathan's actions can be seen as a type of Christ, who also laid aside His rights for the sake of others.<p><b>came to David in Horesh</b><br>Horesh is located in the Wilderness of Ziph, a desolate area in the Judean wilderness. This setting underscores the danger and isolation David faced while fleeing from Saul. Jonathan's journey to Horesh highlights his courage and commitment to David, as he risks his own safety to support his friend. The wilderness often symbolizes a place of testing and preparation in the Bible, as seen in the lives of Moses and Jesus.<p><b>and strengthened his hand in God</b><br>This phrase indicates that Jonathan encouraged David spiritually, reminding him of God's promises and faithfulness. In times of distress, biblical figures often find strength in God's presence and promises, as seen in Psalms and the encouragement given by prophets. Jonathan's support is a reminder of the importance of godly friendships and community in sustaining faith.

The expression "strengthened his hand in God" is added by the narrator to show how sorely tried was the king of the future at this juncture, notwithstanding that so many gallant spirits rallied round him. The determined and relentless hostility of the king of the land, his sovereign, and once his friend--the apparent hopelessness of his struggle--the cruel ingratitude of whole bodies of his fellow countrymen, such as the men of Ziph--his homeless, outlawed condition: all these things naturally weighed upon the nervous and enthusiastic temperament of David, which was soon depressed. His sad forebodings in his desolateness and loneliness at this time are breathed forth in not a few of the Psalms which tradition ascribes to him. At such a juncture the warm sympathy, the steady onlook to a sunnier future of one like Jonathan was a real help to David. Jonathan was far-sighted enough when David's fortunes were at their lowest ebb to look confidently forward to a time when all these thick dark clouds of trouble should have passed away. Jonathan, we know (<a href="/context/1_samuel/20-14.htm" title="And you shall not only while yet I live show me the kindness of the LORD, that I die not:">1Samuel 20:14-15</a>) possessed sufficient confidence in David's future fortune even to ask the hunted exile to remember him, the prince, with kindness when he should have come into his kingdom. Such warm sympathy, such glowing trustful words, we may well imagine, raised the spirits of the outlaw, and gave him new courage to face the grave difficulties of his dangerous position.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jonathan... went to David into the wood.</span> To Horesh, as in ver. 15. This visit suggests two things: the first, that, after the scene in <a href="/1_samuel/22-8.htm">1 Samuel 22:8</a>, Saul was estranged from his son, and treated him harshly, regarding him as a fellow conspirator with David; the second, that there was a growing conviction, not only in Jonathan's mind, but generally, that Jehovah had transferred the kingdom from Saul to David, and that consequently David's final success was inevitable. He <span class="cmt_word">strengthened his</span> (David's) <span class="cmt_word">hand in God.</span> Such a visit, and the expression of Jonathan's strong conviction that Jehovah was with David, must necessarily have had a powerful moral effect upon his mind. Under such trying circumstances David must often have been tempted to despair; but the assurance of Jonathan's unbroken love for him, and the knowledge that he and many more regarded him as chosen by God to be Israel's king, would revive his courage and make him content to bear the hardships of his present lot. <span class="cmt_word">I shall be next unto thee.</span> Had he not been killed in Mount Gilboa, it seems that, unlike Ishbosheth, Jonathan would have resigned all claim to the crown. But the feeling must often have distressed David, that the kingdom could become his only by dispossessing his true and unselfish friend. Nor would such a regret be altogether removed by Jonathan's ready acquiescence in it as God's will, though, as next to him, and beloved as he deserved, his position as the king's friend would have been a not unenviable one. Still, to be second where by right of inheritance he should have been first would have been a very trying lot, and it was better for Jonathan that he should die a soldier's death, even granting that he would have felt a lively joy in David's success and the glory of his empire. But their love was to be exposed to no vicissitudes, and the two friends parted never to meet again - David remaining at Horesh, while Jonathan returned to his home at Gibeah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/23-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1433;&#1511;&#1464;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;q&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
