This event occurs after Samuel anoints David as the future king of Israel, though Saul remains the reigning king. David's journey to Saul's court is orchestrated by divine providence, setting the stage for his future leadership. The context of David's arrival is crucial, as it follows Saul's rejection by God due to disobedience, and the Spirit of the Lord departing from Saul. This transition highlights the beginning of David's rise and Saul's decline.<p><b>and entered his service</b><br>David's entry into Saul's service is a fulfillment of God's plan, as David is positioned to learn about leadership and governance firsthand. Serving in the royal court provides David with invaluable experience and insight into the workings of the kingdom. This service also places David in a position to influence and eventually lead Israel. The cultural context of the time would have seen such service as an honor, and it reflects David's humility and willingness to serve even under a king who has lost God's favor.<p><b>Saul loved him very much</b><br>Saul's initial affection for David is significant, as it demonstrates David's ability to win favor and trust. This love is likely due to David's musical talent, which soothes Saul's troubled spirit, as well as David's character and demeanor. The phrase also foreshadows the complex relationship between Saul and David, which will evolve from love to jealousy and enmity. This dynamic is a poignant reminder of the volatile nature of human relationships and the impact of sin and disobedience.<p><b>and David became his armor-bearer</b><br>The role of an armor-bearer was one of great trust and responsibility, as it involved close proximity to the king in times of battle. This position signifies David's growing importance in Saul's court and his rising status. It also symbolizes David's future role as a warrior king, prefiguring his leadership in battles for Israel. Theologically, David as an armor-bearer can be seen as a type of Christ, who bears the burdens of humanity and fights on behalf of His people. This role also foreshadows David's eventual leadership and the fulfillment of God's promise to establish his kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The youngest son of Jesse, anointed by Samuel to be the future king of Israel.

God&#8217;s providence is unmistakable:<p>&#8226; Earlier, the Lord had already identified David as king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-12.htm">1 Samuel 16:12&#8211;13</a>), yet He now sends David to serve the reigning monarch.<p>&#8226; Similar divine placements can be seen when Joseph is brought before Pharaoh (<a href="/genesis/41-14.htm">Genesis 41:14</a>) and when Esther enters the king&#8217;s palace (<a href="/esther/2-17.htm">Esther 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; This reminds us that God often introduces His chosen servants into positions of influence long before their ultimate assignment unfolds (<a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and entered his service</b><p>David &#8220;entered his service&#8221; (16:21b). Far from a token presence, David becomes an active attendant:<p>&#8226; He arrives with gifts from Jesse&#8212;bread, wine, and a young goat&#8212;signifying respectful submission (<a href="/1_samuel/16-20.htm">1 Samuel 16:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture commends such willing servanthood: &#8220;Serve with goodwill, as to the Lord and not to men&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-7.htm">Ephesians 6:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Faithfulness in small responsibilities precedes larger ones (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>), foreshadowing David&#8217;s future kingship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Saul loved him very much</b><p>&#8220;Saul loved him very much&#8221; (16:21c). God grants David immediate favor:<p>&#8226; Jonathan will soon echo this deep affection (<a href="/1_samuel/18-1.htm">1 Samuel 18:1&#8211;4</a>), showing how God surrounds David with allies.<p>&#8226; The pattern of divine favor also appears when the Lord grants Joseph favor in prison (<a href="/genesis/39-21.htm">Genesis 39:21</a>) and Daniel favor with the Babylonian chief official (<a href="/daniel/1-9.htm">Daniel 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Even Saul, who will later envy David, begins with sincere love&#8212;highlighting the complexity of human hearts under God&#8217;s overarching plan (<a href="/proverbs/21-1.htm">Proverbs 21:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and David became his armor-bearer</b><p>&#8220;and David became his armor-bearer&#8221; (16:21d). In ancient Israel, the armor-bearer was more than a weapons carrier:<p>&#8226; He enjoyed close proximity to the king, offering counsel and protection (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4</a>).<p>&#8226; This role trained David in warfare, court etiquette, and leadership&#8212;skills later evident when he commands troops (<a href="/1_samuel/18-5.htm">1 Samuel 18:5</a>) and writes psalms of battle praise (<a href="/psalms/144-1.htm">Psalm 144:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Other notable armor-bearer relationships, such as Jonathan&#8217;s unnamed aide (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6&#8211;14</a>) and Abimelech&#8217;s attendant (<a href="/judges/9-54.htm">Judges 9:54</a>), show how trusted this position was.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/16-21.htm">1 Samuel 16:21</a> records the precise, historical entry of David into Saul&#8217;s court. God orchestrates David&#8217;s journey from shepherd to servant, grants him favor with the king, and positions him as armor-bearer&#8212;all essential steps toward the throne. The verse testifies that when the Lord appoints someone, He also arranges every detail needed for future calling, using service, favor, and training to prepare His chosen servant.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">And he became his armour-bearer.</span>--But probably only for a very short time. David returned, we should conclude, to Samuel, whose pupil and friend we know he was. The seer was watching over the young man with a view to his lofty destiny. Saul apparently, from his question in <a href="/1_samuel/17-55.htm" title="And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I cannot tell.">1Samuel 17:55</a>, "Whose son is this youth?" had forgotten all about him. There is no "note of time," so we are not able to determine how long a period had elapsed between the events narrated in this chapter and the combat with the Philistines told in 1 Samuel 17. It is, however, likely that the king's malady, which was making rapid progress in this period of his reign, had already obscured his once powerful mind; his memory for the past was likely enough to have been treacherous.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David came to Saul, and stood before him.</span> The latter phrase means, "became one of his regular attendants." This, and his being appointed one of Saul's armour bearers, happened only after the lapse of some time. The armour bearer, like the esquire in the middle ages, had to carry his lord's lance, and sword, and shield, and was always a tried soldier, and one whom the king trusted. It was apparently after the combat with Goliath that Saul sent to Jesse, and asked that David might be always with him; and until his jealousy burst forth David was very dear to him, and his music exercised a soothing influence upon his melancholy. At first, probably, these fits of insanity came upon Saul only at distant intervals, but afterwards more frequently, and with such loss of self-control that he more than once tried to murder David, and even Jonathan, his own son. We have, then, here a summary of the relations of Saul to David until the unfortunate day when the king heard the women ascribe to the youthful soldier the higher honor (<a href="/1_samuel/18-7.htm">1 Samuel 18:7</a>); and thenceforward these friendly feelings gave way to a growing dislike which deprived Saul of a faithful servant, and finally cost him his crown and life on Mount Gilboa. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/16-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1491;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1489;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
