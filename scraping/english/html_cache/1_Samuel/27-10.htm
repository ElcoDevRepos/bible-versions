David, fleeing from Saul, sought refuge with the Philistines, Israel's enemies. The question implies a routine inquiry, suggesting a level of trust or expectation from Achish regarding David's activities. This period highlights David's strategic deception, as he led Achish to believe he was raiding Israelite territories, thus securing his position and safety. The cultural context of the time involved frequent raids and skirmishes, common in the ancient Near East as a means of survival and expansion.<p><b>And David would reply, &#8220;The Negev of Judah,&#8221;</b><br>David's response is part of his strategy to mislead Achish. The Negev of Judah refers to the southern desert region of Judah, a territory belonging to Israel. By claiming to raid his own people, David sought to convince Achish of his loyalty to the Philistines. This deception is significant in understanding David's cunning and resourcefulness. The Negev was a sparsely populated area, making it plausible for David to claim raids without immediate verification. This tactic also prevented Achish from suspecting David's true allegiance to Israel.<p><b>or &#8220;The Negev of Jerahmeel,&#8221;</b><br>The mention of the Negev of Jerahmeel indicates another region within the southern part of Judah. The Jerahmeelites were a clan within the tribe of Judah, suggesting David's familiarity with the internal divisions and territories of his own people. This knowledge allowed him to craft believable reports to Achish. The Jerahmeelites' inclusion highlights the complexity of tribal affiliations and the potential for internal conflict within Israel, which David navigated skillfully.<p><b>or &#8220;The Negev of the Kenites.&#8221;</b><br>The Kenites were a nomadic group with historical ties to Israel, particularly through Moses' father-in-law, Jethro, who was a Kenite. By claiming to raid the Kenites, David further distanced himself from suspicion, as the Kenites were not central to Israel's core tribes. This choice reflects David's understanding of regional politics and alliances. The Kenites' presence in the narrative underscores the diverse ethnic and cultural landscape of the region during this period. David's interactions with various groups foreshadow his future role as a unifying king over a diverse Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, currently living among the Philistines to escape King Saul's pursuit.

Each evening Achish &#8220;would ask him,&#8221; because David had pledged fealty and was expected to supply reports of his military activity. Achish assumed David was now raiding Israelites, severing all hope of reconciliation with Saul. David&#8217;s deceptive answers fed that assumption, protecting his true mission. Compare the way Pharaoh expected regular updates from Joseph in <a href="/genesis/41-16.htm">Genesis 41:16</a>, and note <a href="/proverbs/12-22.htm">Proverbs 12:22</a>&#8212;&#8220;Lying lips are detestable to the LORD.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;What have you raided today?&#8221;</b><p>The Philistine king&#8217;s question implies a routine: David was constantly on the move, fighting somewhere daily. Achish took comfort in that rhythm, believing it benefited Philistine security. Yet David&#8217;s pattern echoes Israel&#8217;s own wilderness campaigns (<a href="/numbers/21-1.htm">Numbers 21:1-3</a>). The verse underscores how God can employ even an enemy&#8217;s curiosity to shield His servant.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Negev of Judah</b><p>David&#8217;s first answer sounds like he attacked his own tribe&#8217;s southern settlements. Achish would conclude David&#8217;s bridge to Israel was burned. In reality David struck Amalekite outposts (<a href="/1_samuel/27-8.htm">1 Samuel 27:8-9</a>), enemies God had earlier marked for destruction (<a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14-16</a>). By naming &#8220;Judah,&#8221; David masked obedience to God&#8217;s longstanding command while maintaining Achish&#8217;s trust. Similar protective misdirection appears when Rahab hid the spies in <a href="/joshua/2-4.htm">Joshua 2:4-7</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Negev of Jerahmeel</b><p>Jerahmeelites were a clan within Judah (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-9.htm">1 Chronicles 2:9, 25</a>-26). Claiming to raid them deepened the illusion of David&#8217;s alienation from every branch of Israel. Meanwhile, wiping out Amalekites fulfilled <a href="/1_samuel/15-2.htm">1 Samuel 15:2-3</a>, which Saul had neglected. David&#8217;s report, though false in detail, advanced divine justice by eliminating those who preyed on Israel (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Negev of the Kenites</b><p>The Kenites had lived peaceably with Israel since showing kindness to Moses (<a href="/numbers/10-29.htm">Numbers 10:29-32</a>; <a href="/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>). Telling Achish he attacked them sounded like treachery to the very allies who had aided Israel early on. Again, the ruse convinced Achish David could never return home. God used David&#8217;s strategy to keep his forces hidden and unharmed, paralleling how Christ later moved in secrecy until &#8220;His hour had come&#8221; (<a href="/john/7-6.htm">John 7:6-10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>In <a href="/1_samuel/27-10.htm">1 Samuel 27:10</a> David offers calculated, misleading answers to Achish&#8217;s nightly inquiry. Each claimed target&#8212;Judah, Jerahmeel, Kenites&#8212;strengthened the lie that David had turned on his own people. In truth he was striking Israel&#8217;s historic enemies, fulfilling God&#8217;s directives and preserving his band. The verse shows how the Lord can sovereignly employ even imperfect tactics to protect His anointed and advance His purposes, while also warning that deceit, though temporarily expedient, carries moral weight before God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">And David said, Against the south of Judah.</span>--The answer of David to his sovereign lord, the King of Gath--for he was now, to all intents and purposes, a vassal prince of Achish--was simply a falsehood. He had been engaged in distant forays against the old Bedaween enemies of Israel, far away in the desert which stretched to the frontier of Egypt; and from these nomads--rich in cattle and in other property, which they had obtained by years of successful plunder--he seems to have gained much booty, a share of which he brought to his "suzerain," Achish. But David represents that the cattle and apparel had been captured from his own countrymen, whose territory he was harrying. "The Jerahmeelites were descendants of Jerahmeel, the firstborn of Hezron (<a href="/1_chronicles/2-9.htm" title="The sons also of Hezron, that were born to him; Jerahmeel, and Ram, and Chelubai.">1Chronicles 2:9</a>; <a href="/context/1_chronicles/2-25.htm" title="And the sons of Jerahmeel the firstborn of Hezron were, Ram the firstborn, and Bunah, and Oren, and Ozem, and Ahijah.">1Chronicles 2:25-26</a>), and therefore one of the three large families of Judah who sprang from Hezron."--<span class= "ital">Keil, </span>They dwelt, it is believed, on the southern frontier of the tribe of Judah.
