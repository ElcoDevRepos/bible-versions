The context is a time of war, where maintaining order and obedience is crucial. Saul's leadership is being tested, and his instructions reflect the need for discipline among the troops. The act of going among the troops signifies direct communication and personal involvement, emphasizing the importance of the message.<p><b>&#8216;Each man must bring me his ox or his sheep,</b><br>The mention of oxen and sheep indicates the presence of livestock among the troops, which was common in ancient times for sustenance. This reflects the pastoral lifestyle of the Israelites and their dependence on livestock for food. The requirement for each man to bring his own animal underscores personal responsibility and accountability within the community.<p><b>slaughter them in this place, and then eat.</b><br>The instruction to slaughter the animals in a specific place suggests a controlled and orderly process, possibly to ensure ritual purity and adherence to dietary laws. This reflects the Levitical laws concerning the proper handling and consumption of meat, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/17-3.htm">Leviticus 17:3-4</a>. The act of slaughtering and eating in a designated area also serves to prevent chaos and maintain unity among the troops.<p><b>Do not sin against the LORD by eating meat with the blood still in it.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This command is rooted in the Mosaic Law, specifically <a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>, which prohibits the consumption of blood. The blood is considered the life of the animal and is sacred to God. Eating meat with blood is seen as a serious offense, as it violates God's covenant with Israel. This reflects the broader biblical theme of life being sacred and belonging to God, and it underscores the importance of obedience to divine commandments.<p><b>So that night everyone brought his ox and slaughtered it there.</b><br>The response of the troops indicates compliance with Saul's command, highlighting the importance of obedience to leadership and divine law. The phrase "that night" suggests urgency and immediate action, reflecting the seriousness of the situation. This collective action also demonstrates unity and cooperation among the Israelites, which is crucial for their success and survival. The act of slaughtering the animals in accordance with Saul's instructions shows a return to proper worship and respect for God's laws.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is leading the Israelites in battle against the Philistines.

Personal responsibility, clear leadership, and immediate obedience blend together to protect Israel from sin and to reorient the army&#8217;s focus back to God&#8217;s holiness&#8212;an enduring lesson for every believer who handles God&#8217;s gifts and longs to honor Him in daily choices.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/14-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then he</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
