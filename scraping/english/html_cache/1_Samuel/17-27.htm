The "people" here refers to the Israelite soldiers who are discussing the rewards King Saul has promised to anyone who defeats Goliath. This reflects the communal nature of ancient Israelite society, where news and information were often shared verbally among the people. The offer itself is significant, as it demonstrates the desperation and fear among the Israelites, who were unable to face Goliath themselves. This moment also sets the stage for David's rise, as he is not motivated by the reward but by his faith in God.<p><b>about the offer, saying</b><br>The "offer" mentioned is a substantial reward promised by King Saul, which includes great wealth, the king's daughter in marriage, and exemption from taxes for the victor's family. This reflects the high stakes and the king's desperation to find a champion willing to face Goliath. The mention of the offer highlights the contrast between David's motivations and those of others; while many are enticed by the material rewards, David is driven by his zeal for God's honor.<p><b>&#8220;That is what will be done for the man who kills him.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase underscores the certainty and seriousness of the king's promise. The use of "will be done" indicates a formal and binding commitment from Saul, emphasizing the importance of defeating Goliath for the morale and future of Israel. The phrase also foreshadows David's eventual victory and the fulfillment of these promises, which play a crucial role in his journey to becoming king. This moment can be seen as a type of Christ, where David, like Jesus, steps forward to face a seemingly insurmountable enemy, not for personal gain, but for the deliverance of God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd who later becomes the king of Israel.

David has just arrived at the front lines (<a href="/1_samuel/17-22.htm">1 Samuel 17:22</a>) and is trying to understand why Israel is allowing Goliath to taunt them.<p>&#8226; The &#8220;people&#8221; are the soldiers near David; they repeat what Saul has announced in verse 25&#8212;great riches, the king&#8217;s daughter in marriage, and tax&#8208;free status for the hero&#8217;s family.<p>&#8226; Their words highlight Saul&#8217;s reliance on earthly incentives rather than personal faith to confront the giant, a contrast to passages where leaders themselves step forward in faith (<a href="/joshua/10-24.htm">Joshua 10:24&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; By recording this conversation, the Spirit shows how human motivations often revolve around reward, yet God looks at the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>; cf. <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19&#8211;21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>about the offer, saying</b><p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;saying&#8221; signals an emphatic, repeated report; multiple eyewitnesses confirm Saul&#8217;s pledge, fulfilling the principle that &#8220;every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Repetition underscores the seriousness of the king&#8217;s promise and the desperation of Israel&#8217;s army (<a href="/1_samuel/17-11.htm">1 Samuel 17:11</a>).<p>&#8226; It also sets up David&#8217;s later appeal when he reminds Saul that he has already killed lion and bear and trusts the Lord to deliver him from Goliath (verses 34&#8211;37), showing that faith, not incentives, ultimately moves him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;That is what will be done for the man who kills him.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The soldiers quote the king verbatim, as if reciting a royal proclamation (compare <a href="/esther/6-6.htm">Esther 6:6&#8211;9</a>, where a reward is carefully detailed).<p>&#8226; The promised reward is tangible, yet David&#8217;s focus quickly shifts to the spiritual issue: &#8220;Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?&#8221; (verse 26).<p>&#8226; Scripture often pairs earthly reward with a higher purpose&#8212;Abram declining the king of Sodom&#8217;s riches to keep God&#8217;s glory spotless (<a href="/genesis/14-22.htm">Genesis 14:22&#8211;23</a>), Moses choosing &#8220;the reproach of Christ&#8221; over Egyptian treasures (<a href="/hebrews/11-24.htm">Hebrews 11:24&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8226; Here, the verse reminds us that God may use human incentives, but He ultimately seeks servants whose chief reward is His honor (<a href="/psalms/19-9.htm">Psalm 19:9&#8211;11</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/17-27.htm">1 Samuel 17:27</a> captures the soldiers&#8217; repetition of Saul&#8217;s reward offer. The line exposes Israel&#8217;s fear, Saul&#8217;s reliance on material motivation, and the contrast between human incentives and genuine faith. David hears the same promise everyone else hears, yet his heart is fixed on defending God&#8217;s name. In the larger narrative, the verse prepares us to see that the true victory&#8212;and the true reward&#8212;belong to those who trust the living God rather than earthly gain.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1506;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
