Her role as a medium was to communicate with the dead, a practice forbidden by the Law of Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>). Her response indicates awareness and caution, suggesting she was wary of strangers due to the recent actions of King Saul.<p><b>Surely you know what Saul has done</b><br>This phrase highlights the notoriety of Saul's actions against mediums and spiritists. Saul, in an attempt to rid Israel of practices contrary to the worship of Yahweh, had expelled or executed those who practiced divination and necromancy. This was in accordance with the Torah, which prohibited such practices (<a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>).<p><b>how he has killed the mediums and spiritists in the land</b><br>The historical context here is significant. Saul's actions were part of a broader effort to purify Israel from pagan practices. This reflects the ongoing struggle in Israel to maintain covenant faithfulness amidst surrounding pagan influences. The killing of mediums and spiritists was a fulfillment of the command in <a href="/exodus/22-18.htm">Exodus 22:18</a>, "You shall not permit a sorceress to live."<p><b>Why have you set a trap to get me killed?</b><br>The woman's question reveals her fear of entrapment and execution. It underscores the danger she faced in practicing her trade under Saul's edict. This also reflects the tension and fear prevalent in Israel during Saul's reign, as he was known for his unpredictable behavior.

Sorcerers and witches, like the woman of En-dor, had, no doubt, been often hunted down by means of informers. The woman possibly at first suspected that something of the kind was intended now. The old tradition, however, which represents the two companions of the king as Abner and Amasa, would preclude such a supposition. Still, in any event, the act of summoning the dead was a capital offence, and the woman would be on her guard, even in the presence of her near relatives, which the old tradition asserts Abner and Amasa to have been. She may, too, by enhancing the peril in which she stood, have thought a larger present would be extorted from the stranger who sought her aid.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou knowest what Saul hath done.</span> Not only had Saul in the earlier part of his reign been earnest in his zeal for the Mosaic law, but even now it seems as if a witch was in danger of death;
