The annual pilgrimage to Shiloh, where the tabernacle was located, was a significant event for Israelite families, as prescribed in <a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>. The repetition of this cycle underscores the enduring nature of Hannah's suffering and the test of her faith. It reflects the broader biblical theme of perseverance through trials, as seen in <a href="/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2-4</a>.<p><b>Whenever Hannah went up to the house of the LORD,</b><br>The "house of the LORD" refers to the tabernacle at Shiloh, the central place of worship before the construction of Solomon's Temple. This was a place where Israelites gathered for worship and sacrifice, as outlined in <a href="/exodus/23-14.htm">Exodus 23:14-17</a>. Hannah's devotion is evident in her regular attendance, demonstrating her faithfulness despite personal anguish. This setting foreshadows the importance of the temple in later biblical narratives and the centrality of worship in the life of believers.<p><b>her rival taunted her</b><br>Hannah's rival, Peninnah, is described as provoking her, which adds a personal and emotional dimension to Hannah's suffering. This rivalry is reminiscent of other biblical narratives of familial strife, such as Sarah and Hagar in <a href="/genesis/16.htm">Genesis 16</a>. The taunting reflects the cultural importance of childbearing in ancient Israel, where a woman's worth was often measured by her ability to bear children, as seen in <a href="/genesis/30.htm">Genesis 30:1-2</a>.<p><b>until she wept and would not eat.</b><br>Hannah's response of weeping and fasting indicates the depth of her distress. Fasting is a common biblical expression of mourning or seeking God's intervention, as seen in <a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a> and <a href="/psalms/35-13.htm">Psalm 35:13</a>. Her emotional turmoil is a poignant reminder of the human experience of suffering and the need for divine comfort. This moment sets the stage for Hannah's fervent prayer and vow to God, leading to the birth of Samuel, a pivotal figure in Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hannah.htm">Hannah</a></b><br>A devout woman who was deeply distressed by her inability to bear children.
