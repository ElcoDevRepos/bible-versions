This decision is significant given David's ancestry; his great-grandmother Ruth was a Moabitess (<a href="/ruth/4-13.htm">Ruth 4:13-22</a>). This connection may have influenced the king's willingness to provide sanctuary. Moab, located east of the Dead Sea, was often in conflict with Israel, yet at this time, they offered protection to David's family. This act of seeking refuge in Moab highlights the complex political and familial ties in the ancient Near East.<p><b>and they stayed with him</b><br>David's family remained under the protection of the Moabite king, indicating a period of safety and stability amidst David's turbulent life. This arrangement suggests a level of trust and diplomacy between David and the Moabite king. It also reflects the precarious nature of David's situation, as he had to rely on foreign allies for the safety of his family.<p><b>the whole time David was in the stronghold</b><br>The "stronghold" likely refers to the cave of Adullam or another secure location where David and his men took refuge (<a href="/1_samuel/22.htm">1 Samuel 22:1-2</a>). During this time, David gathered a group of followers, including those in distress, debt, or discontented, forming the core of his future leadership. This period of hiding and preparation parallels the wilderness experiences of other biblical figures, such as Moses and Elijah, and foreshadows Christ's own time of testing and preparation before His public ministry. David's reliance on God during this time is a recurring theme, as seen in the Psalms attributed to him during his years of fleeing from Saul.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, currently fleeing from King Saul.
