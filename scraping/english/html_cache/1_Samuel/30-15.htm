This question reflects David's leadership and determination to protect his people. The Amalekites were long-standing enemies of Israel, first encountered in <a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>. David's inquiry shows his reliance on God's providence, as he had earlier sought the Lord's guidance in <a href="/1_samuel/30-8.htm">1 Samuel 30:8</a>. This pursuit is a continuation of the divine directive to recover all that was taken.<p><b>And the man replied, &#8220;Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or deliver me into the hand of my master,</b><br>The man in question is an Egyptian servant abandoned by the Amalekites. His request for an oath "by God" indicates a recognition of the power and authority of the God of Israel, even among foreigners. This reflects the cultural practice of swearing oaths as binding agreements, seen in <a href="/genesis/21-23.htm">Genesis 21:23-24</a> with Abraham and Abimelech. The servant's fear of being returned to his master highlights the harsh realities of servitude and the potential for severe punishment or death, common in ancient Near Eastern societies.<p><b>and I will lead you to them.&#8221;</b><br>The Egyptian servant's willingness to guide David to the Amalekite raiders in exchange for his life demonstrates the providential role he plays in David's mission. This mirrors other biblical instances where God uses unexpected individuals to fulfill His purposes, such as Rahab in <a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>. The servant's guidance is crucial for David's success, emphasizing themes of divine intervention and the fulfillment of God's promises, as seen in David's earlier assurance from God that he would "surely overtake them and succeed in the rescue" (<a href="/1_samuel/30-8.htm">1 Samuel 30:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, who is seeking to recover his people and possessions after the Amalekites raided Ziklag.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_egyptian_servant.htm">The Egyptian Servant</a></b><br>A servant of an Amalekite, left for dead, who becomes a crucial informant for David.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_amalekites.htm">The Amalekites</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe that raided Ziklag, taking captives and plundering the city.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziklag.htm">Ziklag</a></b><br>The city given to David by the Philistine king Achish, which was attacked by the Amalekites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_raiding_party.htm">The Raiding Party</a></b><br>The group of Amalekites responsible for the attack on Ziklag.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_providence_in_unexpected_places.htm">Divine Providence in Unexpected Places</a></b><br>God often provides help from unexpected sources.

<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s words show faith in Scripture&#8217;s pattern: God guides His people step by step, often through ordinary conversations (<a href="/proverbs/3-6.htm">Proverbs 3:6</a>;
