This reflects the theocratic nature of Israel's leadership, where God is the ultimate authority. Saul's invocation of God highlights the seriousness of the situation and his reliance on divine guidance.<p><b>&#8220;Why have You not answered Your servant this day?</b><br>Saul's question indicates a period of silence from God, which in the Old Testament often signifies a need for introspection or repentance. This silence could be seen as a divine test or a consequence of disobedience, as seen in other instances where God withholds guidance due to sin (e.g., <a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>).<p><b>If the fault is with me or my son Jonathan,</b><br>Saul acknowledges the possibility of personal or familial sin affecting the nation's standing with God. This reflects the biblical principle that leaders' actions can have corporate consequences, as seen in the stories of Achan (Joshua 7) and David (2 Samuel 24).<p><b>respond with Urim,</b><br>The Urim, along with the Thummim, were part of the high priest's breastplate used for divination or seeking God's will (<a href="/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>). Their exact nature is unknown, but they were likely stones or objects used to discern God's judgment. This practice underscores the importance of seeking divine direction in decision-making.<p><b>but if the fault is with the men of Israel, respond with Thummim.&#8221;</b><br>Saul sets a clear dichotomy for divine judgment, using the Thummim to determine collective guilt. This reflects the communal aspect of Israelite society, where the actions of individuals or groups could impact the entire community, as seen in the covenantal blessings and curses (Deuteronomy 28).<p><b>And Jonathan and Saul were selected,</b><br>The selection of Jonathan and Saul indicates that the issue lies within the royal family. This moment foreshadows the eventual downfall of Saul's dynasty due to disobedience and highlights the biblical theme of accountability for leaders.<p><b>but the people were cleared of the charge.</b><br>The exoneration of the people emphasizes the justice of God's decision-making process. It also serves to maintain unity and morale among the Israelites by clarifying that the fault does not lie with them, thus preserving the integrity of the community.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, chosen by God but later rejected due to disobedience.

Saul turns directly to &#8220;the LORD, the God of Israel,&#8221; acknowledging Him as the covenant-keeping God who rules the nation (<a href="/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>).<p>&#8226; His approach underscores that military success, national direction, and personal vindication must come from God, not human strategy (<a href="/1_samuel/13-11.htm">1 Samuel 13:11-12</a>; <a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Although Saul&#8217;s earlier disobedience strained his relationship with the LORD (<a href="/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13-14</a>), he still expects divine guidance, reflecting the ongoing patience God often shows His leaders (<a href="/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why have You not answered Your servant this day?</b><p>&#8226; Saul recognizes that the LORD&#8217;s silence signals a problem; unanswered prayer can expose hidden sin or misplaced priorities (<a href="/psalms/66-18.htm">Psalm 66:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/59-1.htm">Isaiah 59:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;Your servant&#8221; sounds humble, yet Saul&#8217;s track record reveals a conflicted heart&#8212;zealous in crisis, careless in obedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22-23</a>; <a href="/james/1-8.htm">James 1:8</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s silence sets the stage for self-examination, mirroring situations like Joshua&#8217;s pursuit of Ai after Achan&#8217;s sin (<a href="/joshua/7-10.htm">Joshua 7:10-12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If the fault is with me or my son Jonathan, respond with Urim</b><p>&#8226; Saul invites God to spotlight sin even if it implicates the royal house, echoing David&#8217;s later willingness to be judged (<a href="/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Urim and Thummim were sacred lots kept in the high priest&#8217;s breastpiece for decisive yes/no answers (<a href="/leviticus/8-8.htm">Leviticus 8:8</a>; <a href="/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming himself and Jonathan first, Saul appears self-sacrificing, yet he is also eager to justify his earlier rash oath that put Jonathan at risk (<a href="/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If the fault is with the men of Israel, respond with Thummim</b><p>&#8226; Saul widens the search to the whole army, assuming collective guilt is possible (<a href="/leviticus/4-13.htm">Leviticus 4:13-15</a>).<p>&#8226; His request still places God&#8217;s verdict above human suspicion, affirming that &#8220;the lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/16-33.htm">Proverbs 16:33</a>).<p>&#8226; The king seeks clarity before proceeding, a needed pattern for any leader facing moral ambiguity (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And Jonathan and Saul were selected</b><p>&#8226; The sacred lot falls on the royal pair, immediately shifting suspicion from the troops to the throne (<a href="/1_samuel/14-42.htm">1 Samuel 14:42</a>).<p>&#8226; God isolates the very relationship affected by Saul&#8217;s oath, illustrating that leadership sins often ensnare the innocent (<a href="/1_chronicles/21-17.htm">1 Chronicles 21:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Jonathan&#8217;s earlier victory (<a href="/1_samuel/14-13.htm">1 Samuel 14:13-14</a>) contrasted with Saul&#8217;s rash vow, showing how one family can embody both faith and folly (<a href="/hebrews/12-1.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But the people were cleared of the charge</b><p>&#8226; God vindicates the army, protecting them from wrongful blame (<a href="/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The verdict highlights divine justice: sin is pinpointed precisely, never indiscriminately (<a href="/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>; <a href="/romans/2-2.htm">Romans 2:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Their clearance reinforces corporate unity and prevents unnecessary discipline, preserving morale for continued battle (<a href="/1_samuel/14-45.htm">1 Samuel 14:45-46</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/14-41.htm">1 Samuel 14:41</a> shows a king confronting divine silence and seeking clarity through Urim and Thummim. God answers by exposing the true sphere of guilt&#8212;Saul&#8217;s household&#8212;while exonerating the people. The passage underscores that the LORD remains the ultimate judge, that sin in leadership hinders divine guidance, and that sincere&#8212;even if imperfect&#8212;appeals for God&#8217;s verdict receive a precise, just response.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(41) <span class= "bld">Give a perfect lot.</span>--The rendering in the margin, "show the innocent," is a better and more accurate rendering of the Hebrew.
