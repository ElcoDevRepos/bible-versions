The "third day" often signifies a period of completion or transition in biblical narratives, as seen in the resurrection of Jesus Christ on the third day (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>). It suggests a significant event is about to unfold.<p><b>David and his men arrived in Ziklag</b><br>Ziklag was a city given to David by Achish, the Philistine king of Gath, as a place of refuge (<a href="/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a>). It served as a base for David during his time of exile from King Saul. The arrival in Ziklag marks a return to their home base, expecting safety and rest. This city is located in the Negev region, a semi-arid area in the southern part of ancient Israel, which was strategically important.<p><b>and the Amalekites had raided the Negev</b><br>The Amalekites were a nomadic tribe and long-standing enemies of Israel, first encountered in <a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>. Their raid on the Negev, a region south of Judah, reflects their opportunistic and hostile nature. This act of aggression fulfills the ongoing conflict between Israel and Amalek, as God had declared perpetual war against Amalek (<a href="/exodus/17-16.htm">Exodus 17:16</a>).<p><b>attacked Ziklag</b><br>The attack on Ziklag was a direct assault on David's temporary home and his people. This event highlights the vulnerability of David's position while living among the Philistines. It also sets the stage for David's leadership and reliance on God in times of crisis, foreshadowing his future role as king.<p><b>and burned it down</b><br>The burning of Ziklag signifies total destruction and loss, leaving David and his men without a home. This devastation is reminiscent of the trials faced by God's people throughout history, often leading to a deeper dependence on God. It also prefigures the ultimate deliverance and restoration that God promises to His people, as seen in the prophetic hope of a new heaven and new earth (<a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, currently leading a group of men while in exile from King Saul.

This dismissal could hardly have taken place at Shunem, in the Esdraelon (Jezreel) Vale, for Shunem is some ninety miles distant from Ziklag.
