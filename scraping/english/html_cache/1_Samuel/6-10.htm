In the broader biblical context, obedience to divine instruction is a recurring theme, seen in figures like Noah (<a href="/genesis/6-22.htm">Genesis 6:22</a>) and Abraham (<a href="/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>). The Philistines, though not followers of Yahweh, recognize the power of the God of Israel and act accordingly, demonstrating a universal acknowledgment of divine authority.<p><b>They took two milk cows,</b><br>Milk cows, or cows that have recently given birth and are nursing calves, are significant in this context. These cows would naturally resist leaving their calves, making their selection a test of divine intervention. The use of milk cows underscores the miraculous nature of the event, as it would be against their natural instincts to leave their young. This mirrors other biblical instances where God uses the natural world to demonstrate His power, such as the parting of the Red Sea (<a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21</a>).<p><b>hitched them to the cart,</b><br>The cart was used to transport the Ark of the Covenant back to Israel. This method of transport contrasts with the prescribed method given to the Israelites, where the Ark was to be carried by Levites using poles (<a href="/exodus/25-14.htm">Exodus 25:14</a>). The Philistines' use of a cart reflects their lack of understanding of the sacred protocols associated with the Ark, yet God still uses their actions to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>and penned up their calves.</b><br>By penning up the calves, the Philistines create a situation where the cows would naturally want to return to their young. This sets the stage for a clear sign of divine intervention if the cows proceed towards Israel instead. This act is a test to determine whether the calamities they experienced were indeed caused by the God of Israel. The outcome, where the cows head straight for Israel, serves as a confirmation of God's hand in the events, similar to the signs given to Gideon (<a href="/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36-40</a>).<div

Mean</div><b>So the men did as instructed</b><p>The Philistine leaders followed the precise directions given by their priests and diviners (<a href="/1_samuel/6-7.htm">1 Samuel 6:7&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience, even among pagans, underscores the universal principle that God honors compliance with His revealed will&#8212;compare Israel&#8217;s &#8220;the Israelites had done all the work just as the LORD had commanded Moses&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/39-42.htm">Exodus 39:42</a>) and Samuel&#8217;s reminder that &#8220;to obey is better than sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Their action sets the stage for God to demonstrate His power; when humans do what He says, He takes full responsibility for the outcome (<a

calves and unaccustomed to pulling loads.<p>&#8226; Choosing these cows created a test only God could pass. Left to natural instinct, the animals would stay near their young.<p>&#8226; This mirrors earlier divine tests that required animals unused to labor&#8212;such as the heifer with &#8220;no yoke&#8221; in <a href="/numbers/19-2.htm">Numbers 19:2</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/21-3.htm">Deuteronomy 21:3</a>&#8212;highlighting purity and the direct intervention of the LORD.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>hitched them to the cart</b><p>The cows were placed under a yoke for the first time and attached to a brand-new cart (<a href="/1_samuel/6-7.htm">1 Samuel 6:7</a>).<p>&#8226; A new cart symbolized respect for the holy object it carried, just as later &#8220;they set the ark of God on a new cart&#8221; in David&#8217;s day (<a href="/2_samuel/6-3.htm">2 Samuel 6:3</a>).<p>&#8226; By yoking untrained animals, the Philistines acknowledged that only the God of Israel could direct their path&#8212;echoing the proverb, &#8220;The horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory belongs to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and penned up their calves</b><p>Separating the cows from their nursing calves removed every earthly incentive for the animals to head toward Israel.<p>&#8226; Their natural pull would be back to the pen.

By selecting nursing cows, yoking them to a new cart, and shutting their calves away, the Philistines removed every natural reason for the animals to travel toward Israel. When the cows defy instinct and head straight for Beth-shemesh, all doubt vanishes: the LORD alone directed their steps. The verse reminds us that obedient action, even by those outside the covenant, becomes a stage on which God displays His absolute power and faithfulness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/6-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
