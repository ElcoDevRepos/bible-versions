This act of speaking well of David highlights Jonathan's integrity and courage, as he risks his own standing with his father to defend David. This moment reflects the biblical principle of advocating for righteousness and truth, even when it is difficult. Jonathan's actions can be seen as a type of Christ, who intercedes on behalf of others.<p><b>and said to him, &#8220;The king should not sin against his servant David;</b><br>Jonathan appeals to Saul's conscience, urging him not to commit sin by harming David. This phrase underscores the biblical theme of accountability and the importance of leaders acting justly. The use of the term "sin" indicates a moral and spiritual dimension to Saul's potential actions, reminding readers of the gravity of sin against God's anointed.<p><b>he has not sinned against you.</b><br>Jonathan defends David's innocence, emphasizing that David has done nothing to warrant Saul's hostility. This assertion of David's righteousness is significant, as it aligns with the biblical narrative of David as a man after God's own heart. It also foreshadows the unjust persecution that Jesus would face, despite His innocence.<p><b>In fact, his actions have been highly beneficial to you.</b><br>Jonathan highlights the positive contributions David has made to Saul's reign, including his victory over Goliath and his leadership in battle. This phrase points to the biblical principle of recognizing and valuing the contributions of others. It also serves as a reminder of God's providence in using individuals for the greater good, even when they face opposition.

"See,' urged the eloquent pleader for his friend's life, "on that ever memorable occasion when he fought the giant, when he aimed the pebble of the brook from his shepherd's sling, he put his life in his hand.

And Saul, fickle and selfish, yet not destitute of noble feelings, repents of his purpose, and with characteristic impetuosity takes an oath that David's life shall be spared.
