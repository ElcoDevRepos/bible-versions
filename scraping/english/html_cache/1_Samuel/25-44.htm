Michal, originally given to David as a wife, was a political move by Saul to strengthen ties with David. However, Saul's later decision to give her to another man indicates his desire to undermine David's position and legitimacy. This act can be seen as part of Saul's broader attempts to thwart God's plan for David to become king.<p><b>David&#8217;s wife</b><br>Michal's status as David's wife is significant because it highlights the personal cost of Saul's jealousy and the political maneuvering in ancient Israel. David's marriage to Michal was not just a personal union but also a political alliance. The disruption of this marriage by Saul's actions underscores the instability and personal sacrifices involved in David's rise to power.<p><b>to Palti son of Laish</b><br>Palti, also known as Paltiel, is introduced here as Michal's new husband. This change in marital status was not initiated by Michal or David but by Saul, reflecting the lack of agency women often had in ancient times. Palti's acceptance of Michal as his wife, despite her previous marriage to David, may indicate his loyalty to Saul or his own political aspirations.<p><b>who was from Gallim</b><br>Gallim is a location mentioned in the Bible, though its exact site is not definitively known today. It is referenced in <a href="/isaiah/10-30.htm">Isaiah 10:30</a>, suggesting it was a place of some significance.

Earlier Saul promised Michal to David &#8220;for a hundred Philistine foreskins&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/18-25.htm">1 Samuel 18:25, 27</a>), yet once David fled for his life (<a href="/1_samuel/19-10.htm">1 Samuel 19:10&#8211;11</a>), Saul&#8217;s loyalty to that covenant evaporated.<p>&#8226; The text reminds us how Saul&#8217;s jealousy caused him to break oaths (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/20-30.htm">1 Samuel 20:30&#8211;33</a>). Just as he once reneged on Jonathan&#8217;s plea for David&#8217;s safety, he now reneges on the marriage vow, showing a pattern of unfaithfulness that contrasts starkly with God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness (<a href="/psalms/89-34.htm">Psalm 89:34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>David&#8217;s wife</b><p>&#8226; The narrator purposely calls Michal &#8220;David&#8217;s wife&#8221; even while noting Saul&#8217;s action, reinforcing the legitimacy of the original marriage. God&#8217;s Word treats their union as ongoing despite Saul&#8217;s interference (cf. <a href="/2_samuel/3-14.htm">2 Samuel 3:14</a>, where David still refers to her as &#8220;my wife&#8221;).<p>&#8226; This wording foreshadows David&#8217;s demand that Michal be restored when he becomes king&#8212;indicating her rightful place was always beside David.<p>&#8226; The phrase also highlights the cost of Saul&#8217;s vendetta: David not only lost his safety and position but also, for a season, his wife (<a href="/bsb/psalms/59.htm">Psalm 59</a> superscription, traditionally tied to this period, echoes that anguish).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to Palti son of Laish</b><p>&#8226; Palti&#8212;elsewhere called &#8220;Paltiel&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/3-15.htm">2 Samuel 3:15</a>)&#8212;possibly accepted the marriage for political allegiance, showing how Saul leveraged family ties to retain loyalty in Israel, much like he had offered Merab earlier to Adriel (<a href="/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17&#8211;19</a>).<p>&#8226; While Scripture later notes that Palti wept when Michal was taken back (<a href="/2_samuel/3-16.htm">2 Samuel 3:16</a>), it never portrays him as culpable; Saul is the initiator of the disorder.<p>&#8226; This episode illustrates how sin at the top ripples outward, ensnaring others in painful circumstances&#8212;echoing <a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>, &#8220;When the wicked rule, the people groan.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who was from Gallim</b><p>&#8226; Gallim, a Benjaminite village (<a href="/isaiah/10-30.htm">Isaiah 10:30</a>), situates the narrative geographically: Saul kept marital alliances within his own tribe, attempting to consolidate power among familiar clans.<p>&#8226; By highlighting Gallim, the narrator subtly reminds readers that the conflict remains a family feud within Benjamin&#8212;Saul versus the anointed king-in-waiting from Judah (<a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1, 13</a>).<p>&#8226; The contrast of tribal loyalties sets the stage for future reconciliation under David&#8217;s eventual reign, fulfilling God&#8217;s promise of unity in <a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1&#8211;5</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Saul&#8217;s act of giving Michal to Palti was a calculated maneuver born of jealousy and fear. Scripture insists Michal remained &#8220;David&#8217;s wife,&#8221; underscoring the sanctity of the original covenant and highlighting Saul&#8217;s breach of both familial and divine obligations. Palti and Gallim serve to show how Saul harnessed tribal and political ties to resist God&#8217;s plan. Yet even this detour could not derail the Lord&#8217;s purpose: Michal would be restored, David would ascend, and God&#8217;s faithfulness would eclipse Saul&#8217;s unfaithfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(44) <span class= "bld">Michal his daughter.</span>--The marriage of the Princess Michal to Phalti (Michal, we read, "loved David," <a href="/1_samuel/18-20.htm" title="And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.">1Samuel 18:20</a>) had taken place probably some time before. This high-handed act showed on the part of Saul a fixed determination to break utterly and for ever with David. Phalti was presumably a chieftain whom Saul was desirous of attracting to his fortunes. But the story of Miehal does not end here. After King Saul's death, Abner, the uncle (or perhaps the cousin) of the late king, the well-known captain of his host, made overtures to David. David, however, only consented to a friendship with Abner if his young kins woman, the Princess Miehal, Saul's daughter, was taken away from Phalti, and restored to him as his wife. Abner, we read, complied with the condition, and Miehal was taken from Phaltiel--as he is called in the account of this transaction, contained in <a href="/2_samuel/3-13.htm" title="And he said, Well; I will make a league with you: but one thing I require of you, that is, You shall not see my face, except you first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when you come to see my face.">2Samuel 3:13</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/3-16.htm" title="And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim.

And he returned.">2Samuel 3:16</a><a href="/1_samuel/25-44.htm" title="But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.">1Samuel 25:44</a> the second husband of David's wife is called Phalti, and in <a href="/2_samuel/3-15.htm" title="And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.">2Samuel 3:15</a> he is called Phaltiel. Rabbi Jochanan said his name received that extension (el=God) to indicate that <span class= "ital">God </span>had <span class= "ital">saved </span>him from transgression. (The name <span class= "ital">Phalti </span>being derived from the root <span class= "ital">palat--</span>to cause to escape, Michal and Phalti never having lived together as man and wife.)--Treatise <span class= "ital">Sanhedrin, </span>fol. 19, Colossians 2.<p>Once more the daughter of Saul appears in the sacred history. (See <a href="/context/2_samuel/6-20.htm" title="Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!">2Samuel 6:20-23</a>.) It was the greatest day in David's life--the Ark of the Covenant was being brought up with solemn pomp from its place of long exile in Kirjath-jearim to the new sacred capital of the loved king. One sad incident alone, we are told, marred the glories of the day. Michal, his wife, as Stanley thinks, in the proud, almost conservative, spirit of the older dynasty, not without a thought of her father's fallen house, looked on contemptuously as King David danced before the Ark with the priests, his royal robes thrown aside; and later in the day seems to have poured out before the king her scornful feelings. . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/25-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1431;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
