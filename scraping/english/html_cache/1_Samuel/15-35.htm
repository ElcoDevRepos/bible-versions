Samuel, the last judge and a prophet, had anointed Saul as king under God's direction. However, Saul's disobedience led to God's rejection of him as king. The separation signifies a divine judgment and a shift in leadership, as God prepares to anoint David. This also underscores the seriousness of Saul's disobedience and the resulting consequences. The phrase reflects the gravity of divine rejection and the end of a prophetic relationship.<p><b>Samuel mourned for Saul,</b><br>Samuel's mourning indicates his deep sorrow over Saul's failure and the resulting consequences for Israel. Despite Saul's disobedience, Samuel's grief shows his compassion and concern for the nation and its leadership. This mourning can be compared to the grief of God over human sinfulness, reflecting a heart aligned with God's purposes. Samuel's lamentation is reminiscent of other biblical figures who mourned over the spiritual state of God's people, such as Jeremiah and Jesus.<p><b>and the LORD regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel.</b><br>The term "regretted" here is anthropopathic, attributing human emotions to God to convey His displeasure with Saul's actions. This does not imply a change in God's nature or plan but highlights the seriousness of Saul's failure to fulfill his role as king. The regret is a reflection of God's holiness and justice, as well as His desire for obedience from His chosen leaders. This phrase connects to other instances where God expresses regret or sorrow over human sin, such as in <a href="/genesis/6-6.htm">Genesis 6:6</a> before the flood. It also foreshadows the coming of a king after God's own heart, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who perfectly obeys the Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel who anointed Saul as the first king.

Compare <a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>, where Saul seeks the Lord but receives no answer.<p>&#8226; The absence of a faithful prophet leaves Saul spiritually isolated, anticipating the later judgment described in <a href="/1_samuel/28-15.htm">1 Samuel 28:15&#8211;18</a>.<p>&#8226; A pattern appears in Scripture: when leaders persist in rebellion, God sometimes removes His messengers (<a href="/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11&#8211;12</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-38.htm">Matthew 23:38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Samuel mourned for Saul</b><p>&#8220; Samuel mourned for Saul &#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/15-35.htm">1 Samuel 15:35</a>b).<p>&#8226; Samuel&#8217;s grief shows a shepherd&#8217;s heart. Though Saul wronged him, Samuel loves the man and the nation Saul was meant to serve (cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/13-6.htm">1 Corinthians 13:6</a>).<p>&#8226; This mourning echoes God&#8217;s question, &#8220;How long will you grieve over Saul, since I have rejected him?&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-1.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>). The prophet&#8217;s lament reflects God&#8217;s own sorrow while upholding God&#8217;s judgment.<p>&#8226; Similar righteous mourning appears in <a href="/genesis/6-6.htm">Genesis 6:6</a>, where God is grieved over mankind&#8217;s sin, and in <a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>, where Jesus weeps for Jerusalem.<p>&#8226; Grief over sin should never paralyze obedience.

Why they say, Is Saul also among the prophets?">1Samuel 19:24</a>), but the interview on this occasion was not of Samuel's seeking; nor does it appear then that any communication passed between them. When next the seer and the king <span class= "ital">spoke </span>together, the seer belonged to another and a different world. "After this, Samuel came no more to him, bearing messages and commands, and giving him counsel and guidance from God. Saul's kingship, though still one <span class= "ital">de facto, </span>yet from this time lost its theocratic relation. God's ambassador was recalled from him; the intercourse of the God of Israel with Saul through His Spirit came to an end, because Saul, sinking step by step away from God, had, by continued disobedience and increasing impenitence, given up communion with God."--<span class= "ital">Lange.</span><p><span class= "bld">Nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul.</span>--The old seer, who had known Saul from the days of his splendid youthful promise, had indeed good reason to mourn. He, no doubt, loved him much, and regarded him as his own adopted child. On Saul he had built up all his hopes for the future of the Israel he loved so well. There was besides so much that was great and noble in the character of that first Hebrew king: he was the bravest of the brave, a tried and skilful general, possessed too of many of those high gifts which belong to men like Saul and David, and which enable them to be the saviours and regenerators of their country. This first great king only lacked one thing: true faith in that God who loved Israel with a peculiar love. Saul through his chequered career never really leaned on the Arm of the Mighty One of Jacob. No doubt, too, Samuel already perceived in the brilliant but headstrong king the first beginning of that terrible malady which over-shadowed the meridian and clouded the latter years of Saul--signs of that dread visitant, insanity, were, no doubt, visible to Samuel when the old man began to mourn for Saul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Samuel came no more to see Saul.</span> The friendly intercourse which had previously existed was now broken off, and though they met again (<a href="/1_samuel/19-24.htm">1 Samuel 19:24</a>), it was neither in an amicable manner, nor was their interview of Samuel's seeking. But the words have a higher meaning than the mere seeing or meeting one with the other. They involve the cessation of that relation in which Samuel and Saul had previously stood to one another as respectively the prophet and king of the same Jehovah Saul was no longer the representative of Jehovah, and consequently Samuel no more came to him, bearing messages and commands, and giving him counsel and guidance from God. <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul.</span> There was so much in him that was good and admirable, and he had wrought such brave services in delivering Israel from its many enemies, that Samuel loved him. Now he saw all his high qualities perverted, the man fallen, his powers of usefulness destroyed. Already, too, there was probably the beginning of that darkening of Saul's intellect which filled so many of his future years with melancholy, bursting out from time to time into fits of madness.
