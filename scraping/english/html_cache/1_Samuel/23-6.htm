This event is significant as it marks a turning point in the priesthood, with Abiathar becoming a key religious figure during David's rise to power. The lineage of Abiathar connects to the priestly line of Eli, fulfilling the prophecy of the downfall of Eli's house (<a href="/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31-36</a>).<p><b>had brought the ephod with him</b><br>The ephod was a priestly garment, often associated with the high priest, and was used for seeking God's guidance. Its presence with Abiathar signifies the continuation of legitimate priestly functions despite Saul's actions. The ephod's role in divination and decision-making is seen in other scriptures, such as when David inquires of the Lord (<a href="/1_samuel/23-9.htm">1 Samuel 23:9-12</a>). This highlights the importance of seeking divine guidance in leadership.<p><b>when he fled to David at Keilah</b><br>Abiathar's flight to David signifies a shift in allegiance from Saul to David, indicating David's growing influence and the divine favor upon him. Keilah was a city in Judah, and David's presence there underscores his role as a protector of the people, foreshadowing his future kingship.

Abiathar&#8217;s escape shows God&#8217;s providential rescue.<p>&#8226; Keilah is the town David has just delivered from Philistine plunder (<a href="/1_samuel/23-1.htm">1 Samuel 23:1-5</a>).

You will be safe with me&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/22-23.htm">1 Samuel 22:23</a>).<p>&#8211; This new alliance foreshadows David&#8217;s future reign, in which priest and king serve together (<a href="/2_samuel/8-17.htm">2 Samuel 8:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/23-6.htm">1 Samuel 23:6</a> records far more than a travel detail. God preserves His priest (Abiathar), His appointed tool for guidance (the ephod), and brings both under the protection of His anointed king (David). The verse marks the transfer of spiritual authority from the rejected Saul to David, ensuring that divine direction will continue through legitimate channels. In one concise sentence, Scripture highlights God&#8217;s providence, the integrity of the priestly line, and the unfolding of His plan to establish David&#8217;s kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">With an ephod in his hand.</span>--The difficulty-here with the version and commentators is that they failed to understand that enquiry of the Lord could be made in any other mode than through the Urim. (See Note above on <a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm" title="Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said to David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.">1Samuel 23:2</a>.) Saul in happier days, we know, enquired and received replies <span class= "ital">"through prophets," </span>for before he had recourse to forbidden arts we read how, in contrast evidently to other and earlier times, the Lord answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, <span class= "ital">nor by prophets </span>(<a href="/1_samuel/28-6.htm" title="And when Saul inquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.">1Samuel 28:6</a>). The LXX. here must have deliberately altered the Hebrew text, with the view of escaping what seemed to these translators a grave difficulty. They render. "And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David, that he came down with David to Keilah, having an ephod in his hand," thus implying that Abiathar had come down <span class= "ital">with David </span>to Keilah, having joined him previously. The Hebrew text is, however, definite and clear, and tells us that Abiathar first joined David when he was at Keilah. But the difficulty which puzzled the LXX. and so many others vanishes when we remember that the enquiry of the Lord was not unfrequently made through the prophet; and this was evidently done by David through Gad, a famous representative of that order, in the case of the enquiry referred to in <a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm" title="Therefore David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the LORD said to David, Go, and smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.">1Samuel 23:2</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/23-4.htm" title="Then David inquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.">1Samuel 23:4</a> of this chapter.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Abiathar... fled to David to Koilah, he came down with an ephod in his hand.</span> Literally, "an ephod came down in his hand, and so, word for word, the Syriac. The object of this verse is to explain how it was that David (in vers. 2 and 4) was able to inquire of Jehovah. The words <span class="cmt_word">to Keilah</span> - Hebrew, Kelah-wards - do not mean that it was at Keilah that Abiathar joined David, but that he came in time to go thither with him. In <a href="/1_samuel/22-20.htm">1 Samuel 22:20</a> it seems as if Abiathar must have joined David even at an earlier date, for he is represented as fleeing to him immediately after the massacre of the priests at Nob. Now, granting that David's stay at Gath with Achish was very brief, he must have remained at Adullam a considerable time, inasmuch as men joined him there in large numbers (<a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>), which seems to show that his hiding place had become generally known. It was probably this concourse of men to him that was "discovered," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> made known, to Saul, and, as being an act of formal revolt, so raised his ire. As being supposed to be in league with David, Saul put the priests to death, and Abiathar fled; but probably the news of this terrible act had already reached David, and, in anxiety about his father and mother, he had gone to find refuge for them in Moab. Thither Gad follows him, bringing prophetic approval of his conduct, but ordering him to return into the territory of his own tribe. If then David was on his way to Moab when Abiathar reached Adullam, he may have remained in hiding there till David's return to the thickets of Hareth. But, possibly, even before Abiathar joined him the news may have arrived of the Philistine foray, and David's mind was set Keilah-wards. But there were those who doubted of the prudence of this proceeding, and Abiathars arrival with the ephod enabled him to consult Jehovah's will. By his presence also David had now the approval of the priesthood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/23-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">(Now</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1431;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
