His reply reflects his role as a leader concerned for the safety of his people. This interaction occurs during a time when Israel was frequently at war with the Philistines, a neighboring people known for their military prowess and advanced weaponry.<p><b>You cannot go out against this Philistine to fight him.</b><br>The Philistine in question is Goliath, a giant warrior challenging the Israelites. Saul's statement underscores the perceived impossibility of David's success against such a formidable opponent. This reflects a common biblical theme where human limitations are contrasted with divine possibilities, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>, "Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit," says the Lord Almighty.<p><b>You are just a boy,</b><br>David was likely a teenager at this time, tending sheep and not yet a seasoned warrior. His youth and inexperience are highlighted to emphasize the miraculous nature of his eventual victory. This echoes the biblical motif of God using the unlikely and the humble to achieve His purposes, as seen with Joseph, Moses, and even Jesus, who was born in humble circumstances.<p><b>and he has been a warrior from his youth.</b><br>Goliath's experience as a warrior from a young age contrasts sharply with David's inexperience. This detail emphasizes the natural advantage Goliath had, making David's victory all the more remarkable. It also foreshadows the New Testament teaching that spiritual battles are not won by human strength but by faith and reliance on God, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/6-10.htm">Ephesians 6:10-18</a>, which speaks of the armor of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, chosen by God but later rejected due to disobedience.

The king&#8217;s doubt sets the stage for God to demonstrate that faith, not physical advantage, secures victory. David&#8217;s youth and Goliath&#8217;s prowess highlight a timeless truth: &#8220;The battle is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">And Saul said to David . . .</span>--The king evidently looked on the brave boy with love and admiration, but at first doubted in his heart the reality of David's mission. Whether or not Saul recognised the youth as the sweet singer who had charmed away, perhaps more than once, that terrible soul malady of his which was desolating his once vigorous manhood, is doubtful. (See the Note at the end of this chapter.) He--more than any one in that armed camp--evidently felt that David possessed powers not usually bestowed on the sons of men, and was clearly disposed from the first to grant the shepherd boy's startling petition that the honour of Israel might be entrusted to his almost child-hands. Still, Saul would talk with him, and set before him the grave perils of the terrible encounter he was so eager to engage in.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
