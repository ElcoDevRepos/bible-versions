In ancient Israelite culture, the youngest son typically held the least authority and inheritance rights. This detail highlights the biblical theme of God choosing the unlikely or the humble to fulfill His purposes, as seen in other figures like Joseph and Gideon. David's youth and position in the family set the stage for his unexpected rise to prominence, emphasizing God's sovereignty and the idea that He looks at the heart rather than outward appearances (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><b>The three oldest had followed Saul,</b><br>The three eldest sons of Jesse&#8212;Eliab, Abinadab, and Shammah&#8212;had joined King Saul's army, reflecting the cultural expectation for the eldest sons to take on roles of leadership and responsibility. This detail underscores the contrast between David and his brothers, as they are engaged in the conventional path of service to the king, while David remains at home tending sheep. This sets up the narrative tension and foreshadows David's future role as a leader chosen by God, despite not following the traditional path. The mention of Saul connects this story to the broader narrative of Israel's monarchy and the transition from Saul to David as king, a significant turning point in Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The youngest son of Jesse, later anointed as the king of Israel.

Being the youngest usually placed a son at the end of the line for honor, inheritance, and responsibility (<a href="/genesis/43-33.htm">Genesis 43:33</a>). Yet God had already signaled His different priorities when Samuel anointed David after examining the older brothers (<a href="/1_samuel/16-10.htm">1 Samuel 16:10-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse highlights David&#8217;s apparent insignificance. When Goliath later &#8220;despised him, for he was only a youth&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-42.htm">1 Samuel 17:42</a>), the Philistine echoed the common view. God delights to overturn such expectations, choosing &#8220;the weak things of the world to shame the strong&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s shepherding role (<a href="/1_samuel/17-15.htm">1 Samuel 17:15</a>, <a href="/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70-71</a>) trained him in faithfulness and courage, preparing him for public victory. Like the Lord who calls Himself the Shepherd of Israel (<a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a>; <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>), David learned to protect the flock before protecting the nation.<p>&#8226; Scripture often shows God working through the youngest or overlooked: Jacob over Esau (<a href="/genesis/25-23.htm">Genesis 25:23</a>), Joseph over his brothers (<a href="/genesis/37-3.htm">Genesis 37:3-4</a>), and Gideon from the least clan (<a href="/judges/6-15.htm">Judges 6:15</a>). Each account affirms that the Lord&#8217;s choice rests on His sovereign purpose, not human status.<p>&#8226; By stressing David&#8217;s youth, the text nudges readers to focus on God&#8217;s power rather than David&#8217;s r&#233;sum&#233;. &#8220;The LORD does not save with sword or spear&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>); He saves through obedience and dependence.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The three oldest had followed Saul.</b><p>&#8226; Military service fell naturally to the eldest sons, fitting Samuel&#8217;s earlier warning that a king would &#8220;take your sons and appoint them to his chariots&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/8-11.htm">1 Samuel 8:11</a>). Eliab, Abinadab, and Shammah answered that call (<a href="/1_samuel/17-13.htm">1 Samuel 17:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Their presence in Saul&#8217;s army underlines a contrast: the brothers relied on rank and conventional strength, yet they, along with Saul, were &#8220;dismayed and greatly afraid&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-11.htm">1 Samuel 17:11</a>). Leadership by human stature proved inadequate.<p>&#8226; The phrase shows normal expectations&#8212;older sons with the king, youngest at home&#8212;before the divine reversal. David leaves the pasture, delivers provisions (<a href="/1_samuel/17-17.htm">1 Samuel 17:17-18</a>), and ends up delivering Israel.<p>&#8226; Saul represented Israel&#8217;s request for a king &#8220;like all the nations&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>). His tallest-warrior image (<a href="/1_samuel/10-23.htm">1 Samuel 10:23</a>) faltered when facing a taller Philistine. The older brothers&#8217; alignment with Saul links them to that faltering system, while David&#8217;s later rise signals a better model of leadership under God&#8217;s rule.<p>&#8226; Their following Saul also foreshadows David&#8217;s later role: once a youth who visits the front lines, he will become the commander others follow (<a href="/1_samuel/18-5.htm">1 Samuel 18:5</a>), demonstrating that true authority is rooted in trust in the Lord, not in birth order or physical stature.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/17-14.htm">1 Samuel 17:14</a> sets a deliberate contrast: the youngest son, seemingly insignificant, stands outside the established line of royal and military power, while the three eldest serve the king yet cower before the enemy. The verse highlights God&#8217;s pattern of elevating the humble and exposing the weakness of human strength. As the chapter unfolds, David&#8217;s faith, not his age or rank, brings victory, affirming that the Lord raises up whom He pleases and accomplishes His purposes through those who rely on Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/17-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
