This question is directed to Ahimelech the priest, indicating David's urgent need for sustenance. The phrase reflects David's dire situation, as he is without provisions. In the broader biblical context, this moment highlights David's reliance on God&#8217;s provision during times of distress. It also sets the stage for the subsequent events where David receives the consecrated bread, illustrating God's provision in unexpected ways.<p><b>Give me five loaves of bread,</b><br>David specifically requests five loaves, which may symbolize a complete provision, as the number five often represents grace in biblical numerology. This request underscores David's immediate need for sustenance. The loaves likely refer to the showbread, which was placed in the tabernacle as an offering to God. This bread was typically reserved for the priests, but David's request and subsequent receipt of the bread foreshadow Jesus' teaching in the New Testament about mercy over sacrifice (<a href="/matthew/12-3.htm">Matthew 12:3-4</a>).<p><b>or whatever can be found.</b><br>David's flexibility in his request shows his desperation and humility. He is willing to accept whatever is available, demonstrating his trust in God's provision. This phrase also highlights the scarcity of resources during his flight, contrasting with the abundance he would later experience as king. It reflects a theme of dependence on God, which is echoed throughout David's life and in the Psalms he authored. This moment prefigures the provision of Christ, who is the Bread of Life, offering sustenance to all who come to Him in need.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, currently fleeing from King Saul, who seeks his life.

His opening words to Ahimelech, &#8220;Now then,&#8221; signal urgency and transition:<p>&#8226; The phrase marks a real historical moment&#8212;David stands hungry, weaponless, and on the run (<a href="/1_samuel/21-1.htm">1 Samuel 21:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often shows God&#8217;s servants pressing forward in crisis&#8212;compare Elijah racing from Jezebel (<a href="/1_kings/19-3.htm">1 Kings 19:3-4</a>) or Paul escaping Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-23.htm">Acts 9:23-25</a>).<p>&#8226; The literal setting underscores God&#8217;s providence: danger does not nullify His promises (<a href="/psalms/18-30.htm">Psalm 18:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what do you have on hand?</b><p>David&#8217;s question centers on immediate, tangible provision.<p>&#8226; He looks first to what is already present, much like Elisha with the widow&#8217;s oil (<a href="/2_kings/4-2.htm">2 Kings 4:2</a>) or Jesus asking, &#8220;How many loaves do you have?&#8221; (<a href="/mark/6-38.htm">Mark 6:38</a>).<p>&#8226; Reliance on existing resources highlights stewardship and God&#8217;s method of meeting needs through ordinary means (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The narrative reminds believers to assess God-given assets before panicking&#8212;faith does not bypass practicality (<a href="/proverbs/27-23.htm">Proverbs 27:23-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Give me five loaves of bread,</b><p>David specifies a number, revealing both need and measured expectation.<p>&#8226; Five loaves picture sufficiency for a small company, echoing the five loaves used later by Jesus to feed thousands (<a href="/matthew/14-17.htm">Matthew 14:17-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The request shows confidence that God will supply daily bread (<a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>) while avoiding excess (<a href="/proverbs/30-8.htm">Proverbs 30:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Physically, these loaves come from the Bread of the Presence, underscoring the holy yet compassionate nature of God&#8212;He permits ceremonial bread to sustain His anointed (<a href="/1_samuel/21-6.htm">1 Samuel 21:6</a>; cf. <a href="/mark/2-25.htm">Mark 2:25-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or whatever can be found</b><p>David adds flexibility, leaving room for God&#8217;s alternative provision.<p>&#8226; This mirrors Paul&#8217;s contentment &#8220;in any and every situation&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/4-12.htm">Philippians 4:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; It shows humility: David does not demand luxury, only what God presently supplies (<a href="/1_timothy/6-8.htm">1 Timothy 6:8</a>).<p>&#8226; God often answers with &#8220;whatever can be found,&#8221; turning scarcity into sufficiency (<a href="/exodus/16-14.htm">Exodus 16:14-18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/9-8.htm">2 Corinthians 9:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/21-3.htm">1 Samuel 21:3</a> captures a real episode of need met by holy provision.

The verse invites believers to trust the Lord for daily sustenance, steward available resources wisely, and remain flexible, assured that God&#8217;s faithful provision never fails.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What is under thine hand?</span> This does not mean that Ahimelech was himself carrying the shewbread out of the tabernacle, but simply, "What hast thou?

As Ahimelech could not venture to refuse David's request, he asks if his attendants are at least ceremonially clean, as in that case the urgency of the king's business might excuse the breach of the letter of the commandment.
