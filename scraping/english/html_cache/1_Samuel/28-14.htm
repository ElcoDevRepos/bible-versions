This moment occurs during a time when Saul is facing the Philistine army and feels abandoned by God. Saul's question indicates his uncertainty and need for confirmation, highlighting his spiritual decline and reliance on forbidden practices, such as consulting a medium, which was against God's law (<a href="/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>).<p><b>&#8220;An old man is coming up,&#8221; she replied.</b><br>The medium's description of an "old man" suggests a figure of wisdom and authority, consistent with Samuel's role as a prophet and judge in Israel. The act of "coming up" implies the ancient belief in Sheol, the abode of the dead, which was thought to be below the earth. This reflects the cultural understanding of the afterlife in ancient Israel.<p><b>&#8220;And he is wearing a robe.&#8221;</b><br>The robe is significant as it was a distinctive garment associated with prophets and priests. Samuel's robe is mentioned earlier in <a href="/1_samuel/15-27.htm">1 Samuel 15:27</a>, where Saul tears it, symbolizing the kingdom being torn from him. The robe here serves as a visual confirmation of Samuel's identity and authority, reinforcing the gravity of Saul's encounter.<p><b>So Saul knew that it was Samuel,</b><br>Saul's recognition of Samuel indicates his belief in the medium's ability to summon the prophet, despite his previous expulsion of mediums from the land (<a href="/1_samuel/28-3.htm">1 Samuel 28:3</a>). This acknowledgment underscores Saul's spiritual crisis and the irony of seeking guidance from the very prophet who had pronounced God's judgment on him.<p><b>and he bowed facedown in reverence.</b><br>Saul's act of bowing facedown demonstrates a posture of submission and respect, common in ancient Near Eastern cultures when encountering a figure of authority. This gesture contrasts with Saul's earlier disobedience to God's commands, highlighting his desperation and the tragic irony of seeking counsel from Samuel after his death. Saul's reverence here is misplaced, as he should have sought repentance and guidance from God rather than through forbidden means.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is seeking guidance in desperation as he faces the Philistine army.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The prophet who anointed Saul as king, now deceased, whom Saul seeks to consult through a medium.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/medium_at_endor.htm">Medium at Endor</a></b><br>A woman who practices necromancy, whom Saul visits to summon the spirit of Samuel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/endor.htm">Endor</a></b><br>A location in ancient Israel where Saul visits the medium, despite having previously banned such practices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistine_army.htm">Philistine Army</a></b><br>The opposing force that Saul is preparing to battle, causing him great fear and anxiety.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Saul's actions are a direct result of his earlier disobedience to God.

God allows the deceased prophet to appear, not to endorse occult practice, but to confirm Saul&#8217;s judgment and His own unchanging word. The passage underscores that God&#8217;s revelation is final, His commands unalterable, and any attempt to seek guidance outside His will ends in despair.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">An old man Cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle.</span>--The "mantle<span class= "ital">;" </span>Heb., <span class= "ital">m'il. </span>The garment so named was not a peculiar one, and bore no official signification; still, its mention here in this place would seem as though the woman <span class= "ital">recognised the </span>well-known <span class= "ital">m'il </span>which the prophet used to wear in life.<p>But it has been asked, How could a spirit bear the semblance of an old man? and further, How could such a being be clothed? Rabbi Moses Maimonides of Cordova (twelfth century), surnamed the "Eagle of the Doctors," in his <span class= "ital">Yad Hachazakah, </span>admirably replies to these queries when discussing certain similar expressions used with regard to the Holy One, who is a Spirit without a body or a frame. "We find," says Maimonides, "such expressions as 'under His feet,' written with the finger of God,' 'the eye of the Lord,' &c. Of Him one prophet says, 'That he saw the Holy One--blessed be He !--whose garment was white as snow' (<a href="/daniel/7-9.htm" title="I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.">Daniel 7:9</a>); whilst another saw Him 'like a warrior engaged in battle.'

I., ch. 1 "God designed," says Bishop Wordsworth, "that the spirit of Samuel should be recognised by human eyes; and how could this have been done but by means of such objects as are visible to human sense? Our Lord speaks of the <span class= "ital">tongue </span>of the disembodied spirit of Dives in order to give us an idea of his sufferings; and at the Transfiguration He presented the form of Moses in such a garb to the three disciples as might enable them to recognise him as Moses."<p><span class= "bld">And he stooped . . . and bowed himself.</span>--It Seems probable that at this juncture the king <span class= "ital">saw </span>the form before him when he did obeisance.

As the term a god conveyed no other idea than that she had seen something majestic, Saul asks for a more exact description. She answers that it was an old man clad in a robe, <span class="accented">meil</span> (see on 1 Samuel 2:19). Samuel seems never to have worn the prophetic mantle (see on 1 Samuel 15:27), but always the <span class="accented">meil.</span> There was nothing, therefore, distinctive in the dress; but as she says that she has seen an old man, Saul concludes that he for whom he had asked had appeared to him.
