Gath was known as a stronghold of the Philistines and is often associated with giants, such as Goliath. The movement of the Ark signifies the Philistines' attempt to control the power of Israel's God, not understanding its sacredness. This act reflects a common ancient Near Eastern practice of capturing religious symbols to demonstrate dominance over a conquered people.<p><b>the LORD&#8217;s hand was also against that city</b><br>The phrase "the LORD&#8217;s hand" indicates divine intervention and judgment. In biblical terms, God's hand often symbolizes His power and authority. The Philistines' experience with the Ark reveals that God's presence cannot be manipulated or contained by human efforts. This serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and His ability to act beyond human understanding or control.<p><b>throwing it into great confusion</b><br>The confusion in Gath can be seen as a divine disruption of social and civic order. This chaos is reminiscent of other biblical instances where God confounds human plans, such as the Tower of Babel (<a href="/genesis/11.htm">Genesis 11:1-9</a>). The confusion underscores the futility of opposing God's will and the disorder that ensues when people attempt to usurp divine authority.<p><b>and afflicting the men of the city, both young and old, with an outbreak of tumors</b><br>The affliction of tumors is a direct consequence of mishandling the Ark. The Hebrew term used here can also be translated as "hemorrhoids" or "plagues," suggesting a severe and humiliating physical ailment. This affliction parallels the plagues of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/9-9.htm">Exodus 9:9-11</a>), serving as a divine warning and a call to repentance. The inclusion of "both young and old" emphasizes the comprehensive nature of God's judgment, affecting all demographics within the city. This event foreshadows the ultimate judgment and redemption found in Christ, who bears the afflictions of humanity to bring healing and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_philistines.htm">The Philistines</a></b><br>A group of people who were enemies of Israel and had captured the Ark of the Covenant.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ark_of_the_covenant.htm">The Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>A sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence with Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_city_of_gath.htm">The City of Gath</a></b><br>One of the five major Philistine cities where the Ark was taken, and where God&#8217;s judgment was manifested.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hand_of_the_lord.htm">The Hand of the LORD</a></b><br>A biblical expression indicating God's power and judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/tumors.htm">Tumors</a></b><br>Physical afflictions sent by God as a sign of His displeasure and judgment upon the Philistines.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_judgment.htm">God's Sovereignty and Judgment</a></b><br>God is sovereign over all nations and peoples, and His judgments are just and purposeful.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_presence_of_god.htm">The Presence of God</a></b><br>The Ark of the Covenant symbolizes God's holy presence, which cannot be manipulated or treated lightly.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Disobedience and irreverence towards God lead to serious consequences, as seen in the afflictions upon the Philistines.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_power_over_idols.htm">God's Power Over Idols</a></b><br>The Philistines' gods were powerless before the true God, reminding us of the futility of idolatry.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/repentance_and_humility.htm">Repentance and Humility</a></b><br>The afflictions serve as a call to repentance and recognition of God's authority and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Samuel_5_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Samuel 5:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_5_9_God_s_power_over_Philistines.htm">How does 1 Samuel 5:9 demonstrate God's power over the Philistines?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Insights_on_God_s_judgment_in_1_Sam_5_9.htm">What can we learn about God's judgment from 1 Samuel 5:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_1_Sam_5_9_to_God_s_covenant_promises.htm">How does God's action in 1 Samuel 5:9 connect to His covenant promises?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Believers_response_to_God_s_power_10.htm">How should believers respond when witnessing God's power, as seen in 1 Samuel 5:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_5_9_s_lesson_on_God_s_holiness.htm">What does 1 Samuel 5:9 teach about respecting God's holiness in our lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_were_Gath_s_people_afflicted_with_tumors.htm">Why did God afflict the people of Gath with tumors in 1 Samuel 5:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_the_Ark_cause_plagues_in_1_Sam_5_9.htm">What is the significance of the Ark causing plagues in 1 Samuel 5:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_5_9_God_s_power_over_nations.htm">How does 1 Samuel 5:9 reflect God's power over other nations?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_1_samuel_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 1 Samuel 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_are_emerods_in_the_bible.htm">What are emerods in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/israel's_fighting_men_count.htm">How many fighting men were in Israel?

Its ordinary meaning in both these languages is to "cover," "conceal," and the A.V., taking it in this sense, supposes that the boils were hidden, and translates as above. But the root has a double meaning, and signifies also "to destroy," though in this sense the Arabic has a slight difference in spelling, namely, <span class="accented">shatara</span> instead of <span class="accented">satara.</span> The old versions were evidently at a loss in understanding the meaning, though their renderings are suggestive, except the Syriac, which translates quite literally, but leaves thereby the difficulty untouched of the twofold meaning of the word, and the Syro-Arabic lexicons are uncertain which to choose. Some give, "and the emerods hid themselves in them," in the sense of gnawing and burrowing into the flesh, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> they became cancerous. Others take the alternative sense, and render, "and the emerods were burst upon them," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> became fissured and rent, and turned into open sores. Another translation has been proposed, namely, "the tumours or emerods brake out upon them;" but as the verb, both in the Hebrew and the Syriac, is passive, this rendering can scarcely be defended. Upon the whole, the most probable sense is that the tumours buried themselves deep in the flesh, and becoming thus incurable, ended in causing the death of the sufferers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/5-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But after</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;
