Phinehas, her husband, was one of Eli's sons, both of whom were priests serving at the tabernacle in Shiloh. The mention of her pregnancy and imminent childbirth sets the stage for a dramatic and tragic event. In ancient Israel, childbirth was a critical and often dangerous time for women, and the anticipation of a new life is juxtaposed with the impending news of death and loss. The family of Eli was under divine judgment due to the sins of Eli's sons, as prophesied in <a href="/1_samuel/2-31.htm">1 Samuel 2:31-34</a>.<p><b>When she heard the news of the capture of God&#8217;s ark and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband,</b><br>The capture of the Ark of the Covenant by the Philistines was a catastrophic event for Israel, symbolizing the loss of God's presence and favor. The Ark was central to Israelite worship and represented God's covenant with His people. The deaths of Eli and Phinehas fulfilled the prophecy given to Eli regarding the downfall of his house (<a href="/1_samuel/2-34.htm">1 Samuel 2:34</a>). The news would have been devastating, as it signified not only personal loss but also national calamity. The Ark's capture indicated a severe spiritual crisis, as the Israelites believed it was the dwelling place of God's glory (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>).<p><b>she collapsed and gave birth, for her labor pains overtook her.</b><br>The physical and emotional shock of the news triggered premature labor. In the cultural context, the birth of a child, especially a son, was typically a time of joy and hope. However, in this instance, the birth occurs amidst tragedy and despair. The collapse signifies the overwhelming nature of the events and the fulfillment of divine judgment. The labor pains overtaking her can be seen as a metaphor for the sudden and unavoidable consequences of sin and disobedience, as well as the birth of a new era marked by the absence of the Ark. This moment foreshadows the transition from the period of the judges to the establishment of the monarchy in Israel, as God raises up Samuel to lead His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/phinehas'_wife.htm">Phinehas' Wife</a></b><br>The unnamed wife of Phinehas, who is pregnant and about to give birth.

The news of the terrible calamity that had befallen the ark of God brought on a premature delivery; but when she had given birth to a son, the attendant women naturally hoped that the good tidings would cheer the mother's heart. They haste, therefore, to tell her; <span class="cmt_word">but she answered not, neither did she regard it.</span> This does not mean that she was already dead; if so, the women would not have told her. It means that no private joy could compensate her for the loss of the outward sign and proof that the covenant of Jehovah was with her and her people. The loss of the ark seemed to her to signify the overthrow of her national religion. But she heard, for immediately There is <span class="cmt_word">she named the child I-chabod.</span> There is some doubt as to the exact meaning of the word. It may mean <span class="accented">Alas! the glory</span>; but more probably it signifies <span class="accented">No glory</span> - the glory of Israel is no more. In the reason given by the narrator for her sorrow, as summed up in the name given to her child, the deaths of Eli and of Phinehas are included, but her own words refer only to the ark. Literally they are, "The glory is gone into captivity from Israel." There is possibly a reference to this in <a href="/psalms/78-64.htm">Psalm 78:64</a>, where, speaking of the fall of Shiloh, the Psalmist says, "Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows made no lamentation." Others, it may be, like the wife of Phinehas, felt that there was no room for private grief at a time of so great national distress and humiliation. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/4-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now Eli&#8217;s daughter-in-law,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#7733;al&#183;l&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
