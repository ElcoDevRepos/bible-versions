In the cultural context of ancient Israel, family loyalty was paramount, and Saul expected Michal, his daughter, to support his efforts against David. This moment highlights the tension between Saul's role as king and his personal relationships. Deception is a recurring theme in the Bible, often used to protect God's chosen individuals, as seen with Rahab in <a href="/joshua/2.htm">Joshua 2</a>.<p><b>You sent my enemy away, and he has escaped!&#8221;</b><br>Saul refers to David as "my enemy," indicating the depth of his jealousy and fear of David's rising popularity and God's favor upon him. This enmity is rooted in Saul's awareness of David's anointing as the future king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). The escape of David is significant in the narrative of God's providence and protection over His anointed, paralleling other biblical figures who were preserved from harm, such as Moses in <a href="/exodus/2.htm">Exodus 2</a>.<p><b>Michal replied, &#8220;He said to me, &#8216;Help me get away, or I will kill you!&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>Michal's response to Saul is a strategic lie to protect herself and David. Her actions can be seen as a reflection of her loyalty to David, her husband, over her father, the king. This situation underscores the complex dynamics of familial and marital relationships in the biblical narrative. Michal's deception is reminiscent of other biblical instances where individuals lie to protect God's chosen, such as the Hebrew midwives in <a href="/exodus/1-17.htm">Exodus 1:17-21</a>. This phrase also foreshadows the eventual breakdown of Michal and David's relationship, as seen in <a href="/2_samuel/6-16.htm">2 Samuel 6:16-23</a>, where Michal's disdain for David becomes evident.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is increasingly consumed by jealousy and paranoia, especially towards David.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/michal.htm">Michal</a></b><br>Saul's daughter and David's wife, who helps David escape from Saul's murderous intentions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Anointed by God to be the future king of Israel, he is currently fleeing from Saul's attempts to kill him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/escape_of_david.htm">Escape of David</a></b><br>The event where Michal aids David in escaping from Saul's plot to kill him, demonstrating her loyalty to David over her father.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/loyalty_and_courage.htm">Loyalty and Courage</a></b><br>Michal's actions demonstrate the importance of loyalty to God's anointed, even when it conflicts with familial ties.

His purposes stand even when people choose wrong means (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>; <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/19-17.htm">1 Samuel 19:17</a> spotlights a household torn between God&#8217;s anointed future and a king clinging to power. Saul&#8217;s question unmasks his jealousy; Michal&#8217;s answer reveals the tangled morality of trying to protect David through deceit. Yet through it all the LORD preserves His chosen servant. The verse warns against envy, underscores the cost of divided loyalties, and affirms that no human scheme&#8212;good or bad&#8212;can thwart God&#8217;s sovereign plan to raise up the true king.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/19-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
