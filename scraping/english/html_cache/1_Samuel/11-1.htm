The Ammonites were often in conflict with Israel, as seen in <a href="/judges/11-4.htm">Judges 11:4-33</a>. Nahash's aggression reflects the ongoing hostilities between Israel and its neighbors. His actions here set the stage for Saul's rise as a leader and king of Israel.<p><b>and laid siege to Jabesh-gilead.</b><br>Jabesh-gilead was a city located east of the Jordan River in the territory of Gilead. It had historical ties to Israel, as seen in <a href="/judges/21-8.htm">Judges 21:8-14</a>, where the men of Jabesh-gilead were spared during a conflict with the other tribes of Israel. The siege indicates a strategic move by Nahash to control a significant area and exert influence over Israel. The city's location made it vulnerable to attacks from eastern tribes like the Ammonites.<p><b>All the men of Jabesh said to him,</b><br>The men of Jabesh-gilead, facing a formidable enemy, sought to negotiate rather than face destruction. This reflects the dire situation and the desperation of the inhabitants. Their response also highlights the lack of strong central leadership in Israel at the time, which Saul's eventual kingship would address.<p><b>&#8220;Make a treaty with us,</b><br>The request for a treaty indicates a willingness to submit to Nahash's terms to avoid annihilation. In ancient Near Eastern culture, treaties often involved vassalage, where the weaker party would serve the stronger. This plea underscores the vulnerability of Jabesh-gilead and the threat posed by Nahash.<p><b>and we will serve you.&#8221;</b><br>The offer to serve Nahash suggests a readiness to become vassals, which would involve paying tribute and possibly providing military support. This submission would have been humiliating for Israel, highlighting the need for a unifying leader. The situation foreshadows Saul's role as a deliverer, a type of Christ, who would save his people from oppression.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/n/nahash_the_ammonite.htm">Nahash the Ammonite</a></b><br>A king of the Ammonites, known for his aggression against Israel.

This royal family was in some way related to David (see <a href="/2_samuel/17-25.htm" title="And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab: which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.">2Samuel 17:25</a>; <a href="/context/1_chronicles/2-16.htm" title="Whose sisters were Zeruiah, and Abigail. And the sons of Zeruiah; Abishai, and Joab, and Asahel, three.">1Chronicles 2:16-17</a>). At the time of David's exile owing to the rebellion of Absalom, a son of Nahash the Ammonite is specially mentioned as showing kindness to the fugitive king. Jabesh-gilead was a city situated in Northern Gilead, in the territory assigned to Manasseh. Josephus states that it was the capital of the country of Gilead. The Ammonites were a kindred race to the Moabites, being descended from the same ancestor, the patriarch Lot. They asserted that a portion of their territory had been taken from them by Israel, and in the days of the judges sorely harassed the people. The Judge Jephthah attacked and defeated them with great slaughter.<p>It was, no doubt, to avenge the disgrace they had suffered at the hands of Jephthah that their warlike monarch, Nahash,--deeming the opportunity a favourable one, owing to the old age of the reigning judge, Samuel,--invaded the Israelitic country bordering upon his kingdom, and besieged the city of Jabesh-gilead.<p><span class= "bld">Make a covenant with us.</span>--The citizens of Jabesh-gilead, feeling their isolation and comparative remoteness from the chief centre of the people, were willing to pay a tribute to the Ammonite king, and made him overtures to this effect.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nahash the Ammonite.</span> The same name is found in <a href="/2_samuel/10-2.htm">2 Samuel 10:2</a> as that of the father of Hanun, who treated David's ambassadors so shamefully, and probably they mean the same person. He is there said to have shown kindness to David; and as we read in <a href="/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a> that Abigal (so the Hebrew, not Abigail as the A.V., who was David's wife), Amasa's mother, was the daughter of Nahash, and as Abigal was the sister or half-sister of Zeruiah, David's aunt, there seems to have been some relationship between them. The Ammonites were old enemies of the Israelites, alleging that Israel had taken possession of territory east of the Jordan which rightfully belonged to them (<a href="/judges/11-13.htm">Judges 11:13</a>); but after their defeat by Jephthah their power was so broken that they allowed a century to elapse before they ventured again to assert their claim. Nahash, apparently after other invasions (<a href="/1_samuel/12-12.htm">1 Samuel 12:12</a>), now attacks Jabesh-Gilead, a city in the half-tribe of Manasseh, which had been cruelly treated by the Israelites (<a href="/judges/21-10.htm">Judges 21:10</a>), but apparently had risen again from its ruins. Its inhabitants were willing humbly to submit to Ammonite rule; but Nahash will grant them no other terms than that they should let him <span class="cmt_word">thrust out</span> - Hebrew, bore through - <span class="cmt_word">all their right eyes,</span> not from any special spite against them, but as an insult to all Israel. No better proof could be given of the disorganisation of the nation than that a petty despot should venture to show his contempt for it in so offensive a way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/11-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Soon Nahash</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(n&#257;&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5176.htm">Strong's 5176: </a> </span><span class="str2">Nahash -- the name of several non-Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Ammonite</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1506;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1504;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8216;am&#183;m&#333;&#183;w&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
