David, anointed by Samuel as the future king, is accompanied by Abishai, his nephew and a loyal warrior. This moment highlights David's strategic acumen and his reliance on God's guidance rather than human strength. The presence of Abishai underscores the theme of loyalty and the importance of wise counsel, reminiscent of Jonathan's earlier support for David.<p><b>and Saul was lying there asleep in the inner circle of the camp</b><br>Saul's position in the inner circle signifies his status as king, surrounded by his men for protection. Sleep, in this context, symbolizes a state of unawareness and vulnerability, both physically and spiritually. Saul's pursuit of David, driven by jealousy and fear, contrasts with his current defenseless state, illustrating the futility of opposing God's anointed. This scene echoes the theme of divine sovereignty, where God protects His chosen ones despite human opposition.<p><b>with his spear stuck in the ground by his head</b><br>The spear, a symbol of Saul's authority and military power, is ironically rendered useless as it rests by his head. This detail emphasizes the contrast between Saul's earthly power and David's reliance on God's protection. The spear's presence also foreshadows the potential for violence, yet David chooses mercy over vengeance, reflecting Christ-like restraint and forgiveness. This act prefigures Jesus' teaching on loving one's enemies and turning the other cheek.<p><b>And Abner and the troops were lying around him</b><br>Abner, Saul's cousin and commander of his army, represents the king's earthly security. The troops' presence signifies the human effort to safeguard Saul, yet they are rendered ineffective by divine intervention, as God causes a deep sleep to fall upon them. This scene highlights the limitations of human strength against God's will. The narrative invites reflection on the futility of relying solely on human defenses, pointing to the ultimate security found in God's providence.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by God, who is being pursued by Saul.

The verse sets the stage for David&#8217;s test&#8212;will he seize power by force or trust the Lord&#8217;s timing?

The same Hebrew word occurs in the narration of Jacob's dream (<a href="/genesis/28-11.htm" title="And he lighted on a certain place, and tarried there all night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that place to sleep.">Genesis 28:11</a>); it is there rendered in our English Version, "his pillows." It was the tall spear which ever seems to have been in Saul's hand, or placed close to him. We read of it in battle in his hand, and in the council chamber and at the state banquet it was within his reach, and now it was evidently reared upright beside the sleeping king. "I noticed at all the encampments which we passed that the sheik's tent was distinguished from the rest <span class= "ital">by a tall spear </span>stuck upright in the ground in front of it; and it is the custom when a party set out on an excursion for robbery or for war, that when they halt to rest the spot where the chief reclines or rests is thus designated"--Thomson, <span class= "ital">Land and the Book.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - The two accordingly go <span class="cmt_word">by night</span>, or "at night," as soon as night came on, and find Saul asleep <span class="cmt_word">within the trench,</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> inside the wagon rampart, as in ver. 5, and <span class="cmt_word">his spear,</span> the sign of his royal authority, stuck in the ground; not <span class="cmt_word">at his bolster,</span> but "at his head; and so in vers. 11, 12, 16. The word literally signifies "the place where the head is." Like David's men in <a href="/1_samuel/24-4.htm">1 Samuel 24:4</a>, Abishai sees in Saul's defenceless condition a proof that it was God's will that he should die, but there is a difference of language in the Hebrew which the A.V. does not represent. There the word rendered <span class="accented">deliver</span> is really <span class="accented">give</span>; here it is "hath locked up." <span class="cmt_word">At once.</span> Hebrew, "once." Abishai would pierce him through with a single stroke so thoroughly that no second blow would be necessary. The purpose of this would be to prevent an outcry. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/26-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">That night</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(lay&#183;l&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3915.htm">Strong's 3915: </a> </span><span class="str2">A twist, night, adversity</span><br /><br /><span class="word">David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1448;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7695;&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and Abishai</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1445;&#1497;
