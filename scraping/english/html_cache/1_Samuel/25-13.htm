David, who was anointed but not yet king, was leading a group of men who were loyal to him. This command shows David's leadership and readiness to protect his honor and interests. The context here is David's response to Nabal's insult and refusal to provide provisions, which was a grave offense in the cultural context of hospitality and honor. The call to arms also reflects the tension between David and Saul, as David was living as a fugitive.<p><b>So David and all his men strapped on their swords,</b><br>David's men were a group of warriors who had gathered around him during his time of fleeing from King Saul. This action demonstrates their loyalty and readiness to follow David into potential conflict. The act of strapping on swords signifies preparation for battle, highlighting the seriousness of the offense against David. This moment foreshadows David's future as a military leader and king, as he commands a significant force even while in exile.<p><b>and about four hundred men followed David,</b><br>The number of men indicates the size and strength of David's following, which was substantial for a leader not yet officially recognized as king. This group of men, often referred to as David's mighty men, were skilled warriors who played a crucial role in his rise to power. The number four hundred is significant, as it shows David's growing influence and the trust these men placed in him. This also reflects the fulfillment of God's promise to David, as he was being prepared to lead a nation.<p><b>while two hundred stayed with the supplies.</b><br>This detail highlights the logistical considerations of ancient warfare, where maintaining supplies was crucial for the survival and effectiveness of a fighting force. The division of men also shows David's strategic thinking, ensuring that his resources were protected while he engaged in potential conflict. This mirrors later biblical accounts where David demonstrates wisdom and prudence in leadership, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/30-24.htm">1 Samuel 30:24</a>, where he establishes a principle of sharing spoils equally between those who fight and those who guard supplies.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, and a man after God's own heart.

This is the shepherd-king in waiting acting as leader of a growing band of followers (<a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a>).<p>&#8226; David has just received Nabal&#8217;s insulting refusal of hospitality (<a href="/1_samuel/25-10.htm">1 Samuel 25:10-11</a>), and he responds swiftly, showing both righteous anger and a commander&#8217;s instinct.<p>&#8226; God had already anointed David, yet he is still a fugitive; his words reveal the tension between trusting God&#8217;s timing and confronting evil (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>; <a href="/psalms/7-11.htm">Psalm 7:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Strap on your swords!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Quoting the verse itself: &#8220;Strap on your swords!&#8221;<p>&#8226; The imperative signals immediate action, a call to arms reminiscent of Moses&#8217; command after the golden calf incident (<a href="/exodus/32-27.htm">Exodus 32:27</a>).<p>&#8226; David is prepared to defend honor and protect his men, paralleling later teaching that rulers do &#8220;not bear the sword in vain&#8221; (<a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The command also exposes the danger of retaliatory zeal&#8212;something Christ later reshapes when He tells Peter to put the sword away (<a href="/matthew/26-52.htm">Matthew 26:52</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So David and all his men strapped on their swords</b><p>&#8226; David models decisive leadership; the men mirror their leader&#8217;s resolve (<a href="/2_samuel/15-21.htm">2 Samuel 15:21</a>).<p>&#8226; By acting personally&#8212;strapping on his own sword&#8212;David signals that this is not mere posturing.<p>&#8226; Yet the narrative invites us to weigh whether this reaction aligns with God&#8217;s heart; Abigail&#8217;s intervention in verses 23-31 will highlight a better way (<a href="/proverbs/15-1.htm">Proverbs 15:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>About four hundred men followed David</b><p>&#8226; The numbers echo earlier counts of David&#8217;s following (<a href="/1_samuel/23-13.htm">1 Samuel 23:13</a>), showing growth from 600 to a split force of 400/200.<p>&#8226; Four hundred indicates a formidable company, hinting that David&#8217;s influence and resources are expanding under God&#8217;s providence (<a href="/1_samuel/18-14.htm">1 Samuel 18:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Following David foreshadows the nation that will one day rally to him as king (<a href="/2_samuel/5-1.htm">2 Samuel 5:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Two hundred stayed with the supplies</b><p>&#8226; Practical wisdom surfaces: logistics matter; someone must guard the baggage (<a href="/1_samuel/30-24.htm">1 Samuel 30:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The division underscores teamwork&#8212;combatants and support roles are both vital (<a href="/numbers/31-25.htm">Numbers 31:25-27</a>).<p>&#8226; It also foreshadows the principle that those who &#8220;stay by the baggage&#8221; share equally in the victory spoils, reinforcing unity and fairness within God&#8217;s people.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David&#8217;s sharp command, the men&#8217;s ready obedience, and the strategic division of forces unveil a leader quick to defend but still growing in grace. The verse captures a pivotal moment when righteous anger teeters on vengeful excess, setting the stage for Abigail&#8217;s godly counsel. Through it all, God directs events to refine David, protect his people, and remind us that zeal must bow to divine wisdom and trust in the Lord&#8217;s just timing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Gird ye on every man his sword.</span>--The formal preparation and the largeness of the force told off for the work showed how terribly David was in earnest, and how bent he was on wiping out the insult of Nabal in blood.
