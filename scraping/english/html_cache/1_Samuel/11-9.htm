The messengers had been sent by the besieged city to seek aid against the Ammonites. This reflects the ancient practice of sending envoys to communicate between cities and leaders, a common method of diplomacy and warfare in the ancient Near East.<p><b>Tell the men of Jabesh-gilead</b><br>Jabesh-gilead was a city located east of the Jordan River in the territory of Gilead. It had historical ties to the tribe of Benjamin, as seen in <a href="/judges/21.htm">Judges 21</a>, where the men of Jabesh-gilead were spared during a conflict involving the Benjamites. This connection may have influenced Saul, a Benjamite, to respond swiftly to their call for help.<p><b>&#8216;Deliverance will be yours tomorrow</b><br>This promise of deliverance is significant as it demonstrates Saul's confidence in God's ability to save His people. It echoes the theme of divine intervention found throughout the Old Testament, where God delivers Israel from their enemies. This assurance of salvation foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who provides spiritual salvation to all who believe.<p><b>by the time the sun is hot.&#8217;</b><br>The phrase "by the time the sun is hot" indicates that the deliverance would occur by midday, emphasizing the immediacy and certainty of the promised salvation. This specific timing underscores the urgency and the miraculous nature of the deliverance, as it would happen swiftly and decisively.<p><b>And when the messengers relayed this to the men of Jabesh, they rejoiced.</b><br>The reaction of the men of Jabesh-gilead highlights the relief and hope that comes with the promise of deliverance. Their rejoicing is a natural response to the good news of salvation, paralleling the joy experienced by believers who receive the good news of the Gospel. This joy is a recurring theme in Scripture, reflecting the deep gratitude and celebration that accompanies God's saving acts.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who leads the Israelites to victory against the Ammonites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/messengers.htm">Messengers</a></b><br>Individuals sent from Jabesh Gilead to seek help from the Israelites against the Ammonite threat.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jabesh_gilead.htm">Jabesh Gilead</a></b><br>A city in Israel under threat from the Ammonites, seeking deliverance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A neighboring nation threatening Jabesh Gilead, led by Nahash.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who rally under Saul's leadership to deliver Jabesh Gilead.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_timing_in_deliverance.htm">God's Timing in Deliverance</a></b><br>God's promise of deliverance comes with a specific timing, "by the time the sun is hot," reminding us to trust in His perfect timing for our own deliverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_and_leadership.htm">Unity and Leadership</a></b><br>Saul's leadership unites the Israelites, demonstrating the importance of godly leadership and unity in facing challenges.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/rejoicing_in_god's_promises.htm">Rejoicing in God's Promises</a></b><br>The men of Jabesh Gilead rejoiced upon hearing the promise of deliverance, teaching us to find joy and hope in God's promises even before they are fulfilled.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The response of the Israelites to Saul's call to arms shows the necessity of faith accompanied by action in the face of adversity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_faithfulness.htm">God's Faithfulness</a></b><br>This event underscores God's faithfulness to His people, encouraging us to rely on His promises and past faithfulness in our own lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_1_Samuel_11_9_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 1 Samuel 11:9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/1_Sam_11_9_God_s_deliverance_via_leaders.htm">How does 1 Samuel 11:9 demonstrate God's deliverance through His chosen leaders?
