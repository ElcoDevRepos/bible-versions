Saul's uncle, likely Abner, who later becomes a significant military leader, inquires about their journey. This question reflects the cultural norm of familial accountability and the importance of kinship ties in ancient Israel. The inquiry also sets the stage for revealing Saul's encounter with Samuel, a prophet and judge, highlighting the divine orchestration in Saul's rise to kingship.<p><b>&#8220;To look for the donkeys,&#8221; Saul replied.</b><br>Saul's initial mission was to find his father's lost donkeys, a task that seems mundane but is significant in God's providential plan. The search for donkeys symbolizes Saul's humble beginnings and contrasts with his future role as king. This phrase also underscores the theme of divine intervention in ordinary circumstances, as God uses this search to lead Saul to Samuel. The mention of donkeys connects to other biblical narratives where God uses animals to fulfill His purposes, such as Balaam's donkey in <a href="/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22</a>.<p><b>&#8220;When we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.&#8221;</b><br>Saul's decision to consult Samuel, a respected prophet, indicates the cultural practice of seeking divine guidance through prophets. This reflects the Israelites' reliance on prophetic insight for decision-making. Samuel's role as a prophet and judge is crucial, as he bridges the period between the judges and the monarchy. Saul's encounter with Samuel is a turning point, marking the beginning of his journey to kingship. This moment foreshadows the prophetic anointing and guidance that will characterize Saul's reign, albeit with eventual tragic consequences due to his disobedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, chosen by God and anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Truthfulness about small matters lays groundwork for larger responsibilities (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention of &#8220;donkeys&#8221; recalls how God used an everyday problem to steer Saul toward destiny&#8212;much as He later guides David through tending sheep (<a href="/1_samuel/17-34.htm">1 Samuel 17:34-35</a>).<p>&#8226; Humility surfaces: Saul does not rush to announce kingship; he identifies himself by a servant&#8217;s task (compare <a href="/1_samuel/9-21.htm">1 Samuel 9:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;When we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Saul acknowledges visiting the prophet but omits the anointing details (confirmed in <a href="/1_samuel/10-16.htm">1 Samuel 10:16</a>).<p>&#8226; This selective disclosure shows prudence and respect for God&#8217;s unfolding plan, similar to Jesus telling healed individuals to &#8220;tell no one&#8221; until the proper moment (<a href="/mark/1-44.htm">Mark 1:44</a>).<p>&#8226; The reference to Samuel subtly elevates the prophet&#8217;s role as God&#8217;s mouthpiece (<a href="/1_samuel/3-19.htm">1 Samuel 3:19-20</a>) while hinting that something significant happened there, setting up anticipation for the narrative ahead (<a href="/1_samuel/11-15.htm">1 Samuel 11:15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/10-14.htm">1 Samuel 10:14</a> captures Saul at the threshold of kingship, back in everyday life but carrying a hidden anointing. His uncle&#8217;s simple inquiry draws out a measured response: truthful about lost donkeys, discreet about royal destiny. The verse highlights God&#8217;s pattern of weaving monumental callings into ordinary circumstances, teaching that wisdom sometimes means waiting to reveal what the Lord has done until He opens the door.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">Saul's uncle.</span>--Most probably, this uncle was the subsequently famous Abner--so Ewald, Josephus, and others. Kish, the father of Saul, a quiet, plain man, evidently was quite content that his beasts were found, and that his son had returned in safety and so asks no curious questions about his son's journey. Not so Abner, who was a restless, ambitious man, and who, very probably, had heard something already from the servant who accompanied Saul (traditionally supposed to have been Doeg) of the strange honours paid to his nephew by the great and revered judge of Israel, the famous Samuel, and also of the long private interview between them. Abner, the uncle of the future king, an observant man, might well have been struck with the change that had passed over his nephew since he had last seen him; hence his question, "Tell me what Samuel said unto you?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saul's uncle.</span> According to <a href="/1_samuel/14-50.htm">1 Samuel 14:50, 51</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a>, this would be Abner. The conversation probably took place after Saul had returned from the Bamah and gone to his own home, for in so brief a summary much necessarily is omitted. It is curious that the conversation should have taken place with the uncle, and not with the father; but possibly the latter was too well pleased to have his son back again to be very particular in his inquiries. Not so Abner. He was evidently excited by his nephew s visit to the prophet, and struck perhaps by the change in Saul himself, and would gladly have heard more. But Saul does not gratify his curiosity. <span class="cmt_word">Of the matter of the kingdom... he told him not.</span> It was not merely prudent, but right to keep the matter secret. An able man like Abner would probably have begun to scheme for so great an end.
