This group consisted of those who were in distress, in debt, or discontented, reflecting David's role as a leader for the marginalized. The number 600 is significant in biblical narratives, often symbolizing a complete or substantial group, as seen in other military contexts (e.g., <a href="/judges/18-11.htm">Judges 18:11</a>).<p><b>set out and departed from Keilah</b><br>Keilah was a fortified city in the lowlands of Judah, which David had just saved from the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/23.htm">1 Samuel 23:1-5</a>). Despite his victory, David had to leave due to the threat from Saul, highlighting the precariousness of his situation. This departure underscores the theme of David as a fugitive, constantly on the move to evade Saul's pursuit.<p><b>moving from place to place</b><br>This phrase captures the transient and uncertain nature of David's life during this period. It reflects the broader biblical theme of God's anointed being tested and refined through trials and wanderings, similar to the Israelites in the wilderness. David's movement also foreshadows the itinerant ministry of Jesus, who had "no place to lay his head" (<a href="/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>).<p><b>When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah</b><br>Saul's pursuit of David is relentless, driven by jealousy and fear of losing his kingdom. This pursuit is a key narrative tension in 1 Samuel, illustrating the conflict between Saul's declining kingship and David's rise as God's chosen leader. Saul's reliance on intelligence reports contrasts with David's reliance on divine guidance, as seen in his consultations with the prophet Gad and the priest Abiathar.<p><b>he declined to go forth</b><br>Saul's decision not to pursue David further at Keilah shows his strategic calculations and perhaps a recognition of the futility of capturing David, who is under God's protection. This moment highlights Saul's increasing impotence and the divine favor that shields David, reinforcing the theme of God's sovereignty in the rise and fall of leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, currently fleeing from King Saul.
