The timing suggests an immediate consequence of Saul's growing animosity towards David.<p><b>a spirit of distress sent from God</b><br>This spirit is understood as a divine judgment upon Saul for his disobedience and rejection as king. It reflects the Old Testament understanding of God's sovereignty over all spirits, both good and evil. This distressing spirit contrasts with the Holy Spirit, who had departed from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/16-14.htm">1 Samuel 16:14</a>). It serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God's commands.<p><b>came upon Saul</b><br>The phrase indicates a sudden and overpowering influence, suggesting that Saul was not in control of his actions. This aligns with other instances in Scripture where individuals are overtaken by a spirit, such as the prophets who are moved by the Holy Spirit to speak God's words.<p><b>and he prophesied inside the house</b><br>The act of prophesying here is not in the sense of delivering divine messages, but rather an ecstatic, uncontrolled behavior. This is similar to the frenzied state seen in <a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a> when Saul first encountered the prophets. The setting "inside the house" suggests a private, possibly domestic environment, contrasting with public prophetic acts.<p><b>while David played the harp as usual</b><br>David's role as a musician was to soothe Saul's troubled spirit, a task he had performed since being brought to Saul's court (<a href="/1_samuel/16-23.htm">1 Samuel 16:23</a>). The harp, a common instrument in ancient Israel, was used in worship and to calm the mind. David's consistent service highlights his faithfulness and contrasts with Saul's instability.<p><b>Now Saul was holding a spear</b><br>The spear is a symbol of Saul's authority and warrior status, but it also foreshadows his violent intentions towards David. This detail sets the stage for Saul's subsequent attempts to harm David, illustrating the growing tension and danger in their relationship. The spear becomes a recurring motif in Saul's pursuit of David, representing his descent into paranoia and aggression.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by Samuel.

Hitherto, when the dark hour came upon Saul the madness showed itself in the form of a dull torpor, a hopeless melancholia, an entire indifference to everything connected with life, as well in the lower as in the higher forms. This earlier phase of the <span class= "ital">soul's malady </span>has been exquisitely pictured by Browning in his poem of "Saul." Now the madness assumes a new phase, and the king is consumed with a murderous jealousy, that fills his whole soul, and drives him now to open deeds of ruffianly violence--now to devise dark plots against the life of the bated one. What a fall for the hero- king of Israel, the anointed of the Lord, whose reign had begun so brilliantly and successfully!<p><span class= "bld">And he prophesied.</span>--In his wild phrenzy--under the control of a power higher than himself, had he not by his breaking off all communion with God, left his soul defenceless and prepared for the presence of the evil spirit?--in his wild phrenzy we read "Saul prophesied." The Dean of Canterbury well calls attention here to the conjugation employed in the original Hebrew of the word rendered "prophesied"--<span class= "ital">the Hith-pael, </span>which is never used by an Old Testament writer of real true prophecy, this being always expressed by the <span class= "ital">Niphal </span>conjugation. This of Saul's was but a bastard imitation.<p>Saul was in a state of phrenzy, unable to master himself, speaking words of which he knew not the meaning, and acting like a man possessed. In all this there was something akin to the powerful emotions which agitated the true prophet: only it was not a holy influence, but one springing from violent) passions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It came to pass on the morrow</span>. The day had been a time of public triumph, and yet one of the chief actors goes home to a sleepless couch, because he thinks that another has received higher honour than himself. His melancholy deepens till a fit of insanity comes on. For <span class="cmt_word">the evil spirit from God came upon Saul.</span> Literally, " an evil spirit (breath) of God descended mightily upon Saul" (see <a href="/1_samuel/16-15.htm">1 Samuel 16:15</a>). Just as all mighty enthusiasms for good come from God, so do strong influences for evil, but in a different way. In all noble acts men are fellow workers with God; when evil carries them away it is of God, because he it is who has made and still maintains the laws of our moral nature; but it is by the working of general laws, and not by any special gift or grace bestowed by him. Saul had brooded over his disappointment, and cherished feelings of discontent at his own lot and of envy at the good of others to such an extent that his mind gave way before the diseased workings of his imagination. And so he lost all control over himself, and <span class="cmt_word">prophesied</span>. The conjugation employed here (Hithpahel) is never used of real, true prophecy (which is always the Niphal), but of a bastard imitation of it. Really Saul was in a state of frenzy, unable to master himself, speaking words of which he knew not the meaning, and acting like a man possessed. In all this there was something akin to the powerful emotions which agitated the true prophet, only it was not a holy influence, but one springing from violent passions and a disturbed state of the mind. In order to soothe him <span class="cmt_word">David played with his hand, as at other times,</span> but without the desired effect. On the contrary, Saul brandished the javelin, which he carried as a sort of sceptre in his hand, with such violence that David twice had to escape from this threat of injury by flight. It is not certain that Saul actually threw the javelin. Had he done so it would be difficult to account for David escaping from it twice. After such an act of violence he would scarcely have trusted himself a second time in Saul's presence. Instead of <span class="cmt_word">Saul cast the javelin,</span> the Septuagint in the Alexandrian codex and the Chaldee render <span class="accented">lifted, i.e.</span> retaining the same consonants, they put vowels which refer the verb to another root. But even with the present vowels it may mean "made as though he would cast," or aimed "the javelin."
