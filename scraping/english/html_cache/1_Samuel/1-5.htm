Elkanah's act of giving Hannah a double portion demonstrates his deep affection and preference for her, despite her barrenness. This gesture is significant in a culture where a woman's worth was often measured by her ability to bear children. The double portion can be seen as a symbol of Elkanah's love and an attempt to comfort Hannah in her distress. This act also foreshadows the future blessing and favor that God would bestow upon Hannah.<p><b>for he loved her</b><br>Elkanah's love for Hannah is emphasized here, highlighting the personal and emotional dynamics within the family. This love is significant because it contrasts with the cultural norm where a woman's value was often tied to her fertility. Elkanah's love for Hannah, despite her inability to bear children, reflects a deeper, unconditional love. This mirrors the love God has for His people, which is not based on their productivity or status but on His covenantal commitment.<p><b>even though the LORD had closed her womb</b><br>The phrase acknowledges God's sovereignty over the circumstances of Hannah's life. In the biblical narrative, barrenness is often portrayed as a temporary state that God can change, as seen in the stories of Sarah, Rebekah, and Rachel. This phrase sets the stage for the miraculous birth of Samuel, emphasizing that God has a purpose and timing for everything. It also highlights a theme of divine intervention and the reversal of fortunes, which is prevalent throughout Scripture. The closing of Hannah's womb can be seen as a test of faith, leading to a greater demonstration of God's power and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hannah.htm">Hannah</a></b><br>A devout woman and the wife of Elkanah, who is deeply loved by her husband but is barren, which causes her great distress.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/elkanah.htm">Elkanah</a></b><br>Hannah's husband, who shows his love for her by giving her a double portion of the sacrificial offering.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/peninnah.htm">Peninnah</a></b><br>Elkanah's other wife, who has children and often provokes Hannah because of her barrenness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shiloh.htm">Shiloh</a></b><br>The religious center where the tabernacle was located during this time, and where Elkanah and his family went to offer sacrifices.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who, in His divine wisdom, had closed Hannah's womb, setting the stage for His greater purposes.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_our_circumstances.htm">God's Sovereignty in Our Circumstances</a></b><br>Recognize that God is in control, even in difficult situations like Hannah's barrenness.

It was an expression of his deep love for her. As Von Gerlach puts it, "Thou art as dear to me as if thou hadst borne me a child." Some scholars would translate the difficult Hebrew expression here by, "But to Hannah he gave a portion of anger or sadness," thus intensifying the natural sorrow of Hannah by representing her husband as unkind. The Vulgate, Luther, and Abarbanel favour this singular interpretation; but the one adopted by the English Version, and explained above, is in all respects grammatically and exegetically to be preferred.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A worthy portion.</span> This rendering is based upon the idea that the Hebrew, which is literally "one portion of two faces," may mean "one portion enough for two persons." But for this there is no sufficient authority, and though the word is a dual, it really signifies the two sides of the face, or more exactly "the two nostrils," and so simply the countenance. The Syriac translation, "a double portion," is based upon an accidental resemblance between the words. As the term sometimes signifies anger from the swelling of the nostrils of an enraged person, the Vulgate translates, "And Elkanah was sad when he gave Hannah her portion; for..." The Septuagint has a different reading, <span class="accented">epes</span> for <span class="accented">apaim</span>, and though the words look different in our writing, they are nearly identical in Hebrew.
