This awareness of danger reflects the Israelites' vulnerability and fear, a recurring theme in their history when they turned away from God. The Philistines were a constant threat during this period, often oppressing Israel due to their superior military technology, including iron chariots and weapons.<p><b>because their troops were hard-pressed</b><br>The Israelite forces were under significant pressure, likely outnumbered and outmatched by the Philistines. This situation highlights the dire circumstances faced by Saul's army, which was poorly equipped and lacking in morale. The phrase "hard-pressed" indicates a sense of desperation and urgency, often leading to panic and disarray among the troops. This reflects the broader theme of Israel's struggles when they rely on human strength rather than divine intervention.<p><b>the men of Israel hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in cellars and cisterns</b><br>The Israelites sought refuge in natural and man-made hiding places, indicating their fear and lack of confidence in their ability to confront the Philistine threat. Caves and thickets were common hiding places in the rugged terrain of Israel, providing cover and protection. Cellars and cisterns, typically used for storage and water collection, were repurposed as shelters in times of crisis. This behavior underscores the Israelites' desperation and the breakdown of their military organization. It also contrasts with later biblical narratives where faith in God leads to victory despite overwhelming odds, such as the story of Gideon or David's triumph over Goliath.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who was leading the Israelites during this time of crisis.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>The enemies of Israel, who were a constant threat and had gathered a formidable army against Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of Israel, who were under Saul's leadership and facing the threat of the Philistine army.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/caves,_thickets,_rocks,_cellars,_cisterns.htm">Caves, Thickets, Rocks, Cellars, Cisterns</a></b><br>Various hiding places where the Israelites sought refuge due to fear and desperation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/michmash.htm">Michmash</a></b><br>The location where the Philistines had gathered their forces, creating a sense of impending doom for the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_and_faith.htm">Fear and Faith</a></b><br>The Israelites' response to fear was to hide, which is a natural human reaction.

The tradition preserved by Josephus tells us that a host of foreign allies had joined the Ph?nician armies in this war. This accounts for the great numbers alluded to in the text: "People as the sand which <span class= "ital">is </span>on the sea shore in multitude" (<a href="/1_samuel/13-5.htm" title="And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude: and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.">1Samuel 13:5</a>). The hearts of the as yet undisciplined Hebrews sank at the tidings of such an invasion. And in high places.--The word in the original Hebrew is not the same as the one usually rendered "high places" for prayer and sacrifice. The word here signifies towers. It is the same word which in <a href="/judges/9-46.htm" title="And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.">Judges 9:46</a>; <a href="/judges/9-49.htm" title="And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire on them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.">Judges 9:49</a> is translated "a hold." In the <span class= "ital">Speaker's Commentary </span>it is suggested that it was applied to a particular kind of tower which was the work of the old Canaanite inhabitants, and which remained as ruins in the time of Saul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The people were distressed.</span> Literally, were squeezed, pressed together, were in difficulties. The Philistines had so promptly answered Saul's challenge, that the Israelites, forgetting their victory over Nahash, whose men, however, had probably very inferior arms to those worn by the Philistines, lost courage; and even the picked band of 2000 men dwindled to 600. As for the mass of the people, they acted with the most abject cowardice, hiding themselves in <span class="cmt_word">caves</span>, of which there are very many in the limestone ranges of Palestine. David subsequently found safety in them when hunted by Saul. Also <span class="cmt_word">in thickets.</span> The word as spelt here occurs nowhere else, nor do the versions agree as to its meaning. Most probably it signifies <span class="accented">clefts</span>, rifts or fissures in the <span class="cmt_word">rocks</span>. The next word, rocks, certainly means precipitous <span class="accented">cliffs</span>; and thickets or thorn bushes would scarcely be placed between caverns and cliffs, both of which belong to mountains. <span class="cmt_word">In high places.</span> This word occurs elsewhere only in <a href="/judges/9-46.htm">Judges 9:46, 49</a>, where it is rendered <span class="accented">hold.</span> But this meaning is not supported by the ancient versions, and it more probably signifies a vault or crypt, which better suits the hiding place next mentioned, <span class="cmt_word">pits</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> tanks, artificial reservoirs for water, with which most districts were well supplied in Palestine, even before its conquest by Israel.
