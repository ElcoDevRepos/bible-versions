Their fear here is significant, as it shows a recognition of the power associated with the Ark of the Covenant, which had just entered the Israelite camp. Historically, the Philistines were known for their military prowess, yet they were aware of the stories of the God of Israel and His mighty acts, such as the plagues in Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea. This fear indicates a deep-seated respect and dread for the divine power they believed was now against them.<p><b>&#8220;The gods have entered their camp!&#8221; they said.</b><br>The Philistines, being polytheistic, interpreted the presence of the Ark as the arrival of multiple deities. This reflects their misunderstanding of the monotheistic faith of Israel. The Ark symbolized the presence of Yahweh, the one true God, among His people. This phrase highlights the cultural and religious differences between the Philistines and Israelites. It also underscores the Philistines' perception of divine intervention in battles, a common belief in the ancient Near East.<p><b>&#8220;Woe to us, for nothing like this has happened before.</b><br>The expression of woe signifies a deep sense of impending doom. The Philistines' acknowledgment that "nothing like this has happened before" suggests their awareness of the unprecedented nature of the situation. Historically, the Ark had not been brought into battle in this manner, and its presence was a new and terrifying development for the Philistines. This phrase can also be seen as a foreshadowing of the eventual defeat and capture of the Ark, which was a significant event in Israel's history. The fear of the Philistines contrasts with the Israelites' misplaced confidence in the Ark as a talisman, rather than in God Himself.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A significant group of people in the Old Testament, often in conflict with the Israelites.

This is not ordinary battlefield anxiety; it is terror sparked by the realization that they face something far greater than Israel&#8217;s soldiers. Earlier, when other nations sensed the Lord&#8217;s hand with Israel, they responded similarly (<a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9&#8211;11</a>; <a href="/exodus/15-14.htm">Exodus 15:14&#8211;16</a>). The Philistines, hardened warriors, suddenly mirror that same dread. Such fear underscores a principle woven through Scripture: the mere possibility of God&#8217;s active presence can unnerve even the most confident enemy (<a href="/psalms/48-4.htm">Psalm 48:4&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;The gods have entered their camp!&#8221; they said.</b><p>From their pagan worldview, the Philistines interpret the arrival of the Ark as multiple deities joining Israel. They do not grasp that the Ark represents the one true God who &#8220;is enthroned between the cherubim&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/6-2.htm">2 Samuel 6:2</a>). Still, their conclusion is correct in essence&#8212;the Lord Himself has entered the scene. <a href="/numbers/10-35.htm">Numbers 10:35</a> records Moses saying, &#8220;Rise up, O LORD, and let Your enemies be scattered,&#8221; whenever the Ark set out. The same expectation reverberates here. By calling the Ark &#8220;the gods,&#8221; they inadvertently testify to the Ark&#8217;s reputation for unleashing divine power, a reputation built during Israel&#8217;s exodus and wilderness wanderings (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24&#8211;25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Woe to us, for nothing like this has happened before.&#8221;</b><p>Panic shifts to hopelessness. The Philistines believe they stand on unprecedented ground&#8212;no prior campaign prepared them for fighting a God who parts seas, levels walls, and makes the sun stand still (<a href="/joshua/10-12.htm">Joshua 10:12&#8211;14</a>). <a href="/judges/7-12.htm">Judges 7:12</a> shows Midianites fearful and &#8220;as numerous as locusts,&#8221; yet God still routed them; here the Philistines sense a similar fate. Their lament, &#8220;Woe to us,&#8221; echoes human helplessness whenever people collide with the Holy One (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>). In confessing &#8220;nothing like this has happened,&#8221; they unwittingly acknowledge the uniqueness of Israel&#8217;s covenant relationship with the living God (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34&#8211;35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/4-7.htm">1 Samuel 4:7</a> reveals more than enemy jitters; it showcases the awe-inspiring reality of God&#8217;s presence. The Philistines&#8217; fear, their mislabeling of the Ark, and their despair all spotlight the Lord&#8217;s unmatched power. Though pagans misunderstand Him, they still tremble, proving that the living God commands respect from all. The verse reminds believers today that when God steps into any situation, He brings authority that turns confident opposition into fearful recognition and highlights His faithful commitment to His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">God is come into the camp.</span>--The joy manifested by the Israelites at the arrival of the Ark from the sanctuary made the Philistines suspect that their enemies' God was now present with the defeated army.<p>The city of Aphek, near to which the camp of Israel was pitched, was close to the western entrance of the Pass of Beth-horon. The two defeats of Israel are termed in this Commentary the Battles of Aphek. The name of Eben-ezer, by which the scene was known in after days, was only given to the locality some twenty years later, on the occasion of the victory of Samuel near the same spot.<p>Philistines and Israelites, then, were equally superstitious in their belief both supposing that Deity was in some way connected with the lifeless gold and wood of the symbol Ark and Cherubim. But the Philistines had some excuse for their fears. Tradition was, no doubt, current among the old inhabitants of Canaan how this sacred Ark had been carried before the conquering armies of Israel in many a battle and siege in those bygone days, when the strange shepherd hordes under Joshua had. first invaded and taken possession of their beautiful land. The next verse explains more clearly some of the reasons for their fear.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/4-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">the Philistines</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hap&#183;p&#601;&#183;li&#353;&#183;t&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
