In the biblical context, prosperity often signifies God's favor and blessing. David's success is not limited to a single event but is a continuous state, indicating divine approval. Historically, David's rise from a shepherd boy to a favored servant in King Saul's court exemplifies this prosperity. His victories in battle and growing reputation among the people of Israel further illustrate his success. This prosperity can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promises to Israel, where obedience and faithfulness lead to blessing and success (<a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). David's life foreshadows the ultimate prosperity and victory found in Jesus Christ, who perfectly fulfilled God's will.<p><b>because the LORD was with him</b><br>The presence of the LORD with David is the key reason for his prosperity. In the Old Testament, God's presence is often associated with guidance, protection, and blessing. This divine presence is a recurring theme in the lives of biblical figures such as Joseph (<a href="/genesis/39-2.htm">Genesis 39:2-3</a>) and Moses (<a href="/exodus/33-14.htm">Exodus 33:14</a>). The LORD's presence with David signifies a special relationship and covenantal faithfulness. It also underscores the idea that true success and prosperity come from God, not human effort alone. This phrase connects to the New Testament promise of God's presence with believers through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>, <a href="/john/14-16.htm">John 14:16-17</a>). David's experience serves as a type of Christ, who perfectly embodied God's presence and brought ultimate salvation and prosperity to humanity through His life, death, and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, David is a young shepherd who has been anointed by Samuel to be the future king of Israel.
