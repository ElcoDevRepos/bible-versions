As a Levitical city, it was designated for the priests and Levites, who were responsible for religious duties and the care of the Ark of the Covenant. This context is significant because the Ark was returning to a place where it should have been respected and understood.<p><b>were harvesting wheat in the valley</b><br>The timing of the wheat harvest places this event in late spring or early summer, a period of agricultural significance in ancient Israel. Harvest time was a season of hard work but also of joy and celebration, as it represented God's provision. The valley location suggests fertile land, ideal for agriculture, and highlights the everyday life of the Israelites, who were primarily agrarian.<p><b>and when they looked up and saw the ark</b><br>The Ark of the Covenant was the most sacred object in Israel, symbolizing God's presence among His people. Its return from Philistine captivity was a momentous event. The phrase "looked up" suggests an unexpected and divine encounter, as the Ark's return was not anticipated. This moment echoes other biblical instances where looking up signifies a revelation or divine intervention.<p><b>they were overjoyed at the sight</b><br>The joy of the people reflects the deep spiritual and national significance of the Ark's return. It was not merely a religious artifact but a symbol of God's covenant and favor. Their joy can be compared to other biblical instances of rejoicing at God's deliverance, such as the Israelites' celebration after crossing the Red Sea. This joy also prefigures the joy of believers in the presence of Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's covenant promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/beth-shemesh.htm">Beth-shemesh</a></b><br>A town in the territory of Judah, allocated to the Levites.

Having the ark arrive here fulfills God&#8217;s design that His sacred things rest among those He appointed to guard them (<a href="/numbers/4-15.htm">Numbers 4:15</a>). Its location at the border with Philistia (<a href="/1_samuel/6-9.htm">1 Samuel 6:9</a>) made it the natural first stop once the milk-cows turned toward Israel. This moment reminds us that God orders geography and timing for His own glory, just as He placed the tabernacle &#8220;in the midst&#8221; of the camp (<a href="/numbers/2-17.htm">Numbers 2:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>were harvesting wheat in the valley</b><p>Life was proceeding as usual. Wheat harvest falls in late May or early June (cf. <a href="/exodus/34-22.htm">Exodus 34:22</a>; <a href="/judges/15-1.htm">Judges 15:1</a>). The valley&#8212;likely the Sorek&#8212;was broad and fertile, perfect for threshing floors (<a href="/ruth/2-23.htm">Ruth 2:23</a>). God&#8217;s intervention meets them in ordinary labor, echoing how Jesus later finds fishermen while mending nets (<a href="/matthew/4-18.htm">Matthew 4:18-22</a>). Scripture often pairs harvest imagery with divine visitation: <a href="/joel/3-13.htm">Joel 3:13</a> speaks of multitudes in the &#8220;valley of decision,&#8221; underscoring that routine fields can become stages for God&#8217;s dramatic acts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and when they looked up</b><p>The phrase signals a sudden, eye-opening interruption (<a href="/genesis/22-13.htm">Genesis 22:13</a>; <a href="/john/4-35.htm">John 4:35</a>). It pictures heads lifting from daily toil to perceive what God is doing. Spiritual attentiveness is essential; Israel missed earlier warnings when they kept their heads down in complacency (<a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>). Here, however, the workers respond immediately, showing hearts ready to recognize the Lord&#8217;s hand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and saw the ark</b><p>The ark was the tangible symbol of God&#8217;s throne (<a href="/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>). After seven months in Philistine captivity (<a href="/1_samuel/6-1.htm">1 Samuel 6:1</a>), its reappearance declared that no foreign power can imprison the Holy One (<a href="/1_samuel/5-11.htm">1 Samuel 5:11-12</a>). Like the pillar of cloud in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>) or the ark leading across the Jordan (<a href="/joshua/3-3.htm">Joshua 3:3-4</a>), this sight proclaimed God&#8217;s faithful return to dwell among His people. It also foreshadowed a greater revelation: Christ, &#8220;the radiance of God&#8217;s glory,&#8221; coming into the world (<a href="/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they were overjoyed at the sight</b><p>Joy is the fitting response to God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>). The men of Beth-shemesh echo David who &#8220;danced before the LORD with all his might&#8221; when the ark later entered Jerusalem (<a href="/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14-15</a>). Their rejoicing fulfills <a href="/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7</a>&#8212;&#8220;You shall rejoice before the LORD your God.&#8221; Nevertheless, joy must be joined with reverence; the same chapter recounts their fatal mistake of looking into the ark (<a href="/1_samuel/6-19.htm">1 Samuel 6:19</a>). Gladness without obedience is incomplete, but here the initial delight rightly honors God&#8217;s faithfulness and mercy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/6-13.htm">1 Samuel 6:13</a> captures a vivid scene where faithful Israelites, busy with everyday work, suddenly encounter the returning ark. The verse teaches that God sovereignly directs events to restore His presence, meets His people amid routine responsibilities, invites watchful hearts to recognize His hand, and elicits joyous praise. It stands as a call to live alert and responsive, ready to celebrate the Lord who breaks into ordinary moments with extraordinary grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">And they of Beth-shemesh.</span>--Beth-shemesh, or "House of the Sun," nearly equivalent to Heliopolis, "City of the Sun," was a priestly city. It would thus have seemed that this was a fitting home for the Ark of the Covenant to rest in for a time. Shiloh, the old sanctuary, was, we know, now desolate and ruined; but the priests and Levites, from what follows, evidently had forfeited their old position as guides and teachers of the people. Beth-shemesh was no fit permanent dwelling for the Ark of God. The story of the priestly life in the once famous Shiloh during the latter years of Eli indicated how utterly incapable the Levitical families were to influence and guide the people. The subsequent conduct of priestly Beth-shemesh on this memorable occasion, therefore, is not to be wondered at; at first they seem to have rejoiced at the sight of their lost sacred treasure, but an act of careless irreverence called down a swift and unexpected punishment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="cmt_word">And they of Beth-shemesh.</span> More exactly, "And Beth-shemesh was reaping its wheat harvest," the whole population being in the fields.

Robinson ('Later Bibl. Res.,' 153) speaks of the site of Beth-shemesh as a very noble one, being "a low plateau at the junction of two fine plains." The wheat harvest takes place in Palestine in May, and consequently the disastrous battle of Eben-ezer must have been fought in the previous October. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/6-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now [the people of] Beth-shemesh</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1428;&#1502;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;e&#183;me&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
