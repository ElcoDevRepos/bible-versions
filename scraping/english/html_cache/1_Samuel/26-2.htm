The "three thousand chosen men" indicates a select group of elite soldiers, suggesting the seriousness of Saul's pursuit. This mirrors earlier instances where Saul mobilized significant forces against perceived threats, such as in <a href="/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2</a>. The number "three thousand" is significant, as it often represents a complete and formidable force in biblical narratives. This pursuit reflects Saul's ongoing jealousy and fear of David, who was anointed by Samuel to be the next king of Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>). Saul's actions can be seen as a desperate attempt to maintain his kingship, despite God's rejection of him (<a href="/1_samuel/15-26.htm">1 Samuel 15:26-28</a>).<p><b>went down to the Wilderness of Ziph</b><br>The Wilderness of Ziph is located in the Judean desert, south of Hebron. This area is characterized by its rugged terrain and sparse vegetation, making it an ideal hiding place for David and his men. The geographical setting underscores the theme of David as a fugitive, constantly on the run from Saul. The wilderness also serves as a place of testing and preparation for David, much like the wilderness experiences of other biblical figures such as Moses and Jesus. The Ziphites, inhabitants of the region, previously betrayed David's location to Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/23-19.htm">1 Samuel 23:19</a>), highlighting the political complexities and dangers David faced.<p><b>to search for David there</b><br>Saul's relentless pursuit of David is a central theme in 1 Samuel, illustrating the conflict between the current king and God's chosen successor. This search is not just a physical pursuit but also a spiritual and moral struggle. David, despite being hunted, consistently refuses to harm Saul, demonstrating his respect for God's anointed king and his trust in God's timing for his own ascension to the throne. This narrative foreshadows the New Testament portrayal of Jesus, who, despite being pursued and persecuted, remained obedient to God's will and refrained from retaliating against His enemies. Saul's search for David can also be seen as a metaphor for humanity's often misguided search for power and control, contrasting with David's reliance on God's guidance and protection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by Samuel.

He is still God&#8217;s anointed king (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>), yet his heart has drifted into jealousy and fear of David (<a href="/1_samuel/18-8.htm">1 Samuel 18:8&#8211;9</a>). Earlier he had admitted, &#8220;You are more righteous than I&#8221; after David spared his life (<a href="/1_samuel/24-17.htm">1 Samuel 24:17</a>), but his repentance was shallow. Here we see:<p>&#8226; The persistence of unchecked sin&#8212;Saul returns to the hunt even after a tearful confession (compare <a href="/1_samuel/24-16.htm">1 Samuel 24:16&#8211;22</a> with 26:2).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereignty&#8212;though Saul wields royal authority, the Lord is at work through David&#8217;s patience (<a href="/bsb/psalms/59.htm">Psalm 59</a> superscription ties David&#8217;s trials to Saul&#8217;s pursuit).<p>Cross references remind us that kingship without obedience ends in tragedy (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22&#8211;26</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>accompanied by three thousand chosen men of Israel</b><p>Saul does not come alone; he selects Israel&#8217;s elite soldiers, mirroring an earlier episode: &#8220;Saul took three thousand chosen men&#8230; to seek David&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/24-2.htm">1 Samuel 24:2</a>). This detail highlights:<p>&#8226; The imbalance&#8212;one fugitive versus an army (compare <a href="/psalms/3-6.htm">Psalm 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s determination&#8212;he marshals significant resources for a personal vendetta (<a href="/james/4-1.htm">James 4:1&#8211;2</a> speaks to desires that wage war).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s restraint&#8212;though outnumbered, David remains preserved, echoing Gideon&#8217;s smaller force defeating Midian (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>).<p>Other parallels: Saul once drafted similar numbers to defend Israel against the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/13-2.htm">1 Samuel 13:2</a>); now he turns that strength inward.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>went down to the Wilderness of Ziph</b><p>The Wilderness of Ziph, south of Hebron, is a barren, rocky region. David had hidden there before, and the Ziphites had betrayed him (<a href="/1_samuel/23-19.htm">1 Samuel 23:19</a>). Key thoughts:<p>&#8226; Geography serves God&#8217;s purposes&#8212;He uses lonely places to shape His servants (compare Moses in Midian, <a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>).<p>&#8226; David&#8217;s consistency&#8212;he stays where God leads, even if betrayal repeats (<a href="/bsb/psalms/54.htm">Psalm 54</a>&#8217;s title ties directly to Ziph).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s descent&#8212;&#8220;went down&#8221; hints at more than altitude; it marks moral decline (<a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a> &#8220;went down&#8221; to Joppa when fleeing God).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to search for David there.</b><p>Saul&#8217;s mission is explicit: hunt David. Yet God&#8217;s plan is unfolding:<p>&#8226; David is God&#8217;s chosen future king (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>); Saul&#8217;s search opposes divine intent, much like Pharaoh pursuing Israel (<a href="/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritual blindness&#8212;Saul thinks eliminating David secures the throne, ignoring Samuel&#8217;s word that the kingdom is torn from him (<a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Providence&#8212;God orchestrates another opportunity for David to demonstrate mercy (<a href="/1_samuel/26-7.htm">1 Samuel 26:7&#8211;12</a>), highlighting Christ-like forbearance (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19&#8211;21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/26-2.htm">1 Samuel 26:2</a> paints a vivid scene: Saul, still king but spiritually adrift, mobilizes elite troops to chase one innocent man through the harsh Wilderness of Ziph. Every phrase underscores contrast&#8212;human power versus God&#8217;s protection, royal authority versus divine sovereignty, repeated sin versus steadfast faith. Though Saul &#8220;went down,&#8221; God is lifting David up, proving again that the Lord preserves His anointed and turns even hostile pursuits into platforms for grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/26.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph.</span>--We assume, then, that after the marriage of David with Abigail he and his armed band returned again to his old neighbourhood in the south--in the desert of Judah--the district named after the Hill of Hachilah being, no doubt, in all respects well adapted for the permanent encampment of such a large band as David's now most certainly was. David, who had been forced on a previous occasion to leave it on account of the hot pursuit of Saul, aided by the Ziphites, who knew the country and its resources so well, probably now supposed, after the protestation of Saul at En-gedi, that he would now at least be left in peace. But he forgot with whom he had to do--forgot the state of mind of his determined foe, and how likely it was that the old mania would return with redoubled force. The Ziphites, however, who knew Saul, and the feeling respecting David which existed at the court of Saul, repeated their old tactics, and sent, as on a previous occasion, to suggest that with their help the obnoxious chieftain and his free lances could be destroyed. The temptation was too great to be resisted; so probably, with the advice of Abner, Saul took the field again. The 3,000 seem to have been the standing force which Saul kept round him in the Gibeah garrison. (See the first notice of this standing army in <a href="/1_samuel/13-2.htm" title="Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.">1Samuel 13:2</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Three thousand chosen men</span>.
