In biblical context, "that day" often signifies a moment of divine intervention or judgment. It underscores God's sovereignty and the certainty of His plans. This concept is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12</a>, where "the day of the Lord" is a time of reckoning.<p><b>I will carry out</b><br>This indicates God's active role in executing His judgment. It emphasizes His authority and power to fulfill His promises and warnings. The phrase reflects the biblical theme of divine justice, where God ensures that His word does not return void, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>.<p><b>against Eli</b><br>Eli was the high priest of Israel, and his household was under divine scrutiny due to the sins of his sons, Hophni and Phinehas, and his failure to restrain them. This highlights the biblical principle of accountability, especially for those in spiritual leadership. Eli's story serves as a warning about the consequences of neglecting one's duty to uphold God's standards.<p><b>everything I have spoken</b><br>This refers to the prophetic word previously delivered to Eli through a man of God in <a href="/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27-36</a>. It underscores the reliability and seriousness of God's prophetic messages. The fulfillment of prophecy is a recurring theme in the Bible, affirming God's omniscience and faithfulness.<p><b>about his house</b><br>The "house" of Eli refers to his family lineage and priestly line. In ancient Israel, the family was a central social unit, and the priesthood was often hereditary. The judgment against Eli's house signifies the end of his family's priestly role, which is later fulfilled when the priesthood is transferred to the line of Zadok during Solomon's reign (<a href="/1_kings/2-27.htm">1 Kings 2:27, 35</a>).<p><b>from beginning to end</b><br>This phrase indicates the comprehensive nature of God's judgment, leaving nothing incomplete. It reflects the thoroughness of divine justice and the fulfillment of God's word in its entirety. This concept is mirrored in <a href="/revelation/1-8.htm">Revelation 1:8</a>, where God is described as the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, signifying His eternal nature and the completeness of His plans.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A young boy serving in the temple under Eli, who is called by God to be a prophet.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli.htm">Eli</a></b><br>The high priest of Israel, who has failed to restrain his sons from wickedness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli's_sons.htm">Eli's Sons</a></b><br>Hophni and Phinehas, who are corrupt priests, abusing their positions and leading Israel astray.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The place where Samuel serves and where God speaks to him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_judgment.htm">God's Judgment</a></b><br>The divine decree against Eli's house due to their persistent sin and Eli's failure to correct it.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_spiritual_leadership.htm">The Seriousness of Spiritual Leadership</a></b><br>Spiritual leaders are held to a high standard.
