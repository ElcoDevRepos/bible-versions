The selection of Aaron and his descendants is detailed in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28-29</a>. This choice underscores the concept of divine election, where God chooses individuals or groups for specific purposes. The priesthood was a sacred office, and Aaron's selection set a precedent for the hereditary nature of the Levitical priesthood. This choice also highlights the special role of the Levites among the tribes of Israel, as they were set apart for religious duties.<p><b>to offer sacrifices on My altar</b><br>The altar was central to Israelite worship, serving as the place where sacrifices were made to atone for sin and express devotion to God. The priest's role in offering sacrifices was crucial, as it mediated between God and the people. This practice is rooted in the sacrificial system established in Leviticus, which foreshadows the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>to burn incense</b><br>Burning incense was a priestly duty associated with prayer and worship, symbolizing the prayers of the people ascending to God (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>). The incense altar was located in the Holy Place, just outside the Holy of Holies, indicating the closeness of this act to God's presence. This practice emphasizes the importance of intercession and the priestly role as a mediator.<p><b>and to wear an ephod in My presence</b><br>The ephod was a priestly garment, part of the sacred attire described in <a href="/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a>. It was worn by the high priest and symbolized his unique role and authority. The ephod included the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim, used for discerning God's will. This garment signifies the dignity and responsibility of the priestly office and points to Christ as our High Priest, who intercedes for us before God (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p><b>I also gave to the house of your father all the food offerings of the Israelites</b><br>The food offerings, or portions of the sacrifices, were designated for the priests as their sustenance (<a href="/leviticus/2-3.htm">Leviticus 2:3, 7</a>:31-34). This provision underscores God's care for those who serve Him and the principle that those who minister at the altar should share in the offerings (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-13.htm">1 Corinthians 9:13-14</a>). It reflects the broader biblical theme of God's provision for His servants and the community's responsibility to support them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli.htm">Eli</a></b><br>The high priest during the time of Samuel's birth, Eli is a central figure in this passage.

Out of the twelve tribes He singled out Levi&#8212;and within Levi, Aaron&#8217;s household&#8212;to stand between Himself and the nation. This divine election carries weighty privilege and equal responsibility. By addressing &#8220;your father,&#8221; the Lord links Eli directly to that original call, underscoring that sacred duty passes from generation to generation. When priests fail, they reject not only an office but God&#8217;s personal appointment (<a href="/malachi/2-1.htm">Malachi 2:1-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to offer sacrifices on My altar</b><p>Priests were commissioned to present sin, burnt, peace, grain, and guilt offerings exactly as prescribed (<a href="/bsb/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1&#8211;7</a>). Each blood-sprinkled sacrifice pointed forward to the ultimate atonement in Christ (<a href="/hebrews/5-1.htm">Hebrews 5:1-3</a>; 9:11-14). Handling the altar was never a casual task; it was the center of reconciliation between a holy God and a sinful people. Eli&#8217;s sons treated these offerings with contempt (<a href="/1_samuel/2-17.htm">1 Samuel 2:17</a>), proving how far they had drifted from their core calling.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to burn incense</b><p>Morning and evening, priests lit sweet incense on the golden altar inside the tabernacle (<a href="/exodus/30-7.htm">Exodus 30:7-8</a>). Scripture pictures incense as the prayers of God&#8217;s people rising before Him (<a href="/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/8-3.htm">Revelation 8:3-4</a>). The duty symbolized intercession&#8212;standing in the holy place and representing Israel&#8217;s worship. When priests neglected holiness, their intercession rang hollow. God&#8217;s reminder here presses Eli: true mediation demands purity, not ritual alone.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and to wear an ephod in My presence</b><p>The ephod&#8212;woven of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn (<a href="/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4-12</a>)&#8212;held the breastpiece over the priest&#8217;s heart with the names of the tribes engraved on onyx stones. Every time a priest donned it, he carried Israel before the Lord. By invoking the ephod, God highlights both intimacy and accountability: the priest must walk before Him, bearing people&#8217;s burdens, and receive divine guidance (<a href="/1_samuel/23-9.htm">1 Samuel 23:9-12</a>). Eli&#8217;s household wore the garment, but their lives betrayed the symbolism.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I also gave to the house of your father all the food offerings of the Israelites</b><p>God provided portions of grain, meat, and wave offerings so His priests could live from the altar (<a href="/leviticus/7-31.htm">Leviticus 7:31-34</a>; <a href="/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8-14</a>). Receiving these gifts required gratitude and restraint. Instead, Eli&#8217;s sons seized raw meat with force (<a href="/1_samuel/2-13.htm">1 Samuel 2:13-16</a>), turning provision into profiteering. The Lord&#8217;s statement exposes their ingratitude: what was meant to sustain ministry became fuel for greed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/2-28.htm">1 Samuel 2:28</a> is God&#8217;s concise review of priestly privilege: chosen lineage, sacred service, intercessory worship, representative dignity, and generous provision. Each clause recalls a covenant gift that Eli&#8217;s family had mishandled. The verse warns that divine election never cancels responsibility; it heightens it. When God entrusts high honor, He expects holy obedience&#8212;a truth unchanged for every believer called to serve today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel? . . .</span>--After such glorious privileges had been conferred on this favoured house, and such ample provision for all its wants had been made for it, it was indeed a crime of the blackest ingratitude that its leading members should pour dishonour on their invisible King and Benefactor.<p><span class= "bld">To wear an ephod before me.</span>--This included the privilege, which belonged to the head of the house of Aaron, the reigning high priest, of entering the Holy of Holies--that lightless inner sanctuary where the visible presence of the Eternal was ever and anon pleased to dwell--and also the possession of the mysterious Urim and Thummim, by which enquiry could be made of the will of the invisible King of Israel.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/2-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And out of all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mik&#183;k&#257;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
