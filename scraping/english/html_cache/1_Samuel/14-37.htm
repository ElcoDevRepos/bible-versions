Saul, as king, had the responsibility to seek God's will before making significant military decisions. This reflects the theocratic nature of Israel, where God was seen as the ultimate leader. Saul's inquiry likely involved the use of the Urim and Thummim, sacred lots used by the high priest to discern God's will (<a href="/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>). This practice underscores the importance of divine guidance in leadership, a theme echoed throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>&#8220;Shall I go down after the Philistines?</b><br>The Philistines were a perennial enemy of Israel, often depicted as a formidable military force. Saul's question indicates a strategic decision point, as pursuing the Philistines could lead to either victory or disaster. The phrase "go down" suggests a geographical descent, possibly from the highlands of Israel to the coastal plains where the Philistines resided. This reflects the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Philistines, a central theme in the books of Samuel.<p><b>Will You give them into the hand of Israel?&#8221;</b><br>This phrase highlights Saul's dependence on God for victory, acknowledging that success in battle was attributed to divine intervention rather than mere human effort. The concept of God delivering enemies into the hands of His people is a recurring motif in the Old Testament, seen in stories like Joshua's conquest of Canaan (<a href="/joshua/10-8.htm">Joshua 10:8</a>). It emphasizes the belief that God fights for Israel, a notion that reinforces Israel's identity as God's chosen people.<p><b>But God did not answer him that day.</b><br>The silence of God in response to Saul's inquiry is significant. It suggests a break in the relationship between Saul and God, possibly due to Saul's earlier disobedience (<a href="/1_samuel/13-13.htm">1 Samuel 13:13-14</a>). This silence can be seen as a form of divine judgment, indicating that Saul's leadership was no longer under God's favor. The absence of an answer also foreshadows Saul's eventual downfall and the rise of David, who is portrayed as a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). This moment serves as a turning point in the narrative, highlighting the consequences of disobedience and the importance of maintaining a right relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.
