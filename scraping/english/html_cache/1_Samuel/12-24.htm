This fear is not about terror but about recognizing God's holiness and authority. In the context of 1 Samuel, Israel had just demanded a king, and Samuel reminds them that their ultimate allegiance should be to God, not a human leader. This phrase echoes <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, where the fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, highlighting its foundational importance in a believer's life.<p><b>and serve Him faithfully</b><br>Service to God is a recurring theme in the Bible, often linked with faithfulness. In the historical context, Israel was transitioning from a theocracy to a monarchy, and Samuel stresses the importance of remaining loyal to God despite political changes. Faithful service involves obedience and dedication, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/10-12.htm">Deuteronomy 10:12</a>, where serving God with all one's heart and soul is commanded. This service is not just ritualistic but involves a genuine commitment to God's will.<p><b>with all your heart</b><br>The heart in biblical terms represents the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. Serving God with all one's heart implies total devotion and sincerity. This phrase connects to the Shema in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, where loving God with all one's heart, soul, and strength is commanded. It underscores the need for wholehearted commitment, not just outward compliance.<p><b>consider what great things He has done for you</b><br>Reflecting on God's past deeds is a common biblical exhortation, encouraging gratitude and trust. For Israel, this included deliverance from Egypt, provision in the wilderness, and victories in Canaan. This reflection serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and power, encouraging continued reliance on Him. In a broader biblical context, it points to the ultimate act of salvation through Jesus Christ, who fulfills God's promises and demonstrates His love and power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel, a prophet, and a leader who anointed the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David.
