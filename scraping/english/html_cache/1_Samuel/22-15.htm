The inquiry of God refers to seeking divine guidance, often through the Urim and Thummim, sacred lots used by the high priest. This practice was common in Israel for making important decisions (<a href="/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>). Ahimelech suggests that consulting God for David was not unusual, indicating David's established reputation as a faithful servant of Saul and a man of God.<p><b>Far be it from me!</b><br>This phrase is a strong denial of wrongdoing. Ahimelech emphasizes his innocence and integrity. The expression is used elsewhere in Scripture to reject false accusations or actions contrary to God's will (<a href="/genesis/18-25.htm">Genesis 18:25</a>). It underscores the priest's commitment to righteousness and his shock at being implicated in a conspiracy against the king.<p><b>Let not the king accuse your servant or any of my father&#8217;s household,</b><br>Ahimelech pleads for the king not to hold him or his family responsible. The term "your servant" reflects humility and submission to Saul's authority. The mention of his father's household highlights the communal nature of guilt and punishment in ancient Israel, where families could suffer for an individual's actions (<a href="/joshua/7-24.htm">Joshua 7:24-25</a>). Ahimelech seeks to protect his family from unjust retribution.<p><b>for your servant knew nothing of this whole affair&#8212;</b><br>Ahimelech asserts his ignorance of any conspiracy involving David. This statement is crucial, as it highlights the priest's lack of awareness of David's status as a fugitive. It reflects the broader theme of innocence and misunderstanding that pervades the narrative, as Saul's paranoia leads to tragic consequences.<p><b>not in part or in whole.</b><br>The repetition emphasizes Ahimelech's complete lack of knowledge regarding the situation. This phrase underscores the thoroughness of his denial, leaving no room for partial guilt. It reflects the biblical principle of truthfulness and integrity, as seen in other scriptural contexts where complete honesty is required (<a href="/ephesians/4-25.htm">Ephesians 4:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ahimelech.htm">Ahimelech</a></b><br>The high priest who served at Nob.

He reminds Saul that seeking the LORD for David was not a one-off favor but part of a long-standing pattern.<p>&#8226; Priests regularly asked God for guidance on behalf of Israel&#8217;s leaders (<a href="/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/33-8.htm">Deuteronomy 33:8</a>).<p>&#8226; David, already known as &#8220;a man after God&#8217;s own heart,&#8221; often sought divine direction (<a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2&#8211;4</a>; 30:7-8).<p>&#8226; By pointing to that history, Ahimelech highlights David&#8217;s proven loyalty (<a href="/1_samuel/18-13.htm">1 Samuel 18:13-16</a>) and underscores that nothing about the consultation should look suspicious.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Far Be It From Me!</b><p>&#8220;Far be it from me!&#8221;<p>This strong protest signals both innocence and reverence.

His emphatic &#8220;Far be it from me!&#8221; and plea for his household spotlight his innocence and Saul&#8217;s unjust rage. The verse calls readers to trust the LORD&#8217;s perfect justice even when earthly authorities distort it, and to keep serving faithfully, knowing God ultimately vindicates those who walk uprightly (<a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5-6</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Did I then begin to enquire?</span>--The English translation of the Hebrew here would imply that David had on many previous occasions received through him (the high priest) Divine directions from the Urim and Thummim. "Did I that day <span class= "ital">begin </span>to enquire?" Abarbanel gives an alternative rendering: "That was the first day that I enquired of God for him, and I did not know that it was displeasing to thee." Another rendering is: "Did I enquire?" in a negative sense, suggesting the reply "<span class= "ital">No, I did </span>not." On the whole, the alternative rendering suggested by Abarbanel, quoted in <span class= "ital">Lange, </span>is the best: "That was the first day, &c." And the reason why Ahimelech allowed the sacred Urim to be consulted was that he supposed David was come (as he represented) on a mission direct from King Saul. Surely, thought the blameless high priest, I never supposed my king would have been wroth with me for that.<p>If we render as in the English Version, which has the support of many scholars and versions, the only possible explanation of the words, "Did I that day begin to enquire?" is to suppose that David had been in the habit of consulting the Urim on special occasions <span class= "ital">for the king. </span>The king, when there was a king in Israel, it is nearly certain, <span class= "ital">alone </span>had this right. The Talmud teaching here is most definite; and it is a point in which the Talmud tradition may be looked on as authoritative. "The Rabbis have taught--How were the Urim and Thummim oracularly consulted? The king or the chief of the legislative administration, who alone had the privilege of consulting the Urim, stood facing the priest, and the priest was facing the Shekinah and the 'Shem-hammephorash,' the ineffable name deposited with the Urim within the breastplate."--Treatise <span class= "ital">Yoma, </span>fol. 73, cols. 1, 2.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/22-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Was that day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1447;&#1493;&#1465;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(hay&#183;y&#333;&#183;wm)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
