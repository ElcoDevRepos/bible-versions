His authority is evident as he directs the cook, indicating his leadership and the respect he commands. This moment occurs during Saul's anointing, highlighting Samuel's role in God's plan for Israel. The presence of a cook suggests a formal meal, possibly a sacrificial feast, which was common in Israelite culture for significant religious and social events.<p><b>&#8220;Bring the portion I gave you</b><br>The portion refers to a specific part of the sacrificial meal, often reserved for honored guests. In ancient Israel, certain parts of the sacrifice were set aside for priests or special individuals, signifying honor and divine favor. This act foreshadows Saul's future role as king, as he is being treated with the respect due to royalty. The act of setting aside a portion also reflects the practice of offering the best to God and His chosen ones, a theme seen throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>and told you to set aside.&#8221;</b><br>Samuel's prior instruction to set aside the portion indicates his foreknowledge and divine insight into Saul's future. This premeditated action underscores the prophetic nature of Samuel's ministry and God's sovereignty in orchestrating events. The setting aside of the portion can be seen as a type of Christ, who is the chosen and anointed one, set apart for a divine purpose. This moment also connects to the broader biblical theme of God preparing and providing for His people, as seen in the provision of manna in the wilderness and the feeding of the 5,000 in the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel plays a crucial role in the transition from the period of judges to the establishment of the monarchy.
