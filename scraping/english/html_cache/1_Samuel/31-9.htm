This mirrors the earlier event in <a href="/1_samuel/17-51.htm">1 Samuel 17:51</a>, where David cut off Goliath's head, signifying triumph over the Philistines. The beheading of Saul, Israel's first king, marks a tragic end to his reign and serves as a stark contrast to the earlier victory over Goliath.<p><b>stripped off his armor</b><br>Removing Saul's armor was not only a practical act of taking spoils of war but also a symbolic gesture of stripping away his royal and military authority. Armor in biblical times was a sign of strength and protection, and its removal indicated Saul's vulnerability and defeat. This act also recalls David's refusal to wear Saul's armor in <a href="/1_samuel/17-38.htm">1 Samuel 17:38-39</a>, highlighting the difference between Saul's reliance on physical protection and David's faith in God.<p><b>and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were a significant adversary of Israel, often at war with them throughout the period of the Judges and the early monarchy. By sending messengers, the Philistines sought to spread the news of their victory, boosting their morale and asserting their dominance over Israel. This act of communication underscores the political and military rivalry between the two nations.<p><b>to proclaim the news in the temples of their idols</b><br>The Philistines' proclamation in their temples indicates the religious dimension of their victory. They attributed their success to their gods, such as Dagon, whom they believed had triumphed over the God of Israel. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern belief that military victories were also victories of one deity over another. The desecration of Saul's body in their temples contrasts with the reverence shown to the Ark of the Covenant, which had previously caused distress in Philistine territory (1 Samuel 5).<p><b>and among their people</b><br>By spreading the news among their people, the Philistines aimed to unify and encourage their nation, celebrating their triumph over Israel. This public announcement served to reinforce their cultural identity and pride, while simultaneously demoralizing the Israelites. The dissemination of such news would have been a powerful tool in maintaining Philistine hegemony in the region.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, whose tragic end is described in this chapter.

Decapitation turned Saul&#8217;s body into a trophy, much as David had earlier removed Goliath&#8217;s head (<a href="/1_samuel/17-51.htm">1 Samuel 17:51</a>).<p>&#8211; The act mocked the LORD&#8217;s anointed; David had twice refused to harm Saul for that very reason (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>; 26:9&#8211;11).<p>&#8211; <a href="/1_chronicles/10-10.htm">1 Chronicles 10:10</a> records that the Philistines later hung the head in the temple of Dagon, just as they once placed the captured ark before that idol (<a href="/1_samuel/5-2.htm">1 Samuel 5:2</a>).<p>&#8211; The scene reminds us that God&#8217;s judgment on Saul&#8217;s disobedience (<a href="/1_chronicles/10-13.htm">1 Chronicles 10:13&#8211;14</a>) still grieved Him when pagans gloated over it (<a href="/2_samuel/1-20.htm">2 Samuel 1:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Stripped off his armor</b><p>&#8211; Armor symbolized royal authority and military strength; removing it declared that Saul&#8217;s reign was finished (cf. <a href="/1_samuel/14-52.htm">1 Samuel 14:52</a> on his reliance on armor-bearers).<p>&#8211; The Philistines displayed the armor &#8220;in the temple of the Ashtoreths&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/31-10.htm">1 Samuel 31:10</a>), treating it as a spoil dedicated to their gods, much like the sword of Goliath had once been stored before the LORD (<a href="/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>).<p>&#8211; This reversal highlights the difference between honoring God with victory spoils and using them to exalt idols.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines</b><p>&#8211; Rapid messengers spread the news so every city could celebrate, turning a battlefield moment into national propaganda.<p>&#8211; Similar tactics appear in <a href="/1_samuel/4-9.htm">1 Samuel 4:9&#8211;10</a> (Philistine rallying cries) and <a href="/esther/8-14.htm">Esther 8:14</a> (royal couriers).<p>&#8211; For Israel, the contrast is David&#8217;s lament, &#8220;Tell it not in Gath&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/1-20.htm">2 Samuel 1:20</a>); God&#8217;s people feel sorrow when His name is discredited.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To proclaim the news in the temples of their idols and among their people</b><p>&#8211; Victory announcements inside temples of Dagon or Ashtoreth credited false gods, just as the Philistines once praised Dagon for Samson&#8217;s capture (<a href="/bsb/jude/1.htm">Jude 16</a>:23&#8211;24).<p>&#8211; Though the Philistines thought their deities triumphed, Scripture clarifies that &#8220;the LORD delivered Saul&#8221; because of Saul&#8217;s unfaithfulness (<a href="/1_chronicles/10-13.htm">1 Chronicles 10:13&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8211; God&#8217;s honor is linked to His people&#8217;s obedience; when they fall, the nations blaspheme (<a href="/romans/2-24.htm">Romans 2:24</a>).<p>&#8211; For believers today:<p>&#8226; Guard personal faithfulness so God&#8217;s reputation is not maligned.<p>&#8226; Remember that apparent victories of evil are temporary; the LORD remains sovereign (<a href="/psalms/115-3.htm">Psalm 115:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>1 Sa 31:9 records the Philistines&#8217; fourfold humiliation of Saul&#8212;decapitation, removal of royal armor, rapid circulation of the news, and idol-centered celebration. Each action magnified their triumph but ultimately showcased God&#8217;s righteous judgment on a disobedient king, not the power of pagan gods. The passage warns that sin&#8217;s consequences can bring dishonor to God&#8217;s name, yet it also affirms His ultimate control over history and reminds believers to live faithfully so that His glory, not disgrace, is proclaimed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/31.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour.</span>--Only <span class= "ital">Saul's </span>head and armour is mentioned here, but on comparing <a href="/1_samuel/31-12.htm" title="All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.">1Samuel 31:12</a>, where the bodies of his sons are especially mentioned, it is clear that this act was not confined to the person of the king. The sense of the passage there is, the heads of the king and his three sons were cut off, and their armour stripped from their bodies. The heads and armour were sent as trophies round about the different towns and villages of Philistia, and the headless corpses were fastened to the wall of the city of Beth-shan.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9, 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They cut off his head.</span> This was probably done not simply in retaliation for what had happened to their champion Goliath, but in accordance with the customs of ancient warfare. The fierce joy of the Philistines over the fallen Saul proves how great had been their fear of him, and how successful he had been in breaking their yoke off Israel's neck.

Whether it was divided among the various shrines of Astarte, or whether it was all placed in her famous temple at Askelon, described by Herodotus (1:105) as the most ancient of the fanes of the Syrian Venus, is uncertain. The former view agrees best with the Hebrew text and with what is said in <a href="/1_chronicles/10-10.htm">1 Chronicles 10:10</a>, where we have the additional information that they suspended Saul's head in the temple of Dagon. <span class="cmt_word">They fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan, as also the bodies of his sons</span> (ver. 12). Beth-shan or Scythopolis lies about four miles from the Jordan on the west, and twelve miles south of the lake of Tiberias. It is almost in a straight line to the west of Mahanaim, and must have been at once occupied by the Philistines, and as they hung the bodies of the fallen king and his sons on its wall, they evidently intended to retain it.
