In the ancient Near East, livestock was a primary measure of wealth and sustenance, indicating the restoration of what was lost. The act of taking back the flocks and herds symbolizes God's provision and restoration for His people, as seen in other biblical narratives where God restores what was lost or taken (e.g., <a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>).<p><b>which his men drove ahead of the other livestock</b><br>David's men driving the livestock ahead signifies their role as victors reclaiming what was rightfully theirs. This action reflects the cultural practice of leading livestock as a sign of ownership and control. It also demonstrates the unity and cooperation among David's men, who were loyal to him despite previous hardships. This unity is reminiscent of the Israelites' journey to the Promised Land, where they moved together under God's guidance.<p><b>calling out, &#8220;This is David&#8217;s plunder!&#8221;</b><br>The declaration "This is David&#8217;s plunder!" highlights David's leadership and the recognition of his authority. In the context of ancient warfare, plunder was often claimed by the victorious leader, and this acknowledgment by his men underscores David's role as God's chosen leader. This moment foreshadows David's future as king, where he would lead Israel to numerous victories. It also parallels the ultimate victory of Jesus Christ, who, as the Good Shepherd, reclaims and restores His flock, as seen in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed king of Israel, who at this time was leading his men in battle against the Amalekites to recover their families and possessions.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/amalekites.htm">Amalekites</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe that had raided Ziklag, taking captives and plundering the city, which led to David's pursuit and eventual victory over them.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziklag.htm">Ziklag</a></b><br>The city given to David by the Philistine king Achish, which was raided by the Amalekites while David and his men were away.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/david's_men.htm">David&#8217;s Men</a></b><br>The group of warriors loyal to David, who fought alongside him to recover their families and possessions from the Amalekites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/plunder.htm">Plunder</a></b><br>The goods and livestock recovered from the Amalekites, which were declared as belonging to David by his men.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_guidance_and_victory.htm">Divine Guidance and Victory</a></b><br>David's success was rooted in seeking God's direction.

The text emphasizes total recovery&#8212;God&#8217;s clear answer to David&#8217;s earlier petition, &#8220;Shall I pursue this raiding party?&#8230; Pursue, for you will surely overtake and rescue the captives&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/30-8.htm">1 Samuel 30:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;all the flocks and herds&#8221; mirrors <a href="/1_samuel/30-18.htm">1 Samuel 30:18-19</a>, where &#8220;nothing was missing&#8230; young or old, sons or daughters, spoil or anything else.&#8221; God restores more than was lost, echoing precedents like <a href="/numbers/31-9.htm">Numbers 31:9</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/20-14.htm">Deuteronomy 20:14</a>, where Israel lawfully gathers livestock from defeated enemies.<p>&#8226; This tangible abundance underlines God&#8217;s faithfulness; <a href="/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1</a> reminds that the LORD is David&#8217;s shepherd, so &#8220;I shall not want.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which his men drove ahead of the other livestock</b><p>Picture a long column of animals, David&#8217;s warriors herding the newly won stock out in front.<p>&#8226; Driving the Amalekite animals &#8220;ahead&#8221; publicly distinguishes the rescued property from Israel&#8217;s own herds, making the victory obvious to every eye&#8212;similar to the visible spoils in <a href="/2_chronicles/20-25.htm">2 Chronicles 20:25</a>.<p>&#8226; The soldiers' unity in action hints at the restored morale of a once-despairing band (<a href="/1_samuel/30-6.htm">1 Samuel 30:6</a>). Their coordination foreshadows the later ordinance that both front-line fighters and rear-guard stay-by-the-stuff men will share equally in the spoils (30:24), modeling ordered teamwork instead of chaos.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>calling out, &#8220;This is David&#8217;s plunder!&#8221;</b><p>Voices ring out over bleating sheep: &#8220;This is David&#8217;s plunder!&#8221;<p>&#8226; On one level, it&#8217;s simple credit. After Saul&#8217;s failures, the people now freely acknowledge David&#8217;s God-given leadership, much as they had sung after Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/18-7.htm">1 Samuel 18:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet David quickly redirects ownership to the LORD in 30:23&#8212;&#8220;You must not do this, my brothers, with what the LORD has given us.&#8221; The cry therefore becomes a testimony that God delivers through His chosen servant (cf. <a href="/psalms/44-6.htm">Psalm 44:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; The shout also signals legal claim. In ancient warfare, naming the plunder affirmed rightful possession (<a href="/1_samuel/17-53.htm">1 Samuel 17:53</a>). Here, it anticipates the equitable distribution that will bless even the exhausted two-hundred who stayed behind (30:24-25), prefiguring New-Testament generosity like <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/30-20.htm">1 Samuel 30:20</a> captures a moment of total restoration and public celebration.

The verse stands as a living illustration that when God rescues, He restores fully, unites His people in purpose, and receives all the glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/30.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(20) <span class= "bld">The flocks and the herds, which they drave.</span>--In the English translation the word "which," inserted in italics, obscures the sense; the literal reading is, "And David took all the flocks and the herds; they drove them before their cattle, and said, this is David's spoil." David took, no doubt, by popular acclamation as <span class= "ital">his </span>share of the plunder, all the flocks and herds belonging to the Amalekites, mostly acquired, no doubt, in the late raid; these were driven in front of "those cattle" thus particularising <span class= "ital">the cattle of Ziklag </span>belonging to David's own people. Of course, this plunder went back to the original Israelitish owners. The drovers, as they marched behind the vast herds of Amalekite cattle, sung of the prowess of their leader in words long remembered, "See all this. This is David's spoil." It was "these herds"--numerically, probably very great--that David distributed among the friendly cities of the south. (See <a href="/1_samuel/30-26.htm" title="And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;">1Samuel 30:26</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-31.htm" title="And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where David himself and his men were wont to haunt.">1Samuel 30:31</a>.) All the other plunder of the camp--arms, accoutrements, ornaments, jewels, camels' cloths, &c.--was divided, as Bishop Hervey well suggests, among the little army. David's motive in choosing the sheep and oxen (for his warriors certainly the least desirable part of the Amalekite possession) is evident from <a href="/context/1_samuel/30-26.htm" title="And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;">1Samuel 30:26-31</a>.
