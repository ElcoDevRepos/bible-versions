It suggests a moment of reflection and realization. In the broader narrative, this occurs after David spares Saul's life in the cave at En Gedi, a significant location known for its rugged terrain and caves, providing a strategic hideout for David and his men.<p><b>David&#8217;s conscience was stricken</b><br>David's conscience, or heart, being stricken reveals his sensitivity to God's will and his respect for Saul as the Lord's anointed king. This internal conviction highlights David's integrity and his understanding of divine authority. It reflects the biblical principle found in <a href="/proverbs/4-23.htm">Proverbs 4:23</a>, which emphasizes guarding one's heart, as it is the wellspring of life. David's response contrasts with Saul's hardened heart, showcasing the difference between a man after God's own heart and one who has turned away.<p><b>because he had cut off the corner of Saul&#8217;s robe</b><br>The act of cutting off the corner of Saul's robe was symbolic. In ancient Israel, the robe represented authority and kingship. By cutting it, David could have been seen as challenging Saul's authority. However, David's remorse indicates his respect for God's timing and his refusal to seize the throne by force. This act and David's subsequent regret can be seen as a type of Christ, who, though having the authority, chose humility and submission to God's will, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-8</a>. David's restraint and respect for Saul's position foreshadow the ultimate submission and respect for divine authority demonstrated by Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who is currently fleeing from King Saul.

This is better than with Clericus to say, "David was afraid that Saul would take this, though a clear sign of his [David's] magnanimity, in bad part, and regard it as a violation of his royal majesty." There is no sign at all of David's even regretting he had cut off the fringe of the king's garment. It was the far more terrible thought of slaying the God-anointed king which troubled David. The words of the next verse show us clearly what was passing in his mind when he gravely rebuked his men, and evidently restrained them, with some little trouble, from rushing upon Saul, even after he had left the sleeping form, with the piece of the mantle in his hand. The Hebrew word rendered "stayed" is a forcible one, and, literally, would be <span class= "ital">crushed down. </span>There is a curious Note, however, in the Babylonian Talmud on this passage in the Book of Samuel which tells how David cut off a piece of Saul's robe, in which the act is evidently very strongly condemned. Rabbi Yosi ben Rabbi chanina on the words, "Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily," said, "Whoever treats clothes slightingly will at last derive no benefit from them, for it is said (<a href="/1_kings/1-1.htm" title="Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him with clothes, but he got no heat.">1Kings 1:1</a>), 'And they covered him [David] with clothes, but he gat no heat.'"--Treatise <span class= "ital">Berachoth, </span>fol. 62, Colossians 2.<p>This is evidently one of the "cryptographs," of which there are such innumerable instances in the Talmud. The lesson intended to be taught by the famous Rabbi was probably intense reverence for the teachers and guides of Israel, here represented by Saul; any act of disrespect shown to one of these, even by injuring the clothes they wore, would be punished by God sooner or later.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/24-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Afterward,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1469;&#1495;&#1458;&#1512;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#183;&#7717;a&#774;&#183;r&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_310.htm">Strong's 310: </a> </span><span class="str2">The hind or following part</span><br /><br /><span class="word">David&#8217;s</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1430;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">conscience</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1461;&#1489;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#234;&#7687;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3820.htm">Strong's 3820: </a> </span><span class="str2">The heart, the feelings, the will, the intellect, centre</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was stricken</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1445;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
