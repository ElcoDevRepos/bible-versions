This act of valor reflects their gratitude and respect for Saul, despite his tragic end. The term "men of valor" indicates not only physical strength but also courage and moral integrity, qualities highly esteemed in Israelite society.<p><b>journeyed all night</b><br>The urgency and dedication of the men are highlighted by their willingness to travel under the cover of darkness. This nocturnal journey suggests a strategic move to avoid confrontation with the Philistines, who had occupied the area. It also underscores the risk they were willing to take to honor Saul and his sons, reflecting a deep sense of duty and loyalty.<p><b>and retrieved the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth-shan</b><br>Beth-shan was a significant city in the Jezreel Valley, strategically located at the crossroads of major trade routes. The Philistines had displayed the bodies as a public humiliation of Israel and its king. Retrieving the bodies was an act of defiance against the Philistines and a restoration of dignity to Saul and his sons. This act also fulfilled the cultural and religious obligation to ensure proper burial, which was crucial in Israelite tradition.<p><b>When they arrived at Jabesh</b><br>Jabesh-gilead was located east of the Jordan River, in the territory of Gilead. The connection between Jabesh-gilead and Saul was strong due to his earlier deliverance of the city. The return to Jabesh signifies a full circle of loyalty and respect, as the people of Jabesh-gilead repay Saul's past kindness with their own.<p><b>they burned the bodies there</b><br>Cremation was not a common practice in Israelite culture, where burial was the norm. However, in this context, burning the bodies may have been a practical decision to prevent further desecration by the Philistines or due to the condition of the bodies after being exposed. This act ensured that the remains were treated with respect and safeguarded from further dishonor.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/v/valiant_men_of_jabesh-gilead.htm">Valiant Men of Jabesh-gilead</a></b><br>These were brave warriors from Jabesh-gilead who risked their lives to honor King Saul and his sons by retrieving their bodies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, whose tragic end came in battle against the Philistines.

The Jews in all cases buried their dead. The Chaldee therefore interpret the words relating this act of the men of Jabesh-Gilead, in the case of Saul and the princes, as referring to the solemn burning of spices, a ceremony which was afterwards performed at the burial of some of the kings of Judah. (See <a href="/2_chronicles/16-14.htm" title="And they buried him in his own sepulchers, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' are: and they made a very great burning for him.">2Chronicles 16:14</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/21-19.htm" title="And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.">2Chronicles 21:19</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/34-5.htm" title="But you shall die in peace: and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings which were before you, so shall they burn odors for you; and they will lament you, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 34:5</a>.) But the language used in these cases is different; here it is expressly stated that "they burnt them." The reason for their thus acting is clear. The mutilated trunks had been exposed for some days to the air, and the flesh was no doubt in a state of putrefaction. The flesh here only was burned. The bones (see next verse) were reverently and lovingly preserved, and laid to rest beneath the friendly shade of the great tamarisk tree of Jabesh.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/31.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12, 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They burnt them.</span> Cremation, though highly honourable among classical nations, is here mentioned for the first time in Holy Scripture, and was probably resorted to on this occasion to insure the bodies of Saul and his sons against further maltreatment, as, if buried, the Philistines might have made the attempt to get them again into their power. Some suppose that the burning of the dead was afterwards practised by the Jews, and quote in its favour <a href="/2_chronicles/16-14.htm">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>; <a href="/isaiah/33-12.htm">Isaiah 33:12</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/31-40.htm">Jeremiah 31:40</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/34-5.htm">Jeremiah 34:5</a>; <a href="/amos/6-10.htm">Amos 6:10</a>, but these passages bear a different interpretation. After the exile, interment was the sole method of disposing of the dead among the Jews, and in the Talmud cremation is condemned as a heathen practice. The burial of the bones of Saul and his sons proves that their bodies here were really burnt. <span class="cmt_word">Under a tree.</span> Hebrew, "under the tamarisk," the famous tree of that species at Jabesh. It was under one tamarisk that Saul commanded the massacre of the priests (<a href="/1_samuel/22-6.htm">1 Samuel 22:6</a>), and now his bones are placed in rest beneath another. Perhaps the people remembered the king's fondness for trees. For the final fate of these relics see <a href="/2_samuel/21-12.htm">2 Samuel 21:12-14</a>. They <span class="cmt_word">fasted seven days</span> (see <a href="/genesis/1-10.htm">Genesis 1:10</a>). The time of mourning was thirty days for Aaron (<a href="/numbers/20-29.htm">Numbers 20:29</a>) and for Moses (<a href="/deuteronomy/34-8.htm">Deuteronomy 34:8</a>). The Talmudic rule is strict mourning for seven days, less strict for the next twenty-three, in all thirty; and for a father or mother mourning was continued for a year. The fasting was mourning of the strictest kind, and proves that the people of Jabesh-Gilead honored to the utmost their deliverer. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/31-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their valiant warriors</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">set out,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1511;&#1436;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;q&#363;&#183;m&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
