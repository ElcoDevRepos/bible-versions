The crossing of the Jordan River signifies a retreat, as the land of Gad and Gilead was east of the Jordan, away from the central conflict. Historically, this area was part of the territory given to the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh (<a href="/numbers/32-33.htm">Numbers 32:33</a>). The movement of the Hebrews into this region indicates a significant lack of confidence in Saul's leadership and a desire to seek refuge in a less threatened area. This retreat can be seen as a lack of faith, contrasting with the call to trust in God&#8217;s deliverance, as seen in other biblical narratives like the crossing of the Red Sea (Exodus 14).<p><b>Saul, however, remained at Gilgal,</b><br>Gilgal holds historical and spiritual significance as the first campsite of the Israelites after crossing the Jordan into the Promised Land (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19-20</a>). It was a place of renewal and covenant, where the Israelites celebrated the Passover and circumcised the new generation (Joshua 5). Saul's presence at Gilgal is symbolic, as it was a place where Samuel had previously instructed him to wait for seven days for further guidance (<a href="/1_samuel/10-8.htm">1 Samuel 10:8</a>). Saul's decision to remain there reflects his initial obedience to Samuel's command, but it also sets the stage for his impending disobedience and impatience, which would lead to his downfall.<p><b>and all his troops were quaking in fear.</b><br>The fear among Saul's troops underscores the dire situation Israel faced against the Philistines, who had superior military technology, including iron chariots and weapons (<a href="/1_samuel/13-5.htm">1 Samuel 13:5</a>). This fear is a recurring theme in Israel's history, often leading to a call for divine intervention. The troops' fear contrasts with the courage expected of God's people, as seen in the exhortations to be strong and courageous (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>). This fear also foreshadows Saul's failure as a leader who could not inspire confidence or faith in God&#8217;s protection, unlike David, who would later face Goliath with unwavering trust in the Lord (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-47</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hebrews.htm">Hebrews</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites, God's chosen people, who were in a state of fear and disarray during this time.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jordan.htm">Jordan</a></b><br>The river that the Hebrews crossed, symbolizing a retreat or escape from the impending Philistine threat.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gad_and_gilead.htm">Gad and Gilead</a></b><br>Regions east of the Jordan River, representing places of refuge for the fleeing Israelites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who remained at Gilgal, facing a critical test of leadership and faith.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilgal.htm">Gilgal</a></b><br>A significant location in Israel's history, where Saul awaited Samuel and where the Israelites had previously renewed their covenant with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_and_faith.htm">Fear and Faith</a></b><br>Fear is a natural human response, but it should drive us to God rather than away from Him.

Here Israel&#8217;s panic sends them running; the roles are tragically reversed.<p>The verse highlights how unbelief disrupts God&#8217;s people and weakens their testimony.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into the land of Gad and Gilead</b><p>Gad and Gilead lie on the east side of the river, territory once granted to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half-Manasseh (<a href="/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1-5, 33</a>; <a href="/joshua/22-1.htm">Joshua 22:1-9</a>).<p>&#8226; Crossing there felt &#8220;safer,&#8221; but it meant leaving the battle God had assigned.<p>&#8226; Gadite towns had livestock and natural defenses, yet true security rests in obedience, not geography (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p>&#8226; This movement foreshadows later schisms (<a href="/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16-19</a>) that fracture national unity whenever faith falters.<p>The phrase reminds us that refuge outside God&#8217;s will is no refuge at all.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Saul, however, remained at Gilgal</b><p>Gilgal was the place Samuel had instructed Saul to wait for seven days (<a href="/1_samuel/10-8.htm">1 Samuel 10:8, 13</a>:8).<p>&#8226; Gilgal carried historic weight: the first campsite after Joshua&#8217;s crossing (<a href="/joshua/4-19.htm">Joshua 4:19</a>) and the site of covenant renewal (<a href="/1_samuel/11-14.htm">1 Samuel 11:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul &#8220;remained,&#8221; showing initial obedience, yet his patience will soon crack (13:9-12).<p>&#8226; This contrast&#8212;people fleeing while the king stays&#8212;sets up the test of whether Saul will trust God or grasp control.<p>Waiting on God&#8217;s timing is often the dividing line between faith and presumption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and all his troops were quaking in fear</b><p>The Hebrew soldiers who stayed with Saul were not courageous; they trembled.<p>&#8226; Fear had been expressly addressed in Israel&#8217;s war code: &#8220;Let anyone who is fearful&#8230;go home&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-8.htm">Deuteronomy 20:8</a>). Staying yet fearing reveals hearts unprepared for battle.<p>&#8226; Similar dread strikes again before Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-11.htm">1 Samuel 17:11</a>). The pattern underscores the need for a leader whose confidence rests in the Lord.<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s men mirror their king&#8217;s inner state; when leadership is uncertain, followers feel it (<a href="/proverbs/29-2.htm">Proverbs 29:2</a>).<p>The phrase exposes how fear spreads when faith stalls.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/13-7.htm">1 Samuel 13:7</a> paints a snapshot of collective panic: some Israelites abandon the Promised Land, others huddle with a waiting&#8212;but wavering&#8212;king, and all tremble before the Philistine threat. The verse warns that leaving God-appointed ground, seeking safety in familiar comforts, or merely &#8220;holding position&#8221; without steadfast trust all lead to the same place: fear.
