Naioth was a place associated with the prophets, where Samuel was leading a group of prophets. This setting highlights the spiritual environment from which David is fleeing, emphasizing the contrast between Saul's hostility and the prophetic community's peace. Ramah, Samuel's hometown, was a significant location in Israel's history, serving as a center for prophetic activity. David's departure from this place signifies a transition from safety to danger, as he leaves the protection of Samuel and the prophets.<p><b>He came to Jonathan and asked,</b><br>David's approach to Jonathan underscores the deep bond and covenantal friendship between them. Jonathan, Saul's son, is caught in a difficult position, torn between his loyalty to his father and his love for David. This meeting reflects the trust and reliance David places in Jonathan, seeking his counsel and support. Their friendship is a model of loyalty and faithfulness, often seen as a type of Christ's relationship with His followers, where love transcends familial and political ties.<p><b>&#8220;What have I done?</b><br>David's question reveals his innocence and confusion regarding Saul's hostility. It highlights the theme of unjust persecution, a recurring motif in the lives of biblical figures, including Jesus Christ, who was also persecuted without cause. David's inquiry is a plea for understanding and justice, reflecting the human desire to comprehend suffering and adversity.<p><b>What is my iniquity?</b><br>David's use of the term "iniquity" suggests a deeper introspection, as he examines his actions for any wrongdoing. This reflects the biblical principle of self-examination and repentance, where individuals are called to assess their lives in light of God's standards. David's question also points to the broader theme of sin and its consequences, a central tenet in Scripture.<p><b>How have I sinned against your father,</b><br>David's reference to Saul as "your father" acknowledges Jonathan's familial ties and the complexity of their situation. It underscores the tension between personal relationships and political dynamics. The question also highlights the biblical theme of familial conflict, reminiscent of other scriptural narratives where family members are at odds, such as Cain and Abel or Jacob and Esau.<p><b>that he wants to take my life?&#8221;</b><br>David's awareness of Saul's intent to kill him underscores the gravity of his situation. This phrase reflects the theme of life and death struggles found throughout the Bible, where God's chosen individuals often face mortal danger. It also foreshadows the ultimate deliverance and protection that God provides to His anointed, paralleling the deliverance offered through Jesus Christ. David's plight is a reminder of the spiritual warfare believers face and the assurance of God's sovereignty over life and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, currently fleeing from King Saul's wrath.

It was, no doubt, by Samuel's advice that he once more betook himself to the city of Saul, but his return was evidently secret.<p>Alone with his friend, he passionately asserts his entire innocence of the crimes laid to his charge by the unhappy, jealous Saul. His words here are found in substance in not a few of his Psalms, where, in touching language, he maintains how bitterly the world had wronged and persecuted a righteous, innocent man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David fled from Naioth.</span> While Saul was under the influence of the prophetic enthusiasm David escaped; but it is evident that this visit to Samuel, and the extraordinary occurrences which attended it, were not without, a good influence for the time upon Saul's mind. Some sort of reconciliation must have been patched up, probably by the mediation of Samuel; for David assumed that at the new moon be would be expected to dine at the king's table (ver. 5), and that Saul would look for him as a matter of course (ver. 6). We find, moreover, that his place was made ready, not only on the new moon (ver. 25), but also on the following day (ver. 26). But whatever professions Saul may have made to Samuel, it is evident that no promise had been made personally to David, and taught by past experience that the intention of slaying him had grown more and more fixed in the king's mind, he feels that his position is full of danger, and takes counsel with Jonathan, with the view of learning whether he might venture once again to take his place as a member of Saul s family. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/20-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1428;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">fled</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1512;&#1463;&#1443;&#1495;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#7687;&#183;ra&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
