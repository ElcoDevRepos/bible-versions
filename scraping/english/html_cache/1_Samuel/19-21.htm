This reflects Saul's increasing obsession with David, whom he saw as a threat to his throne. The context here is Saul's jealousy and fear of David, who had gained favor with God and the people. This report likely came from his servants or spies, indicating Saul's extensive network to monitor David's movements.<p><b>he sent more messengers</b><br>Saul's decision to send additional messengers shows his determination to capture David. This action underscores Saul's persistence and desperation. The messengers were likely soldiers or officials tasked with bringing David back to Saul. This reflects the political tension and the lengths to which Saul would go to maintain his power.<p><b>but they began to prophesy as well</b><br>The messengers, upon arriving at Naioth in Ramah where David was with Samuel, were overcome by the Spirit of God and began to prophesy. This divine intervention highlights God's protection over David. The act of prophesying here is not necessarily predicting the future but speaking under divine inspiration. This event demonstrates God's sovereignty and the futility of Saul's efforts against His chosen servant.<p><b>So Saul tried again and sent messengers a third time</b><br>Saul's repeated attempts show his relentless pursuit of David, despite previous failures. The number three in biblical terms often signifies completeness or emphasis. Saul's persistence is contrasted with God's repeated intervention, emphasizing the futility of opposing God's will.<p><b>and even they began to prophesy</b><br>Once again, the messengers are overcome by the Spirit of God, indicating that God's presence and power are overwhelming and cannot be thwarted by human plans. This repeated divine intervention serves as a sign of God's favor upon David and a warning to Saul.

And he and Samuel went and dwelled in Naioth.">1Samuel 19:18</a> to end of the chapter, which relates the illapse of the Spirit on Saul's messengers, and even on Saul himself, the persecutor of David, being appointed by the Church to be read on Whitsun Tuesday (Old Lect.), in order to show the existence and working of the Holy Spirit before the times of the Gospel, and the freedom and power of His Divine agency." (Comp. here <a href="/context/numbers/11-26.htm" title="But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested on them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out to the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.">Numbers 11:26-31</a> : the history of Eldad and Medad, which we read on Whitsun Monday, New Lect.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-24.</span> - Saul sends messengers a second and even a third time with the same result, and finally determines to go in person. Having set out, <span class="cmt_word">he came to a</span> - more correctly <span class="accented">the</span> - <span class="cmt_word">great well that is in Sechu</span> - more probably the cistern or tank there. From the value of water it was no doubt a well known spot at the time, but in the present ruined state of the country all such works have perished. Sechu, according to Conder ('Handbook'), was probably on the site of the present ruin of Suweikeh, immediately south of Beeroth. Having there made inquiries whether Samuel and David were still at Ramah, courageously awaiting his craning, he proceeds on his way. But even before arriving in Samuel's presence, with that extraordinary susceptibility to external impressions which is so marked a feature in his character, he begins singing psalms, and no sooner had he entered the Nevavoth than <span class="cmt_word">he stripped off his clothes</span> - his <span class="accented">beged</span> and <span class="accented">meil</span> - <span class="cmt_word">and lay down naked</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> with only his tunic upon him - <span class="cmt_word">all that day and all that night.</span> His excitement had evidently been intense, and probably to the chanting he had added violent gesticulation. But it was not this so much as the tempest of his emotions which had exhausted him, and made him thus throw himself down as one dead. And once again the people wondered at so strange an occurrence, and called back to mind the proverb, <span class="cmt_word">Is Saul also among the prophets?</span> When first used (<a href="/1_samuel/10-11.htm">1 Samuel 10:11</a>) Saul's enthusiasm was an outburst of piety, genuine but evanescent, and which had long since passed away. What was it now? The Chaldee, as explained by Rashi, says he was mad. More probably, in the violent state of excitement under which Saul had for some time been labouring, the thought of seeing Samuel, from whom he had been so long separated, brought back to his mind the old days when the prophet had loved and counselled him, and made him king, and been his true and faithful friend. And the remembrance overpowered him. What would he not have given to have continued such as he then was! And for a time he became once again the old Saul of Ramah; but the change was transient and fitful; and after these twenty-four hours of agony Saul rose up, full perhaps of good intentions, but with a heart unchanged, and certain, therefore, very quickly to disappoint all hopes of real amendment, and to become a still more moody and relentless tyrant. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/19-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When this was reported</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1443;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yag&#183;gi&#183;&#7695;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
