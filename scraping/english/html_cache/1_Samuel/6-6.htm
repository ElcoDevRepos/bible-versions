In biblical terms, a hardened heart is one that is unresponsive to God's commands and guidance. This concept is prevalent throughout Scripture, notably in the narrative of Pharaoh during the Exodus. A hardened heart is often associated with pride and rebellion against God, leading to spiritual blindness and eventual judgment.<p><b>as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened theirs?</b><br>The reference to the Egyptians and Pharaoh serves as a historical reminder of the consequences of resisting God's will. In the Exodus account, Pharaoh's repeated refusal to release the Israelites despite the plagues demonstrates a progressive hardening of his heart. This hardening is both a result of Pharaoh's own choices and a divine judgment, illustrating the interplay between human free will and divine sovereignty. The Egyptians' experience serves as a cautionary tale for the Philistines, warning them of the dangers of opposing God.<p><b>When He afflicted them</b><br>This phrase refers to the plagues that God sent upon Egypt as a means of compelling Pharaoh to release the Israelites. These afflictions were both punitive and redemptive, designed to demonstrate God's power and to liberate His people. The plagues were a direct challenge to the Egyptian gods, showcasing the supremacy of the God of Israel. This affliction was not arbitrary but served a divine purpose in the unfolding of salvation history.<p><b>did they not send the people out</b><br>The eventual release of the Israelites by Pharaoh highlights the futility of resisting God's will. Despite his initial stubbornness, Pharaoh ultimately capitulates to God's demands. This act of sending the Israelites out is a pivotal moment in the Exodus narrative, marking the beginning of their journey to the Promised Land. It underscores the theme of deliverance and God's faithfulness to His covenant promises.<p><b>so they could go on their way?</b><br>The phrase "go on their way" signifies the freedom and new beginning granted to the Israelites. It is a fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham and a step towards the establishment of Israel as a nation. This journey is not just a physical relocation but a spiritual pilgrimage towards becoming God's chosen people. It also prefigures the Christian journey of salvation, where believers are set free from the bondage of sin to walk in the newness of life in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A group of people who captured the Ark of the Covenant and experienced God's judgment as a result.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/egyptians_and_pharaoh.htm">Egyptians and Pharaoh</a></b><br>Historical figures who resisted God's will during the Exodus, leading to severe plagues.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_the_covenant.htm">Ark of the Covenant</a></b><br>The sacred chest representing God's presence, captured by the Philistines and causing them distress.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>God's chosen people, who were enslaved in Egypt and later freed by God's intervention.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/plagues.htm">Plagues</a></b><br>Divine judgments sent by God to compel Pharaoh to release the Israelites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_a_hardened_heart.htm">The Danger of a Hardened Heart</a></b><br>Just as Pharaoh's heart was hardened, leading to his downfall, we must guard against hardening our hearts to God's voice.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/learning_from_history.htm">Learning from History</a></b><br>The Philistines are reminded of the consequences faced by the Egyptians.

Every fresh outbreak is God&#8217;s gracious warning: &#8220;Yield before something worse happens.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened theirs?</b><p>&#8226; The question points back to a well-known historical fact: Pharaoh repeatedly &#8220;hardened his heart&#8221; even after each plague (<a href="/exodus/7-13.htm">Exodus 7:13</a>; 9:34; 10:1).<p>&#8226; Remembering Egypt is meant to jolt the Philistines: &#8220;Do you really want to replay that disaster?&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/78-12.htm">Psalm 78:12&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; God preserved the Exodus account so that future nations&#8212;and we today&#8212;would heed its lesson (<a href="/romans/9-17.htm">Romans 9:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When He afflicted them</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;He&#8221; is the LORD, the covenant God who actively intervenes in history.

Each plague dismantled Egypt&#8217;s idols, proving the LORD alone is God (<a href="/exodus/12-12.htm">Exodus 12:12</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-26.htm">Psalm 105:26&#8211;36</a>).<p>&#8226; Those who refuse lighter disciplines invite heavier ones; God&#8217;s escalating judgments display His patience as well as His power (<a href="/revelation/9-20.htm">Revelation 9:20&#8211;21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>did they not send the people out so they could go on their way?</b><p>&#8226; After the tenth plague, Pharaoh finally capitulated: &#8220;Up, leave my people&#8212;you and the Israelites!&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/12-31.htm">Exodus 12:31&#8211;33</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s purpose&#8212;the liberation of His people&#8212;was accomplished despite Pharaoh&#8217;s resistance (<a href="/exodus/14-30.htm">Exodus 14:30</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-37.htm">Psalm 105:37</a>).<p>&#8226; The point for the Philistines is clear: yield willingly now, or be forced later. God&#8217;s deliverance plan for Israel will not be thwarted, and defying Him only multiplies suffering (<a href="/proverbs/21-30.htm">Proverbs 21:30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/6-6.htm">1 Samuel 6:6</a> is a God-given wake-up call.

These constant references to the story of Moses and the Exodus are indications of the deep impression those events had made on the surrounding nations; hence the value they set on the Ark, which they looked upon as the visible symbol of the mighty Hebrew God. The argument here used by the priests and diviners is:--You all remember the well-known story of the obduracy of the powerful Egyptians in connection with these Israelites, yet even they in the end had to let them go. You Philistines have had the experience of one plague; will you, like those foolish Egyptians, harden your hearts till you. like them, have been smitten with ten?"<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Wherefore do you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh?</span> On this reference to Egypt see on 1 Samuel 4:8. It is remarkable that they so correctly point out that it was the obduracy of the Egyptians which made their punishment so severe. Yet finally even they, in spite of their determined opposition were compelled to let Israel go. So now the question is whether the Philistines will restore the ark on the warning of one plague, or whether they will hold out till they have been smitten with ten. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/6-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Why</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1500;&#1464;&#1444;&#1502;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;l&#257;m&#183;m&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
