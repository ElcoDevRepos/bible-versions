In the biblical context, "faithful ones" refers to those who live in accordance with God's commandments and maintain a covenant relationship with Him. This protection is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, as seen in Psalms 37:23-24, where God is depicted as guiding and upholding the righteous. The imagery of "steps" suggests a journey or path, indicating that God is actively involved in the daily lives and decisions of His followers. This aligns with the cultural understanding of God as a shepherd, guiding and protecting His flock.<p><b>but the wicked perish in darkness</b><br>The contrast between the faithful and the wicked is stark. "Perish in darkness" implies a lack of divine guidance and protection, leading to destruction. Darkness in biblical literature often symbolizes chaos, evil, and separation from God, as seen in <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19-20</a>. The historical context of ancient Israel, where light and darkness were powerful metaphors for good and evil, underscores the fate of those who reject God's ways. This phrase serves as a warning and a call to repentance, highlighting the consequences of living outside God's will.<p><b>for by his own strength shall no man prevail</b><br>This statement underscores the futility of relying on human strength and wisdom apart from God. It reflects the biblical principle that true success and victory come from God alone, as echoed in <a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>, "Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit, says the LORD of Hosts." The cultural context of ancient Near Eastern societies, where military might and personal prowess were highly valued, contrasts with the biblical teaching that divine intervention is the ultimate source of triumph. This phrase also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ, who embodies the perfect reliance on God's strength, as seen in <a href="/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5-11</a>, where Christ's humility and obedience lead to His exaltation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hannah.htm">Hannah</a></b><br>The mother of Samuel, who offers a prayer of thanksgiving to God, acknowledging His sovereignty and justice.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The child dedicated to the Lord by Hannah, who would become a significant prophet and judge in Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli.htm">Eli</a></b><br>The priest at Shiloh, where Hannah prays and dedicates Samuel to the Lord.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/shiloh.htm">Shiloh</a></b><br>The religious center where the Ark of the Covenant was kept and where Hannah prayed.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_faithful_and_the_wicked.htm">The Faithful and the Wicked</a></b><br>Representing two groups of people in the verse, highlighting the contrast between those who follow God and those who do not.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_protection_for_the_faithful.htm">God's Protection for the Faithful</a></b><br>God actively guards and directs the lives of those who are faithful to Him.

Lasting safety, guidance, and triumph are found only in wholehearted reliance on the Lord who guards, judges, and forever reigns.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">He will keep the feet.</span>--This was the comforting deduction Hannah drew from the circumstances of her life: this the grave moral reflection the Spirit of the Lord bade her put down for the support and solace of all true servants of the Eternal in coming ages. Seeing that Jehovah of Israel governs the world, the righteous have nothing really to fear; it is only the wicked and rebellious who have reason to be afraid. The Babylonian Talmud has the following comment on these words:--"If any man has passed the greater part of his years without sin, he will sin no more. If a man has been able to resist the same temptation once or twice, he will sin no more; for it is said (<a href="/1_samuel/2-9.htm" title="He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.">1Samuel 2:9</a>), 'He will keep the feet of his saints.'"--Treatise <span class= "ital">Yoma, </span>fol. 38, Colossians 2.<p><span class= "bld">By strength shall no man prevail.</span>--The same thought is expressed very grandly by the prophet, "Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts" (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm" title="Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, said the LORD of hosts.">Zechariah 4:6</a>). The Holy Ghost, in one of the sublime visions of St. Paul, taught the suffering apostle the same great truth, "My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness" (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-9.htm" title="And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest on me.">2Corinthians 12:9</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The feet of his saints.</span> The Hebrews written text (<span class="accented">ch'tib</span>) has his <span class="accented">saint</span>, sing.; but the word really means not <span class="accented">saint, i.e.</span> one sanctified and holy, but <span class="accented">pious</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one lovingly disposed towards God. The sense, therefore, is not affected by the number, but the sing. is more forcible "He will guard the steps, the earthly course, of each one that loveth him;" while over against this watchful providence, ever exerted for the safe keeping of all who love the light, stands God's punitive justice, whereby the wicked are finally brought down to the dark silence of the grave.
