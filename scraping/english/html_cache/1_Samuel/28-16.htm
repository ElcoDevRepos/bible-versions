This event occurs during a time when Saul is desperate for guidance as the Philistine army threatens Israel. Consulting the dead was strictly forbidden in Israelite law (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-10.htm">Deuteronomy 18:10-12</a>), highlighting Saul's disobedience and desperation. Samuel's question underscores the futility of seeking guidance from the dead when one has already rejected the living God. This reflects the broader biblical theme that true wisdom and guidance come from God alone (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).<p><b>&#8220;since the LORD has turned away from you</b><br>The LORD turning away from Saul signifies a divine judgment due to Saul's repeated disobedience and failure to follow God's commands, such as his incomplete destruction of the Amalekites (1 Samuel 15). This turning away is a fulfillment of Samuel's earlier prophecy that the kingdom would be torn from Saul and given to another (<a href="/1_samuel/15-28.htm">1 Samuel 15:28</a>). It serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of persistent disobedience to God.<p><b>and become your enemy?&#8221;</b><br>The phrase indicates a complete reversal of Saul's relationship with God. Once anointed as king by God's command, Saul's actions have led to God opposing him. This enmity is not arbitrary but a result of Saul's choices, illustrating the biblical principle that God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble (<a href="/james/4-6.htm">James 4:6</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate enmity between God and those who reject His Son, Jesus Christ, who is the fulfillment of the Davidic line and the true King of Israel (<a href="/luke/1-32.htm">Luke 1:32-33</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet of God who anointed Saul as the first king of Israel.
