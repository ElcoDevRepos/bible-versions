Ekron was one of the five major Philistine cities, located in the southwestern part of Canaan. The movement of the Ark among these cities highlights the Philistines' misunderstanding of the God of Israel, treating the Ark as a mere object rather than recognizing its sacredness. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's sovereignty and the futility of idolatry, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/46.htm">Isaiah 46:1-2</a>, where idols are powerless before the true God.<p><b>but as it arrived, the Ekronites cried out</b><br>The reaction of the Ekronites underscores the fear and panic that the presence of the Ark induced among the Philistines. Their cry indicates a recognition of the power associated with the Ark, despite their lack of faith in the God of Israel. This fear is reminiscent of the terror that fell upon the inhabitants of Jericho in <a href="/joshua/2-9.htm">Joshua 2:9-11</a>, where the fame of God's mighty acts preceded the Israelites.<p><b>&#8220;They have brought us the ark of the God of Israel</b><br>The phrase "the God of Israel" acknowledges the distinct identity and power of Yahweh, contrasting with the local deities of the Philistines. This acknowledgment by the Philistines, albeit out of fear, points to the universal recognition of God's supremacy, as echoed in <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>, where every knee shall bow to Christ.<p><b>in order to kill us and our people!&#8221;</b><br>The Ekronites' fear of death reflects the severe consequences experienced by the Philistines due to the Ark's presence, including plagues and destruction. This mirrors the judgment that falls upon those who oppose God, as seen in the plagues of Egypt (Exodus 7-12). It also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and deliverance themes found in Revelation, where God's enemies face destruction while His people are saved. The Ark, a type of Christ, symbolizes God's presence and the dual nature of His coming&#8212;bringing salvation to believers and judgment to those who reject Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/ark_of_god.htm">Ark of God</a></b><br>The sacred chest that held the tablets of the Ten Commandments, representing God's presence and covenant with Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/ekron.htm">Ekron</a></b><br>One of the five major Philistine cities, located in the southwestern part of Canaan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines</a></b><br>A group of people who were often in conflict with the Israelites; they captured the Ark of God in battle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/people_of_ekron.htm">People of Ekron</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Ekron who feared the presence of the Ark due to the calamities it brought to other Philistine cities.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_of_israel.htm">God of Israel</a></b><br>The one true God worshiped by the Israelites, whose power and holiness were demonstrated through the Ark.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god's_presence.htm">Reverence for God's Presence</a></b><br>The Ark symbolizes God's holy presence.

Compelled to receive it until the lords of the Philistines could be convened in council to decide upon its ultimate destination, the plague broke out so heavily among them that they were in utter dismay. For the rendering <span class="cmt_word">deadly destruction</span> is untenable. Literally the words are, "a dismay of death;" but in Hebrew <span class="accented">death</span> added to a word of this sort simply means "very great." So "terrors of death" in <a href="/psalms/55-4.htm">Psalm 55:4</a> are very great terrors.
