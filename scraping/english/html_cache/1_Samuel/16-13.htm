The use of a horn, often from a ram, signifies strength and authority. This act of anointing is a precursor to David's future role as king, aligning with the tradition of anointing leaders, priests, and prophets (<a href="/exodus/30-30.htm">Exodus 30:30</a>).<p><b>and anointed him in the presence of his brothers</b><br>David's anointing in front of his brothers highlights the theme of God's choice versus human expectations. Despite being the youngest and seemingly least likely candidate, David is chosen by God, echoing the biblical motif of God elevating the humble (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). This public anointing foreshadows David's future leadership and establishes his divine selection.<p><b>and the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David from that day forward</b><br>The Spirit of the LORD coming upon David signifies divine empowerment for his future role as king. This is a transformative moment, marking the beginning of David's journey under God's guidance. The Spirit's presence is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, seen in figures like Samson (<a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>) and Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/10-10.htm">1 Samuel 10:10</a>), but with David, it signifies a lasting anointing that prefigures the New Testament outpouring of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/2-4.htm">Acts 2:4</a>).<p><b>Then Samuel set out and went to Ramah</b><br>Samuel's return to Ramah, his hometown, signifies the completion of his mission. Ramah, located in the territory of Benjamin, served as a base for Samuel's prophetic ministry. This departure underscores Samuel's obedience to God's directive and the transition of leadership from Saul to David, setting the stage for the unfolding narrative of David's rise to kingship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel, Samuel is tasked by God to anoint the next king of Israel.

Samuel&#8217;s obedience, David&#8217;s anointing, and the Spirit&#8217;s rush together show that when God calls, He equips, and His purposes advance even before they are fully visible.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Anointed him in the midst of his brethren.</span>--The history here simply relates the bare fact that the young shepherd was anointed in the presence of his brethren. No words of Samuel on this occasion are recorded; we are left, therefore, uncertain whether any reason was given for the choice of David, or any explanation of this peculiar anointing. It would seem most probable that Samuel kept silence for the present respecting the high destinies of the boy standing before him, and that he merely anointed him as one chosen to be his assistant in the sacrifice he was about to offer, stating probably that the Spirit of the Lord had directed him thus to associate the young son of Jesse with himself, and to adopt him in some way as a pupil in his prophetic school. From this time forward much of David's time was doubtless spent in Samuel's company. From him he received his training in poetry and music, for which he subsequently became distinguished; from the wise seer, too, the future king derived those early lessons of wisdom and learning which enabled him later to fill so nobly the great position for which he was thus early marked out. David was, before everything, Samuel's pupil, and the last years of that long and memorable career of the prophet were spent in moulding the life of Israel's greatest king.<p><span class= "bld">And the Spirit of the Lord came upon David . . . (14) But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul.</span>--This "Spirit of the Lord" which on the day of his anointing by Samuel came upon the shepherd boy, was the "Holy Ghost, or good Spirit of God," and is clearly and formally opposed to those evil spirits which (to use the words of Bishop Pearson) "must be acknowledged persons of a spiritual and intellectual subsistence, as <span class= "ital">the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him. </span>Now, what those evil spirits from the Lord were is apparent from the sad example of Ahab, concerning whom we read, <span class= "ital">There came out a spirit and stood before the Lord, and said, I will entice him; and the Lord said unto him, Wherewith? and he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail; go out, and do even so. </span>From whence it is evident that the evil spirits from God were certain persons--even bad angels--to which the one good Spirit as a person is opposed, departing from him to whom the other cometh" (Bishop Pearson, <span class= "ital">Creed, </span>Art. 8).<p>The effect of this <span class= "ital">descent </span>of the Spirit of the Lord upon David was that the shepherd boy grew up into a hero, a statesman, a scholar, and a wise, far-sighted king. The effect of the <span class= "ital">departure </span>of the Spirit from Saul was that from that hour the once generous king became a prey to a groomy melancholy, and a victim to a torturing jealousy of others, which increased as time went on, and which goaded him now and again to madness, ruining his life, and marring utterly the fair promise of his early years.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren.</span> Did he or they understand the meaning of the act? We think not. Certainly Eliab (<a href="/1_samuel/17-28.htm">1 Samuel 17:28</a>) had no idea of any special greatness being in store for his brother. Most probably both Jesse and his sons regarded David as simply selected to be trained in Samuel's schools; and there can be little doubt that he was so trained. Samuel gave unto David that which Saul had not received - long and careful training; and David profited by it, and at Naioth in Ramah perfected his skill, not only in reading and writing, but in poetry and music. Saul and David were both men of extraordinary natural ability; but the one is always shy, awkward, and with all the defects of an uneducated man; while David is altogether the contrary. But Samuel gave his youthful pupil something better than accomplishments - he carefully educated him in the law of God, and led his mind onward to all that was good. It was Samuel's last and crowning work. Prophecy and monarchy were both of his institution, as orderly elements of the Jewish state; he also trained the man who more nearly than any other approached unto the ideal of the theocratic king, and was to Israel the type of their coming Messiah. It was Samuel's wisdom in teaching his young men music which gave David the skill to be the sweet singer of the sanctuary; and we may feel sure also that when David arranged the service of the house of God, and gave priests and Levites their appointed duties (<a href="/1_chronicles/23.htm">1 Chronicles 23-26</a>.), the model which he set before him was that in which he had so often taken part with Samuel at Ramah. As Eliah, Abinadab, and Shammah were but lads (ver. 11), David must have been very young, and many years have elapsed between his anointing and his summons to Saul's presence and combat with Goliath; and they were thus well spent in the prophet's company, whence at, proper intervals he would return to his father's house and resume his ordinary duties. <span class="cmt_word">The Spirit of Jehovah came upon David from that day forward</span> (comp. <a href="/1_samuel/10-6.htm">1 Samuel 10:6, 9</a>). In modern language we should say that David's character grew and developed nobly, both intellectually and morally. With far more ethical truth the Israelites saw in the high qualities which displayed themselves in David's acts and words the presence and working of a Divine Spirit. It was a "breathing of Jehovah" which moved David onward, and fostered in him all that was morally great and good, just as it was "the breath of God" which at the creation moved upon the face of the waters to call this earth into being (<a href="/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Samuel rose up and went to Ramah.</span> His mission was over, and he returned to his ordinary duties; but, doubtless, first he made arrangements that David should in due time follow him thither, that he might be trained for his high office under Samuel's direct influence and control.
