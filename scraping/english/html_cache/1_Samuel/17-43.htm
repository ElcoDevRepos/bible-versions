Dogs were not typically seen as beloved pets but rather as scavengers. Goliath's rhetorical question underscores his disdain for David, whom he perceives as an unworthy opponent. This phrase highlights the arrogance and pride of Goliath, contrasting with David's humility and faith. The imagery of a "dog" is also used elsewhere in Scripture to denote contempt or lowliness, such as in <a href="/2_samuel/16-9.htm">2 Samuel 16:9</a> and <a href="/matthew/15-26.htm">Matthew 15:26</a>.<p><b>&#8220;that you come at me with sticks?&#8221;</b><br>Goliath's reference to "sticks" is a mocking observation of David's shepherd's staff, which he carried alongside his sling. This reflects Goliath's underestimation of David, seeing him as a mere shepherd boy rather than a formidable adversary. The mention of "sticks" also emphasizes the contrast between Goliath's heavily armed appearance and David's seemingly inadequate weaponry. This moment foreshadows the biblical theme that God often uses the weak and humble to overcome the strong, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>.<p><b>And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</b><br>Cursing by one's gods was a common practice in ancient warfare, invoking divine power to defeat enemies. The Philistines worshiped deities such as Dagon, and Goliath's curse reflects his reliance on these false gods. This act of cursing highlights the spiritual battle underlying the physical confrontation. It sets the stage for the demonstration of the true God's power over the idols of the Philistines. This moment is reminiscent of other biblical narratives where God's power triumphs over pagan deities, such as the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 7-12) and Elijah's challenge to the prophets of Baal (1 Kings 18).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>A young shepherd boy, anointed by God to be the future king of Israel.
