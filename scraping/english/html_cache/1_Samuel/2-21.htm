In the cultural context of ancient Israel, barrenness was often seen as a source of shame and a sign of divine disfavor. Hannah's earlier prayer in <a href="/1_samuel/1-10.htm">1 Samuel 1:10-11</a> shows her deep distress and her vow to dedicate her child to the LORD if He granted her a son. The LORD's attention to Hannah signifies His compassion and the fulfillment of His promises, echoing His faithfulness to other women in the Bible, such as Sarah and Rachel, who also experienced miraculous births.<p><b>and she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters</b><br>This phrase underscores the abundant blessing that God bestowed upon Hannah. After the birth of Samuel, whom she dedicated to the LORD, God continued to bless her with more children. This multiplication of her offspring can be seen as a sign of divine favor and a reversal of her previous barrenness. It also reflects the biblical theme of God blessing those who are faithful to Him, as seen in the stories of other patriarchs and matriarchs. The number of children, five in total, may symbolize completeness and God's generous provision.<p><b>Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD</b><br>Samuel's upbringing in the presence of the LORD indicates his unique role and calling as a prophet and judge in Israel. Raised in the tabernacle under the guidance of Eli the priest, Samuel was set apart for God's service from a young age. This phrase foreshadows his future significance in Israel's history, as he would anoint the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David. The presence of the LORD signifies not only physical proximity to the tabernacle but also spiritual growth and divine favor. Samuel's life parallels that of Jesus Christ, who also grew in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man (<a href="/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hannah.htm">Hannah</a></b><br>A devout woman who was initially barren but fervently prayed for a child.
