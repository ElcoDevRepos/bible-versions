This interaction occurs during a period when David is fleeing from King Saul, who is seeking to kill him. Abishai is part of David's inner circle, demonstrating the trust and loyalty within David's camp. This moment highlights David's leadership and his ability to influence those around him, even in matters of life and death.<p><b>Do not destroy him</b><br>David instructs Abishai not to kill Saul, despite having the opportunity to do so. This reflects David's respect for God's authority and his understanding of divine timing. David's decision is rooted in his faith and his belief that vengeance belongs to God, not man. This restraint is a testament to David's character and his commitment to righteousness, even when it would be easier to act otherwise.<p><b>for who can extend a hand against the LORD&#8217;s anointed</b><br>Saul, despite his pursuit of David, is still the anointed king of Israel. The term "anointed" refers to someone chosen by God for a specific purpose, often marked by a ceremonial anointing with oil. David recognizes Saul's position as God's chosen leader, which is why he refrains from harming him. This respect for God's anointed is a recurring theme in David's life and is a principle that underscores the sanctity of God's appointments.<p><b>and be guiltless?</b><br>David acknowledges that taking action against Saul would result in guilt before God. This reflects the biblical principle that one must not take justice into their own hands, especially against those whom God has placed in authority. David's rhetorical question implies that any attempt to harm Saul would be a sin, showing his deep reverence for God's law and order.

Through the anointing Saul had become the possession of Jehovah; only Jehovah, then, could lawfully take away that sacred life. This he elaborates in the next verse. It is possible that these exalted sentiments respecting the Divine rights of kings were not uttered by David while standing in the dark night among Saul's soldiers by the sleeping king, but subsequently, when he and Abishai were talking the incident over together.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-11.</span> - David forbids the deed as before (<a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>), because of Saul's office. As we there saw, this was an ingrained principle in David's mind on which he constantly acted. Present with equal strength in Saul's mind, it was the cause of moral ruin to the one, and of a noble forbearance and self-control to the other. David therefore leaves him in Jehovah's hand, saying, <span class="cmt_word">As Jehovah liveth, Jehovah shall smite him; or his day,</span> etc. Literally, "As Jehovah liveth (I will not smite him), but Jehovah shall smite him; either his day shall come and he shall die; or he shall go down into battle and perish." Whenever he falls, it shall be Jehovah's doing, whether he die a natural death, or a violent one in battle. "The smiting of Jehovah" does not imply a sudden death. God smites men with disease (<a href="/2_kings/15-5.htm">2 Kings 15:5</a>) and other troubles. What David means is that he will leave the matter entirely to God, but that if Saul's death is to be a violent one, he must fall honourably, not by the hand of a subject, but in battle with Israel's enemies. <span class="cmt_word">Jehovah forbid.</span> The same phrase as in <a href="/1_samuel/24-6.htm">1 Samuel 24:6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Cruse of water.</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> water bottle, as in <a href="/1_kings/19-6.htm">1 Kings 19:6</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/26-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1435;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1447;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
