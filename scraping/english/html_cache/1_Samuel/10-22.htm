In the context of ancient Israel, the use of the Urim and Thummim by the high priest was a common method for seeking God's will (<a href="/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>). This reflects the theocratic nature of Israel, where God was seen as the ultimate authority. The act of inquiring of the LORD underscores the dependence on divine wisdom, a theme prevalent throughout the Old Testament (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Has the man come here yet?&#8221;</b><br>The question reflects the anticipation and uncertainty surrounding the selection of Saul as king. This moment is pivotal in Israel's transition from a theocracy to a monarchy. The people were eager to see their new leader, as they had demanded a king to be like other nations (<a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>). This reflects a tension between God's plan and human desires, a recurring theme in biblical narratives.<p><b>And the LORD replied</b><br>This direct communication from God highlights His active involvement in the affairs of Israel. It demonstrates that God is not distant but is intimately aware of and engaged with His people. This divine response also serves to validate the process of selecting Saul, showing that it was under God's sovereign control. The ability of God to communicate directly with His people is a testament to His omniscience and omnipresence.<p><b>&#8220;Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage.&#8221;</b><br>Saul's hiding among the baggage is symbolic of his initial reluctance and humility, despite his physical stature and the people's expectations (<a href="/1_samuel/9-2.htm">1 Samuel 9:2</a>). This act can be seen as a type of Christ, who, despite being the King of Kings, humbled Himself (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>). The baggage may have been the supplies and belongings of the people gathered for the assembly, indicating a large gathering and the significance of the event.

They had already drawn lots, and the lot had pointed to Saul, yet they wanted further confirmation. Their reflex was to seek God rather than trust mere probability. Scripture frequently commends this instinct (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>; <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>).

While people seek assurance, God gives precise direction. Though Saul hides, the Lord&#8217;s call finds him. The verse reassures us that God&#8217;s plans are sure, His knowledge complete, and His answers timely for every servant who hesitates among the baggage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Therefore they enquired of the Lord further, if the man should yet come thither.</span>--Saul and Samuel alone, of all the host gathered that day at Mizpeh, knew on whom the lot would fall. So certain was Saul, after the strange signs had sealed the truth of the prophet's revelation, that he would be designated by the sacred lot, that he shrank from waiting to hear the result, and concealed himself among the baggage and store-tents and waggons of the vast assembly. A second Divine announcement was needed to discover his hiding-place, and draw him forth before the people.<p>(23?24) <span class= "bld">He was higher than any of the people.</span>--"How shall this man save us?" was the impatient and angry murmur soon raised by some discontented spirits in Israel, not improbably princes of the leading houses of the great tribes of Judah and Ephraim, who were disgusted at the choice falling on an unknown man of the small and comparatively powerless tribe of Benjamin. But Samuel--whose place in the nation the unknown Benjamite was really to take--with rare nobility and singleness of purpose, had already singled out and called conspicuous attention to the one gift Saul undoubtedly, in an extraordinary degree, possessed--the one gift by which, in that primitive time, a man seemed to be worthy of rule. He was "goodly": "there was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he;" from his shoulders and upward he towered above all the people. When he stood among the people, Samuel could say of him, "See ye him? Look at him whom the Lord hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people." It is in the days of the Judges, as in the Homeric days of Greece; Agamemnon, like Saul, is head and shoulders taller than the people. Like Saul, too, he has that peculiar air and dignity expressed by the Hebrew word which we translate "good," or "goodly." This is the ground of the epithet which became fixed as part of his name, "Saul the chosen," "the chosen of the Lord." In the Mussulman traditions this is the only trait of Saul which is preserved. His name has there been almost lost; he is known only as Thal-t, "the tall one." In the Hebrew songs of his own time he was known by a more endearing, but not less expressive, indication of the same grace. His stately towering form, standing under the pomegranate-tree above the precipice of Migron, or on the pointed crags of Michmash, or the rocks of Engedi, claimed for him the title of "wild roe," "the gazelle," perched aloft, the pride and glory of Israel. Against the giant Philistines a giant king was needed. The time for the little stripling of the house of Jesse was close at hand, but was not yet come. Saul and Jonathan, swifter than eagles and stronger than lions, still seemed the fittest champions of Israel. When Saul saw any strong man or any valiant man, he took him unto him. He, in his gigantic panoply, that would fit none but himself, with the spear that he had in his hand, of the same form and fashion as the spear of Goliath, was a host in himself.--Dean Stanley: <span class= "ital">Lectures on the Jewish Church, </span>21<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They inquired of Jehovah further, if the man should yet come thither.</span> More correctly, "Is any one as yet come hither?" The Septuagint and Vulgate translate as if there were an article before "any one" (Hebrew, <span class="accented">a man</span>), and give, "Is the man coming hither?" But the Hebrew text is the more satisfactory. For the object of the inquiry, made by the Urim and Thummim, was to find Saul, wherever he might be; and the enigmatical way of putting the question, Is any one as yet come? was regarded as more reverential than asking directly, Is Saul come? <span class="cmt_word">Among the stuff.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> the baggage, as in <a href="/1_samuel/17-22.htm">1 Samuel 17:22</a>, where it is translated "carriage." The people, collected from all Israel, would come with wagons and provisions, and such arms as they could procure; for very probably the Philistines would interrupt such a meeting, as they had that convened formerly by Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/7-7.htm">1 Samuel 7:7</a>). Naturally, therefore, they would follow the regulations of an army, and so arrange their baggage as to form a place of defence in case of attack.
