This phrase signifies readiness and accountability, echoing the posture of a servant before God, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>. It reflects a leader's willingness to be scrutinized and judged by the community he serves.<p><b>Bear witness against me before the LORD and before His anointed:</b><br>Samuel calls upon the people to testify against him if he has wronged them, doing so in the presence of God and the king, Saul, whom God has anointed. This highlights the seriousness of the occasion, as both divine and royal authority are invoked. The term "anointed" connects to the Hebrew word "Messiah," foreshadowing the ultimate Anointed One, Jesus Christ.<p><b>Whose ox or donkey have I taken?</b><br>Samuel asks if he has unlawfully taken property, specifically livestock, which were valuable assets in ancient Israelite society. This question underscores the importance of integrity and justice in leadership, as seen in the laws of restitution in <a href="/exodus/22.htm">Exodus 22:1-4</a>.<p><b>Whom have I cheated or oppressed?</b><br>Samuel seeks to affirm his just treatment of the people, aligning with the biblical mandate against oppression found in <a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>. This reflects God's concern for justice and fairness, themes prevalent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>From whose hand have I accepted a bribe and closed my eyes?</b><br>Bribery is condemned in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>), as it perverts justice. Samuel's question emphasizes his commitment to impartiality and righteousness, qualities expected of leaders. This also prefigures the perfect justice of Christ, who judges without partiality.<p><b>Tell me, and I will restore it to you.&#8221;</b><br>Samuel offers restitution, demonstrating repentance and the desire to make amends, in line with the biblical principle of restitution (<a href="/numbers/5-6.htm">Numbers 5:6-7</a>). This reflects the heart of a true servant leader, willing to correct wrongs, and points to the restorative work of Christ, who reconciles humanity to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The last judge of Israel, a prophet, and a leader who anointed the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David.

His simple declaration echoes earlier moments of availability before God (<a href="/1_samuel/3-4.htm">1 Samuel 3:4</a>; <a href="/genesis/22-1.htm">Genesis 22:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>). He is saying, &#8220;My life is an open book.&#8221; Leadership begins with visibility and integrity&#8212;qualities affirmed by Paul centuries later: &#8220;I always strive to maintain a clear conscience before God and man&#8221; (<a href="/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Bear witness against me before the LORD and before His anointed</b><p>Accountability is two-fold: divine and human. By summoning testimony &#8220;before the LORD,&#8221; Samuel anchors the moment in God&#8217;s omniscient presence (<a href="/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1-4</a>). Adding &#8220;before His anointed&#8221; brings Saul&#8212;the newly crowned king&#8212;into the courtroom, underscoring lawful order (<a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-4</a>). Mosaic law required at least two witnesses to confirm a charge (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>), a principle restated by Jesus (<a href="/matthew/18-16.htm">Matthew 18:16</a>) and Paul (<a href="/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1</a>). Samuel invites that scrutiny, confident no accusation will stand.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whose ox or donkey have I taken?</b><p>In agrarian Israel, oxen and donkeys were essential assets. Leaders could abuse power by requisitioning livestock, but Samuel never did. His question recalls the eighth commandment, &#8220;You shall not steal&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>). Kings were specifically warned not to multiply horses&#8212;or by extension, other animals&#8212;for themselves (<a href="/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">Deuteronomy 17:16</a>). By refusing to enrich himself at the people&#8217;s expense, Samuel models shepherd leadership, anticipating <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a> where the good shepherd &#8220;lays down His life for the sheep.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whom have I cheated or oppressed?</b><p>Here Samuel addresses economic and social justice. The law forbade oppression: &#8220;You must not oppress your neighbor or rob him&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>). Prophets later thundered against leaders who &#8220;sell the righteous for silver&#8221; (<a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6</a>). Samuel&#8217;s clean record shows what covenant faithfulness looks like in practice&#8212;walking humbly with God and doing justice (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From whose hand have I accepted a bribe and closed my eyes?</b><p>Bribery blinds judgment (<a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>). Proverbs warns, &#8220;A wicked man accepts a bribe in secret to pervert the ways of justice&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/17-23.htm">Proverbs 17:23</a>). Samuel&#8217;s refusal of bribes sets him apart from Eli&#8217;s corrupt sons (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>) and foreshadows the Messiah, &#8220;who will not judge by what His eyes see&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/11-3.htm">Isaiah 11:3-4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Tell me, and I will restore it to you.</b><p>Restitution is a biblical requirement (<a href="/exodus/22-1.htm">Exodus 22:1</a>; <a href="/leviticus/6-4.htm">Leviticus 6:4-5</a>).

Standing before God and king, he invites scrutiny over theft, oppression, or bribery and offers restitution if any wrong is found. The silence that follows (vv. 4-5) vindicates him, proving that righteous leadership is possible when one fears the LORD, honors His law, and serves others without personal gain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Behold, here I am: witness against me before the Lord, and before his anointed.</span>--I speak in a solemn presence, <span class= "ital">"</span>before the Eternal," went on the old man, looking up heavenward, "and before His anointed," pointing with a reverent gesture to the kingly form by his side. "His Anointed"--this is the earliest instance of a <span class= "ital">king </span>bearing this title of honour. The high priest, whose blessed office brought him in such close contact with the invisible and eternal King, is in the early Hebrew story styled now and again by this honoured name. But henceforth it seems to be limited to the man invested with the kingly dignity. The infinite charm which the name "Anointed of the Eternal" carried with it for centuries is, no doubt, due <span class= "ital">to </span>the fact that one greater than any of the sons of men would, in the far future, assume the same sacred designation--"His Anointed," or <span class= "ital">"</span>His Christ." (The words are synonymous, both being translations of the Hebrew word Messiah.)<p>Nor has this peculiar reverence for the "Lord's Anointed "been limited to His own people. Since the seer in the early morning on the hill-side, looking on "Ramah of the Watchers," poured out the holy oil on the young Saul's head, and then before all Israel gathered at Gilgal styled the new king by the title of the "Anointed of the Eternal," wherever the one true God has been worshipped, an infinite charm has gone with the name, a strange and peculiar reverence has surrounded every one who could fairly claim to bear it, and for many a century, among all peoples, an awful curse has at once attached itself to any one who would dare lift his hand against the "Lord's Anointed."<p><span class= "bld">Whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken?</span>--The ox and the ass are taken as representative possessions in this primitive age, in a country where agriculture formed the principal source of the national resources. Before the wars and conquests of David and Solomon, there was comparatively little of the precious metals among the Hebrew people, who seem to have traded in those early days but rarely with foreign nations; horses were, too, unknown among them. The law of <a href="/exodus/20-17.htm" title="You shall not covet your neighbor's house, you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is your neighbor's.">Exodus 20:17</a> especially makes mention of the ox and the ass as things the Israelite was forbidden to covet. On these words of Samuel the Babylonian Talmud has an important note, which well illustrates the doctrine of the "Holy Spirit" as taught in Israel before the Christian era.<p>"Rabbi Elazer said, on three occasions did the Holy Spirit manifest Himself in a peculiar manner--in the judicial tribunal instituted by Shem, in that of Samuel the Ramathite, and in that of Solomon. In that of Shem, Judah declared, "She is righteous," &c. How could he know it? Might not another man have come to her as well as he did? But an echo of a voice was heard exclaiming: Of me (the word <span class= "greekheb">????</span> is separated from the preceding word, and taken as a distinct utterance of the Holy Spirit); these things were overruled by me. Samuel said (<a href="/context/1_samuel/12-3.htm" title="Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind my eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.">1Samuel 12:3-5</a>), "Behold, here I am: witness against me before the Lord, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? . . . And he said unto them, The Lord is witness against you, &c . . . And he said, He is witness" (<span class= "greekheb">?????</span>). It ought to read, "And <span class= "ital">they </span>said." But it was the Holy Spirit that gave that answer. So with Solomon the words "She is the mother thereof (<a href="/1_kings/3-27.htm" title="Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.">1Kings 3:27</a>) were spoken by the Holy Spirit."--Treatise <span class= "ital">Maccoth, </span>fol. 23, Colossians 2.<p><span class= "bld">Whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed?</span>--Alluding, of course, to his conduct during his long continuance in office as supreme judge in Israel. The "bribe"--literally, <span class= "ital">ransom</span>--alludes to that practice unhappily so common in the East of giving the judge a gift (usually of money) to buy his favour, and thus a criminal who had means was too often able to escape punishment.<p>The sons of Samuel, we know from <a href="/1_samuel/8-3.htm" title="And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.">1Samuel 8:3</a>, "took bribes, and perverted judgment." This accusation, we know, had been preferred by the very elders of the nation before whom the seer was then speaking. The old judge must have been very confident of his own spotless integrity to venture upon such a solemn challenge. The elders had shown themselves by their bold accusation of the seer's sons no respecters of persons, and from the tone of Samuel's address, must have felt his words were but the prelude of some scathing reproaches they would have to listen to, and yet they were constrained with one voice to bear their witness to the perfect truth of his assertion that his long official life had been indeed pure and spotless. The Talmud has a curious tradition respecting the prophets, based apparently upon this saying of Samuel. "All the prophets were rich men. This we infer from the account of Moses, Samuel, Amos, and Jonah. Of Moses, as it is written (<a href="/numbers/16-15.htm" title="And Moses was very wroth, and said to the LORD, Respect not you their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.">Numbers 16:15</a>), 'I have not taken one ass from them.' Of Samuel, as it is written (<a href="/1_samuel/12-3.htm" title="Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind my eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.">1Samuel 12:3</a>), 'Behold, here I am; witness against me before the Lord, and before His anointed. Whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken?' Of Amos, as it is written (<a href="/amos/7-14.htm" title="Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdsman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:">Amos 7:14</a>), 'I was an herdsman and a gatherer of sycamore fruit,' <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>I am proprietor of my herds and own sycamores in the valley. Of Jonah, as it is written (<a href="/jonah/1-3.htm" title="But Jonah rose up to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them to Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.">Jonah 1:3</a>), 'So he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it.' Rabbi Yochanan says he hired the whole ship. Rabbi Rumanus says the hire of the ship amounted to <span class= "ital">four thousand </span>golden denarii."--Treatise <span class= "ital">Nedarim, </span>fol. 38, Colossians 1. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Witness against me.</span> Literally, "answer," as in a court of justice to the formal question of the judge. <span class="cmt_word">His anointed.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> the king (see on 1 Samuel 2:10, 35; 2:1). <span class="cmt_word">Whose ox,... whose ass?</span> See on 1 Samuel 8:16. <span class="cmt_word">Of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith?</span> Bribe should be rendered <span class="accented">ransom.</span> Literally it signifies a covering, and was used of money given by a guilty person to induce the judge to close or "blind his eyes," and not see his sin. It does not mean, therefore, any bribe, but only that given to buy off a guilty person. Such persons are generally powerful men who have oppressed and wronged others; and the knowledge that they can cover their offence by sharing their gains with the judge is to this day in the East the most fruitful source of bad government. The people all bear witness to Samuel's uprightness, nor is there any contradiction between this and their desire to have a king. His internal administration was just and righteous, but they were oppressed by the nations round them, and needed a leader in war. And in Samuel's sons they had men, not vicious or licentious, but too fond of money, and so neither fit to be their generals in war nor their judges in peace. We gather from <a href="/1_samuel/22-2.htm">1 Samuel 22:2</a> that though Saul proved a competent leader in war, he was not successful in the government of the country in peace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/12-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Here I am.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1504;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection &#124;
