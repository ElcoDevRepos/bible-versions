The context is Saul's relentless pursuit of David, who was anointed by Samuel to be the next king of Israel. David's hiding places were often in the wilderness areas of Judah, such as the Desert of Ziph. This pursuit highlights the tension between Saul and David, a recurring theme in 1 Samuel. The act of observing and finding out suggests espionage and the use of informants, which was common in ancient warfare and political intrigue.<p><b>Then come back to me with certainty,</b><br>Saul demands precise information, indicating his desperation and the importance of eliminating David as a threat to his throne. The need for certainty underscores the high stakes involved and Saul's reliance on human intelligence rather than seeking divine guidance. This reflects Saul's spiritual decline and contrasts with David's reliance on God for guidance, as seen in other parts of 1 Samuel.<p><b>and I will go with you.</b><br>Saul's willingness to personally lead the pursuit shows his vested interest in capturing David. It also indicates the seriousness of the threat David posed to Saul's reign. This personal involvement contrasts with earlier instances where Saul delegated tasks to others, showing his increasing obsession with David.<p><b>If he is in the land,</b><br>This phrase acknowledges the possibility that David might have left the territory of Judah, which was under Saul's control. It reflects the uncertainty and difficulty in tracking David, who was skilled in evasion and had the support of local populations. The land of Judah is significant as it is David's tribal territory, providing him with some level of protection and support.<p><b>I will search him out among all the clans of Judah.&#8221;</b><br>Saul's intent to search among all the clans of Judah indicates a thorough and exhaustive effort to find David. The clans of Judah were numerous and spread out, making this a daunting task. This phrase highlights the tribal structure of ancient Israel, where loyalty to one's clan could supersede loyalty to the king. It also foreshadows the eventual support David would receive from the tribe of Judah when he becomes king. Saul's determination to search among the clans also reflects the broader theme of division and conflict within Israel, which is a backdrop to the narrative of 1 Samuel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, currently on the run from King Saul.

The wording also hints at Saul&#8217;s fear that David might slip beyond reach, reminding us that God can hide His servants wherever He chooses (<a href="/1_kings/17-3.htm">1 Kings 17:3&#8211;4</a>; <a href="/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I will search him out among all the clans of Judah</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;I will search him out among all the clans of Judah.&#8221;

The verse exposes Saul&#8217;s escalating paranoia, contrasts human scheming with divine preservation, and foreshadows how God will overturn Saul&#8217;s efforts by firmly establishing David in the very territory Saul plans to scour. The passage assures believers that no amount of worldly plotting can undo God&#8217;s covenant purposes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Throughout all the thousands of Judah.</span>--The "thousands" (Heb., <span class= "ital">alaphim</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>as we learn from <a href="/numbers/1-16.htm" title="These were the renowned of the congregation, princes of the tribes of their fathers, heads of thousands in Israel.">Numbers 1:16</a>; <a href="/numbers/10-4.htm" title="And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves to you.">Numbers 10:4</a>, were the greater tribal divisions.
