Their gathering signifies a unified decision among the tribes, highlighting the gravity of their request. In the ancient Near Eastern context, elders held significant authority and were often involved in decision-making processes. This gathering reflects a collective concern about leadership and governance, as the elders sought a change in the political structure of Israel. The unity among the elders underscores the widespread desire for a monarchy, which was a common form of government among neighboring nations.<p><b>and came to Samuel</b><br>Samuel was the last of the judges and a prophet, serving as a pivotal figure in Israel's transition from a theocracy to a monarchy. His role as a judge and prophet made him a key intermediary between God and the people. The elders approaching Samuel indicates their recognition of his spiritual authority and leadership. Samuel's life and ministry are significant in the biblical narrative, as he anointed the first two kings of Israel, Saul and David. His role as a prophet is crucial, as he conveys God's will to the people, and his response to the elders' request would shape the future of Israel.<p><b>at Ramah</b><br>Ramah was Samuel's hometown and served as his base of operations. It is located in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Jerusalem. Archaeological evidence suggests that Ramah was a significant settlement during the time of Samuel. The choice of Ramah as the meeting place indicates its importance as a center of leadership and governance. In biblical history, Ramah is associated with several key events, including Samuel's birth and his establishment of a school of prophets. The location also holds prophetic significance, as it is mentioned in the context of Rachel's weeping in <a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>, which is later referenced in the New Testament in <a href="/matthew/2-18.htm">Matthew 2:18</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders_of_israel.htm">Elders of Israel</a></b><br>These were the leaders or representatives of the various tribes of Israel.

The verse sets the stage for Israel&#8217;s request for a king&#8212;a request God will permit but also warn against&#8212;highlighting the perpetual tension between relying on visible structures and trusting the invisible King.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">All the elders of Israel.</span>--We have here a clear trace of a popular assembly which seems in all times to have existed in Israel. Such a body appears to have met for deliberation even during the Egyptian captivity (see <a href="/exodus/3-16.htm" title="Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:">Exodus 3:16</a>). Of this popular council we know little beyond the fact of its existence. It seems to have been composed of representatives of the people, qualified by birth or office; these were known as "elders." Ewald sees special allusions to the "Parliament" or Assembly of Elders in Psalms 1. and 82. There are, however, various mentions of these councils in the Books of Samuel, Kings, Jeremiah, and Isaiah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The elders of Israel.</span> Here, as elsewhere (<a href="/1_samuel/15-30.htm">1 Samuel 15:30</a>:<a href="/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3</a>, etc.), we have traces of a popular assembly, representing the Israelite nation, and composed probably of the chiefs and heads of fathers houses. Already in Egypt (<a href="/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>, etc.) we find stone such body in existence, and it seems to have lasted throughout the whole history of the nation; for it outlived the monarchy, gained increased power after the exile, and continued down to New Testament times. The demand, therefore, for a king, though a sort of revolt against Samuel's authority, was at least made in a constitutional manner, and came before him with all the weight of a formal decision on the part of the representatives of the nation. They put it also in the form of a request, for which they give two reasons. First, the decay of his physical powers - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, thou art old.</span> Wise and vigorous as his rule had been, yet with increasing years there was less of energy; and the events recorded as having occurred at the beginning of Saul's reign show, that in order to check the increasing power of the Philistines, a leader was needed who was at once daring, resolute, and skilful in war. But there was a further reason - <span class="cmt_word">Thy sons walk not in thy ways</span>. These words show that the elders had the most perfect confidence in Samuel. They felt that he would not connive at the wickedness of his sons, but would do what was right by the nation. Thus they had everything to hope from the father's justice, while if they waited till his death the sons might resist what was virtually their deposition. That the sons of a judge possessed considerable power see <a href="/judges/9-2.htm">Judges 9:2</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Make us a king to judge us like all the nations.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> just as all the heathen nations have a king. The words are those of <a href="/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14</a>, and were probably intended to remind Samuel that the nation was only asking what had virtually been promised. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/8-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the elders</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(ziq&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2205.htm">Strong's 2205: </a> </span><span class="str2">Old</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Israel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1513;&#1474;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(yi&#347;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3478.htm">Strong's 3478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc</span><br /><br /><span class="word">gathered together</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1514;&#1456;&#1511;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1456;&#1510;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#7791;&#183;qab&#183;b&#601;&#183;&#7779;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
