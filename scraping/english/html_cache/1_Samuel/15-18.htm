In the biblical context, a mission from God is a divine mandate that carries significant weight and responsibility. The concept of being sent on a mission by God is seen throughout Scripture, such as in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) where Jesus sends His disciples to spread the Gospel. This mission for Saul was a test of obedience and faithfulness to God's commands.<p><b>saying, &#8216;Go and devote to destruction</b><br>The term "devote to destruction" is translated from the Hebrew word "herem," which means to completely destroy or consecrate something to God by destroying it. This was a common practice in ancient warfare, especially in the context of holy wars, where the spoils of war were not to be taken for personal gain but were to be destroyed as an offering to God. This command highlights the seriousness of God's judgment against sin and the need for complete obedience.<p><b>the sinful Amalekites.</b><br>The Amalekites were a nomadic tribe that were long-standing enemies of Israel. Their sinfulness is noted in their unprovoked attack on the Israelites as they came out of Egypt (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>). God declared perpetual war against them, and their destruction was a fulfillment of that divine judgment. The Amalekites symbolize persistent sin and opposition to God's people, and their destruction serves as a warning against allowing sin to persist.<p><b>Fight against them until you have wiped them out.</b><br>This command for total annihilation underscores the completeness of God's judgment. It reflects the idea that partial obedience is disobedience. Saul's failure to fully carry out this command led to his rejection as king (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>). This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate victory over sin and evil through Jesus Christ, who will one day completely eradicate sin and establish His eternal kingdom (<a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who commands and guides His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>The prophet who conveys God's message to Saul, the first king of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, chosen by God, who is given the mission to destroy the Amalekites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/amalekites.htm">Amalekites</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe, historically enemies of Israel, known for their opposition to God's people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mission.htm">Mission</a></b><br>The divine command given to Saul to execute God's judgment on the Amalekites.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_commands.htm">Obedience to God's Commands</a></b><br>God's instructions are clear and require full obedience.
