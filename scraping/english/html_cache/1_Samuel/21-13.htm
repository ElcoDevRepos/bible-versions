This phrase indicates a strategic decision by David to alter his conduct to avoid recognition and potential harm. The context is crucial: David is in enemy territory, and his reputation as a warrior who defeated Goliath, a Philistine champion, precedes him. This act of changing behavior is a survival tactic, reflecting David's resourcefulness and adaptability in dire circumstances.<p><b>and feigned madness in their hands;</b><br>Feigning madness was a common tactic in ancient times to avoid persecution or harm, as those considered insane were often not seen as threats. In the cultural context, madness was sometimes viewed as a sign of divine displeasure or possession, which could lead to fear or avoidance by others. David's actions here are reminiscent of the wisdom literature, where prudence and cunning are valued (<a href="/proverbs/22-3.htm">Proverbs 22:3</a>). This act of feigning madness can also be seen as a type of Christ, who, though possessing divine wisdom, was often misunderstood and rejected by those around Him.<p><b>he scratched on the doors of the gate</b><br>This action further emphasizes David's attempt to appear deranged. The gates of a city were significant places, often where legal matters were discussed and where leaders sat. By scratching on the doors, David is making a public display of his supposed madness, ensuring that his act is visible to all. This behavior might have been intended to provoke a reaction of disdain or pity, rather than hostility, from the Philistines.<p><b>and let his saliva run down his beard.</b><br>In the cultural and historical context, a man's beard was a symbol of dignity and respect. Allowing saliva to run down one's beard would be seen as a loss of self-respect and an indication of insanity. This act would have been particularly shocking and convincing to the Philistines, reinforcing David's ruse. The beard, often associated with wisdom and honor, being defiled in this way, underscores the depth of David's humiliation and the lengths he was willing to go to preserve his life. This moment can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's own humiliation and suffering, where He was despised and rejected by men (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The future king of Israel, anointed by Samuel, who is fleeing from King Saul's wrath.

His altered behavior, public antics, and deliberate humiliation illustrate God&#8217;s faithful protection, the legitimacy of prudent strategy, and the truth that no cost is too high when God&#8217;s purposes are at stake.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">He changed his behaviour.</span>--These very words (with the substitution of Abimelech for Achish, a name which, as has been above suggested, seems to have been the "nomen dignitatis" for generations of Philistine kings) are found in the title of Psalms 34. The poem in question is, however, of a general, not of an historical character, and especially celebrates Jehovah's guardian care of the righteous. Its "acrostic" arrangement, however, suggests a later date than the time of David. If, as is quite possible, the royal psalmist was the original author, and that the deliverance on the present occasion suggested the theme, then it must have been brought into its present form by some later temple musician.<p><span class= "bld">Feigned himself mad.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">he roamed hither and thither</span>, <span class= "ital">restless and in terror.</span>--Dean Payne Smith. "In their hands," that is, "in their presence." Some have supposed that the madness was not "simulated," but <span class= "ital">real. </span>Wrought upon by excitement of fear and terrible anxiety, it has been suggested that the mind for a time lost its balance, and that David became temporarily really insane; but the sense of the narrative plainly indicates that the madness was feigned.<p><span class= "bld">Scrabbled on the doors of the gate.</span>--Scratched on them; "scrabble" being probably a diminutive of "scrape" (Richardson, <span class= "ital">Dictionary</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>By others it is connected with "scribble." the root in either case being ultimately the same. The LXX. and Vulg. apparently translate from a slightly different word, and instead of "scrabbled," render "drummed" (<span class= "ital">impingebat</span>) on the wings of the doors.<p><span class= "bld">Let his spittle fall.</span>--That is, allowed the foam which comes from the mouth of a madman to hang about his beard. It has been cleverly suggested that David was only too well acquainted with all the signs of madness, from his long and intimate association with King Saul in his darker hours of insanity. There are other well-authenticated examples in history of great heroes, in seasons of sore danger, feigning madness like David, with a view of escaping from their enemies. For instance, according to the Shahnameh, Kai Khosrev feigned idiocy in face of mortal peril.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He changed his behaviour.</span> The same word is used in the title of <a href="/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a>. Literally it means "his taste," and, like the Latin word <span class="accented">sapientia</span>, is derived from the action of the palate, and so from the faculty of discriminating flavours it came to signify the power of discrimination generally. Thus "to change his taste" means to act as if he had lost the power of distinguishing between objects. <span class="cmt_word">Feigned himself mad.</span> Literally, "he roamed hither and thither" restlessly and in terror. <span class="cmt_word">In their hands.</span> <span class="accented">I.e.</span> before them, in their presence. <span class="cmt_word">Scrabbled on the doors of the gate.</span> The Vulgate and Septuagint read <span class="accented">drummed</span> upon them. Literally the verb means "to make the mark of a Tau," the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet, and which anciently was in the form of a cross. The gate, on the leaves of which David scrawled, was probably that of the court or waiting room, in which the servants of Achish passed their time when in attendance upon him. Possibly David had witnessed these symptoms of madness in Saul's case during his fits of insanity.
