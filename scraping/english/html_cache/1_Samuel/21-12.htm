The words he took to heart were those of the servants of Achish, who recognized him as the king of Israel. This moment reflects David's acute awareness of the danger he was in, as he was in enemy territory. The phrase "took these words to heart" suggests a moment of reflection and realization, highlighting David's vulnerability and humanity. This introspection is a recurring theme in David's life, as seen in the Psalms, where he often contemplates his circumstances and God's role in them.<p><b>and was very much afraid</b><br>David's fear is significant, as it shows that even a man after God's own heart experienced fear. This fear was not just a passing emotion but a profound sense of dread, indicating the seriousness of his predicament. The Bible often records the fears of its heroes to show their reliance on God. David's fear contrasts with his previous courage against Goliath, illustrating that even the faithful can experience moments of weakness. This fear would later lead him to feign madness, a tactic to escape danger, showing his resourcefulness and reliance on God for deliverance.<p><b>of Achish the king of Gath</b><br>Achish was the king of Gath, one of the five Philistine city-states. Gath was known for its giants, including Goliath, whom David had previously defeated. David's presence in Gath is ironic and dangerous, as he was now among the people he had once fought against. Achish's recognition of David as a threat underscores the tension and danger of the situation. Historically, Gath was a significant Philistine city, and its king would have been a powerful figure. David's fear of Achish highlights the political and military threat he faced, as well as the precariousness of his position as a fugitive from Saul.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, currently fleeing from King Saul.

David realizes he is no anonymous fugitive; his past victories over Philistines are well known (<a href="/1_samuel/17-50.htm">1 Samuel 17:50-54</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and was very much afraid</b><p>&#8226; Fear here is intense, not casual. The man who once ran toward Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-48.htm">1 Samuel 17:48</a>) now feels genuine dread.<p>&#8226; Fear itself is not sin; what we do with it matters. David channels it into desperate dependence on God&#8212;see the superscriptions of <a href="/bsb/psalms/34.htm">Psalm 34</a> and <a href="/bsb/psalms/56.htm">Psalm 56</a>, both composed &#8220;when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech [Achish] and he drove him away.&#8221; In those psalms he confesses, &#8220;When I am afraid, I put my trust in You&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/56-3.htm">Psalm 56:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; His fear also spurs practical action. Immediately he crafts a plan, feigning madness (<a href="/1_samuel/21-13.htm">1 Samuel 21:13</a>).

David&#8217;s presence could be seen as a direct threat, especially with songs of his Philistine-slaying exploits still in public memory.<p>&#8226; Later, Achish will welcome David as a vassal (<a href="/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2-6</a>), showing that God can turn even feared enemies into unlikely protectors.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>David&#8217;s quick, inward response to hostile words reveals a heart alive to danger and to God. He weighs the threat, feels honest fear, and recognizes the earthly power of Achish. Yet his subsequent psalms show that fear drives him not to despair but to deeper trust. The verse reminds believers that taking circumstances seriously, acknowledging fear, and seeking God&#8217;s help are not contradictory but complementary steps of faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">And David laid up these words.</span>--Now, for the first time, David saw how widely travelled was a renown of which he in his humbleness of heart had thought so little, and at once a deadly fear took possession of him. The life he held so cheaply when in battle with the enemies of his country now, strange to say, in his deep degradation and poverty, became of real value to him, and he adopted the piteous and humiliating device of feigning madness, hoping thus to change the wondering admiration of the servants of Achish into pitying scorn. What David hoped took place, and he was driven out of Gath with ignominy; but there is no reason for supposing that had he maintained a quiet dignity of behaviour any evil would have happened to him. The Philistines, for those wild times, seem to have been a cultured people, and by no means devoid of generous instincts. Not one word, strangely enough, is reported to have been spoken about the great injury he had done to the Philistine nation when he slew Goliath. It has been suggested with considerable ingenuity that the great name of the dead champion, the hero of so many battle-fields, was never brought forward here, perhaps out of a natural indisposition to recall a grievous calamity, but more likely out of regard for Goliath's family and friends. Singularly little is told us, in fact, about this renowned hero, whom tradition hints at as the great warrior in the decisive battle when the Ark was captured and the sons of Eli were slain. The Talmud has a curious comment on this strange silence--"Not half the praises of Goliath are related in Scripture; hence it follows that it is wrong to tell the praises of the wicked."--Treatise <span class= "ital">Soteh, </span>fol. 42, Colossians 2.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/21-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now David</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1493;&#1460;&#1435;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#257;&#183;wi&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1732.htm">Strong's 1732: </a> </span><span class="str2">David -- perhaps 'beloved one', a son of Jesse</span><br /><br /><span class="word">took</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1447;&#1513;&#1474;&#1462;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#347;em)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7760.htm">Strong's 7760: </a> </span><span class="str2">Put -- to put, place, set</span><br /><br /><span class="word">words</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(had&#183;d&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1697.htm">Strong's 1697: </a> </span><span class="str2">A word, a matter, thing, a cause</span><br /><br /><span class="word">these</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1500;&#1468;&#1462;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;l&#183;leh)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_428.htm">Strong's 428: </a> </span><span class="str2">These, those</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to heart</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1489;&#1425;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(bil&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3824.htm">Strong's 3824: </a> </span><span class="str2">Inner man, mind, will, heart</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and was very much</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1488;&#1465;&#1428;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3966.htm">Strong's 3966: </a> </span><span class="str2">Vehemence, vehemently, wholly, speedily</span><br /><br /><span class="word">afraid</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1512;&#1464;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#183;r&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3372.htm">Strong's 3372: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fear, to revere, caus, to frighten</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1508;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1461;&#1430;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(mip&#183;p&#601;&#183;n&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6440.htm">Strong's 6440: </a> </span><span class="str2">The face</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Achish</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1499;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#7733;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">0<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_397.htm">Strong's 397: </a> </span><span class="str2">Achish -- king of Gath</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the king</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1469;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(me&#183;le&#7733;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
