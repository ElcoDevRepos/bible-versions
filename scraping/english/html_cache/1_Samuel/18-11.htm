In ancient Near Eastern culture, spears were common weapons used in warfare and personal combat. Saul's act of hurling the spear indicates a moment of intense anger and jealousy. This action is a physical manifestation of Saul's inner turmoil and his growing animosity towards David, who had found favor with God and the people of Israel.<p><b>thinking, &#8220;I will pin David to the wall.&#8221;</b><br>Saul's intention to "pin David to the wall" reveals his murderous intent. This phrase highlights Saul's desire to eliminate David, whom he saw as a threat to his throne. The imagery of pinning someone to the wall suggests a violent and decisive act. Saul's thoughts reflect his fear and insecurity, as David's successes and popularity increased. This moment foreshadows the ongoing conflict between Saul and David, which is a central theme in the narrative of 1 Samuel.<p><b>But David eluded him twice.</b><br>David's ability to elude Saul's attack twice demonstrates his agility and God's protection over him. This repeated evasion signifies that David was not only physically adept but also under divine favor. The number "twice" may symbolize the completeness of God's deliverance, as seen in other biblical narratives where God intervenes to protect His chosen ones. David's escape from Saul's attempts on his life is reminiscent of other biblical figures who were preserved by God for a greater purpose, such as Joseph and Moses. This protection underscores David's future role as king and his typological connection to Jesus Christ, who also faced opposition but fulfilled God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Earlier the king loved David (18:2); now, inflamed by jealousy after the women&#8217;s song (18:7&#8211;9), he acts on murderous rage.<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently shows how unchecked anger escalates into violence&#8212;Cain rose up against Abel (<a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5&#8211;8</a>), and an angry man stirs up strife (<a href="/proverbs/29-22.htm">Proverbs 29:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s action is deliberate. Unlike a sudden outburst, he waits with the spear in hand while David ministers to him with music (18:10), highlighting the contrast between Saul&#8217;s hatred and David&#8217;s service.<p>&#8226; The scene foreshadows Saul&#8217;s later attempts (19:9&#8211;10) and illustrates <a href="/james/1-20.htm">James 1:20</a>: &#8220;For man&#8217;s anger does not bring about the righteousness of God.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Thinking, &#8220;I will pin David to the wall.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The phrase gives us Saul&#8217;s internal dialogue; his intent is unmistakably lethal. Murder in the heart precedes murder by the hand (<a href="/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; Jealousy drives the plot. Saul resents God&#8217;s favor on David (18:12) much like Joseph&#8217;s brothers envied him (<a href="/genesis/37-11.htm">Genesis 37:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s words expose rebellion against God&#8217;s command, &#8220;You shall not murder&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>). Instead of defending Israel&#8217;s anointed champion, he seeks to destroy him.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_john/3-12.htm">1 John 3:12</a> reminds us that, like Cain, Saul&#8217;s jealousy is rooted in unrighteousness: &#8220;And why did he kill him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother&#8217;s were righteous.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But David eluded him twice.</b><p>&#8226; Though the spear flies twice, David survives twice. The repetition underscores God&#8217;s protective hand (<a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/22-31.htm">2 Samuel 22:31</a>).<p>&#8226; David does not retaliate. His restraint anticipates his later mercy in the caves of En-gedi and Hakilah (<a href="/bsb/1_samuel/24.htm">1 Samuel 24</a>; 26), embodying <a href="/proverbs/19-11.htm">Proverbs 19:11</a>: &#8220;A man&#8217;s insight gives him patience, and his virtue is to overlook an offense.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s sovereign preservation allows David to continue serving, composing, and ultimately ascending to the throne (<a href="/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4</a>).

Saul&#8217;s violent act exposes the corrosive power of envy; David&#8217;s escape highlights divine protection and patient faith. The verse warns against nurturing anger and comforts us with the assurance that God&#8217;s plans for His people stand firm, even when spears are flying.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">And Saul cast the javelin.</span>--The Alexandrian MS. of the LXX. and the Chaldee Version translate the Hebrew here "lifted the javelin."
