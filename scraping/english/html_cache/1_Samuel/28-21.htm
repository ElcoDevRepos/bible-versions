Saul's distress is significant, as it highlights his spiritual decline and separation from God. This moment occurs after God has stopped answering Saul through prophets or dreams, leading him to seek forbidden practices. The woman's recognition of Saul's distress underscores the gravity of his situation, as he is the king of Israel yet finds himself in a state of fear and helplessness. This reflects the consequences of disobedience to God, as Saul had previously banned mediums and spiritists from the land (<a href="/1_samuel/28-3.htm">1 Samuel 28:3</a>).<p><b>she said to him, &#8220;Look, your maidservant has obeyed your voice.</b><br>The woman's reference to herself as Saul's "maidservant" indicates her submission and acknowledgment of his authority, despite the illicit nature of their encounter. Her obedience to Saul's request, despite the risk involved, highlights the desperation and fear that permeated the situation. This phrase also reflects the cultural norms of the time, where women often referred to themselves in subservient terms when addressing men, especially those in positions of power.<p><b>I took my life in my hands and did as you told me.</b><br>The phrase "I took my life in my hands" indicates the danger the woman faced in complying with Saul's request. Engaging in necromancy was punishable by death according to the Law of Moses (<a href="/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a>), and Saul himself had enforced this law. Her willingness to risk her life suggests either a fear of Saul's authority or a belief in the seriousness of his plight. This act of risking one's life can be seen as a parallel to the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who willingly laid down His life for humanity. The woman's actions, though motivated by fear or obligation, inadvertently highlight themes of sacrifice and obedience.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who is in a state of desperation and fear as he seeks guidance from a medium, having been abandoned by God due to his disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman (Medium of Endor)</a></b><br>A woman who practices necromancy, whom Saul consults in violation of God's law, highlighting his spiritual decline and desperation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/endor.htm">Endor</a></b><br>A location in ancient Israel where the medium resided, representing a place of spiritual compromise for Saul.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel (Referenced in Context)</a></b><br>The prophet who had died, whom Saul seeks to contact through the medium, symbolizing Saul's longing for divine guidance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/philistines.htm">Philistines (Referenced in Context)</a></b><br>The enemy nation threatening Israel, whose impending attack contributes to Saul's fear and desperation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Saul's actions demonstrate the severe consequences of turning away from God's commands.

David&#8217;s use of the phrase about Goliath, <a href="/1_samuel/19-5.htm">1 Samuel 19:5</a>).<p>- Practicing necromancy carried the death penalty (<a href="/leviticus/20-27.htm">Leviticus 20:27</a>). By complying, she risked immediate execution from Saul&#8217;s own decree.<p>- Her courage exposes Saul&#8217;s desperation; he willingly endangers another to satisfy his craving for supernatural counsel (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and did as you told me</b><p>- She emphasizes complete compliance&#8212;she has done &#8220;as you told me,&#8221; echoing Israel&#8217;s expected response to divine commands (<a href="/exodus/19-8.htm">Exodus 19:8</a>).<p>- Saul&#8217;s authority prevails in this limited sphere, yet his earlier half-obedience to God (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22</a>) stands in stark relief.<p>- The episode highlights a reversal: the pagan medium displays full obedience; the anointed king persists in selective obedience, sealing his downfall (<a href="/1_chronicles/10-13.htm">1 Chronicles 10:13-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/28-21.htm">1 Samuel 28:21</a> portrays the medium approaching a physically and spiritually shattered Saul, testifying that she has risked her life to obey his request. Her respectful obedience contrasts with Saul&#8217;s habitual disobedience to God, underscoring the tragic irony of Israel&#8217;s king relying on forbidden means while ignoring the Lord. The verse thus exposes Saul&#8217;s desperation, the woman&#8217;s courage, and the sobering consequences of turning from divine guidance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">And the woman.</span>--The story is completed in these few concluding verses (<a href="/context/1_samuel/28-21.htm" title="And the woman came to Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said to him, Behold, your handmaid has obeyed your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.">1Samuel 28:21-25</a>) in a most natural and unaffected style. The witch, though a grievous sinner, is struck with a woman's pity for the stricken king, and with kind words and still kinder acts does her best to recover him from the death-like swoon into which the hapless Saul had fallen. Her whole behaviour contradicts the supposition that she was moved by a bitter hatred against Saul (see <span class= "ital">Excursus </span>L at end of this Book) to desire the appearance of Samuel, and to imitate his voice by means of ventriloquism. Firstly, she was herself terrified at the apparition; and secondly, she was saddened by the effect of the dead seer's words on the king, and did her poor best to restore him to composure and strength again. We read in the next verse how the woman, with Saul's servants, used even a gentle compulsion to induce the king to take the nourishment he was so sorely in need of.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/28-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">When the woman</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1469;&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;i&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
