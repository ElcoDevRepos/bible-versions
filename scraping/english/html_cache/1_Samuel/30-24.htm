In the context of <a href="/1_samuel/30.htm">1 Samuel 30</a>, David addresses his men after a victorious battle against the Amalekites. Some of his men, described as "wicked and worthless," proposed that those who did not fight should not share in the spoils. David's question challenges this selfish mindset, emphasizing unity and fairness. This reflects the biblical principle of equality and justice, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/acts/10-34.htm">Acts 10:34</a>, where God shows no partiality.<p><b>The share of the one who went to battle</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of those who actively participate in the mission. In ancient warfare, those who fought were often rewarded with the spoils of victory. This practice is seen throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/numbers/31-27.htm">Numbers 31:27</a>, where the spoils of war are divided among those who fought and the community. David acknowledges the bravery and effort of the warriors, aligning with the biblical theme of rewarding diligence and courage.<p><b>will match the share of the one who stayed with the supplies.</b><br>David's decision to give equal shares to those who stayed with the supplies reflects a principle of shared responsibility and community. In the ancient Near Eastern context, guarding supplies was a crucial task, ensuring the army's sustenance and security. This decision promotes unity and prevents division among the people. It echoes the New Testament teaching in <a href="/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12-27</a>, where Paul describes the body of Christ as having many parts, each with its own role and importance.<p><b>They will share alike.&#8221;</b><br>This final statement establishes a precedent for equitable distribution among the people of God. It highlights the value of every role within the community, whether visible or behind the scenes. This principle is seen in the early church, where believers shared everything in common (<a href="/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32-35</a>). David's decree foreshadows the inclusive nature of the kingdom of God, where all contributions are valued, and everyone shares in the blessings, much like the parable of the workers in the vineyard in <a href="/matthew/20.htm">Matthew 20:1-16</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The anointed future king of Israel, who demonstrates leadership and fairness in distributing the spoils of battle.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_amalekites.htm">The Amalekites</a></b><br>A nomadic tribe that raided Ziklag, taking captives and spoils, prompting David's pursuit.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziklag.htm">Ziklag</a></b><br>The town given to David by the Philistine king Achish, which was attacked and burned by the Amalekites.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_400_warriors.htm">The 400 Warriors</a></b><br>The men who went with David to recover their families and possessions from the Amalekites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_200_men.htm">The 200 Men</a></b><br>Those who stayed behind with the supplies due to exhaustion, yet were included in the distribution of the spoils.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/principle_of_fairness.htm">Principle of Fairness</a></b><br>David's decision underscores the importance of fairness and equality in the community of believers.

This teaches us about the importance of just leadership in our communities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_and_community.htm">Unity and Community</a></b><br>The decision to share the spoils equally fosters unity and prevents division. In the body of Christ, unity is crucial, and we should strive to maintain it by valuing each member's contribution.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_for_the_weary.htm">Encouragement for the Weary</a></b><br>The inclusion of the 200 men who stayed with the supplies serves as an encouragement to those who may feel weary or sidelined. God sees and values their role.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_economy.htm">God's Economy</a></b><br>God's way of rewarding is not based on human standards of merit but on His grace and justice.

No one who fears God or values their brothers would endorse withholding the spoil.<p>&#8226; The question is rhetorical&#8212;David expects a resounding &#8220;no one.&#8221;<p>&#8226; He appeals to shared covenant loyalty, echoing earlier reproofs of selfishness such as Moses&#8217; warning against a &#8220;wicked thought&#8221; in the heart (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-9.htm">Deuteronomy 15:9</a>) and Abigail&#8217;s rebuke of Nabal&#8217;s greed (<a href="/1_samuel/25-25.htm">1 Samuel 25:25</a>).<p>&#8226; By framing it this way, David immediately shifts the conversation from personal gain to communal righteousness, much like Paul later asks, &#8220;Is Christ divided?&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-13.htm">1 Corinthians 1:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The share of the one who went to battle</b><p>Those who fought did risk their lives and obviously deserve reward.
