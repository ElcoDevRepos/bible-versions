It reflects the idea that those who were once prosperous and self-sufficient find themselves in need. This can be seen as a divine intervention where God humbles the proud and exalts the humble. The concept is echoed in the Magnificat (<a href="/luke/1-53.htm">Luke 1:53</a>), where Mary praises God for filling the hungry with good things and sending the rich away empty. This reversal serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and justice, emphasizing that material wealth is not a guarantee of security.<p><b>But the starving hunger no more</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to God's provision and care for those in need. It reflects the biblical theme of God as a provider, as seen in the provision of manna for the Israelites in the wilderness (Exodus 16). The transformation from hunger to satisfaction symbolizes spiritual fulfillment and divine blessing. It also foreshadows the teachings of Jesus, who declared Himself the Bread of Life, promising that those who come to Him will never hunger (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<p><b>The barren woman gives birth to seven</b><br>In the ancient Near Eastern context, barrenness was often seen as a curse or a sign of divine disfavor. The birth of seven children, a number symbolizing completeness and perfection in the Bible, represents a complete reversal of this condition. This phrase can be connected to the story of Hannah, the mother of Samuel, who was initially barren but was blessed by God with a son after fervent prayer (1 Samuel 1). It also prefigures the miraculous births in the Bible, such as that of Isaac to Sarah and John the Baptist to Elizabeth, highlighting God's power to bring life where there was none.<p><b>But she who has many sons pines away</b><br>This phrase contrasts the previous one, illustrating the theme of reversal once more. In the cultural context, having many sons was considered a sign of blessing and strength. However, this statement suggests that even those who seem secure in their blessings can experience loss and decline. It serves as a warning against complacency and pride, reminding believers that true security and blessing come from God alone. This idea is echoed in the story of Job, who lost his children and possessions but remained faithful to God, ultimately being restored (Job 1-42).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/hannah.htm">Hannah</a></b><br>The mother of Samuel, who was initially barren but prayed fervently to God for a child.
