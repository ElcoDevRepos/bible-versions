The context here is that Saul had initially set out to find his father's lost donkeys, which were a valuable asset in ancient Israelite society. The mention of donkeys highlights the agrarian lifestyle and the importance of livestock in the economy and daily life. Saul's response is straightforward and factual, focusing on the immediate concern of the donkeys. This reflects Saul's initial humility and simplicity before he becomes king. The donkeys' recovery can also be seen as a sign of God's providence and care for even the small details of life, which is a recurring theme in Scripture.<p><b>But Saul did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about the kingship.</b><br>This phrase indicates Saul's reticence to disclose the full extent of his encounter with Samuel, particularly the prophetic revelation about his future as king. This omission can be interpreted in several ways. It may reflect Saul's humility or uncertainty about the monumental change that was about to occur in his life. Historically, the concept of kingship was new to Israel, as they had been led by judges and prophets. Saul's silence could also suggest a reluctance to embrace this new role, which aligns with his later hesitance and struggles as king. Theologically, this moment foreshadows the tension between divine calling and human response, a theme that runs throughout the Bible. Saul's kingship is a significant turning point in Israel's history, marking the transition from a theocracy to a monarchy. This passage also connects to the broader biblical narrative of God's sovereignty in appointing leaders, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>, where God chooses David as king. Saul's initial reluctance can be contrasted with Jesus Christ, who fully embraced His role as the Messiah, highlighting the difference between human and divine leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, chosen by God and anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Much like Joseph withholding his dreams until God&#8217;s timing (<a href="/genesis/37-5.htm">Genesis 37:5-11</a>), Saul waits for the Lord to unveil the bigger plan.<p>&#8226; The restraint underscores humility; though anointed, he does not rush to claim the throne (compare <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a>).<p>&#8226; God often tests future leaders with secrecy before visibility&#8212;Gideon tears down the Baal altar at night (<a href="/judges/6-27.htm">Judges 6:27</a>), David tends sheep after his own anointing (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What Samuel had said about the kingship</b><p>The withheld information is staggering: Saul is Israel&#8217;s first king (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1, 24</a>).<p>&#8226; By keeping it private, Saul lets God, not gossip, introduce him to the nation (<a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a>).<p>&#8226; The episode foreshadows Christ&#8217;s frequent commands to silence after miracles&#8212;&#8220;My hour has not yet come&#8221; (<a href="/john/2-4.htm">John 2:4</a>; <a href="/mark/1-44.htm">Mark 1:44</a>). Divine timing guards divine purposes.<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s secrecy also protects Samuel&#8217;s prophetic office; premature leaks could invite doubt or rebellion (<a href="/jeremiah/1-17.htm">Jeremiah 1:17-19</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the verse hints at future tension: Saul begins well in humility, but later pride and disobedience will emerge (<a href="/1_samuel/15-17.htm">1 Samuel 15:17-23</a>). Early choices set trajectories.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/10-16.htm">1 Samuel 10:16</a> captures a critical crossroads in Saul&#8217;s life. He speaks truth about the donkeys, proving Samuel&#8217;s prophecy, yet withholds the astounding news of his anointing. The verse teaches that:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s guidance addresses everyday needs even while revealing grand purposes.<p>&#8226; Humility and discretion are vital in stewarding a fresh calling.<p>&#8226; Obedience includes knowing when to speak and when to stay silent, trusting the Lord to unveil His plan in His own time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/10.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">He told him not.</span>--It has been suggested ingeniously that this reply was prompted by the characteristic Israelite caution--the fear of betraying prematurely an important secret. It is, however, far better to assume that Samuel had given the young Saul to understand that the revelation respecting his future, and the great state change involved in it, was, in the first instance, for him alone; no other man was as yet to share that great secret with him. In His own good time God would signify His sovereign will and pleasure to Israel; till then, Saul was strictly to keep his own counsel in this important matter. To have imparted the secret to any one would have at once opened the door to secret intrigues and party plotting; one like Abner, especially, would not have been slow in devising schemes to compass so great an end as the placing the crown of Israel on the head of one of his own family.<p>The modesty and humility, as well as the wisdom, of Saul in these early days of his greatness is remarkable. The "changed heart" was indeed an acknowledged fact with him. Wordsworth quotes here how, "in like manner, Samson, in the early days of his humility, told not his parents of the lion. (See <a href="/judges/14-6.htm" title="And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily on him, and he rent him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had done.">Judges 14:6</a>.) So Saul of Tarsus spake not of his visions and revelations of the Lord till he was constrained to do so by his enemies." (See <a href="/2_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.">2Corinthians 12:1</a>.)<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/10-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
