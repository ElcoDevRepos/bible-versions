In the context of ancient Israel, altars were central to worship and sacrifice, serving as a place where offerings were made to God. This act can be seen as Saul's effort to align himself with the religious practices of his forefathers, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who also built altars to the LORD (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 26</a>:25, 35:7). However, Saul's spiritual leadership is often contrasted with that of Samuel, who was a prophet and judge, and David, who was a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>).<p><b>it was the first time he had built an altar to the LORD.</b><br>This phrase highlights Saul's lack of previous personal initiative in establishing a place of worship, which may reflect his inconsistent spiritual leadership. Unlike other leaders in Israel's history who frequently built altars as acts of devotion and covenant renewal, Saul's delayed action suggests a reactive rather than proactive approach to his relationship with God. This moment is significant because it underscores Saul's struggle with obedience and faithfulness, themes that are prevalent throughout his reign. The mention of this being his first altar may also imply a missed opportunity for earlier spiritual leadership and guidance for the nation. Saul's reign is marked by a series of failures to fully obey God's commands, contrasting with the future king, David, who would establish Jerusalem as a central place of worship and bring the Ark of the Covenant there (<a href="/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

The contrast exposes his earlier misstep and hints at repentance (<a href="/1_samuel/14-24.htm">1 Samuel 14:24, 33</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to the LORD</b><p>&#8211; The phrase clarifies the altar&#8217;s purpose: exclusive devotion to Yahweh, not to any pagan deity (<a href="/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24&#8211;26</a>).<p>&#8211; Earlier, Saul&#8217;s spiritual focus had wavered&#8212;consulting the priest but quickly stopping him (<a href="/1_samuel/14-18.htm">1 Samuel 14:18&#8211;19</a>). Here, the altar sets his attention squarely on the covenant God.<p>&#8211; The text underscores that true worship is God-directed, not king-centered (<a href="/psalms/29-2.htm">Psalm 29:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/42-8.htm">Isaiah 42:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it was the first time he had built an altar to the LORD</b><p>&#8211; Although anointed years earlier (<a href="/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>), Saul had never erected an altar until now. The delay highlights a pattern: he often acted militarily before acting spiritually (<a href="/1_samuel/13-7.htm">1 Samuel 13:7&#8211;12</a>).<p>&#8211; Compare Jonathan, who regularly invoked the LORD&#8217;s name in faith (14:6). Saul&#8217;s late start underscores the spiritual gap between father and son.<p>&#8211; The note also foreshadows Saul&#8217;s later failures; sporadic worship can signal inconsistent obedience (<a href="/1_samuel/15-22.htm">1 Samuel 15:22&#8211;23</a>; <a href="/hosea/6-4.htm">Hosea 6:4</a>).<p>&#8211; Yet God allows new beginnings. Even a tardy altar can become a turning point, just as Manasseh&#8217;s late repentance was accepted (<a href="/2_chronicles/33-12.htm">2 Chronicles 33:12&#8211;13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/14-35.htm">1 Samuel 14:35</a> captures a rare high moment for Saul: after a chaotic battle and a rash oath, he finally pauses to honor God. The sequence teaches that worship must follow deliverance, that leadership includes modeling reliance on the LORD, and that it is never too late to start building altars of obedience&#8212;even if earlier steps were missed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">The same was the first altar that he built . . .</span>--More accurately, as in margin, <span class= "ital">the same he began to build as an altar. </span>The great Jewish commentators are divided as to the precise meaning of the old Hebrew language of this verse. <span class= "ital">Abarbanel </span>interprets the words, "that King Saul began to build, but did not finish." The Midrash prefers to understand the statement as telling how "Saul began among the kings of Israel the building of altars." The more obvious meaning, if we translate as in our English Version, seems to be that this was the first public acknowledgment King Saul made to God for the mercies and goodness vouchsafed to him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Saul built an altar unto Jehovah</span> as a thank offering for the Divine favour in gaining so great a victory. <span class="cmt_word">The same was the first altar,</span> etc. Literally, "As to it he began to build an altar unto Jehovah." On these words the question has arisen whether the meaning be that Saul began to build an altar, but with characteristic impetuosity left off before he had completed it; or whether on that occasion he commenced the custom followed by David (<a href="/2_samuel/24-25.htm">2 Samuel 24:25</a>) of erecting altars as the patriarchs had done in old time. The latter interpretation is more in accordance with the usage of the Hebrew language, and is approved by the translations of the Septuagint and Vulgate. <p> CHAPTER 14:36-52 JONATHAN'S DANGER AND DELIVERANCE (vers. 36-46). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/14-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Saul</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1488;&#1435;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#363;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7586.htm">Strong's 7586: </a> </span><span class="str2">Saul -- first king of Israel, also an Edomite and two Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">built</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1447;&#1489;&#1462;&#1503;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yi&#183;&#7687;en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
