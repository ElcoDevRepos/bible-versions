This area was known for its rugged terrain, making it a suitable place for David to hide. The Ziphites' decision to approach Saul indicates their loyalty to the king, possibly motivated by a desire for favor or fear of retribution. Gibeah, Saul's hometown and royal residence, was the center of his power. This act of betrayal by the Ziphites highlights the political tensions and shifting allegiances during Saul's reign.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Is not David hiding among us</b><br>David, anointed by Samuel as the future king of Israel, was on the run from Saul, who saw him as a threat to his throne. The Ziphites' question implies they were aware of David's presence and chose to inform Saul, perhaps to curry favor with the king. This reflects the broader theme of David's persecution and the testing of his faith and character during his time in the wilderness.<p><b>in the strongholds at Horesh</b><br>Horesh was a location in the wilderness of Ziph, characterized by its natural fortifications. These strongholds provided David with protection and a strategic advantage against Saul's forces. The mention of strongholds underscores the constant danger David faced and his reliance on God's guidance and provision for safety.<p><b>on the hill of Hachilah</b><br>The hill of Hachilah was a specific geographical feature in the wilderness of Ziph. Its mention provides a precise location for David's hiding place, emphasizing the detailed knowledge the Ziphites had of the area. This detail also highlights the challenges David faced in remaining hidden and the persistent threat posed by Saul's pursuit.<p><b>south of Jeshimon?</b><br>Jeshimon refers to a desolate or desert area, further emphasizing the harsh conditions David endured while evading Saul. The wilderness setting serves as a backdrop for David's spiritual growth and dependence on God. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of the wilderness as a place of testing and preparation, seen in the experiences of figures like Moses and Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/ziphites.htm">Ziphites</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Ziph, a town in the territory of Judah.

Each geographic detail authenticates the narrative and magnifies David&#8217;s peril, yet the broader context shows the Lord continually shielding His anointed (<a href="/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14, 24</a>:15). What men intend for harm, God weaves into His sovereign plan, preserving David for the throne and ultimately pointing to the flawless Kingship of Christ (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>; <a href="/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/23.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(</span>19<span class= "ital">) </span><span class= "bld">The Ziphites.</span>--The words of these Ziphites, and the king's grateful reply, show that they were very warm adherents of Saul, entirely devoted to his fortunes, and well aware of his passionate desire to be rid of David.<p><span class= "bld">On the south of Jeshimon.</span>--Jeshimon is not the name of a place, but it signifies a "desert" or "solitude" (see <a href="/isaiah/43-19.htm" title="Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall you not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.">Isaiah 43:19</a>). It is used here for the "dreary desert which extends between the Dead Sea and the Hebron Mountains. . . . It is a plateau of white chalk, terminated on the east by cliffs, which rise vertically from the Dead Sea shore to a height of above 3,000 feet. The scenery is barren and wild beyond all description."--Conder: <span class= "ital">Tent Life in Palestine. </span>This is the wilderness of Judea spoken of in <a href="/matthew/3-1.htm" title="In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,">Matthew 3:1</a>. David was just then encamped with some of his followers in some thickets bordering on this trackless desert. The Ziphites evidently knew the country well, not only the hills, but the solitary wastes stretching out at its base. They were willing and ready, if Saul's trained soldiers marched into their neighbourhood, to act as their guides in the pursuit or the famous outlaw and his men. They kept their promise faithfully, and in the pursuit which followed the arrival of Saul and his forces, David was in extreme danger of capture. The news that the Philistines had invaded the territories of Saul in great force hastily summoned the king from the district, and David was thus saved from a destruction which appeared to be imminent.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19, 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Ziphites.</span> Rather, "some Ziphites," or "people of Ziph," as there is no article. They tell Saul that David was hiding in the fastnesses of the wild region in their neighbourhood, and especially in <span class="cmt_word">the hill of Hachilah,</span> a ridge that ran along eastward of Maon. Conder recognises it in the long ridge called El Kolah, running out of the Ziph plateau towards the Dead Sea desert. It lay <span class="cmt_word">on the south of Jeshimon</span>, or rather "on the right hand of the desert." Jeshimon is not a proper name, but means any desert (<a href="/psalms/107-4.htm">Psalm 107:4</a>; <a href="/isaiah/43-19.htm">Isaiah 43:19</a>), though it is used specially of the desert of Sinai in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a>, and of that of Judah here and in <a href="/numbers/21-20.htm">Numbers 21:20</a>; <a href="/numbers/23-28.htm">Numbers 23:28</a>. Conder ('Handbook,' p. 213) calls it "the dreary desert which extends between the Dead Sea and the Hebron mountains. It is called Jeshimon, or 'Solitude,' in the Old Testament, and 'wilderness of Judea' in the New (<a href="/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a>). It is a plateau of white chalk, 2000 feet lower than the watershed, and terminated on the east by cliffs which rise vertically from the Dead Sea shore to a height of about 2000 feet. The scenery is barren and wild beyond all description. The chalky ridges are scored by innumerable torrents, and their narrow crests are separated by broad flat valleys. Peaks and knolls of fantastic forms rise suddenly from the swelling downs, and magnificent precipices of ruddy limestone stand up like fortress-walls above the sea. Not a tree nor a spring is visible in the waste, and only the desert partridge and the ibex are found ranging the solitude. It was in this pathless desert that David found refuge from Saul's persecution, and the same has been a place of retreat from the days of Christ to the present time."
