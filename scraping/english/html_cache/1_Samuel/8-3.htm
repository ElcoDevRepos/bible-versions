This phrase highlights the recurring biblical theme of the failure of the next generation to uphold the spiritual and moral standards of their predecessors. Similar patterns are seen with Eli's sons in <a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>, who also did not follow in their father's ways. This failure underscores the importance of personal responsibility in maintaining faithfulness to God's commands, regardless of one's lineage or upbringing.<p><b>they turned aside toward dishonest gain,</b><br>The phrase "turned aside" suggests a deliberate departure from the path of righteousness. The pursuit of dishonest gain indicates a prioritization of personal wealth and power over justice and integrity. This behavior is condemned throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a>, which warns against the destructive nature of greed. The actions of Samuel's sons reflect a broader societal issue where leaders exploit their positions for personal benefit, a problem that persists in various forms throughout history.<p><b>accepting bribes</b><br>Accepting bribes is explicitly condemned in the Mosaic Law, as seen in <a href="/exodus/23-8.htm">Exodus 23:8</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>, where it is stated that bribes blind the eyes of the wise and subvert the cause of the righteous. This practice undermines the justice system and erodes public trust in leadership. The acceptance of bribes by Samuel's sons illustrates their moral corruption and the resulting failure to administer justice impartially, which is a direct violation of God's commandments.<p><b>and perverting justice.</b><br>Perverting justice is a grave sin in the biblical context, as justice is a foundational principle of God's character and His expectations for human governance. <a href="/isaiah/5-20.htm">Isaiah 5:20-23</a> speaks against those who call evil good and good evil, highlighting the severity of distorting justice. The actions of Samuel's sons contributed to the people's demand for a king, as they lost faith in the current system of judges. This demand ultimately led to the anointing of Saul as king, marking a significant shift in Israel's governance and fulfilling God's warning about the consequences of rejecting His direct rule (<a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge over Israel, known for his faithfulness to God.

Their refusal to walk in their father&#8217;s ways led them to chase dishonest gain, accept bribes, and warp justice, violating clear commands in God&#8217;s Law. The verse warns that personal righteousness cannot be inherited; every generation must choose obedience. It also illustrates how corrupt leadership damages a nation&#8217;s trust and pushes people to seek alternatives, setting the stage for Israel&#8217;s request for a king.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Took bribes, and perverted judgment.</span>--This sin, at all times a fatally common one in the East, was especially denounced in the Law. (See <a href="/context/exodus/23-6.htm" title="You shall not wrest the judgment of your poor in his cause.">Exodus 23:6-8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm" title="You shall not wrest judgment; you shall not respect persons, neither take a gift: for a gift does blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>.) It is strange that the same ills that ruined Eli's house, owing to the evil conduct of his children, now threatened Samuel. The prophet-judge, however, acted differently to the high priestly judge. The sons of Samuel were evidently, through their father's action in procuring the election of Saul, quickly deposed from their authority. The punishment seems to have been successful in correcting the corrupt tendencies of these men, for we hear in after days of the high position occupied at the court of David by the distinguished descendants of the noble and disinterested prophet. (See the notices in <a href="/1_chronicles/6-33.htm" title="And these are they that waited with their children. Of the sons of the Kohathites: Heman a singer, the son of Joel, the son of Shemuel,">1Chronicles 6:33</a>; <a href="/context/1_chronicles/25-4.htm" title="Of Heman: the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamtiezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth:">1Chronicles 25:4-5</a>, respecting Heman, the grandson of Samuel, the king's seer, who was chief of the choir of the Psalmist-king in the house of God.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His sons...took bribes.</span> This sin was expressly forbidden in <a href="/exodus/23-6.htm">Exodus 23:6, 8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-19.htm">Deuteronomy 16:19</a>, and it marks the high spirit of the nation that it was so indignant at justice being thus perverted. <span class="cmt_word">They walked not in his way</span> (singular - so the written text); for Samuel's own administration of justice had been most upright (<a href="/1_samuel/12-4.htm">1 Samuel 12:4</a>), nor is it laid to his charge that he connived at the misconduct of his sons. On the contrary, after remonstrance indeed, not for his sons' sake, but for the honour of the theocracy, and that the people might be on their guard against a despotic exercise of the power with which they were about to intrust a single man, he superseded not them only, but also himself. His conduct in this trying conjuncture was most admirable, and few commentators have done justice to the man, who, possessed of what was virtually kingly power, yet gave it over for the nation's good into the hands of another. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/8-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">But his sons</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1464;&#1504;&#1464;&#1497;&#1493;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7687;&#257;&#183;n&#257;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
