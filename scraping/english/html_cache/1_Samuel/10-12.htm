The setting is Gibeah, Saul's hometown, where people would have been familiar with his previous life and character. The man's question reflects the surprise and skepticism of the community, as Saul was not known for prophetic activity. This highlights the unexpected nature of God's calling and the transformation that can occur when God chooses someone for His purposes.<p><b>&#8220;And who is their father?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question suggests doubt about the legitimacy or origin of the prophetic group Saul was seen with. In ancient Israel, lineage and family background were significant, often determining one's social and religious roles. The question implies skepticism about the authority or authenticity of the prophets, and by extension, Saul's sudden inclusion among them. It underscores the theme that God's choices often defy human expectations and societal norms.<p><b>So the saying became a proverb</b><br>The transformation of this event into a proverb indicates its widespread impact and the lasting impression it made on the people. Proverbs in biblical times were used to convey wisdom or express common experiences. This particular saying captures the astonishment and irony of Saul, a man not previously associated with spiritual leadership, being counted among the prophets. It serves as a reminder of God's unpredictable ways and the potential for change in anyone's life.<p><b>&#8220;Is Saul also among the prophets?&#8221;</b><br>This phrase became a proverbial expression of surprise and disbelief. Saul's unexpected prophetic behavior was so remarkable that it became a cultural reference point. Theologically, it illustrates the theme of divine empowerment, where God equips individuals for His purposes regardless of their past. This event foreshadows Saul's complex relationship with God and his eventual failure to fully embrace his divine calling. It also prefigures the New Testament concept of transformation through the Holy Spirit, as seen in the lives of the apostles and early Christians.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, chosen by God and anointed by the prophet Samuel.

The reply gives us some insight into the deep conviction entertained by the ordinary Israelite of the days of Samuel that the invisible God was ever present, <span class= "ital">working </span>in the midst of His chosen people.<p>The reply of the second citizen has been well explained by Von Bunsen:--"Is the <span class= "ital">son of Kish, </span>then, a prophet?' asks the first citizen, surprised, apparently, that one so undistinguished, that one so unlikely to train up a "son of the prophets," should have a son associated in this peculiar and sudden manner with a chosen band of scholars and teachers. To this question the second citizen replied--no doubt, pointing to the honoured group from the prophet schools of Gibeah--"Do you wonder that the son of so rough and uncultivated a man as Kish should receive the Divine gift which we all love so well and admire so greatly? Who," pointing to the group singing on the hill-side, "who is <span class= "ital">their </span>father?" <span class= "ital">They </span>owe their power of persuasive speech, their gift of holy song, to no accident of birth. Surely Saul, like them, may have received the same power as a gift of the Eternal, not as a patrimony. Owing to this obvious meaning not having occurred to them, the LXX., "Vulgate, and Syriac Versions alter the original into, "Who is his (instead of their) father?" in other words, "Who is Saul? and who is his father, Kish?" But the Hebrew text and the English Version, as explained above, gives an admirable sense, and teaches besides a great spiritual lesson.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">One of the same place</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Gibeah - <span class="cmt_word">answered and said, But who is their father?</span> The Septuagint, Syriac, and Vulgate read, <span class="accented">But who is his father?</span> But this would be a foolish reply to the question, "What has happened to the son of Kish?" The meaning rather must be, You ask about the son of Kish; but what has birth to do with prophecy? None of these young men have inherited these gifts, and if Saul can take part in their prophesyings, why should he not? Kish, his father, is no worse than theirs. <span class="cmt_word">Is Saul also among the prophets?</span> Under very different circumstances Saul once again took part in the exercises of these youthful prophets (<a href="/1_samuel/19-24.htm">1 Samuel 19:24</a>), and evidently on both occasions with such skill and success as prove the readiness of his genius; and so struck were the people at the strange power which he thus evinced, that their expression of wonder became fixed in the national mind as a proverb. Saul was a man of great natural ability, and yet not the sort of person whom the people expected would be made king. He probably could neither read nor write, and from his extreme height was perhaps awkward and bashful; as he suffered afterwards from fits of insanity (<a href="/1_samuel/16-14.htm">1 Samuel 16:14</a>), he may always have been flighty and wilful; and altogether, though possessed of marvellous gifts, was certainly the very opposite of Samuel's well trained and orderly scholars. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/10-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who lived there</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1464;&#1435;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;&#353;&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124;
