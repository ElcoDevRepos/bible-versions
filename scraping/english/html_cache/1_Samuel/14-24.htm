The distress indicates both physical exhaustion and a moral burden due to the oath imposed by Saul. This reflects the broader theme of leadership and its impact on the people, as seen in other biblical narratives where leaders' decisions directly affect the well-being of their followers (e.g., <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a> with the golden calf incident).<p><b>for Saul had placed the troops under an oath</b><br>Saul's leadership style often involved impulsive decisions, as seen in previous chapters. Oaths in ancient Israel were serious commitments, often invoking divine witness and consequences. This reflects the cultural and religious significance of vows, as seen in <a href="/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>, where making and keeping vows is emphasized.<p><b>saying, &#8220;Cursed is the man who eats any food before evening</b><br>The curse here is a form of a conditional curse, common in ancient Near Eastern cultures, where breaking an oath would bring divine retribution. This reflects the seriousness with which oaths were taken and the belief in divine enforcement of such vows. The curse also highlights Saul's focus on personal vendetta over the well-being of his troops.<p><b>before I have taken vengeance on my enemies.&#8221;</b><br>Saul's statement reveals his personal motivation and desire for vengeance, which contrasts with the biblical principle of leaving vengeance to God (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>). This personal vendetta can be seen as a deviation from the theocratic ideal where God is the ultimate deliverer of justice.<p><b>So none of the troops tasted any food.</b><br>The troops' obedience to Saul's oath, despite their distress, underscores the hierarchical nature of ancient Israelite society and the authority of the king. This obedience, however, leads to further consequences, as seen later in the chapter when Jonathan unknowingly breaks the oath. This incident foreshadows the eventual decline of Saul's kingship, as his decisions increasingly lead to negative outcomes for Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, who made a rash oath that affected his troops.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_men_of_israel.htm">The Men of Israel</a></b><br>The soldiers under Saul's command, who were distressed due to the oath.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_philistines.htm">The Philistines</a></b><br>The enemies of Israel, whom Saul sought to defeat.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonathan.htm">Jonathan</a></b><br>Saul's son, who was unaware of the oath and later violated it by eating honey.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_battle.htm">The Battle</a></b><br>The ongoing conflict between Israel and the Philistines, which was impacted by Saul's oath.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_rash_decisions.htm">The Danger of Rash Decisions</a></b><br>Saul's impulsive oath demonstrates the potential harm of making decisions without seeking God's guidance.

The number 10,000 is not an improbable one, as the original small force which had kept with Saul and Jonathan had been joined by the Hebrew auxiliaries in the Philistine camp, and also by many of the fugitives from the villages around.
