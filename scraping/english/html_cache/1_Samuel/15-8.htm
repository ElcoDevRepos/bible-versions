The Amalekites were a nomadic tribe and long-standing enemies of Israel, first attacking them during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-16</a>). God's command to Saul was to completely destroy the Amalekites as a form of divine judgment for their past sins against Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a>). Capturing Agag alive indicates Saul's partial obedience to God's command, which ultimately leads to his rejection as king. The sparing of Agag can be seen as a failure to fully execute divine justice, reflecting Saul's tendency to prioritize his own judgment over God's instructions.<p><b>but devoted all the others to destruction with the sword</b><br>The phrase "devoted to destruction" refers to the Hebrew concept of "herem," which means to completely destroy or consecrate something to God, often through destruction. This was a common practice in ancient warfare, especially in the context of holy wars, where the spoils of war were not to be taken for personal gain but were to be destroyed as an offering to God. Saul's actions here show a partial fulfillment of God's command, as he destroys the rest of the Amalekites. However, his failure to fully obey by sparing Agag and taking spoils (as seen later in the chapter) highlights a significant theme in 1 Samuel: the importance of complete obedience to God. This act of incomplete obedience is contrasted with the future king, David, who is described as a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). Saul's disobedience foreshadows the eventual rise of David, who will fulfill God's commands more faithfully.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, anointed by the prophet Samuel.

Everything belonged to God&#8212;no spoils, no survivors.<p>&#8226; Partial obedience still equals disobedience; Saul&#8217;s selective compliance resembles Ananias and Sapphira&#8217;s partial gift (<a href="/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The text underlines the seriousness of covenant justice: God judged Amalek for generational hostility toward Israel (<a href="/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>with the sword</b><p>&#8226; The sword stresses that this was not symbolic but physical judgment&#8212;life-and-death obedience (<a href="/romans/13-4.htm">Romans 13:4</a> speaks of rulers bearing the sword, yet Saul shrank from using it fully).<p>&#8226; God had earlier declared, &#8220;I will utterly blot out the memory of Amalek&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/17-14.htm">Exodus 17:14</a>); the sword was His chosen instrument.<p>&#8226; Saul&#8217;s inconsistent use of that sword foreshadows his own downfall by the same means (<a href="/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4</a>), illustrating <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>: &#8220;whatever a man sows, he will reap.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/1_samuel/15-8.htm">1 Samuel 15:8</a> highlights Saul&#8217;s selective obedience: he kept Agag alive while slaughtering the rest. God&#8217;s command was total; Saul&#8217;s compliance was partial, revealing a heart not fully surrendered. The verse reminds us that half-hearted obedience is disobedience, that God&#8217;s judgments are righteous and complete, and that genuine faith follows His word without editing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He took Agag.</span> This was the official name of the Amalekite kings (see <a href="/numbers/24-7.htm">Numbers 24:7</a>), as Pharaoh was that of the kings of Egypt.
