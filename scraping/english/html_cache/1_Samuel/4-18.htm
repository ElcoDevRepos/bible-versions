Its mention here signifies the gravity of the situation, as the Ark had been captured by the Philistines. This event marks a significant turning point in Israel's history, highlighting the consequences of Israel's disobedience and the failure of its leadership. The Ark's capture is a fulfillment of the prophecy against Eli's house (<a href="/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27-36</a>).<p><b>Eli fell backward from his chair by the city gate</b><br>Eli's position at the city gate indicates his role as a judge and leader, as city gates were places of judgment and decision-making in ancient Israel. His fall symbolizes the downfall of his house and the end of his ineffective leadership. The city gate was a place of public gathering, suggesting that Eli's fall was witnessed by many, emphasizing the public nature of his failure.<p><b>and being old and heavy</b><br>Eli's age and physical condition reflect his spiritual state and the decline of his leadership. His heaviness may also symbolize the weight of his responsibility and the burden of his failure to restrain his sons, Hophni and Phinehas, who had corrupted the priesthood (<a href="/1_samuel/2-12.htm">1 Samuel 2:12-17</a>). This detail underscores the consequences of neglecting God's commands and the importance of faithful leadership.<p><b>he broke his neck and died</b><br>Eli's death is both literal and symbolic, marking the end of an era of corrupt leadership. The breaking of his neck signifies a sudden and irreversible judgment from God, fulfilling the prophecy that his house would be judged (<a href="/1_samuel/3-11.htm">1 Samuel 3:11-14</a>). This event serves as a warning of the seriousness of sin and the necessity of obedience to God's will.<p><b>And Eli had judged Israel forty years</b><br>The forty-year period of Eli's judgeship is significant, as the number forty often represents a time of testing or judgment in the Bible (e.g., the Israelites' forty years in the wilderness). Eli's long tenure suggests a period of stagnation and decline in Israel's spiritual life, setting the stage for the rise of Samuel, who would lead Israel into a new era of faithfulness and renewal. This transition foreshadows the coming of Christ, who would bring ultimate redemption and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/eli.htm">Eli</a></b><br>The high priest and judge of Israel, Eli served for forty years.

Eli&#8217;s instant reaction to news about the ark shows that the presence of God is paramount. His toppled chair, physical heaviness, and broken neck all testify that permissive, half-hearted obedience eventually meets decisive judgment. Yet even in this sobering scene, God is already positioning Samuel to guide Israel, proving that His purposes march on undeterred.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">He fell from off the seat backward.</span>--The compiler of these books was actuated by no feeling of friendship to the high priest Eli. In composing this history of the events which led to the elevation of Samuel to the judgeship, he simply puts together the materials he possessed of the records of these days, and gives us a vivid picture of the calamities of the rule of Eli. As he never spares his weakness, or attempts to veil his blind nepotism, we feel here the perfect truth of this touching incident which closed the old man's life. He loved the Ark, because of its close connection with his God, better, after all, than his two sons. We have seen already that he could bear the stern announcement of the ruin and degradation of the fortune of his proud house, for which he toiled only too faithfully; he could bear to see another--the boy Samuel--preferred before him, the high priest and judge of Israel; he could endure to hear of the defeat and ruin of the country over which he had so long ruled, and which he loved so well; even the news of the death of his sons he could listen to with sad resignation; but when his ears caught the words "the ark of God is taken," the old man s heart broke, and he died. The chronicler of this period, who certainly never favoured Eli, leaves upon us the impression that with all his faults and imperfections he was still a servant of God. Wordsworth quotes here <a href="/context/psalms/137-5.htm" title="If I forget you, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.">Psalm 137:5-6</a> : "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget <span class= "ital">her cunning. </span>If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: <span class= "ital">if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy."</span>--The dying words of Archbishop Whitgift were, "<span class= "ital">Pro ecclesils Dei,"--"</span>For the church of God."<p><span class= "bld">And he had judged Israel forty years.</span>--"When I read of Eli the priest, of the sons of Aaron, judging Israel forty years, and of Samuel, certainly a Levite, though not a priest, going circuit as a judge itinerant in Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/7-16.htm" title="And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.">1Samuel 7:16</a>), and of others of the families of Levi appointed by King David to be judges and officers, not only in all the business of the Lord, but also for the outward business of Israel (<a href="/2_samuel/15-35.htm" title="And have you not there with you Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever you shall hear out of the king's house, you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.">2Samuel 15:35</a>; <a href="/context/1_chronicles/26-29.htm" title="Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward business over Israel, for officers and judges.">1Chronicles 26:29-32</a>)--when I observe in the Church stories, ever since the world had Christian princes, how ecclesiastical persons have been employed by their sovereigns in their weightiest consultations and affairs of state, I cannot but wonder at those who inveigh against courts, power, jurisdiction, and the temporalities of bishops and other ecclesiastical persons. I speak it not to justify abuses of men, but to justify the lawfulness of the tiling."--Bishop Sanderson, quoted by Wordsworth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - At this last sad news the old man's spirit failed; and though it was his own want of a firm sense of duty that had prepared the way for this sad ruin of his country, yet we cannot but respect his deep attachment and reverent love for the symbol of his faith. The rest he could have borne; but that the ark of God, especially intrusted to his care, was now captive in heathen hands was a calamity that broke his heart. <span class="cmt_word">He had judged Israel forty years.</span> The Septuagint reads <span class="accented">twenty</span>, but these differences in numbers occur constantly. In either case he would have been well advanced in years before he reached the judgeship, and probably he attained to it slowly; not by one great act, but by the qualities of a statesman, by which he lightened the yoke of the Philistines, and rendered the people for a long time a match for them in war. His character is not that of a hero, but of a wise, patient, and prudent ruler, but one whose good qualities were spoiled at last by his weak partiality for his unworthy sons. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/1_samuel/4-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">As soon as</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1438;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
