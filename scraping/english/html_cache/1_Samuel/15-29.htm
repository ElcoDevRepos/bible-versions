The term "Glory of Israel" highlights God's unique relationship with Israel as their divine protector and leader. In the Old Testament, God's glory is often associated with His presence and power, as seen in the tabernacle and the temple (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-35</a>, <a href="/1_kings/8-10.htm">1 Kings 8:10-11</a>). This title underscores God's sovereignty and His role as the ultimate authority over Israel.<p><b>does not lie</b><br>God's nature is fundamentally truthful and reliable. Unlike humans, who are prone to deceit, God embodies truth (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>). This assurance of God's truthfulness is a recurring theme in Scripture, providing a foundation for trust in His promises and commands. The Bible consistently portrays God as faithful and unchanging in His word (<a href="/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a>, <a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>).<p><b>or change His mind</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's immutability, meaning He does not change His nature or decisions capriciously. While there are instances in Scripture where God appears to "relent" (such as in <a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>), these are understood as part of His sovereign plan and consistent with His character. God's purposes are eternal and unalterable (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm">Malachi 3:6</a>, <a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><b>for He is not a man</b><br>This highlights the distinction between God and humanity. Humans are finite, fallible, and subject to change, whereas God is infinite, perfect, and constant. This distinction is crucial in understanding the nature of God as transcendent and wholly other, yet also immanent and involved in His creation (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><b>that He should change His mind.</b><br>Reiterating the previous point, this phrase underscores God's steadfastness. In the context of <a href="/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>, it contrasts with Saul's disobedience and the resulting divine judgment. God's decisions are based on His perfect wisdom and justice, and He remains consistent in His dealings with humanity. This assurance of God's unchanging nature is a source of comfort and confidence for believers, as seen in the fulfillment of His promises through Jesus Christ (<a href="/hebrews/13-8.htm">Hebrews 13:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samuel.htm">Samuel</a></b><br>A prophet and judge of Israel who anointed Saul as king and later conveyed God's message of rejection to him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/saul.htm">Saul</a></b><br>The first king of Israel, whose disobedience to God's command led to his rejection as king.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_glory_of_israel.htm">The Glory of Israel</a></b><br>A title for God, emphasizing His majesty, faithfulness, and unchanging nature.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/amalekites.htm">Amalekites</a></b><br>A people whom God commanded Saul to completely destroy as a judgment for their past sins against Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilgal.htm">Gilgal</a></b><br>The location where Samuel confronted Saul about his disobedience and delivered God's message of rejection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_unchanging_nature.htm">God's Unchanging Nature</a></b><br>God's character and promises are consistent and reliable.

Saul&#8217;s lost kingdom and our secure salvation alike rest on this same immovable foundation: God does not lie, and He never changes His mind.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/1_samuel/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">The Strength of Israel will not lie.</span>--This title of the Eternal, here rendered "the Strength of Israel," would be better rendered <span class= "ital">the Changeless One of Israel. </span>The Hebrew word is first found in this passage. In later Hebrew, as in <a href="/1_chronicles/29-2.htm" title="Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.">1Chronicles 29:2</a>, it is rendered "glory," from the Aramaean usage of speech (Keil). Some, less accurately, would translate it here "The Victory," or "the Triumph of Israel," will not lie, &c. In the eleventh verse of this chapter we read of the Eternal saying, "<span class= "ital">It repenteth me </span>that I have set up Saul to be king," while here we find how "the Changeless One (or Strength) of Israel <span class= "ital">will . . .</span> <span class= "ital">not repent." </span>The truth is that with God there is no change. <span class= "ital">Now </span>He approves of men and their works and days, and promises them rich blessings; <span class= "ital">now </span>He condemns and punishes the ways and actions of the same men; hence He is said "to repent:" but the change springs alone from a change in the men themselves, not in God. Speaking in human language the Lord is said "to repent" because there was what appeared to be a change in the Eternal counsels.<p>"One instrument," well says Dean Payne Smith, "may be laid aside, and another chosen (as was the case of Saul), because God ordains that the instruments by which He works shall be beings endowed with free will." So God in the case of King Saul--in human language--was said to repent of His choice because, owing to Saul's deliberate choice of evil, the Divine purposes could not in his case be carried out. Predictions and promises in the Scriptures are never absolute, but are always conditional. Still, God is ever the "Changeless One of Israel." "The counsel of the Lord stands for ever" (<a href="/psalms/33-11.htm" title="The counsel of the LORD stands for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.">Psalm 33:11</a>). "I am Jehovah; I change not" (<a href="/malachi/3-6.htm" title="For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore you sons of Jacob are not consumed.">Malachi 3:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/1_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Strength</span> - better, as in the margin, the Victory or Triumph - <span class="cmt_word">of Israel.</span> He who is Israel's Victory, or He in whom Israel has victory, will not repent. In ver. 11 God was said to repent, because there was what appeared to be a change in the Divine counsels. "God gave Israel a king in his anger, and took him away in his wrath" (<a href="/hosea/13-11.htm">Hosea 13:11</a>). But such modes of speaking are in condescension to human weakness. Absolutely with God there is no change. He is the Eternal Present, with whom all things that were, and are, and shall be are one. But even looked at from below, as this finite creature man looks at his Maker's acts, there is no change in the Divine counsels, because, amidst all the vicissitudes of human events, God's will moves calmly forward without let or hindrance. No lower or secondary motives influence him, no rival power thwarts him. One instrument may be laid aside, and another chosen, because God ordains that the instruments by which he works shall be beings endowed with free will. Saul was the very counterpart of the Jewish people - highly endowed with noble qualities, but headstrong, self-willed, disobedient. Nevertheless, he laid the foundation for the throne of David, who in so many points was the ideal of the theocratic king; and Israel in like manner prepared the way for the coming of the true Messianic King, and gave mankind the one Catholic, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> universal, religion.
