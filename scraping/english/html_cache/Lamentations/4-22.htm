The "punishment" mentioned is the Babylonian exile, a consequence of the nation's persistent idolatry and disobedience to God. The completion of this punishment signifies God's mercy and the end of a period of divine discipline. This reflects the covenant relationship where God disciplines but also restores His people, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/30.htm">Deuteronomy 30:1-3</a>, where God promises to bring back the exiles once they return to Him.<p><b>He will not prolong your exile.</b><br>The assurance that the exile will not be prolonged is a promise of hope and restoration. Historically, the Babylonian exile lasted 70 years, as prophesied by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>). This period was a time of purification and reflection for the Israelites, leading to a renewed commitment to the covenant. The return from exile is a type of the ultimate redemption found in Christ, who delivers believers from the bondage of sin.<p><b>But He will punish your iniquity, O Daughter of Edom;</b><br>Edom, descendants of Esau, often acted as adversaries to Israel. The "iniquity" refers to Edom's actions against Judah during the Babylonian invasion, where they rejoiced over Jerusalem's downfall (<a href="/obadiah/1-10.htm">Obadiah 1:10-14</a>). This phrase indicates divine justice, as Edom's betrayal and hostility will not go unpunished. The judgment against Edom is a reminder of God's sovereignty and justice over all nations, not just Israel.<p><b>He will expose your sins.</b><br>The exposure of Edom's sins signifies God's omniscience and the inevitability of divine judgment. This exposure is not just a revelation of wrongdoing but a call to accountability. In a broader biblical context, this reflects the principle that all hidden things will be brought to light (<a href="/luke/8-17.htm">Luke 8:17</a>). It serves as a warning that God's justice is impartial and comprehensive, ultimately fulfilled in the final judgment through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughter_of_zion.htm">Daughter of Zion</a></b><br>This term refers to the people of Jerusalem or the inhabitants of Judah. It is a poetic way of personifying the city and its people, often used to express God's relationship with them.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughter_of_edom.htm">Daughter of Edom</a></b><br>Edom represents the descendants of Esau, Jacob's brother, and is often seen as an adversary to Israel. In this context, Edom symbolizes those who rejoice over Judah's downfall.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/punishment_and_exile.htm">Punishment and Exile</a></b><br>The verse speaks of the end of Judah's punishment and exile, indicating a period of suffering due to their sins, which God allowed as a form of discipline.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/iniquity_and_sin.htm">Iniquity and Sin</a></b><br>These terms refer to moral wrongdoing and rebellion against God. The verse contrasts the completed punishment of Zion with the impending judgment on Edom for their sins.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god's_justice.htm">God's Justice</a></b><br>The event of God punishing Edom while completing Zion's punishment highlights His justice and sovereignty over nations.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_discipline_is_temporary.htm">God's Discipline is Temporary</a></b><br>God's discipline, though painful, is not eternal.
