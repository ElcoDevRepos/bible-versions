In the ancient Near East, jackals were often seen as scavengers and symbols of desolation (<a href="/isaiah/34-13.htm">Isaiah 34:13</a>). Despite their reputation, they fulfill their maternal duties, emphasizing the severity of the situation in Jerusalem. The comparison underscores the unnatural behavior of the people of Jerusalem during the siege, as they fail to provide for their children. This reflects the dire circumstances and the breakdown of societal norms due to the Babylonian conquest.<p><b>but the daughter of my people has become cruel</b><br>The "daughter of my people" refers to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, personified as a woman. The use of "daughter" is a common biblical metaphor for cities or nations (<a href="/isaiah/1-8.htm">Isaiah 1:8</a>). The cruelty mentioned here is a result of extreme famine and suffering during the Babylonian siege, leading to desperate actions (<a href="/lamentations/2-20.htm">Lamentations 2:20</a>). This phrase indicates a moral and spiritual decline, contrasting with the expected nurturing nature of a mother. It serves as a lament over the loss of compassion and humanity among God's chosen people.<p><b>like an ostrich in the wilderness</b><br>Ostriches are known for their perceived neglect of their eggs, as mentioned in <a href="/job/39-13.htm">Job 39:13-17</a>, where they are described as lacking wisdom and understanding. In the wilderness, an ostrich might leave its eggs vulnerable, symbolizing neglect and abandonment. This comparison illustrates the unnatural and harsh behavior of the people of Jerusalem, who, in their desperation, have become indifferent to the needs of their children. The wilderness setting further emphasizes isolation and desolation, mirroring the spiritual and physical state of Jerusalem during its destruction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Lamentations, Jeremiah is known as the "weeping prophet" who lamented the destruction of Jerusalem and the suffering of his people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city that faced destruction and devastation, leading to the lamentations expressed in this book.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_daughter_of_my_people.htm">The Daughter of My People</a></b><br>A poetic term referring to the people of Jerusalem or Judah, highlighting their collective identity and suffering.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jackals.htm">Jackals</a></b><br>Wild animals known for their scavenging nature, yet even they are depicted as caring for their young, contrasting with the behavior of the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/ostriches.htm">Ostriches</a></b><br>Known in ancient times for their perceived neglect of their eggs, used here as a metaphor for the cruelty and neglect of the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_depth_of_human_depravity.htm">The Depth of Human Depravity</a></b><br>The verse highlights the extent of human depravity and the unnatural behavior that can result from severe judgment and suffering.

Here, the prophet points to a creature people would normally regard as fierce, showing it still cares for its offspring.<p>&#8226; The point: if such an untamed animal displays parental compassion, how much more should God&#8217;s covenant people, who have received His law of love (<a href="/leviticus/19-18.htm">Leviticus 19:18</a>), reflect that same heart?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but the daughter of my people</b><p>&#8226; Jeremiah shifts abruptly: &#8220;but the daughter of my people&#8230;&#8221; The phrase identifies Jerusalem, Zion, Israel in covenant terms (<a href="/jeremiah/6-2.htm">Jeremiah 6:2</a>; <a href="/lamentations/2-13.htm">Lamentations 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Daughter&#8221; evokes familial intimacy; the prophet is grieving over his own family. This is not a detached lament&#8212;it is a brokenhearted acknowledgement that those closest to him, once called to be &#8220;a kingdom of priests&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>), are now unrecognizable.<p>&#8226; By using &#8220;my people,&#8221; Jeremiah includes himself in the sorrow. He does not preach from a distance; he mourns as part of the community under judgment (<a href="/lamentations/3-40.htm">Lamentations 3:40&#8211;42</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>has become cruel</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Has become cruel&#8221;&#8212;the Hebrew idea is a hardening, a loss of natural affection. The siege of Jerusalem (<a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1&#8211;3</a>) had driven mothers to unimaginable extremes, fulfilling earlier warnings: &#8220;You will eat the fruit of your womb&#8230; in the distress your enemy will inflict on you&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53</a>, also echoed in <a href="/lamentations/2-20.htm">Lamentations 2:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Sin erodes compassion. What began as covenant unfaithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/2-13.htm">Jeremiah 2:13</a>) now shows itself in merciless behavior. The people once called to &#8220;do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly&#8221; (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>) have instead mirrored the cruelty they allowed in their society (<a href="/jeremiah/7-5.htm">Jeremiah 7:5&#8211;6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>like an ostrich in the wilderness</b><p>&#8226; The ostrich is the biblical symbol of neglectful motherhood. <a href="/job/39-14.htm">Job 39:14-16</a> notes that she &#8220;abandons her eggs on the ground&#8230; forgets that a foot may crush them&#8230; She treats her young harshly, as if they were not hers.&#8221; By comparing Israel to an ostrich, Jeremiah says the nation has lost the most basic instinct to protect her young.<p>&#8226; &#8220;In the wilderness&#8221; amplifies the image&#8212;an open, threatening environment where carelessness guarantees death. Israel has placed her children in peril through spiritual adultery (<a href="/ezekiel/16-20.htm">Ezekiel 16:20-21</a>) and now through literal starvation.<p>&#8226; The contrast is striking: jackals nurture; Israel, called to reflect God&#8217;s steadfast love (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>), behaves worse than creatures renowned for indifference.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/lamentations/4-3.htm">Lamentations 4:3</a> layers vivid contrasts to expose Israel&#8217;s spiritual collapse. Wild jackals nurse their pups, yet God&#8217;s covenant &#8220;daughter&#8221; withholds compassion. Prolonged rebellion has hardened hearts until they resemble the neglectful ostrich, abandoning offspring in a barren wilderness. The verse stands as a sober reminder that when a people turn from God&#8217;s Word, even the most natural expressions of love can shrivel, but His standards of care and covenant faithfulness never change.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/lamentations/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Even the sea monsters . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">jackals. </span>The Authorised Version is intended apparently to apply to cetaceous mammals; elsewhere (<a href="/jeremiah/14-6.htm" title="And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there was no grass.">Jeremiah 14:6</a>) the word is rendered "dragons."

A like reference to the seeming want of maternal instinct in the ostrich is found in <a href="/job/39-16.htm" title="She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not her's: her labor is in vain without fear;">Job 39:16</a>. The comparison was obviously suggested by facts like those referred to in <a href="/lamentations/2-20.htm" title="Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom you have done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord?">Lamentations 2:20</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The sea monsters;</span> rather, <span class="accented">the jackals</span> (<span class="accented">tannin</span>, the Aramaic form of the plural for <span class="accented">tannim</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.</span> So in Job (<a href="/job/39-14.htm">Job 39:14-16</a>) it is said of the ostrich that she "leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust, and forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them. She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers." The description is literally true, if we add a detail not mentioned by the sacred poet. The eggs destined for hatching are deposited in a nest hole scratched in the sand, but there are other eggs laid, not in the sand, but near it, to all appearance forsaken. These eggs, however, are not exposed in simple stupidity, though they do often fall victims to violence.
