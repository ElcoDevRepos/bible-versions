The "terrors" can be understood as the invading armies and the resulting chaos. This aligns with the covenant curses found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-25.htm">Deuteronomy 28:25</a>, where God warns Israel of the consequences of disobedience. The phrase also echoes the lament in <a href="/psalms/31-13.htm">Psalm 31:13</a>, where David speaks of terror on every side, highlighting a recurring theme of divine judgment throughout the Scriptures.<p><b>as for the day of an appointed feast</b><br>The comparison to an "appointed feast" is ironic, as feasts were typically times of joy and celebration in Israel. Here, it underscores the severity and inevitability of the judgment, as if the destruction was as certain as a scheduled festival. This reflects the reversal of fortunes prophesied in <a href="/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>, where joyous feasts would turn into mourning. The appointed feasts were central to Israel's worship and identity, making their subversion a profound symbol of divine displeasure.<p><b>In the day of the LORD&#8217;s anger</b><br>This phrase indicates a specific time of divine wrath, often referred to as "the day of the LORD" in prophetic literature. It signifies a period when God actively intervenes in history to execute judgment. This concept is prevalent in books like Isaiah and Joel, where the day of the LORD is depicted as both a time of judgment and future hope. The historical context here is the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC, a fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by Jeremiah and others.<p><b>no one escaped or survived</b><br>The totality of the destruction is emphasized here, indicating that the judgment was comprehensive and inescapable. This reflects the fulfillment of prophecies such as those in <a href="/jeremiah/11-11.htm">Jeremiah 11:11</a>, where God declares that disaster will come upon the people, and they will not be able to escape. The phrase underscores the seriousness of divine judgment and the consequences of persistent disobedience.<p><b>my enemy has destroyed those I nurtured and reared</b><br>This lament highlights the personal and communal loss experienced by the prophet and the people. The "enemy" refers to the Babylonians, who were used as instruments of God's judgment. The nurturing and rearing suggest a deep, parental care for the people, akin to God's relationship with Israel as depicted in <a href="/hosea/11.htm">Hosea 11:1-4</a>. The destruction of those nurtured signifies the breaking of familial and societal bonds, a poignant reminder of the cost of turning away from God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Lamentations, Jeremiah is known as the "weeping prophet" who lamented the destruction of Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The city that faced destruction and devastation, central to the lament in this chapter.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>- The sovereign God whose anger is depicted as the cause of the calamity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_enemy.htm">The Enemy</a></b><br>- Represents the Babylonian forces that besieged and destroyed Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_survivors.htm">The Survivors</a></b><br>- The people of Jerusalem who faced destruction and captivity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>The destruction of Jerusalem serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.

God &#8220;summons&#8221; enemies as easily as He once summoned worshipers to celebrate.<p>&#8226; <a href="/zephaniah/1-7.htm">Zephaniah 1:7</a> draws the same contrast: &#8220;The LORD has prepared a sacrifice; He has consecrated His guests.&#8221; Here, those &#8220;guests&#8221; are invading armies.<p>&#8226; The twist shocks the reader: the calendar that once marked seasons of gladness now marks devastation, highlighting how sin reverses blessing into curse.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the day of the LORD&#8217;s anger no one escaped or survived</b><p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;day of the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a>; <a href="/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1</a>) typically signals decisive, visible judgment. Lamentations presents the historical fulfillment of that warning in 586 BC.<p>&#8226; &#8220;No one escaped&#8221; recalls <a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a> where God declares, &#8220;there is no one who can deliver out of My hand.&#8221; The totality of loss validates the covenant warnings (<a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-39</a>).<p>&#8226; The statement also exposes false hopes in alliances, walls, or rituals. When divine wrath is active, human defenses crumble (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>My enemy has destroyed those I nurtured and reared</b><p>&#8226; Jerusalem speaks as a bereaved mother. The children she &#8220;nurtured and reared&#8221; are gone (<a href="/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>). This image intensifies the grief: destruction is not abstract; it is personal.<p>&#8226; God allowed Babylon&#8212;the &#8220;enemy&#8221;&#8212;to become the rod of correction (<a href="/jeremiah/25-9.htm">Jeremiah 25:9</a>). What seems like enemy victory is ultimately divine discipline.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1-7</a> shows the same heartbreaking reversal: the One who taught Israel to walk must let them fall because they refused to return.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/lamentations/2-22.htm">Lamentations 2:22</a> paints a sobering picture of Jerusalem&#8217;s fall. God Himself summons comprehensive terror, overturns festival joy into a grim convocation, unleashes a day in which no one escapes, and permits enemies to destroy the very people He once nurtured. The verse affirms the faithfulness of God&#8217;s covenant warnings: persistent sin brings certain judgment. Yet by recording this tragedy, Scripture also invites repentance and renewed trust in the Lord whose discipline, though severe, aims ultimately at restoration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/lamentations/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">Thou hast called . . .</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">Thou hast summoned, as for a solemn feast-day. </span>(Comp. <a href="/lamentations/1-15.htm" title="The LORD has trodden under foot all my mighty men in the middle of me: he has called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the LORD has trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a wine press.">Lamentations 1:15</a>.)
