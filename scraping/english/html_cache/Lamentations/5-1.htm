The use of "remember" here is not suggesting that God forgets, but rather it is a call for God to act on behalf of His people. The historical context is the aftermath of the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 586 BC, a time of immense suffering and loss for the Israelites. This phrase reflects the communal lament and the desire for divine intervention. Theologically, it underscores the belief in God's sovereignty and His ability to restore and redeem His people.<p><b>Look and see our disgrace!</b><br>The call for God to "look and see" is an appeal for divine attention and compassion. This reflects the deep sense of shame and humiliation experienced by the Israelites due to their defeat and exile. In the cultural context of the ancient Near East, disgrace was not only a personal experience but also a communal one, affecting the entire nation. The phrase echoes similar cries found in other lament psalms (<a href="/psalms/25-18.htm">Psalm 25:18</a>, <a href="/psalms/44-24.htm">Psalm 44:24</a>). Theologically, it highlights the human condition of sin and the resulting separation from God, pointing to the need for repentance and restoration. This can also be seen as a type of Christ, who bore the ultimate disgrace on the cross for the redemption of humanity (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>- Traditionally attributed as the author of Lamentations, Jeremiah is known as the "weeping prophet."

(<a href="/lamentations/5-1.htm">Lamentations 5:1</a>)<p>&#8226; The speaker appeals directly to God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness, trusting He &#8220;does not forget the cry of the afflicted&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/9-12.htm">Psalm 9:12</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Remember&#8221; is not a reminder for God&#8217;s memory but a plea for Him to act, as He did when He &#8220;remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/2-24.htm">Exodus 2:24</a>).<p>&#8226; This opening word affirms that even in national collapse, God remains personal and approachable&#8212;He invites His people to turn to Him (<a href="/jeremiah/33-3.htm">Jeremiah 33:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse therefore teaches that prayer begins with confidence in God&#8217;s attentive character, echoing the psalmist: &#8220;Remember me, LORD, when You show favor to Your people&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/106-4.htm">Psalm 106:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what has happened to us</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;what has happened to us.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The people rehearse the reality of their present suffering, just as David laid out his distress before God (<a href="/psalms/142-2.htm">Psalm 142:2</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word encourages honest lament; withholding nothing acknowledges that He already knows every circumstance (<a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29&#8211;31</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming &#8220;what has happened,&#8221; they confirm that divine discipline does not sever relationship; instead, it brings correction with purpose, as <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a> explains.<p>&#8226; This clause also reminds future readers that historical judgment on Judah was literal (<a href="/bsb/2_kings/25.htm">2 Kings 25</a>), underscoring Scripture&#8217;s accuracy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Look and see</b><p>&#8220;Look and see&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The request for God to &#8220;look&#8221; mirrors the cry of Hagar: &#8220;You are the God who sees me&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/16-13.htm">Genesis 16:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often joins God&#8217;s seeing with His saving action&#8212;when He &#8220;saw&#8221; Israel&#8217;s misery, He sent Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Asking God to look expresses confidence that His gaze brings mercy, anticipating Christ who &#8220;saw the crowds and had compassion&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers today can pray with the same boldness, knowing &#8220;the eyes of the LORD are on the righteous&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/3-12.htm">1 Peter 3:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>our disgrace</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;our disgrace!&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Disgrace&#8221; recognizes the shame that sin and judgment have produced, fulfilling warnings such as <a href="/deuteronomy/28-37.htm">Deuteronomy 28:37</a>.<p>&#8226; Lamentations consistently links disgrace to covenant unfaithfulness; yet even shame can invite restoration when confessed (<a href="/psalms/25-2.htm">Psalm 25:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Admitting disgrace shifts focus from self-pity to God&#8217;s honor&#8212;pleading that His reputation be vindicated by redeeming His people (<a href="/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; This humility prepares hearts for the ultimate lifting of shame through Christ, who &#8220;endured the cross, despising its shame&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/lamentations/5-1.htm">Lamentations 5:1</a> models a prayer that joins reverent confidence with honest confession. By asking God to remember, look, and see, Judah affirms His covenant loyalty while owning the disgrace wrought by sin. The verse invites every generation to bring its deepest sorrows to the Lord who sees, remembers, and is ready to act in steadfast love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/lamentations/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>V.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Remember, O Lord.</span>--The fact that the number of verses is, as in Lamentations 1, 2, 4, the same as that of the Hebrew alphabet suggests the inference that this chapter also, though not actually alphabetic, was intended to have been so, and that we have the last of the five elegies in a half-finished state. It would seem as if Jeremiah first wrote freely what was in his mind, and then set to work as an artist to bring it under the alphabetic scheme. This chapter, it may be stated, has more the character of a prayer than any other, and the prayer begins with recapitulating the woes of Judah as a ground for the compassion of Jehovah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-18.</span> - INSULT UPON INSULT HAS BEEN HEAPED UPON JERUSALEM. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/lamentations/5-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Remember,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1456;&#1499;&#1465;&#1444;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#601;&#183;&#7733;&#333;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2142.htm">Strong's 2142: </a> </span><span class="str2">To mark, to remember, to mention,   to be male</span><br /><br /><span class="word">O LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1492;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">what</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1462;&#1469;&#1492;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(meh-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4100.htm">Strong's 4100: </a> </span><span class="str2">What?, what!, indefinitely what</span><br /><br /><span class="word">has happened to us.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1443;&#1497;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;y&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1961.htm">Strong's 1961: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fall out, come to pass, become, be</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Look</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1496;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hab&#183;b&#238;&#183;&#7789;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Imperative - masculine singular &#124; third person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5027.htm">Strong's 5027: </a> </span><span class="str2">To scan, look intently at, to regard</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and see</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1445;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">our disgrace!</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1462;&#1512;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1464;&#1514;&#1461;&#1469;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;er&#183;p&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#234;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2781.htm">Strong's 2781: </a> </span><span class="str2">Contumely, disgrace, the pudenda</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/lamentations/5-1.htm">Lamentations 5:1 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/lamentations/5-1.htm">Lamentations 5:1 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/lamentations/5-1.htm">Lamentations 5:1 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/lamentations/5-1.htm">Lamentations 5:1 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/lamentations/5-1.htm">Lamentations 5:1 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/lamentations/5-1.htm">Lamentations 5:1  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/lamentations/5-1.htm">Lamentations 5:1 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/lamentations/5-1.htm">Lamentations 5:1 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/lamentations/5-1.htm">Lamentations 5:1 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/lamentations/5-1.htm">Lamentations 5:1 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/lamentations/5-1.htm">OT Prophets: Lamentations 5:1 Remember Yahweh what has come on us: (Lam.
