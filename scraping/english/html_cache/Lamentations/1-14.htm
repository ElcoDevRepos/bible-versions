In biblical times, a yoke represented oppression and servitude. The transgressions of the people of Judah have become a binding force, leading to their subjugation. This reflects the consequences of sin as described in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>, where disobedience results in serving enemies under a yoke of iron.<p><b>Knit together by His hand</b><br>The phrase indicates that God Himself has allowed these transgressions to become a burden. It suggests divine sovereignty and judgment, where God permits the natural consequences of sin to take effect. This aligns with the biblical principle that God disciplines those He loves (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>), using circumstances to bring about repentance and restoration.<p><b>They are draped over my neck</b><br>The imagery of sins being draped over the neck emphasizes the inescapable and personal nature of the burden. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the neck was often associated with submission and vulnerability. This phrase highlights the personal responsibility and the weight of guilt that cannot be easily shrugged off, reminiscent of <a href="/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22</a>, where the wicked are ensnared by their own sins.<p><b>And the Lord has broken my strength</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the result of sin: the loss of strength and vitality. The breaking of strength can be seen as a fulfillment of the curses for disobedience found in <a href="/leviticus/26-19.htm">Leviticus 26:19</a>, where God promises to break the pride of power. It reflects the spiritual and physical depletion that comes from living in rebellion against God.<p><b>He has delivered me into the hands of those I cannot withstand</b><br>This phrase speaks to the historical context of the Babylonian exile, where Judah was delivered into the hands of the Babylonians, a powerful enemy they could not resist. It echoes the warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah, who foretold of the coming judgment due to persistent sin (<a href="/jeremiah/21-7.htm">Jeremiah 21:7</a>). This also serves as a type of Christ, who, though sinless, was delivered into the hands of His enemies, fulfilling God's redemptive plan (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Lamentations, Jeremiah is known as the "weeping prophet" who lamented the destruction of Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The city that has been destroyed, symbolizing the spiritual and physical desolation of the people of Judah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord (Yahweh)</a></b><br>- The sovereign God who, in His justice, has allowed the consequences of sin to manifest in the destruction and captivity of His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_enemies.htm">The Enemies</a></b><br>- Representing the Babylonian forces that have overtaken Jerusalem, symbolizing the instruments of God's judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_judah.htm">The People of Judah</a></b><br>- The recipients of the lament, who are experiencing the consequences of their collective sin and rebellion against God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_weight_of_sin.htm">The Weight of Sin</a></b><br>Sin is not just a personal failing but a burden that affects our relationship with God and others.

In Jeremiah&#8217;s day the literal yoke was an instrument of slavery (<a href="/jeremiah/28-13.htm">Jeremiah 28:13-14</a>). Just as the Lord warned in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-47.htm">Deuteronomy 28:47-48</a>, disobedience would lead to serving enemies &#8220;under an iron yoke.&#8221;<p>&#8226; A yoke always joins the wearer to another power. Here it fastens the nation to the consequences of its own rebellion, fulfilling <a href="/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a>, &#8220;For my iniquities have overwhelmed me; they are a burden too heavy to bear&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The image invites personal reflection: every trespass I choose adds weight to the harness until I can no longer pretend I am free (<a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>knit together by His hand</b><p>&#8226; Nothing about this judgment is random.
