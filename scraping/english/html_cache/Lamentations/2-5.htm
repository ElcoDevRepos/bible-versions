Historically, the Israelites understood God as their protector and ally, but due to their persistent disobedience and idolatry, God allowed their enemies to triumph over them. This is reminiscent of <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where blessings and curses are outlined based on Israel's obedience or disobedience. The imagery of God as an enemy underscores the severity of their situation and the depth of their estrangement from Him.<p><b>He has swallowed up Israel.</b><br>The term "swallowed up" conveys total destruction and consumption, similar to how the earth swallowed Korah and his followers in <a href="/numbers/16-32.htm">Numbers 16:32</a>. This reflects the complete devastation of the Northern Kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians in 722 BC and serves as a warning to Judah. The imagery suggests an overwhelming force that leaves nothing behind, emphasizing the totality of God's judgment.<p><b>He has swallowed up all her palaces and destroyed her strongholds.</b><br>Palaces and strongholds symbolize security, wealth, and power. Their destruction signifies the loss of national pride and protection. Archaeological evidence from sites like Lachish shows the extent of destruction during the Babylonian invasions. This phrase highlights the futility of relying on human strength and fortifications instead of God, echoing the warnings of prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>He has multiplied mourning and lamentation for the Daughter of Judah.</b><br>The "Daughter of Judah" is a poetic term for the people of Judah, emphasizing their vulnerability and the personal nature of their suffering. Mourning and lamentation are expressions of profound grief, often associated with death and loss. This reflects the cultural practices of the time, where public displays of mourning were common. The phrase connects to the broader theme of Lamentations, which is a book of sorrow and repentance, urging the people to turn back to God amidst their suffering.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who is depicted as acting in judgment against His people due to their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The northern kingdom, representing the people of God who have faced divine judgment.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughter_of_judah.htm">Daughter of Judah</a></b><br>A poetic term for the southern kingdom of Judah, emphasizing its vulnerability and suffering.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/palaces_and_strongholds.htm">Palaces and Strongholds</a></b><br>Symbols of security and power that have been destroyed, indicating the totality of the devastation.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mourning_and_lamentation.htm">Mourning and Lamentation</a></b><br>The emotional and communal response to the destruction and suffering experienced by the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_judgment.htm">Understanding Divine Judgment</a></b><br>Recognize that God's judgment is a response to persistent disobedience and sin.

The verse stands as a sober reminder: sin carries real consequences, God&#8217;s judgments are just, and true security lies only in humble obedience to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/lamentations/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Her palaces: . . . his strong holds . . .</span>--The change of gender is remarkable, probably rising from the fact that the writer thought of the "palaces" in connection with the "daughters of Zion," and of the "strong holds" in connection with the land or people. A like combination is found in <a href="/hosea/8-14.htm" title="For Israel has forgotten his Maker, and builds temples; and Judah has multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire on his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.">Hosea 8:14</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Mourning and lamentation.</span>--The two Hebrew nouns are formed from the same root, and have an assonance like "the sorrow and sighing" of <a href="/isaiah/35-10.htm" title="And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy on their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.">Isaiah 35:10</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was as an enemy: he hath swallowed,</span> etc. The threefold division of the verse is, unfortunately, concealed in the Authorized Version, owing to the arbitrary stopping. The grouping suggested by the Massoretic text is - <p><span class="accented">"The Lord is become an enemy, he hath swallowed up Israel;<br />He hath swallowed up all her palaces, he hath destroyed all his strongholds;<br />And hath increased in the daughter of Judah moaning and bemoaning."</span> The change of gender in the second line is easily explicable. In the first case the poet is thinking of the city; in the second, of the people of Israel. The rendering "moaning and bemoaning" is designed to reproduce, to some extent, the Hebrew phrase, in which two words, derived from the same root, and almost exactly the same, are placed side by side, to give a more intense expression to the idea. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/lamentations/2-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The Lord</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1491;&#1465;&#1504;&#1464;&#1444;&#1497;
