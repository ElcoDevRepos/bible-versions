The comparison to a "garden booth" suggests something temporary and fragile, highlighting the vulnerability of what was once considered a permanent and sacred structure. The tabernacle, originally a mobile sanctuary during the Israelites' wilderness journey, symbolizes God's presence among His people. The destruction signifies a severe judgment and the withdrawal of divine presence. This imagery echoes the temporary nature of human constructs compared to God's eternal nature.<p><b>He has destroyed His place of meeting.</b><br>The "place of meeting" refers to the temple in Jerusalem, where God met with His people through sacrifices and worship. Its destruction was a devastating blow to the Israelites, as it represented the loss of direct communion with God. Historically, this occurred during the Babylonian siege and destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. Theologically, it signifies the breaking of the covenant relationship due to the people's persistent disobedience. This event foreshadows the New Covenant, where Jesus becomes the ultimate meeting place between God and humanity.<p><b>The LORD has made Zion forget her appointed feasts and Sabbaths.</b><br>Zion, representing Jerusalem and the people of Israel, forgetting the feasts and Sabbaths indicates a loss of religious and cultural identity. These observances were central to Jewish life, serving as reminders of God's covenant and acts of deliverance. The cessation of these practices underscores the severity of God's judgment. This forgetfulness is not merely a lapse in memory but a consequence of the destruction and exile. It points to a spiritual desolation where the rhythms of worship and community life are disrupted.<p><b>In His fierce anger He has despised both king and priest.</b><br>The king and priest were pivotal figures in Israelite society, representing civil and religious authority. God's anger leading to their despising indicates a total upheaval of the established order. Historically, this reflects the failure of both the monarchy and the priesthood to lead the people in faithfulness to God. Theologically, it underscores the theme of accountability for leaders. This judgment prefigures the coming of Jesus Christ, who fulfills both roles perfectly as the King of Kings and the Great High Priest, establishing a new order based on righteousness and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who is depicted as executing judgment upon His people due to their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>A term often used to refer to Jerusalem, the city of God, which is central to Jewish worship and identity.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/tabernacle/place_of_meeting.htm">Tabernacle/Place of Meeting</a></b><br>Refers to the sacred space where God met with His people, symbolizing His presence among them.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/appointed_feasts_and_sabbaths.htm">Appointed Feasts and Sabbaths</a></b><br>These are the divinely instituted times of worship and rest, integral to the covenant relationship between God and Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/k/king_and_priest.htm">King and Priest</a></b><br>The leaders of Israel, representing both the political and spiritual authority, who are also affected by God's judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_disobedience.htm">The Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>God's judgment upon Israel serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of persistent disobedience and idolatry.

God&#8217;s judgment touched time itself, not just space.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In His fierce anger He has despised both king and priest</b><p>The last earthly pillars&#8212;royal and priestly leadership&#8212;crumbled under the same wrath.<p>&#8226; King Zedekiah was blinded and carried off (<a href="/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6-7</a>); priests were slaughtered or taken captive (<a href="/2_kings/25-18.htm">2 Kings 25:18-21</a>).<p>&#8226; By setting aside both offices, God exposed the failure of human mediators and rulers to keep His covenant (<a href="/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-2</a>; <a href="/lamentations/4-13.htm">Lamentations 4:13-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet the verse implicitly points forward: only a perfect King-Priest could finally satisfy divine justice (<a href="/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>; <a href="/hebrews/7-26.htm">Hebrews 7:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/lamentations/2-6.htm">Lamentations 2:6</a> paints a fourfold picture of judgment: the temple reduced to a makeshift booth, the sacred meeting place dismantled, the worship calendar silenced, and both throne and altar cast down. Each loss sprang from the Lord&#8217;s righteous anger toward persistent sin, proving that His covenant warnings were literal and sure. At the same time, the collapse of every earthly refuge prepared the way for the coming Messiah, the true Temple and eternal King-Priest, in whom God&#8217;s people would once again draw near and celebrate forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/lamentations/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">He hath violently taken away his tabernacle . . .</span>--The noun represents a "booth" or "shed," like those erected in the Feast of Tabernacles.

The destruction involved the non-observance of all such feasts, as well as of the sabbath. "King and priest," the two representatives of the nation's life (<a href="/jeremiah/33-21.htm" title="Then may also my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign on his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers.">Jeremiah 33:21</a>), were alike, as it seemed, rejected.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Violently taken away;</span> rather, <span class="accented">violently treated; i.e.</span> broken up. <span class="cmt_word">His tabarnacle;</span> rather, <span class="accented">his booth.</span> "Tent" and "dwelling" are interchangeable expressions (see ver. 4); and in the Psalms "booth" is used as a special poetic synonym for tent when God's earthly dwelling place, the sanctuary of the temple, is spoken of (so <a href="/psalms/27-5.htm">Psalm 27:5</a>; <a href="/psalms/31-20.htm">Psalm 31:20</a>; <a href="/psalms/76-2.htm">Psalm 76:2</a>). The Authorized Version, indeed, presumes an allusion to the proper meaning of the Hebrew word, as if the poet compared the sanctuary of Jehovah to a pleasure booth in a garden. It is, however, more natural to continue, <span class="accented">as a garden</span>, the sense of which will be clear from <a href="/psalms/80-12.htm">Psalm 80:12, 13</a>. The Septuagint has, instead, "as a vine" - a reading which differs from the Massoretic by having one letter more (<span class="accented">kaggefen</span> instead of <span class="accented">kaggan</span>). This ancient reading is adopted by Ewald, and harmonizes well with <a href="/isaiah/5-1.htm">Isaiah 5:1</a>, etc.; <a href="/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a> (comp. <a href="/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8</a>); but the received text gives a very good sense.
