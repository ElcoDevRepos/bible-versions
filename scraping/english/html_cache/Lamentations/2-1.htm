The imagery of a cloud signifies divine displeasure and obscurity, contrasting with the protective cloud that guided Israel in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a>). The "cloud of His anger" suggests a temporary but severe judgment, emphasizing God's holiness and justice. Historically, this refers to the Babylonian siege and destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC, a pivotal event in Jewish history. Theologically, it underscores the consequences of Israel's covenant unfaithfulness, as warned by prophets like Jeremiah and Isaiah.<p><b>He has cast the glory of Israel from heaven to earth.</b><br>The "glory of Israel" can be understood as the presence of God, symbolized by the Ark of the Covenant and the Temple, which were central to Israel's identity and worship. The phrase indicates a dramatic fall from divine favor and protection, akin to the lament in <a href="/1_samuel/4-21.htm">1 Samuel 4:21-22</a> when the Ark was captured. This casting down signifies the loss of divine presence and blessing, a theme echoed in Ezekiel's vision of God's glory departing from the Temple (Ezekiel 10). It serves as a reminder of the consequences of idolatry and disobedience.<p><b>He has abandoned His footstool in the day of His anger.</b><br>The "footstool" refers to the Temple in Jerusalem, considered God's earthly dwelling place (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-2.htm">1 Chronicles 28:2</a>, <a href="/psalms/132-7.htm">Psalm 132:7</a>). Abandonment here signifies God's withdrawal of His presence and protection, leaving the city vulnerable to its enemies. This abandonment fulfills prophetic warnings and serves as a type of Christ, who would later cleanse the Temple and embody God's presence on earth (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>). The "day of His anger" highlights the immediacy and intensity of divine judgment, a theme that resonates with eschatological warnings in the New Testament about the Day of the Lord (<a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>The sovereign God who is expressing His righteous anger against His people due to their disobedience and sin.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughter_of_zion.htm">Daughter of Zion</a></b><br>A poetic term referring to the city of Jerusalem and its inhabitants, symbolizing the people of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, which has fallen into sin and is experiencing the consequences of divine judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cloud_of_his_anger.htm">Cloud of His Anger</a></b><br>A metaphor for God's wrath and judgment, indicating a temporary but severe obscuring of His favor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/footstool.htm">Footstool</a></b><br>Symbolically refers to the temple in Jerusalem, representing God's presence and favor, which is now disregarded in His anger.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_anger.htm">Understanding Divine Anger</a></b><br>God's anger is not capricious but a response to persistent sin and rebellion.

Once the city basked under the protective pillar-cloud of God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-38</a>), but now a very different cloud hangs overhead&#8212;anger instead of glory (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-20.htm">Deuteronomy 32:20</a>).<p>- The verse opens with an exclamation of shock, signaling that this judgment was no mere string of misfortunes but the deliberate act of the covenant God who had warned of such consequences (<a href="/leviticus/26-27.htm">Leviticus 26:27-33</a>).<p>- Like a thundercloud that blocks out the sun, His wrath obscures every sense of comfort or favor. Jeremiah had already pictured coming judgment &#8220;like clouds, with chariots like a whirlwind&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/4-13.htm">Jeremiah 4:13</a>). That warning is here fulfilled.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He has cast the glory of Israel from heaven to earth.</b><p>- &#8220;The glory of Israel&#8221; evokes the temple, the priesthood, the throne of David&#8212;everything that displayed God&#8217;s splendor among His people (<a href="/1_kings/8-11.htm">1 Kings 8:11</a>). To be &#8220;cast &#8230; from heaven to earth&#8221; is to be violently dethroned and publicly humiliated (<a href="/psalms/89-44.htm">Psalm 89:44</a>).<p>- Centuries earlier, when the ark was captured, people cried, &#8220;The glory has departed from Israel!&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/4-22.htm">1 Samuel 4:22</a>). Now the departure is worse: Babylon&#8217;s siege flattens the city, proving that unrepentant sin drags God&#8217;s people from a place of honor to the dust (<a href="/jeremiah/13-18.htm">Jeremiah 13:18</a>).<p>- Ezekiel saw God&#8217;s glory physically leave the temple (<a href="/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18</a>); Lamentations records the aftermath: glory gone, rubble left.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He has abandoned His footstool in the day of His anger.</b><p>- Scripture calls the ark and the temple God&#8217;s &#8220;footstool&#8221; (<a href="/1_chronicles/28-2.htm">1 Chronicles 28:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/99-5.htm">Psalm 99:5</a>), the earthly spot where heaven touched earth. By &#8220;abandoning&#8221; it, God withdraws His special presence, leaving the structure exposed to enemy hands.<p>- This abandonment is temporary but terrifying. <a href="/psalms/132-13.htm">Psalm 132:13-14</a> promised Zion as His resting place &#8220;forever,&#8221; yet covenant blessings are enjoyed only in obedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-14</a>). In the &#8220;day of His anger&#8221; He honors His own holiness by stepping away.<p>- The loss of the footstool signals a broken relationship; worshipers can no longer draw near as before (<a href="/lamentations/2-7.htm">Lamentations 2:7</a>).
