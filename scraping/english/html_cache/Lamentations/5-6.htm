Egypt and Assyria were two dominant powers during the time of the prophets. Historically, Judah often sought alliances with these nations for protection against other threats, such as Babylon. This submission indicates a reliance on foreign powers rather than trusting in God, which was a recurring issue for Israel and Judah. Biblically, this is seen as a failure to heed the warnings of prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah, who cautioned against such alliances (<a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-3</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>). Theologically, this submission can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual unfaithfulness, as Israel was called to rely solely on God.<p><b>to get enough bread</b><br>This phrase highlights the dire economic and social conditions faced by the people of Judah. Bread, a staple of the ancient Near Eastern diet, symbolizes basic sustenance and survival. The need to submit to foreign powers for food underscores the severity of the famine and deprivation experienced during and after the Babylonian siege. This situation fulfills the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>, where disobedience to God would lead to serving enemies in hunger and thirst. Theologically, it points to the consequences of turning away from God, as reliance on Him was meant to provide for all needs (<a href="/psalms/37-25.htm">Psalm 37:25</a>). In a typological sense, Jesus Christ is seen as the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), offering spiritual sustenance and fulfillment that earthly powers cannot provide.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>Traditionally considered the author of Lamentations, Jeremiah was a prophet who warned Judah of impending judgment due to their disobedience to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, which faced destruction and exile due to its persistent idolatry and rebellion against God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/egypt.htm">Egypt</a></b><br>A neighboring nation to the south of Judah, often seen as a place of refuge or alliance in times of trouble, but also a symbol of reliance on human strength rather than God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/a/assyria.htm">Assyria</a></b><br>A powerful empire to the north, known for its military might and oppression of smaller nations, including Israel and Judah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/exile.htm">Exile</a></b><br>The event of Judah's captivity and removal from their land, a consequence of their failure to follow God's covenant.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reliance_on_god_vs._human_alliances.htm">Reliance on God vs. Human Alliances</a></b><br>The verse highlights the danger of relying on human alliances instead of trusting in God.

Turning to both shows desperation&#8212;seeking help in opposite directions instead of returning to the covenant God (<a href="/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>; 12:1).<p>&#8226; Egypt represents a return to the house of slavery from which God had redeemed them (<a href="/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3</a>; <a href="/isaiah/30-1.htm">Isaiah 30:1-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Assyria once devastated the northern kingdom (<a href="/2_kings/17-6.htm">2 Kings 17:6</a>). Appealing to that same empire exposes Judah&#8217;s forgetfulness of history and of God&#8217;s warnings (<a href="/nahum/3-1.htm">Nahum 3:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; The pairing emphasizes that no earthly nation, no matter how mighty, could supply what obedience to the LORD would have provided (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to get enough bread</b><p>&#8226; Physical hunger drove political compromise.

God had pledged abundance in the land if His people walked in His ways (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-5</a>). Their quest for bread outside the covenant shows misplaced trust (<a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31-33</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse therefore testifies that spiritual unfaithfulness produces material want; turning to worldly suppliers brings only temporary relief and deeper bondage (<a href="/isaiah/55-2.htm">Isaiah 55:2</a>; <a href="/john/6-26.htm">John 6:26-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/lamentations/5-6.htm">Lamentations 5:6</a> captures Judah&#8217;s tragic choice: under pressure, the nation surrendered to foreign powers&#8212;Egypt and Assyria&#8212;in a bid for mere survival. This single verse exposes the folly of abandoning reliance on God, the humiliation of reverting to old oppressors, and the futility of seeking bread apart from covenant faithfulness. True security and provision remain with the LORD alone, who calls His people back to wholehearted trust and obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/lamentations/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">We have given the hand.</span>--The recognised phrase for submission (<a href="/jeremiah/1-15.htm" title="For, see, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, said the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.">Jeremiah 1:15</a>).
