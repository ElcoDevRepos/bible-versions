The Israelites often faced consequences for the sins of their ancestors, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, where God warns of visiting "the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation." This highlights the communal nature of sin and its impact on the entire community, not just the individual.<p><b>and are no more</b><br>This indicates that the forefathers who sinned have passed away, emphasizing the transient nature of human life. It reflects the reality of mortality and the inevitable passing of generations, as seen in <a href="/ecclesiastes/1-4.htm">Ecclesiastes 1:4</a>, "Generations come and generations go." The phrase also suggests a sense of loss and absence of those who might have repented or sought to rectify their wrongs.<p><b>but we bear their punishment</b><br>Here, the lament expresses the enduring consequences of ancestral sins on the current generation. This concept is echoed in the Deuteronomic history, where the fate of Israel is often tied to the covenantal faithfulness of its leaders and people. The idea of bearing the punishment for others' sins is also a theme that points forward to the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who bore the sins of humanity, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, "He was pierced for our transgressions." This phrase underscores the deep sense of injustice and suffering experienced by the people, while also pointing to the hope of ultimate redemption and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>- Traditionally attributed as the author of Lamentations, Jeremiah was a prophet who warned Judah of impending judgment due to their disobedience to God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>- The southern kingdom of Israel, which faced destruction and exile due to its persistent sin and rebellion against God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/babylonian_exile.htm">Babylonian Exile</a></b><br>- The event where the people of Judah were taken captive by the Babylonians, serving as the backdrop for the lament in this verse.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/generational_consequences.htm">Generational Consequences</a></b><br>The verse highlights the reality of generational consequences, where the actions of one generation can impact the next.

This view of national troubles is very clearly endorsed by one important class of passages (<a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="/exodus/34-7.htm">Exodus 34:7</a>; <a href="/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/32-18.htm">Jeremiah 32:18</a>). The objection to it is forcibly expressed by Job (<a href="/job/21-19.htm">Job 21:19</a>), "God [it is said] layeth up his iniquity for his children: [but] let him requite it to himself, that he may feel it!" Hence Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/31-30.htm">Jeremiah 31:30</a>) and Ezekiel (<a href="/ezekiel/18-1.htm">Ezekiel 18:1</a>, etc.) insist on the truth that every man is punished for his own sins. Of course the two views of punishment are reconcilable. The Jews were not only punished, according to <a href="/jeremiah/16-11.htm">Jeremiah 16:11, 12</a>, for their fathers' sins, but for their own still more flagrant offences. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/lamentations/5-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Our fathers</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1489;&#1465;&#1514;&#1461;&#1444;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#7687;&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#234;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124; first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1.htm">Strong's 1: </a> </span><span class="str2">Father</span><br /><br /><span class="word">sinned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1464;&#1469;&#1496;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7789;&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2398.htm">Strong's 2398: </a> </span><span class="str2">To miss, to sin, to forfeit, lack, expiate, repent, lead astray, condemn</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and are] no more,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1464;&#1428;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;n&#257;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Adverb &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_369.htm">Strong's 369: </a> </span><span class="str2">A non-entity, a negative particle</span><br /><br /><span class="word">but we</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1463;&#1430;&#1495;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;na&#7717;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Pronoun - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_587.htm">Strong's 587: </a> </span><span class="str2">We</span><br /><br /><span class="word">bear</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1505;&#1464;&#1489;&#1464;&#1469;&#1500;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(s&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#257;&#183;l&#601;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5445.htm">Strong's 5445: </a> </span><span class="str2">To carry, be burdensome, to be gravid</span><br /><br /><span class="word">their punishment.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1493;&#1466;&#1504;&#1465;&#1514;&#1461;&#1497;&#1492;&#1462;&#1445;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;w&#333;&#183;n&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#234;&#183;hem)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common plural construct &#124; third person masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5771.htm">Strong's 5771: </a> </span><span class="str2">Iniquity, guilt, punishment for iniquity</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/lamentations/5-7.htm">Lamentations 5:7 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/lamentations/5-7.htm">Lamentations 5:7 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/lamentations/5-7.htm">Lamentations 5:7 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/lamentations/5-7.htm">Lamentations 5:7 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/lamentations/5-7.htm">Lamentations 5:7 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/lamentations/5-7.htm">Lamentations 5:7  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/lamentations/5-7.htm">Lamentations 5:7 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/lamentations/5-7.htm">Lamentations 5:7 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/lamentations/5-7.htm">Lamentations 5:7 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/lamentations/5-7.htm">Lamentations 5:7 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/lamentations/5-7.htm">OT Prophets: Lamentations 5:7 Our fathers sinned and are no more (Lam.
