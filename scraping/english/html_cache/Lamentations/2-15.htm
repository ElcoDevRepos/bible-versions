In ancient Near Eastern culture, clapping hands was often a gesture of contempt or derision. The historical context here is the aftermath of the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem in 586 BC, which left the city in ruins. The onlookers, likely neighboring nations, express their disdain and perhaps satisfaction at the downfall of a once-great city. This reflects the fulfillment of prophecies regarding Jerusalem's destruction due to its disobedience (<a href="/jeremiah/18-16.htm">Jeremiah 18:16</a>).<p><b>They hiss and shake their heads at the Daughter of Jerusalem:</b><br>Hissing and shaking the head were common expressions of scorn and disbelief in ancient times. The "Daughter of Jerusalem" is a poetic term for the city and its inhabitants, emphasizing their vulnerability and the intimate relationship between God and His people. This imagery is also found in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7</a> and <a href="/job/16-4.htm">Job 16:4</a>, where it signifies derision and rejection. The cultural practice of shaking the head indicates a deep sense of shame and disgrace.<p><b>&#8220;Is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty,</b><br>Jerusalem was once renowned for its beauty and splendor, particularly during the reigns of David and Solomon. The phrase "perfection of beauty" highlights the city's former glory and its status as a center of worship and culture. This description is echoed in <a href="/psalms/50-2.htm">Psalm 50:2</a>, where Zion is called the "perfection of beauty." The contrast between its past glory and current desolation underscores the severity of its fall and serves as a reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>the joy of all the earth?&#8221;</b><br>Jerusalem was not only a political and cultural center but also a spiritual one, considered the joy of the earth due to its association with God's presence in the temple. This phrase reflects the city's significance in the ancient world and its role as a symbol of divine favor and blessing. The lamentation over its destruction is profound, as it represents the loss of a place that was meant to be a beacon of hope and joy for all nations. This sentiment is echoed in <a href="/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>, where Jerusalem is described as the "joy of the whole earth," highlighting its intended role in God's plan for humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/d/daughter_of_jerusalem.htm">Daughter of Jerusalem</a></b><br>This term refers to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, personified as a daughter.
