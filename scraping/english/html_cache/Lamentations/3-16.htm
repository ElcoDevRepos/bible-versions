In ancient times, the act of grinding teeth with gravel would symbolize extreme distress and discomfort. The imagery suggests a forced consumption of something harsh and painful, reflecting the deep anguish experienced by the speaker. This can be seen as a metaphor for the severe trials and tribulations faced by the people of Jerusalem during the Babylonian siege and subsequent exile. The grinding of teeth is also a biblical expression of anguish and despair, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/matthew/8-12.htm">Matthew 8:12</a>, where it describes the weeping and gnashing of teeth in outer darkness. This phrase highlights the physical and emotional torment endured by the prophet Jeremiah, who is traditionally considered the author of Lamentations, as he laments the destruction of Jerusalem.<p><b>and trampled me in the dust</b><br>The imagery of being trampled in the dust signifies utter defeat and degradation. In the ancient Near Eastern context, being cast down to the dust was a sign of complete subjugation and humiliation. Dust is often associated with mortality and lowliness, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>, where humanity is reminded of its origin from dust and eventual return to it. This phrase underscores the depth of despair and the feeling of being crushed under the weight of divine judgment. It reflects the historical reality of Jerusalem's fall and the subsequent suffering of its inhabitants. Theologically, it can be seen as a representation of the consequences of sin and disobedience, as the people of Judah faced the repercussions of turning away from God. This imagery also foreshadows the suffering of Christ, who was humiliated and bore the weight of humanity's sins, as described in <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, where He was "crushed for our iniquities."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>Traditionally attributed as the author of Lamentations, Jeremiah is known as the "weeping prophet."

Gravel between the teeth is painful, shocking, and impossible to ignore. It pictures God allowing His people to taste the full bitterness of their rebellion.<p>&#8226; Literal suffering lay behind the metaphor. During the siege (<a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1&#8211;3</a>) food was scarce; chewing anything&#8212;let alone debris&#8212;would scrape the mouth raw. Jeremiah records what was happening, not merely how it felt.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s discipline can feel as though He Himself presses the gravel in. Yet Scripture assures us His hand is purposeful, not spiteful (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>; <a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>).<p>&#8226; Cross references help us see the wider biblical pattern:<p>&#8211; <a href="/proverbs/20-17.htm">Proverbs 20:17</a>: &#8220;Food gained by fraud is sweet to a man, but later his mouth is full of gravel.&#8221; Sin&#8217;s short-lived pleasure ends in biting misery.<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/3-7.htm">Psalm 3:7</a>: &#8220;Strike all my enemies on the jaw; break the teeth of the wicked.&#8221; The Lord once broke wicked teeth; now the covenant people feel that blow because they have imitated the wicked.<p>&#8211; <a href="/lamentations/3-15.htm">Lamentations 3:15</a> has just said, &#8220;He has filled me with bitterness, He has sated me with wormwood.&#8221; Gravel follows wormwood&#8212;moving from bitter taste to physical agony.<p>&#8226; Personal takeaway: when God lets us experience the consequences of sin, the jarring pain is meant to wake us, not destroy us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and trampled me in the dust</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Trampled&#8221; speaks of being completely overpowered. The city that once stood tall (<a href="/psalms/48-2.htm">Psalm 48:2</a>) now lies flattened.<p>&#8226; Dust signifies mortality and humiliation. Adam was taken from dust (<a href="/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>); to be pressed back into it is to face our frailty head-on.<p>&#8226; Cross-reinforcements:<p>&#8211; <a href="/psalms/44-25.htm">Psalm 44:25</a>: &#8220;For our soul has sunk to the dust; our bodies cling to the earth.&#8221; National catastrophe brings the same posture&#8212;face down, powerless.<p>&#8211; <a href="/isaiah/51-23.htm">Isaiah 51:23</a>: the oppressor says, &#8220;Lie down so we may walk over you,&#8221; an eerily close picture of being trampled.<p>&#8211; <a href="/job/16-15.htm">Job 16:15</a>: &#8220;I have buried my horn in the dust.&#8221; Personal anguish mirrors corporate collapse.<p>&#8226; God remains sovereign even while His foot is on His people&#8217;s back. The next verses will climb toward hope (<a href="/lamentations/3-21.htm">Lamentations 3:21-23</a>), proving that the One who crushes also revives (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>).<p>&#8226; Practical encouragement: believers today may feel utterly walked over&#8212;by circumstances, by enemies, even by divine discipline. Yet, as Paul affirms, &#8220;we are hard pressed on all sides, but not crushed&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-8.htm">2 Corinthians 4:8</a>). Dust is not the end; resurrection follows.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/lamentations/3-16.htm">Lamentations 3:16</a> records real, excruciating judgment: God lets His people chew gravel and be ground into dust. These twin images stress the bitterness and totality of divine discipline. Yet even here, His purpose is redemptive&#8212;shocking the sinner awake and lowering the proud so they can be lifted by mercy. Gravel in the mouth and dust on the face mark the turning point where repentance can begin and steadfast love can shine all the brighter.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/lamentations/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">He hath also broken my teeth.</span>--The metaphor of food is continued. The mourner eats bread that is gritty, as if made of sand instead of flour. (Comp. <a href="/proverbs/20-17.htm" title="Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.">Proverbs 20:17</a>.) Here, again, we are reminded of Dante (<span class= "ital">Parad. </span>xvii. 58), when he speaks of the bitterness of the bread which comes as the grudging gift of strangers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he hath (unnatural as it may seem in Israel's Father) given me stones instead of bread (comp. <a href="/matthew/7-9.htm">Matthew 7:9</a>). The Jewish rabbi commonly called Rashi thinks that a historical fact is preserved in these words, and that the Jewish exiles were really obliged to eat bread mixed with grit, because they had to bake in pits dug in the ground. So too many later commentators, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Grotius, who compares a passage of Seneca ('De Benefie.,' 2:7), "Beneficium superbe datum simile est pani lapidoso." <span class="cmt_word">He hath covered me with ashes;</span> rather, <span class="accented">he hath pressed me down into ashes.</span> A figurative expression for great humiliation. So in the Talmud the Jewish nation is described as "pressed down into ashes" ('Bereshith Rabba,' 75). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/lamentations/3-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He has ground</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1490;&#1456;&#1512;&#1461;&#1444;&#1505;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;ya&#7713;&#183;r&#234;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1638.htm">Strong's 1638: </a> </span><span class="str2">To crush, to dissolve</span><br /><br /><span class="word">my teeth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;in&#183;n&#257;y)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - cdc &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8127.htm">Strong's 8127: </a> </span><span class="str2">A tooth,   ivory, a cliff</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with gravel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1462;&#1469;&#1495;&#1464;&#1510;&#1464;&#1509;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(be&#183;&#7717;&#257;&#183;&#7779;&#257;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2687.htm">Strong's 2687: </a> </span><span class="str2">Something cutting, gravel, an arrow</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and trampled me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1499;&#1456;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1463;&#1430;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(hi&#7733;&#183;p&#238;&#183;&#353;a&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person masculine singular &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3728.htm">Strong's 3728: </a> </span><span class="str2">To make bent, press or bend together</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the dust.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1469;&#1508;&#1462;&#1512;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;p&#772;er)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-b, Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_665.htm">Strong's 665: </a> </span><span class="str2">Ashes</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/lamentations/3-16.htm">Lamentations 3:16 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/lamentations/3-16.htm">Lamentations 3:16 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/lamentations/3-16.htm">Lamentations 3:16 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/lamentations/3-16.htm">Lamentations 3:16 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/lamentations/3-16.htm">Lamentations 3:16 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/lamentations/3-16.htm">Lamentations 3:16  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/lamentations/3-16.htm">Lamentations 3:16 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/lamentations/3-16.htm">Lamentations 3:16 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/lamentations/3-16.htm">Lamentations 3:16 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/lamentations/3-16.htm">Lamentations 3:16 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/lamentations/3-16.htm">OT Prophets: Lamentations 3:16 He has also broken my teeth (Lam.
