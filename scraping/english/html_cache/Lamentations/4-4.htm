The image of a nursing infant suffering from thirst highlights the severity of the famine and the breakdown of societal structures. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the well-being of children was a reflection of the community's health. The mention of thirst is significant, as water scarcity was a common issue during sieges, and it underscores the desperation of the situation. This imagery is reminiscent of <a href="/deuteronomy/28-48.htm">Deuteronomy 28:48</a>, where God warns of the consequences of disobedience, including hunger and thirst. The suffering of the innocent, such as infants, emphasizes the depth of the nation's calamity and serves as a poignant reminder of the consequences of turning away from God.<p><b>Little children beg for bread,</b><br>The plight of the children begging for bread illustrates the extreme poverty and hunger experienced during the siege. Bread, a staple food in the ancient world, symbolizes basic sustenance and life. The fact that children, who are typically cared for and protected, are reduced to begging indicates a complete societal collapse. This situation fulfills the curses outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>, where God warns that disobedience will lead to a lack of bread. The image of children begging also evokes compassion and highlights the moral and spiritual decay of the society that fails to provide for its most vulnerable members.<p><b>but no one gives them any.</b><br>This phrase underscores the hopelessness and despair prevalent in Jerusalem during the siege. The lack of response to the children's pleas indicates a community overwhelmed by its own needs and unable to extend help to others. It reflects the fulfillment of prophetic warnings, such as those in <a href="/jeremiah/19-9.htm">Jeremiah 19:9</a>, where God foretells the dire consequences of the people's unfaithfulness. The absence of compassion and aid is a stark contrast to the biblical call to care for the needy, as seen in passages like <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>. This situation serves as a sobering reminder of the spiritual desolation that accompanies physical suffering and the importance of maintaining faithfulness to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>- Traditionally attributed as the author of Lamentations, Jeremiah is known as the "weeping prophet."

When leaders rebel, even the innocent suffer (<a href="/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17</a>). Scripture tells the story plainly so we will grasp how serious rebellion against a holy God truly is.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Little children beg for bread, but no one gives them any</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Little children&#8221; (toddlers and primary-age kids) roam the streets, stretching out hands that remain empty. The siege has drained every household; even compassionate parents have nothing left to share.<p>&#8226; <a href="/lamentations/2-12.htm">Lamentations 2:12</a> echoes the scene: &#8220;They say to their mothers, &#8216;Where is bread and wine?&#8217; as they faint like the wounded in the city streets.&#8221; The mothers are powerless, a reversal of God&#8217;s design for families (<a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_kings/25-3.htm">2 Kings 25:3</a> notes that on the ninth day of the fourth month &#8220;the famine in the city became so severe that there was no food for the common people.&#8221; The prophetic warnings (<a href="/jeremiah/21-9.htm">Jeremiah 21:9</a>; 37:21) are fulfilled to the letter.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53-55</a> had foretold horrifying hunger so intense that parents would refuse food even to their own children. <a href="/lamentations/4-4.htm">Lamentations 4:4</a> shows the first stage of that desperation&#8212;breadlessness.<p>&#8226; Beyond the historical moment, the image points to a deeper spiritual need. <a href="/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11</a> predicted &#8220;a famine&#8230; not of bread, but of hearing the words of the LORD.&#8221; By the time Jesus declared, &#8220;I am the bread of life&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), Judah&#8217;s history had already proven that physical bread alone cannot save.

Both pictures fulfill covenant warnings to the letter, showing that God&#8217;s Word is utterly accurate and that sin&#8217;s consequences fall even on the innocent.
