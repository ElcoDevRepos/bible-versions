In the context of Lamentations, it underscores the reality of the suffering being experienced. The book is traditionally attributed to the prophet Jeremiah, who witnessed the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC. This word sets the tone for the lament, indicating that the following statements are not mere hyperbole but a reflection of genuine distress.<p><b>He keeps turning His hand against me</b><br>This phrase suggests continuous action, indicating that the speaker feels persistently afflicted by God. In the historical context, the destruction of Jerusalem and the subsequent exile were seen as divine judgment for the nation's sins. The "hand" of God is often symbolic of His power and authority (<a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>, <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). Here, it is perceived as an instrument of discipline. This reflects the covenant relationship where God promised blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience (Deuteronomy 28). Theologically, it raises questions about divine justice and mercy, themes explored throughout the book.<p><b>all day long.</b><br>The expression "all day long" conveys the unrelenting nature of the suffering. It suggests that the speaker feels there is no respite from the affliction. This can be connected to the broader biblical theme of enduring trials and the hope of eventual deliverance (<a href="/psalms/13.htm">Psalm 13:1-2</a>, <a href="/romans/8-18.htm">Romans 8:18</a>). The phrase also highlights the intensity of the lament, as the speaker feels overwhelmed by the continuous nature of the hardship. In a typological sense, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of Christ's suffering, who endured continuous opposition and ultimately bore the sins of humanity (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3-5</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Lamentations, Jeremiah is known as the "weeping prophet."

This &#8220;indeed&#8221; ties the thought directly to that earlier confession.<p>- Other sufferers echo the same certainty: Job admits, &#8220;Indeed, I know that it is so&#8221; (<a href="/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2</a>), and Asaph cries, &#8220;Surely God is good to Israel&#8230; but as for me, my feet had almost slipped&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/73-1.htm">Psalm 73:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>- The word anchors us&#8212;this is no passing feeling but a settled recognition that the Lord&#8217;s hand is involved in what follows.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He keeps turning His hand</b><p>- The image of God&#8217;s &#8220;hand&#8221; speaks of active power.

David felt the same continuing pressure: &#8220;Day and night Your hand was heavy upon me&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/32-4.htm">Psalm 32:4</a>).<p>- This persistence reminds us that divine discipline does not relent until it achieves its purpose (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6&#8211;11</a>).<p>- Even when God&#8217;s hand feels harsh, it remains the hand of a loving Father directing His people back to Himself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Against me</b><p>- The prophet experiences the judgment personally: it is not merely national calamity; it pierces the individual heart.<p>- Similar language flows from <a href="/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a>: &#8220;Your arrows have pierced me, and Your hand has come down on me.&#8221;<p>- Jeremiah elsewhere records God&#8217;s opposition: &#8220;You have filled me with indignation&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/15-17.htm">Jeremiah 15:17</a>).<p>- Yet the same God promises, &#8220;I am with you and will save you&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a>).
