This plea reflects the deep personal anguish and the desire for divine intervention. The use of "LORD" signifies a covenant relationship, reminding readers of God's faithfulness despite Israel's current suffering. This echoes the cries of other biblical figures, such as David in the Psalms, who often sought God's attention in times of distress.<p><b>I am churning within; my heart is pounding within me,</b><br>This vivid description of internal turmoil highlights the intense emotional and physical response to the situation. The imagery of churning and pounding suggests a state of anxiety and fear, common in the face of divine judgment. This internal struggle can be compared to the agony Jesus experienced in the Garden of Gethsemane, where He was deeply troubled and distressed.<p><b>for I have been most rebellious.</b><br>The speaker acknowledges personal and collective sin, recognizing rebellion against God as the root cause of their suffering. This confession is crucial in the biblical narrative, as repentance is often the first step toward restoration. The theme of rebellion and its consequences is prevalent throughout the Old Testament, particularly in the prophetic books where Israel's unfaithfulness leads to exile.<p><b>Outside, the sword bereaves;</b><br>This phrase describes the external threat of warfare and violence, likely referring to the Babylonian siege and destruction of Jerusalem. The sword symbolizes death and loss, a common consequence of disobedience to God's covenant. This external devastation is a fulfillment of prophetic warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah, who foretold the consequences of Israel's unfaithfulness.<p><b>inside, there is death.</b><br>The internal devastation complements the external threat, indicating that the consequences of sin permeate all aspects of life. This could refer to famine, disease, or spiritual death within the city. The duality of external and internal suffering underscores the totality of judgment. It also serves as a reminder of the spiritual death that results from sin, a theme that is addressed in the New Testament through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who offers life in place of death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>- Traditionally attributed as the author of Lamentations, Jeremiah is known as the "weeping prophet" who mourns the destruction of Jerusalem.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>- The city that has been destroyed, representing the heart of the Jewish nation and the center of worship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>- The covenant God of Israel, to whom the lament is directed.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sword.htm">The Sword</a></b><br>- Symbolizes external threats and violence, often used to describe warfare and destruction.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/d/death.htm">Death</a></b><br>- Represents the internal despair and spiritual desolation experienced by the people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognition_of_sin_and_rebellion.htm">Recognition of Sin and Rebellion</a></b><br>Acknowledge personal and communal sin as the root of distress and turmoil.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_consequences.htm">The Reality of Consequences</a></b><br>Understand that rebellion against God leads to both external and internal consequences, as seen in the destruction and despair of Jerusalem.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_lament.htm">The Importance of Lament</a></b><br>Embrace lament as a biblical response to suffering, allowing for honest expression of pain and seeking God's intervention.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_suffering.htm">God's Sovereignty in Suffering</a></b><br>Trust in God's sovereignty even amidst suffering, recognizing that He is still in control and can bring restoration.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_repentance.htm">Call to Repentance</a></b><br>Use the distress and consequences as a call to repentance and a return to faithful obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Lamentations_1_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Lamentations 1:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Lamentations_1_20_Jerusalem_s_pain_sin.htm">How does Lamentations 1:20 reveal the depth of Jerusalem's suffering and sin?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Emotions_in_Lam_1_20_today_s_relevance.htm">What emotions are expressed in Lamentations 1:20, and how can we relate today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Lam_1_20_to_God_s_justice_mercy.htm">How does Lamentations 1:20 connect with God's justice and mercy throughout Scripture?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_seek_God_s_forgiveness_in_distress.htm">In what ways can we seek God's forgiveness when feeling "distressed" and "faint"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Guide_from_Lam_1_20_for_repentance_prayer.htm">How can Lamentations 1:20 guide us in praying for personal and communal repentance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Context_of_Lamentations_1_20.htm">What is the historical context of Lamentations 1:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Lam_1_20_show_suffering.htm">How does Lamentations 1:20 reflect the theme of suffering?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Lamentations_1_20_s_theological_message.htm">What theological message is conveyed in Lamentations 1:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_lamentations_1.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Lamentations 1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_to_reconcile_jeremiah_20_7_with_james_1_13.htm">How can Jeremiah 20:7 be reconciled with James 1:13, which states that God never tempts or deceives anyone?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/lamentations_2_20__literal_or_metaphorical.htm">Lamentations 2:20 -

Or, perhaps, he means "every form of death" (Virgil's "plurima mortis imago"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/lamentations/1-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Behold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1461;&#1448;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#234;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">O LORD,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1444;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3068.htm">Strong's 3068: </a> </span><span class="str2">LORD -- the proper name of the God of Israel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">how</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">distressed I am.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;ar-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6862.htm">Strong's 6862: </a> </span><span class="str2">Narrow, a tight place, a pebble, an opponent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I am churning</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1459;&#1502;&#1463;&#1512;&#1456;&#1502;&#1464;&#1428;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;o&#183;mar&#183;m&#257;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2560.htm">Strong's 2560: </a> </span><span class="str2">To boil up, to ferment, to glow, to smear with pitch</span><br /><br /><span class="word">within;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1461;&#1506;&#1463;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#234;&#183;&#8216;ay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct &#124;
