Historically, Jerusalem was considered a stronghold due to its strategic location and formidable defenses. The city was seen as divinely protected, especially after miraculous deliverances in the past, such as during the reign of King Hezekiah when the Assyrian army was supernaturally defeated (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35-36</a>). The disbelief of the kings underscores the unexpected nature of Jerusalem's downfall, emphasizing the severity of the judgment against it.<p><b>nor any people of the world</b><br>This broadens the scope of disbelief to include all nations, not just the rulers. Jerusalem was renowned for its religious significance and its association with the God of Israel, who was known for His mighty acts. The phrase suggests that the city's fall was a shock to the international community, which had heard of or witnessed the power of Israel's God. This disbelief reflects the widespread reputation Jerusalem had as a city under divine protection, making its conquest seem impossible.<p><b>that an enemy or a foe could enter the gates of Jerusalem</b><br>The gates of Jerusalem symbolize the city's security and strength. Historically, the gates were heavily fortified and guarded, serving as the primary points of defense against invaders. The idea that an enemy could breach these gates was unthinkable, especially given the city's past deliverances. This phrase also connects to the prophetic warnings given by prophets like Jeremiah, who foretold the city's destruction due to its people's unfaithfulness (<a href="/jeremiah/21-10.htm">Jeremiah 21:10</a>). The entry of enemies into Jerusalem serves as a fulfillment of these prophecies and a demonstration of God's judgment. Additionally, this breach can be seen as a type of Christ's later entry into Jerusalem, where He would confront the spiritual corruption within, offering a path to redemption rather than destruction.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The capital city of Judah, known for its strong fortifications and the location of the Temple, the center of Jewish worship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings_of_the_earth.htm">Kings of the Earth</a></b><br>Refers to the rulers of various nations who would have been aware of Jerusalem's reputation for being a well-defended city.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/people_of_the_world.htm">People of the World</a></b><br>Represents the general populace beyond Israel, indicating a widespread disbelief in Jerusalem's vulnerability.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/enemy_or_foe.htm">Enemy or Foe</a></b><br>The Babylonians, who ultimately breached Jerusalem's defenses, leading to its destruction and the exile of its people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_prophet_jeremiah.htm">The Prophet Jeremiah</a></b><br>Traditionally credited as the author of Lamentations, he witnessed the fall of Jerusalem and expressed profound grief over the event.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_illusion_of_invincibility.htm">The Illusion of Invincibility</a></b><br>The belief that Jerusalem could not fall serves as a warning against overconfidence in human strength and security.

It has to be remembered, however, that since the latter of these two the city had been strongly fortified by Uzziah, Hezekiah, and Manasseh, and the failure of Sennacherib's attempt had probably led to the impression that it was impregnable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/lamentations/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The kings of the earth,</span> etc. And yet Jerusalem had been taken twice before its capture by Nebuchadnezzar (see <a href="/1_kings/14-26.htm">1 Kings 14:26</a>; <a href="/2_kings/14.htm">2 Kings 14</a>:131. How is the language of the second part to be accounted for? It will help us to an answer if we observe that the later Jews seem to have acquired an exorbitant confidence in their national future ever since the Book of Deuteronomy had become as it were canonical in the reign of Josiah. "The temple of Jehovah" was ever in their mouths (<a href="/jeremiah/7-9.htm">Jeremiah 7:9</a>), and the strong outward regard paid to the directions of the Law seemed to them to justify their believing in the fulfilment of its promises. And, in fact, the grand deliverance of Jerusalem in the reign of Hezekiah might, even without this misunderstanding of Deuteronomy, have inspired a firm faith in the security of Jerusalem. A sacred poet had already, on the occasion of that deliverance, declared of the holy city that "God upholdeth the same forever" (<a href="/psalms/48-8.htm">Psalm 48:8</a>), and also (in vers. 4, 5) used the same hyperbole as the author of this lamentation to express the wide reaching interest felt in the fortunes of Jerusalem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/lamentations/4-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The kings</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1461;&#1497;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(mal&#183;&#7733;&#234;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4428.htm">Strong's 4428: </a> </span><span class="str2">A king</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the earth</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1428;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_776.htm">Strong's 776: </a> </span><span class="str2">Earth, land</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did not</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1444;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">believe,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1462;&#1488;&#1457;&#1502;&#1460;&#1433;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(he&#183;&#8217;&#277;&#183;m&#238;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_539.htm">Strong's 539: </a> </span><span class="str2">To confirm, support</span><br /><br /><span class="word">nor any</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1465;&#1430;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#333;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3427.htm">Strong's 3427: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sit down, to dwell, to remain, to settle, to marry</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the world,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1461;&#1489;&#1461;&#1425;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7791;&#234;&#183;&#7687;&#234;l)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8398.htm">Strong's 8398: </a> </span><span class="str2">The earth, the globe, its inhabitants, a particular land</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">an enemy</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1510;&#1463;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7779;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6862.htm">Strong's 6862: </a> </span><span class="str2">Narrow, a tight place, a pebble, an opponent</span><br /><br /><span class="word">or a foe</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1497;&#1461;&#1428;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#183;y&#234;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
