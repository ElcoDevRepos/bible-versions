The bow is a symbol of divine judgment and power. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, the bow was a primary weapon of war, signifying strength and precision. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages where God is depicted as a warrior, such as in <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>, "The LORD is a warrior; the LORD is His name." The bending of the bow suggests preparation for action, indicating that God is actively involved in the events being described.<p><b>and set me as the target</b><br>The speaker, traditionally understood to be the prophet Jeremiah, feels personally targeted by God's judgment. This reflects the intense personal suffering and sense of abandonment experienced during the Babylonian siege and destruction of Jerusalem. The idea of being a target underscores the feeling of vulnerability and helplessness. This personal lament can be connected to Job's experiences, where he also feels singled out by God&#8217;s trials (<a href="/job/7-20.htm">Job 7:20</a>). It highlights the theme of individual suffering within the broader context of communal judgment.<p><b>for His arrow</b><br>The arrow represents the specific instruments of God's judgment. In the context of Lamentations, this can be seen as the calamities that have befallen Jerusalem, such as famine, destruction, and exile. Arrows in the Bible often symbolize swift and unavoidable judgment, as seen in <a href="/psalms/38-2.htm">Psalm 38:2</a>, "For Your arrows have pierced me deeply, and Your hand has pressed down on me." This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate judgment and redemption found in Christ, who bore the arrows of God's wrath on behalf of humanity, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, "But He was pierced for our transgressions."<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jeremiah.htm">Jeremiah</a></b><br>- Traditionally considered the author of Lamentations, Jeremiah is known as the "weeping prophet."
