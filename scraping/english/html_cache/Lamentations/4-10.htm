In ancient Israelite culture, women were often seen as the primary caregivers, embodying compassion and nurturing. The use of "compassionate" underscores the unnaturalness of the situation, as these women, known for their tenderness, are driven to actions contrary to their nature. This reflects the severity of the siege and famine conditions described in <a href="/2_kings/6-28.htm">2 Kings 6:28-29</a>, where similar desperate acts occurred.<p><b>have cooked their own children</b><br>The act of cooking one's own children is a horrific fulfillment of the curses outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53-57</a>, where God warns Israel of the dire consequences of disobedience, including cannibalism during sieges. This phrase serves as a stark reminder of the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where blessings and curses were contingent upon obedience. The historical context of the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem in 586 BC provides the backdrop for this desperate act, illustrating the extreme deprivation and moral collapse during the city's destruction.<p><b>who became their food</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the dire necessity and the complete breakdown of societal norms and family structures. The consumption of children as food is a literal and symbolic representation of the judgment and devastation that has befallen Jerusalem. It serves as a vivid illustration of the consequences of sin and rebellion against God, as prophesied by Jeremiah and other prophets. The act of eating one's offspring is a reversal of the life-giving role of a parent, highlighting the depth of despair and the collapse of hope.<p><b>in the destruction of the daughter of my people</b><br>The "daughter of my people" is a poetic expression referring to Jerusalem and its inhabitants, often used in prophetic literature to convey a sense of endearment and lament. The destruction mentioned here is the result of the Babylonian conquest, a pivotal event in Jewish history that led to the exile. This phrase connects to the broader theme of divine judgment and the fulfillment of prophetic warnings, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/19-9.htm">Jeremiah 19:9</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/5-10.htm">Ezekiel 5:10</a>.
