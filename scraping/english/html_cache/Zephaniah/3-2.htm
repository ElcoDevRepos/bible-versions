In the context of Zephaniah, this refers to Jerusalem and its inhabitants who ignored the warnings of the prophets sent by God. The "voice" can be understood as the voice of God communicated through His prophets, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah, who called the people to repentance. This reflects a broader biblical theme where God&#8217;s people often fail to listen to divine instruction, as seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/3-7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7</a>. The refusal to heed God's voice is a recurring issue throughout Israel's history, leading to judgment and exile.<p><b>she accepted no correction.</b><br>The refusal to accept correction indicates a hardened heart and a resistance to change. Biblically, correction is a form of divine discipline intended to guide the people back to righteousness, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-11.htm">Proverbs 3:11-12</a>. The historical context shows that despite numerous warnings and opportunities for repentance, the people of Jerusalem continued in their sinful ways. This stubbornness is reminiscent of the Israelites' behavior in the wilderness, as described in <a href="/exodus/32.htm">Exodus 32</a>, where they repeatedly resisted God's guidance. The failure to accept correction ultimately leads to severe consequences, as prophesied by Zephaniah and fulfilled in the Babylonian exile.<p><b>She does not trust in the LORD;</b><br>Trust in the LORD is a central tenet of faith in the Hebrew Scriptures, emphasized in passages like <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>. The lack of trust here signifies a reliance on human strength, alliances, or idols rather than on God. Historically, this can be seen in Judah's political alliances with foreign nations like Egypt and Assyria, which were often condemned by the prophets (<a href="/isaiah/30.htm">Isaiah 30:1-2</a>). Theologically, this lack of trust is a form of idolatry, as it places confidence in something other than God. This phrase underscores the spiritual adultery of the people, who have turned away from their covenant relationship with the LORD.<p><b>she has not drawn near to her God.</b><br>Drawing near to God implies a relationship characterized by worship, obedience, and intimacy. In the Old Testament, this is often associated with the temple worship and the sacrificial system, which were intended to facilitate communion with God (<a href="/leviticus/9-7.htm">Leviticus 9:7</a>). The failure to draw near suggests a neglect of these practices and a spiritual distance from God. This phrase can also be seen as a call to repentance, echoing <a href="/james/4-8.htm">James 4:8</a>, which encourages believers to draw near to God with the promise that He will draw near to them. Theologically, this distance from God is a result of sin, which separates humanity from the divine presence, a theme that is ultimately addressed through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ, who reconciles believers to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zephaniah.htm">Zephaniah</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament, Zephaniah's ministry occurred during the reign of King Josiah of Judah.
