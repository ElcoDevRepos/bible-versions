In the context of Zephaniah, this refers to the end of the impending judgment on Judah due to their sins. It echoes the theme of redemption found throughout the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/isaiah/40-2.htm">Isaiah 40:2</a>, where God speaks comfort to Jerusalem, declaring that her sin has been paid for. This removal of punishment is a precursor to the New Testament message of salvation through Christ, who takes away the sins of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<p><b>He has turned back your enemy.</b><br>This indicates a divine intervention where God actively protects His people by repelling their adversaries. Historically, this can be seen in instances like the Assyrian threat being turned back during the reign of Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35-36</a>). It also foreshadows the ultimate victory over spiritual enemies through Christ's triumph over sin and death (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<p><b>Israel&#8217;s King, the LORD, is among you;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's presence with His people, a central theme in the covenant relationship between God and Israel. It recalls the theocratic ideal where God Himself is the true King of Israel, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7</a>. The presence of the LORD among His people is fulfilled in the New Testament with the incarnation of Jesus Christ, Immanuel, meaning "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>).<p><b>no longer will you fear any harm.</b><br>This assurance of safety and peace is a promise of divine protection. It reflects the eschatological hope found in prophetic literature, where God's ultimate reign brings about a time of peace and security (<a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>). In the New Testament, this is mirrored in the peace that surpasses understanding, granted to believers through Christ (<a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a>), and the promise of eternal security in the presence of God (<a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is both just and merciful.

In this context, Israel is the recipient of God's deliverance and protection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_enemy.htm">The Enemy</a></b><br>Represents any force or nation that opposes God's people. In the historical context, this could refer to the Assyrians or Babylonians, but it also symbolizes spiritual adversaries.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king_of_israel.htm">The King of Israel</a></b><br>A title for God, emphasizing His sovereign rule and intimate relationship with His people.
