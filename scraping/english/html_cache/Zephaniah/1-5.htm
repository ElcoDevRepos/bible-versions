This practice is condemned in the Hebrew Scriptures as it often involved idolatry, specifically the worship of celestial bodies such as the sun, moon, and stars. The Israelites were explicitly warned against this in <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>, which cautions against being led astray to worship the "host of heaven." The rooftop worship indicates a private, yet deliberate, act of idolatry, showing a departure from exclusive worship of Yahweh. This practice reflects the syncretism prevalent in Judah, where foreign religious practices were adopted alongside the worship of the LORD.<p><b>those who bow down and swear by the LORD but also swear by Milcom</b><br>This phrase highlights the syncretistic religious practices that had infiltrated Judah. Milcom, also known as Molech, was the god of the Ammonites, and his worship often involved detestable practices, including child sacrifice (<a href="/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>). The act of swearing by both the LORD and Milcom indicates a divided loyalty and a breach of the first commandment, which demands exclusive worship of Yahweh (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>). This dual allegiance is a form of spiritual adultery, as seen in <a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>, where Elijah challenges the Israelites to choose between the LORD and Baal. The divided worship reflects a heart that is not fully committed to God, a theme echoed in the New Testament where Jesus teaches that one cannot serve two masters (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>). This syncretism is a recurring issue in Israel's history, leading to divine judgment and calls for repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zephaniah.htm">Zephaniah</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament, Zephaniah's ministry occurred during the reign of King Josiah of Judah.

This expression is used when God is about to do great things or inflict notable punishment (see <a href="/exodus/3-20.htm">Exodus 3:20</a>; <a href="/exodus/15-12.htm">Exodus 15:12</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-25.htm">Isaiah 5:25</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a>, etc.). Judah. In so far as Judah was rebellious and wicked, it should incur the judicial punishment.

Hence it is added, <span class="cmt_word">upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem,</span> because, having in their very midst the temple of God, with its services and priests, they ought especially to have abhorred idolatry and maintained the true faith. <span class="cmt_word">The remnant of Baal;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the last vestige. One cannot argue from this expression that the reform was already carried so far that Baal worship had almost disappeared.

"The name," says Dr. Pussy, "is probably the Syriac name of 'priest,' used in Holy Scripture of idolatrous priests, because the Syrians were idolaters" Not only shall the persons of these priests be cut off, but their very name and memory shall vanish (<a href="/zechariah/13-2.htm">Zechariah 13:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With the priests</span> (<span class="accented">kohanim</span>).

The worship of the sun, moon, and stars was a very ancient form of error, the heavenly bodies being regarded as the representatives of the powers of nature and the originators of events on earth (see <a href="/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>; <a href="/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26, 27</a>; <a href="/2_kings/17-16.htm">2 Kings 17:16</a>). It was especially prevalent in the time of Manasseh (<a href="/2_kings/21-3.htm">2 Kings 21:3</a>), On the flat roofs of the houses, which were used as places of meditation, recreation, or conference (comp. <a href="/joshua/2-6.htm">Joshua 2:6</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/9-25.htm">1 Samuel 9:25</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/11-2.htm">2 Samuel 11:2</a>; <a href="/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9</a>), they erected altars for family worship of the heavenly bodies. Here they both burned incense (<a href="/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>) and offered animal sacrifices (<a href="/2_kings/23-12.htm">2 Kings 23:12</a>). "In Syrian cities," says Dr. Thomson, "the roofs are a great comfort. The ordinary houses have no other place where the inmates, can either see the sun, smell the air, dry their clothes, set out their flower pots, or do numberless other things essential to their health and comfort. During a large part of the year the roof is the most agreeable place about the establishment, especially in the morning and evening.
