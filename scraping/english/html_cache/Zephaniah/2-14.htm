The city, once bustling with human activity, is now overtaken by animals. This imagery is often used in prophetic literature to signify divine judgment and the reversal of human civilization (<a href="/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/50-39.htm">Jeremiah 50:39</a>). The presence of herds and various creatures suggests a return to a natural state, emphasizing the totality of the city's destruction and the absence of human inhabitants.<p><b>Both the desert owl and screech owl will roost atop her pillars.</b><br>The mention of owls, often associated with desolation and ruin in biblical texts (<a href="/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11</a>), reinforces the theme of judgment. Owls, being nocturnal and solitary creatures, symbolize the eerie silence and abandonment of the once-thriving city. The image of these birds roosting on pillars, which were once symbols of strength and architectural beauty, highlights the complete overthrow of human pride and achievement.<p><b>Their calls will sound from the window, but desolation will lie on the threshold,</b><br>The calls of the owls echoing from the windows suggest a haunting presence, a reminder of what once was. Windows, typically associated with life and activity, now serve as openings for the sounds of desolation. The threshold, a place of entry and exit, now lies in ruin, symbolizing the end of habitation and the cessation of normal life. This imagery underscores the thoroughness of divine judgment, leaving no part of the city untouched.<p><b>for He will expose the beams of cedar.</b><br>Cedar beams were a sign of wealth and grandeur, often used in the construction of palaces and temples (<a href="/1_kings/7-2.htm">1 Kings 7:2-3</a>). The exposure of these beams signifies the stripping away of luxury and the vulnerability of what was once considered strong and enduring. This act of exposure is a divine action, indicating God's direct involvement in the judgment. It serves as a reminder of the futility of human pride and the ultimate sovereignty of God over all creation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/flocks_and_beasts_of_the_field.htm">Flocks and Beasts of the Field</a></b><br>Symbolic of desolation and abandonment, representing the complete destruction of a once-thriving city.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/desert_owl_and_screech_owl.htm">Desert Owl and Screech Owl</a></b><br>Birds often associated with desolation and ruin in biblical literature, emphasizing the eerie silence and emptiness of the destroyed city.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/columns_and_windows.htm">Columns and Windows</a></b><br>Architectural elements of the city, now serving as perches for birds, highlighting the city's fall from grandeur to ruin.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/rubble_and_doorways.htm">Rubble and Doorways</a></b><br>Indicators of destruction and decay, symbolizing the judgment that has come upon the city.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/beams_of_cedar.htm">Beams of Cedar</a></b><br>Once a sign of strength and beauty, now exposed and vulnerable, representing the complete exposure and humiliation of the city.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_judgment_and_accountability.htm">Divine Judgment and Accountability</a></b><br>God's judgment is thorough and complete.

Compare <a href="/isaiah/17-2.htm">Isaiah 17:2</a>, &#8220;The cities of Aroer are forsaken; they will be left to flocks that lie down, with no one to frighten them away&#8221;; also <a href="/jeremiah/50-3.htm">Jeremiah 50:3, 39</a>.<p>&#8226; The image is literal and vivid: where chariots once rumbled, cows now chew cud.

The very openings that ushered in luxury now broadcast ruin.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/9-11.htm">Jeremiah 9:11</a> links animal cries and ruined windows: &#8220;I will make Jerusalem a heap of rubble, a haunt of jackals&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Desolation will lie on the threshold, for He will expose the beams of cedar</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Threshold&#8221; marks the entryway; if even that is ruined, the entire house is gone.

Every detail confirms that when the LORD judges, He overturns human splendor and leaves undeniable evidence of His sovereignty. The verse therefore calls readers to humility, reminding us that lasting security is found only in trusting and obeying Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zephaniah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Flocks</span>; <span class="accented">herds.</span> The prophet describes graphically the desolation mentioned in the preceding verse. The "herds" are not sheep and cattle, as in parallel cases (<a href="/isaiah/17-2.htm">Isaiah 17:2</a>; <a href="/isaiah/27-10.htm">Isaiah 27:10</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-14.htm">Isaiah 32:14</a>), but all <span class="cmt_word">the beasts of the nations</span> - all the wild beasts that infest the country.

The Hebrew will hardly hear Keil's rendering, "all kinds of beasts in crowds." (Compare similar predictions, <a href="/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="/isaiah/34-11.htm">Isaiah 34:11, 14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The cormorant</span> (<span class="accented">kaath</span>); probably <span class="accented">the pelican</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">onocrotalus</span>; the Septuagint gives, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, which word Schleusner thinks to have been interchanged with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> that follows soon afterwards.

Certainly the following clause suits the habits of a bird better than those of a hedgehog (see 'Bible Educator,' 3:312, where Dr. Tristram is quoted saying, "As a matter of fact, the bittern is very abundant in these swamps of the Tigris, and in all the marshy grounds of Syria; and its strange booming note, disturbing the stillness of the night, gives an idea of desolation which nothing but the wail of the hyena can equal"). No notice of the bittern seems to be found in the Assyrian monuments, though the mention of the heron is not uncommon. The <span class="accented">kaath</span> and <span class="accented">kippod</span> are commonly mentioned together, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/isaiah/34.htm">Isaiah 34</a>. II. <span class="cmt_word">The upper lintels;</span> "the capitals" of the columns (see note on Amos 9:1, where the same word <span class="accented">kaphtor</span> is used). <span class="cmt_word">Their voice shall sing in the windows;</span> literally, <span class="accented">the voice of the songster in the window.</span> Birds shall perch and sing in the apertures of the ruined palaces. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Vox cantantis in fenestra</span>; the LXX. has, <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, "Wild beasts shall cry in the breaches thereof." Others translate, "Hark! it singeth in the windows." There are no traces of windows in any of the Assyrian palaces, even in the case of chambers next the outer walls. If daylight were admitted, it must have entered through openings in the ceilings (Layard, 'Nineveh.' 2:260). Desolation shall be in the thresholds. The word rendered "desolation" (<span class="accented">chorebh</span>) Jerome notes may be read as meaning "sword," "drought." and "raven;" he adopts the last signification, and translates, in agreement with the LXX., <span class="accented">corvus.</span> But it seems best to take the term as signifying "desolation;" no human creature shall be found there, only ruin and rubbish. Ewald renders, "Owls shall sing in the windows, crows on the threshold, 'shivered. crushed.'" For he shall uncover (<span class="accented">he hath laid bare</span>) the cedar work. God, or the enemy, has so destroyed the palaces that the cedar panelling is exposed to the weather. Jerome has, "Attenuabo robur ejus." We see by Sennacherib's boast (<a href="/isaiah/37-24.htm">Isaiah 37:24</a>) that the Assyrians imported cedars for building purposes. And we have monumental evidence of the employment of cedar in palaces at least since the time of Assurnazirpal, <span class="date">B.C. 860</span>. Esar-haddon reports that he received cypress and cedar from Lebanon as tribute; and Assurbanipal states that in erecting his palace he used cedar pillars from Sirjon and Lebanon (Schrader, 'Die Keilinschrift. und Alt. Test.,' pp. 183, 453). Neriglissar, King of Babylon, <span class="date">B.C. 559</span>, in rebuilding his palace, records that he "arranged tall cedars for its roof" ('Records of the Past,' 5:142). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zephaniah/2-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Herds</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1458;&#1491;&#1464;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#774;&#183;&#7695;&#257;&#183;r&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5739.htm">Strong's 5739: </a> </span><span class="str2">An arrangement, muster</span><br /><br /><span class="word">will lie down</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1512;&#1464;&#1489;&#1456;&#1510;&#1448;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;r&#257;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;&#7779;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
