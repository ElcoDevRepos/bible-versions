This remnant is often seen as those who remain true to God amidst widespread apostasy. In the context of Zephaniah, the remnant of Israel represents those who survive the coming judgment and are purified. This idea is echoed in other prophetic books like Isaiah and Jeremiah, where the remnant is a symbol of hope and future restoration.<p><b>will no longer do wrong or speak lies</b><br>This phrase indicates a transformation in the moral and ethical behavior of the remnant. The prophets frequently condemned Israel for their sins, including injustice and deceit. The promise here is of a future where the remnant is characterized by righteousness and truthfulness. This transformation is often associated with the New Covenant, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God writes His law on the hearts of His people.<p><b>nor will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouths</b><br>The emphasis on truthful speech highlights the importance of integrity and honesty in the community of God's people. In biblical times, deceit was a common issue, leading to broken relationships and societal decay. The absence of deceit in the remnant signifies a restored relationship with God and each other, reflecting the holiness expected of God's people.<p><b>But they will feed and lie down</b><br>This imagery of feeding and lying down suggests peace and security, reminiscent of pastoral scenes in the Psalms, such as <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>. It conveys a sense of provision and rest, where the remnant enjoys the blessings of God without fear. This peaceful existence is often associated with the Messianic age, where Christ, the Good Shepherd, provides for His flock.<p><b>with no one to make them tremble</b><br>The absence of fear indicates a time of safety and divine protection. Historically, Israel faced threats from surrounding nations, leading to fear and instability. The promise of no longer trembling suggests a future where God&#8217;s people are secure from external threats. This assurance is seen in prophecies of the Messianic kingdom, where Christ reigns as the Prince of Peace, ensuring the safety and well-being of His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_remnant_of_israel.htm">The Remnant of Israel</a></b><br>This refers to the faithful group of Israelites who remain true to God amidst widespread unfaithfulness.
