Historically, this was a time of spiritual decline in Judah, likely during the reign of King Josiah before his reforms. The act of turning back implies a deliberate choice to abandon the covenant relationship with God, which was central to Israel's identity. This echoes the warnings given in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a> about the consequences of forsaking the LORD. The concept of turning back is also seen in the New Testament, such as in <a href="/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38-39</a>, where believers are warned against shrinking back in faith.<p><b>neither seeking the LORD</b><br>Seeking the LORD involves actively pursuing a relationship with Him through prayer, worship, and obedience. In the cultural context of ancient Judah, seeking God was often associated with going to the temple, offering sacrifices, and adhering to the Law. The failure to seek God indicates a neglect of these practices and a lack of desire for His presence and guidance. This neglect is condemned in other prophetic writings, such as <a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a>, which urges people to seek the LORD while He may be found. The call to seek God is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, emphasizing the importance of a personal and communal relationship with Him.<p><b>nor inquiring of Him.</b><br>Inquiring of the LORD refers to seeking His will and guidance, often through prayer or consulting a prophet. This was a common practice in Israel's history, as seen in the actions of leaders like David (<a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>). The failure to inquire of God suggests a reliance on human wisdom or foreign gods, which was prevalent in Zephaniah's time due to the influence of surrounding nations and their deities. This neglect of divine guidance is a form of spiritual arrogance and self-sufficiency, which is condemned throughout the Bible. The importance of inquiring of God is underscored in <a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>, where believers are encouraged to ask God for wisdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zephaniah.htm">Zephaniah</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament, Zephaniah's ministry took place during the reign of King Josiah of Judah.

Jesus warns, &#8220;No one who puts his hand to the plow and then looks back is fit for the kingdom of God&#8221; (<a href="/luke/9-62.htm">Luke 9:62</a>).<p>&#8226; Hebrews echoes the danger: &#8220;My righteous one will live by faith; and if he shrinks back, I will take no pleasure in him&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-38.htm">Hebrews 10:38&#8211;39</a>).<p>&#8226; The image is covenantal: God had redeemed Judah, yet many reversed course, preferring old patterns of sin to covenant loyalty (<a href="/jeremiah/2-19.htm">Jeremiah 2:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>From following the LORD</b><p>The phrase clarifies what is being abandoned: an active walk of obedience.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Follow&#8221; carries the idea of close, continual allegiance&#8212;&#8220;It is the LORD your God you must follow, and Him you must fear&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-4.htm">Deuteronomy 13:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Joshua&#8217;s call, &#8220;As for me and my house, we will serve the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>), shows the positive opposite Zephaniah expects.<p>&#8226; In New Testament language, Jesus says, &#8220;My sheep listen to My voice&#8230; and they follow Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>). Rejecting that voice detaches people from the only secure path.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Neither seeking the LORD</b><p>The downward slide continues: once a person stops following, he ceases to seek.<p>&#8226; Seeking is an intentional pursuit&#8212;&#8220;Seek the LORD while He may be found&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Amos pleads, &#8220;Seek Me and live&#8221; (<a href="/amos/5-4.htm">Amos 5:4</a>), underscoring that spiritual vitality depends on continual desire for God.<p>&#8226; Jesus reinforces the same principle: &#8220;Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a>). Indifference is not neutral; it breeds spiritual drought.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Nor inquiring of Him</b><p>Finally, there is a refusal to consult the Lord for guidance.<p>&#8226; David habitually asked, &#8220;Shall I go up?&#8221; and the LORD answered (<a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2</a>). The people Zephaniah addresses would not bother asking at all.<p>&#8226; Proverbs urges, &#8220;Trust in the LORD with all your heart&#8230; in all your ways acknowledge Him&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5&#8211;6</a>). Ignoring God&#8217;s counsel leaves one to human wisdom alone.<p>&#8226; James promises, &#8220;If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a>). Failing to inquire cuts off the very help God delights to give.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zephaniah/1-6.htm">Zephaniah 1:6</a> traces a four-step decline: turning back, abandoning the path, losing the desire to seek, and finally refusing to listen. Each step widens the gap between the person and the Lord, inviting judgment rather than blessing. The verse is a sober call to persevere&#8212;continually following, seeking, and inquiring of the Lord&#8212;so that faith remains vibrant and obedience steadfast.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zephaniah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Them that are turned back from the Lord.</span> This is a third class, vie. apostates and open despisers.
