The fear of the Lord is a recurring theme in Scripture, often associated with wisdom and obedience (<a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>). In the context of Zephaniah, God had sent prophets to warn Judah of impending judgment due to their idolatry and injustice. The expectation was that these warnings would lead to a change of heart, similar to the call for repentance seen in the ministry of other prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/26-3.htm">Jeremiah 26:3</a>) and Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18-20</a>).<p><b>Then her dwelling place would not be cut off despite all for which I punished her.</b><br>Here, "her dwelling place" refers to Jerusalem and, by extension, the nation of Judah. The promise of not being "cut off" suggests that God was willing to relent from complete destruction if the people repented. This echoes the conditional nature of many of God's covenants, where blessings are contingent upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28). Historically, Jerusalem had been spared in the past, such as during the Assyrian siege in the time of King Hezekiah (<a href="/2_kings/19-32.htm">2 Kings 19:32-36</a>), demonstrating God's mercy when the people turned back to Him.<p><b>But they rose early to corrupt all their deeds.</b><br>This phrase indicates the people's eagerness and determination to pursue sinful behavior, highlighting their stubbornness and rebellion. The imagery of rising early suggests a deliberate and proactive commitment to wrongdoing, contrasting with the call to seek God early (<a href="/psalms/63.htm">Psalm 63:1</a>). The corruption of their deeds points to widespread moral decay, including idolatry, injustice, and social oppression, which were prevalent in Judah at the time (<a href="/zephaniah/1-4.htm">Zephaniah 1:4-6</a>). This persistent disobedience ultimately led to the Babylonian exile, fulfilling the prophetic warnings of judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The speaker in this verse, expressing His expectation for reverence and correction from His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The implied subject of God's address, representing the people of Judah who were expected to heed God's warnings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet_zephaniah.htm">Prophet Zephaniah</a></b><br>The messenger delivering God's words, active during the reign of King Josiah of Judah.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>The southern kingdom of Israel, facing impending judgment due to persistent disobedience.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/corruption.htm">Corruption</a></b><br>The actions of the people who, despite God's warnings, continued in their sinful ways.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_expectation_of_reverence.htm">The Expectation of Reverence</a></b><br>God desires His people to fear Him, which involves a deep respect and acknowledgment of His authority.

Scripture repeatedly shows Him initiating conversation with His people&#8212;patiently, lovingly, and unmistakably (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/65-2.htm">Isaiah 65:2</a>). We hear the same divine voice in <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>, &#8220;Come now, let us reason together, says the LORD.&#8221; His words are never casual; they carry covenant weight, calling His people to listen rather than dismiss.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Surely you will fear Me and accept correction</b><p>The Lord&#8217;s expectation is clear:<p>&#8226; &#8220;Fear Me&#8221; points to reverent awe, the same healthy fear echoed in <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a>, &#8220;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;Accept correction&#8221; stresses teachability. <a href="/jeremiah/7-28.htm">Jeremiah 7:28</a> laments, &#8220;This is the nation that would not obey the voice of the LORD their God or accept correction.&#8221;<p>Taken together, God anticipated that discipline would drive Judah to humble repentance. <a href="/hebrews/12-10.htm">Hebrews 12:10-11</a> assures believers that divine chastening &#8220;yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness&#8221; when received. The intent of correction is restoration, not destruction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then her dwelling place would not be cut off despite all for which I punished her</b><p>Here God lays out the gracious alternative history they could have experienced: continued habitation, security, and blessing in Jerusalem. He is consistent with the principle found in <a href="/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7-8</a>&#8212;if a nation turns from evil, God relents. Even after judgment begins, He holds the door of mercy open: &#8220;He has not dealt with us according to our sins&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-10.htm">Psalm 103:10</a>). <a href="/isaiah/55-7.htm">Isaiah 55:7</a> invites, &#8220;Let the wicked forsake his way&#8230;and He will freely pardon.&#8221; Had Judah responded, the city would have remained intact; the exile and desolation were not inevitable but a consequence of persistent rebellion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But they rose early to corrupt all their deeds</b><p>The contrast is jarring. Instead of early-morning devotion, they practiced early-morning corruption. <a href="/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1</a> paints the picture: &#8220;Woe to those who plan iniquity&#8230;and at morning light they carry it out.&#8221; Their eagerness for sin outpaced any desire for God. <a href="/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13</a> captures God&#8217;s grief: &#8220;I spoke to you again and again, but you did not listen.&#8221; Jesus diagnoses the same heart in <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19</a>&#8212;people &#8220;loved darkness rather than light.&#8221; The deliberate, energetic pursuit of evil canceled the blessing God longed to give.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zephaniah/3-7.htm">Zephaniah 3:7</a> reveals the gracious heartbeat of God: He speaks, expects reverent obedience, and offers protection even after discipline has begun. Yet Judah&#8217;s stubborn refusal turned opportunity into judgment. The verse stands as both warning and encouragement: God&#8217;s correction is an invitation to repent, and His mercy waits for any who will fear Him and accept it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zephaniah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - Taught by such examples, the Jews might have learned to repent and amend their ways.

"To rise early to do a thing" is a phrase used to signify the acting with zeal and full purpose (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/7-13.htm">Jeremiah 7:13, 25</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/11-7.htm">Jeremiah 11:7</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Corrupted all their doings.</span> Like the inhabitants of the earth before the Flood (Corinthians 6:12; comp. <a href="/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>).

St. Jerome, moralizing on this, adds, "Nisi praeparati fuerimus, non nobis orietur sol justitiae. Orto autem sole, omnes racemi de vinea Sodomorum dissipantur et pereunt; ut non solum grandes botri, sed etiam quod parvum esse videbatur in nobis, Christi lucerna radiante dispereat." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zephaniah/3-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I said,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1464;&#1502;&#1463;&#1436;&#1512;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#257;&#183;mar&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;Surely</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1498;&#1456;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#7733;-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_389.htm">Strong's 389: </a> </span><span class="str2">A particle of affirmation, surely</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you will fear</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(t&#238;&#183;r&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - second person feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3372.htm">Strong's 3372: </a> </span><span class="str2">To fear, to revere, caus, to frighten</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1497;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Direct object marker &#124;
