The "remnant" refers to those who survive the judgment and exile, a common theme in prophetic literature. The "coast" likely refers to the Philistine territory, which includes cities like Ashkelon. Historically, the Philistines were long-time adversaries of Israel, and this prophecy suggests a reversal of fortunes where the land of their enemies will be given to the faithful remnant. This echoes the promise of land inheritance found throughout the Old Testament, such as in the Abrahamic Covenant (<a href="/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18-21</a>).<p><b>there they will find pasture.</b><br>This phrase suggests peace and provision. In an agrarian society, pasture is essential for livestock, which in turn supports the community's livelihood. The imagery of finding pasture is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where the Lord is depicted as a shepherd who provides for His flock. It signifies a return to normalcy and prosperity after a period of desolation and exile.<p><b>They will lie down in the evening among the houses of Ashkelon,</b><br>Ashkelon was one of the five major Philistine cities and a symbol of Philistine power. The idea of lying down in the evening suggests security and rest, free from fear of attack or oppression. This imagery is similar to the peace and safety described in <a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>, where each person sits under their vine and fig tree. It indicates a time when former enemies are no longer a threat.<p><b>for the LORD their God will attend to them and restore their captives.</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine initiative in the restoration process. The LORD's attention to His people is a recurring theme in the Bible, emphasizing His faithfulness and covenantal love. The restoration of captives points to a reversal of exile, a theme also found in <a href="/jeremiah/29-14.htm">Jeremiah 29:14</a>. It highlights God's sovereignty and His ability to redeem and restore His people, foreshadowing the ultimate redemption through Jesus Christ, who liberates from spiritual captivity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_remnant_of_the_house_of_judah.htm">The Remnant of the House of Judah</a></b><br>This refers to the faithful survivors of Judah who remain after God's judgment.

It symbolizes a place of future blessing and provision for the remnant.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ashkelon.htm">Ashkelon</a></b><br>One of the five major Philistine cities, representing the enemies of Israel. Its mention here signifies the reversal of fortunes, where the former oppressors' land becomes a place of rest for God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_their_god.htm">The LORD their God</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who promises to intervene and restore His people.
