Historically, this refers to the return from Babylonian exile, a pivotal event in Jewish history. The return to Jerusalem signifies not just a physical relocation but a spiritual renewal and re-establishment of the covenant relationship with God. Jerusalem, the city of David, holds significant theological importance as the center of Jewish worship and the location of the Temple. This promise also foreshadows the ultimate gathering of God's people in eschatological times, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/11-11.htm">Isaiah 11:11-12</a> and <a href="/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21-28</a>, where God promises to gather His people from all nations.<p><b>where they will be My people</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the covenant relationship between God and Israel. It echoes the covenantal language found in <a href="/leviticus/26-12.htm">Leviticus 26:12</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33</a>, where God promises to be in a special relationship with His people. This relationship is characterized by mutual commitment and faithfulness. The phrase also points to the New Covenant, where believers in Christ, both Jew and Gentile, are grafted into this relationship, as seen in <a href="/romans/9-25.htm">Romans 9:25-26</a> and <a href="/1_peter/2-9.htm">1 Peter 2:9-10</a>. It highlights the identity of God's people as those who are chosen and set apart for His purposes.<p><b>and I will be their faithful and righteous God.</b><br>This phrase underscores God's character as faithful and righteous. His faithfulness is a central theme throughout Scripture, assuring His people that He will fulfill His promises, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/7-9.htm">Deuteronomy 7:9</a> and <a href="/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22-23</a>. His righteousness ensures that He acts justly and upholds His covenant. This assurance of God's character provides hope and stability for His people. The phrase also points to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who embodies God's faithfulness and righteousness, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-9.htm">1 Corinthians 1:9</a> and <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>. Through Christ, believers experience the fullness of God's faithful and righteous nature.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet who ministered to the Jewish people after their return from Babylonian exile.

<a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reassures every generation that no scattering&#8212;political, geographical, or spiritual&#8212;can cancel God&#8217;s covenant agenda (<a href="/romans/11-26.htm">Romans 11:26&#8211;29</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to dwell in Jerusalem</b><p>The destination is clear and literal: &#8220;to dwell in Jerusalem.&#8221;<p>&#8226;
