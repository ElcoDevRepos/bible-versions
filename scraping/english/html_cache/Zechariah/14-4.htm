It signifies a moment when God will act decisively in human history, bringing judgment and salvation.<p><b>His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives</b><br>The Mount of Olives is a significant location in biblical history, situated east of Jerusalem. It is the place from which Jesus ascended into heaven (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-12</a>) and is prophesied to be the site of His return. The physical presence of the Lord on this mountain emphasizes the literal fulfillment of prophecy.<p><b>east of Jerusalem</b><br>The Mount of Olives' position east of Jerusalem highlights its strategic and symbolic importance. It served as a vantage point over the city and was a place of refuge and prayer for Jesus (<a href="/luke/22-39.htm">Luke 22:39</a>). Its location underscores the connection between the prophecy and the city of Jerusalem, central to God's redemptive plan.<p><b>and the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west</b><br>This dramatic geological event symbolizes a significant transformation and upheaval. The splitting of the mountain represents God's power to alter creation and prepare the way for His purposes. It may also symbolize the division between the old and new, judgment and restoration.<p><b>forming a great valley</b><br>The creation of a valley suggests a path or passageway, possibly for the deliverance of God's people. Valleys in scripture often represent places of decision or transition, such as the Valley of Jehoshaphat (<a href="/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2, 12</a>), where God judges the nations.<p><b>with half the mountain moving to the north and half to the south</b><br>This division of the mountain into north and south parts further emphasizes the magnitude of the event. It may symbolize the separation of peoples or the opening of a way for the remnant of Israel.

The geographical detail is added in the text to indicate the line of escape which shall be opened for those who are to be de-livened.
