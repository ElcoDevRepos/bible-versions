In the context of Zechariah, angels frequently serve as intermediaries between God and the prophet, conveying visions and instructions. This reflects the biblical theme of God using messengers to communicate His will, as seen in other prophetic books like Daniel and Revelation.<p><b>&#8220;Run and tell that young man:</b><br>The "young man" refers to Zechariah himself, emphasizing his youth and perhaps his zeal or inexperience. The urgency of the message ("Run") underscores its importance and immediacy. This reflects the biblical pattern where God often calls young individuals, such as David and Timothy, to significant roles in His plans.<p><b>&#8216;Jerusalem will be a city without walls</b><br>This prophecy speaks to a future time when Jerusalem will not need physical defenses. Historically, ancient cities relied on walls for protection against enemies. The absence of walls suggests divine protection and peace, a theme echoed in <a href="/isaiah/60-18.htm">Isaiah 60:18</a>, where God promises security and salvation as the city's walls and gates.<p><b>because of the multitude of men and livestock within it.</b><br>This indicates a time of prosperity and growth, with a population so large that walls would be impractical. The mention of livestock suggests agricultural abundance and economic stability. This vision contrasts with the post-exilic reality of a struggling Jerusalem, pointing to a future fulfillment. It also alludes to the eschatological hope found in <a href="/revelation/21-25.htm">Revelation 21:25</a>, where the New Jerusalem is described as a place of eternal safety and prosperity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet who received visions from God, encouraging the Israelites during the post-exilic period.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_young_man.htm">The Young Man</a></b><br>Likely Zechariah himself or another figure in the vision, representing the people of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city central to Jewish identity and worship, symbolizing God's presence and the future hope of restoration.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>A messenger from God, delivering divine instructions and revelations to Zechariah.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision.htm">The Vision</a></b><br>A prophetic revelation concerning the future expansion and divine protection of Jerusalem.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_protection_over_human_security.htm">Divine Protection Over Human Security</a></b><br>The vision of Jerusalem without walls emphasizes reliance on God's protection rather than human-made defenses.

The term applied to him is thought to show that he was still young when the vision appeared; but the word is used also for minister, or servant, or disciple, without necessarily defining the age.

The word <span class="accented">perazoth</span> is used in <a href="/ezekiel/38-11.htm">Ezekiel 38:11</a>, meaning "unwalled villages" where men dwelt "without walls, having neither bars nor gates." So <a href="/esther/9-19.htm">Esther 9:19</a>, where it means, "country towns," in contrast to the metropolis, which was walled and fortified. The idea in the text is that Jerusalem in the future shall be so extended that walls shall no longer contain its inhabitants, but they shall spread themselves in the open country on every side. It is certain that the city did greatly increase in after time, if we may believe Aristeas's account in his famous letter to his brother Philocrates; and the annunciation of this prosperity would be a comfort to the prophet (comp. Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 5:04, 2). But no material increase of this nature satisfies the prophecy, which can only have its fulfilment in the spiritual Jerusalem, whose Builder is Christ, in whose light the nations of them that are saved shall walk (<a href="/revelation/21-24.htm">Revelation 21:24</a>; see <a href="/isaiah/49-18.htm">Isaiah 49:18</a>, etc.; Isaiah 54:2, 3).
