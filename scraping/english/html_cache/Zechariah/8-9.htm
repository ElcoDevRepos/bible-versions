It is a reminder of His power and authority, often used in contexts where God is asserting His will or providing assurance of His protection and strength. This phrase sets the tone for a divine directive, underscoring the importance and seriousness of the message that follows.<p><b>Let your hands be strong:</b><br>This phrase is an encouragement to be diligent and courageous in the work of rebuilding. In the context of Zechariah, it is a call to the returned exiles to continue their efforts in reconstructing the temple despite opposition and discouragement. Biblically, "strong hands" symbolize readiness and determination to accomplish a task, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/joshua/1-6.htm">Joshua 1:6-7</a>, where strength and courage are commanded for the fulfillment of God's promises.<p><b>You who now hear these words spoken by the prophets:</b><br>This refers to the contemporary audience of Zechariah who were listening to the prophetic messages. The prophets Haggai and Zechariah were instrumental during this period, providing guidance and encouragement. The emphasis on "now hear" suggests an active listening and responsiveness to God's word, a theme echoed in <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>, which calls believers to be doers of the word, not just hearers.<p><b>Who were present when the foundations were laid to rebuild the temple:</b><br>This phrase recalls the initial efforts to lay the foundation of the second temple, which began in 536 BC under the leadership of Zerubbabel and Jeshua (<a href="/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8-13</a>). The laying of the foundation was a significant event, marking the renewal of worship and the restoration of the community's identity. It connects the current generation with the past, reminding them of their shared history and the continuity of God's plan.<p><b>The house of the LORD of Hosts:</b><br>The temple is referred to as the "house of the LORD of Hosts," highlighting its significance as the dwelling place of God's presence among His people. The temple was central to Jewish worship and identity, serving as a symbol of God's covenant and faithfulness. The rebuilding of the temple was not just a physical task but a spiritual renewal, pointing forward to the ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who referred to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>), signifying the new covenant and the indwelling of God's presence through the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet who ministered to the Jewish people after their return from Babylonian exile.
