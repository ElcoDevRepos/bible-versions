In the context of shepherding, a staff is a tool for guidance and protection, indicating God's role as the shepherd of Israel. The name "Favor" suggests a period of divine favor and protection that God extended to His people. This imagery connects to <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, where the Lord is depicted as a shepherd who provides and cares for His flock. The act of taking the staff signifies a deliberate action by God, highlighting the seriousness of the forthcoming judgment.<p><b>and cut it in two</b><br>Cutting the staff in two represents the termination of God's favor and the breaking of a relationship. This act is symbolic of judgment and the withdrawal of divine protection. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, breaking a staff or rod was a common symbol for ending an agreement or covenant. This action foreshadows the rejection of the Messiah by Israel and the subsequent consequences. It also parallels the tearing of the temple veil at Christ's crucifixion, symbolizing the end of the old covenant and the beginning of a new one.<p><b>revoking the covenant I had made with all the nations</b><br>The covenant mentioned here refers to God's protective and providential relationship with Israel, which had implications for the surrounding nations. The revocation signifies a shift in God's dealings with Israel and the world, pointing to the broader scope of God's redemptive plan through Christ. This phrase can be linked to the Abrahamic covenant in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where God promises that all nations will be blessed through Abraham's descendants. The breaking of this covenant prefigures the opening of the gospel to the Gentiles, as seen in the New Testament, particularly in <a href="/acts/10.htm">Acts 10</a> with the conversion of Cornelius.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet of the Old Testament, Zechariah is the author of the book bearing his name.

The impact extends beyond Israel to every nation, underscoring that divine favor is neither automatic nor cheap.
