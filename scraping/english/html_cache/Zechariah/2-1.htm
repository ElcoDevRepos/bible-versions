The act of lifting one's eyes often symbolizes readiness to receive a message from God. In biblical context, it suggests a transition from the mundane to the spiritual realm, as seen in other prophetic books like Daniel and Ezekiel.<p><b>and saw a man</b><br>The "man" here is often interpreted as an angelic figure, a messenger of God. In the context of Zechariah, angels frequently appear to deliver divine messages or to guide the prophet. This aligns with the appearances of angelic beings in other prophetic visions, such as those in the books of Daniel and Revelation.<p><b>with a measuring line in his hand</b><br>The measuring line is a tool used for surveying and construction, symbolizing preparation and planning. In biblical prophecy, it often signifies God's intention to restore, rebuild, or judge. This imagery is reminiscent of Ezekiel's vision of the new temple (Ezekiel 40) and the measuring of the New Jerusalem in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21</a>. It suggests a divine plan for the future of Jerusalem, indicating both physical and spiritual restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>The prophet who receives the vision.

By looking up, the prophet models expectant faith; by seeing, he receives revelation meant to comfort and instruct. The appearance of a man&#8212;an angelic figure&#8212;signals God&#8217;s personal engagement. The measuring line foretells exact, divinely supervised restoration, while its placement in the messenger&#8217;s hand guarantees the certainty and immediacy of God&#8217;s work. Together these phrases assure God&#8217;s people that their future is carefully planned, fully known, and securely carried out by the Lord Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-13.</span> - &sect; 5. <span class="accented">The third vision</span>: <span class="accented">the man with the measuring line.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - (<a href="/hebrews/2-5.htm">Hebrews 2:5</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">I lifted up mine eyes again</span> (comp. <a href="/zechariah/5-1.htm">Zechariah 5:1</a>; <a href="/zechariah/6-1.htm">Zechariah 6:1</a>; <a href="/daniel/8-3.htm">Daniel 8:3</a>). This third vision makes a further revelation of God's mercy to Israel. Consequent on the destruction of enemies shall be the growth and development of the chosen people till the time of their final glory (comp. <a href="/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>). There is some difficulty in arranging the details of this vision, depending in great measure on the decision we arrive at with regard to the identification of the "young man" of ver. 4. Those who, as Theodoret, Hitzig, Schegg, Trcehon, Wright, Perowne, etc., consider him to be the man with the measuring line of ver. 1, do not explain why the message should be given to him instead of to the prophet who had asked for information. Nor is it at all certain that the measurer is meant to be regarded as having made a mistake in attempting to define the limits of what was practically unlimited - viz. the restored Jerusalem - and was stopped accordingly in his proceedings. It seems preferable, with Jerome, Cornelius a Lapide, Pusey, Keil, Knabenbauer, etc., to regard the "young man" as Zechariah himself. Then the vision is thus presented: The prophet sees a man with a measuring line; he asks whither he is going, and is answered that he was going forth to measure Jerusalem. Upon this the interpreting angel leaves the prophet's side to receive the explanation of the man's proceedings, and is met by a superior angel, who bids him hasten to tell the prophet the meaning of the vision. <span class="cmt_word">A man.</span> Probably an angel in human form, as <a href="/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8</a>. <span class="cmt_word">A measuring line.</span> This is not the same word as that in <a href="/zechariah/1-16.htm">Zechariah 1:16</a>; but the idea there proposed is taken up here, and its fulfilment is set forth (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/11-3.htm">Ezekiel 11:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-1.htm">Revelation 11:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-15.htm">Revelation 21:15, 16</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/2-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then I lifted</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1462;&#1513;&#1474;&#1468;&#1464;&#1445;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;e&#347;&#183;&#347;&#257;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5375.htm">Strong's 5375: </a> </span><span class="str2">To lift, carry, take</span><br /><br /><span class="word">up my eyes</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1461;&#1497;&#1504;&#1463;&#1435;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#234;&#183;nay)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - cdc &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5869.htm">Strong's 5869: </a> </span><span class="str2">An eye, a fountain</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and saw</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1461;&#1430;&#1512;&#1462;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#234;&#183;re)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with a measuring</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1491;&#1468;&#1464;&#1469;&#1492;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(mid&#183;d&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4060.htm">Strong's 4060: </a> </span><span class="str2">Extension, height, breadth, a measure, a portion, a vestment, tribute</span><br /><br /><span class="word">line</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1462;&#1445;&#1489;&#1462;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;e&#183;&#7687;el)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2256.htm">Strong's 2256: </a> </span><span class="str2">A rope, a measuring line, a district, inheritance, a noose, a company, a throe, ruin</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in his hand.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1491;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#363;&#183;&#7687;&#601;&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#7695;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Preposition-b &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3027.htm">Strong's 3027: </a> </span><span class="str2">A hand</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/zechariah/2-1.htm">Zechariah 2:1 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/zechariah/2-1.htm">OT Prophets: Zechariah 2:1 I lifted up my eyes and saw (Zech.
