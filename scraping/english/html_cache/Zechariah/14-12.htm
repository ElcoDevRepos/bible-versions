Historically, Jerusalem has been a focal point of conflict, and this prophecy reflects the city's significance in God's plan. The concept of a "plague" as divine retribution is consistent with other biblical narratives, such as the plagues of Egypt in Exodus. This judgment underscores God's protection over Jerusalem, a city central to biblical prophecy and eschatology. The phrase also connects to the broader theme of God's sovereignty and justice, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/34-8.htm">Isaiah 34:8</a> and <a href="/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a>, where God judges nations for their actions against His people.<p><b>Their flesh will rot while they stand on their feet,</b><br>This vivid imagery of decay while standing suggests an immediate and supernatural judgment. The description parallels the suddenness of divine intervention seen in other biblical accounts, such as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The rotting flesh can symbolize the futility of human strength against divine power, echoing themes in <a href="/isaiah/40-6.htm">Isaiah 40:6-8</a>, where human frailty is contrasted with God's enduring word. This phrase may also serve as a warning of the consequences of opposing God's will, emphasizing the seriousness of rebellion against Him.<p><b>their eyes will rot in their sockets,</b><br>The rotting of eyes signifies the loss of vision, both physically and spiritually. In biblical symbolism, eyes often represent understanding and insight (<a href="/ephesians/1-18.htm">Ephesians 1:18</a>). This judgment could imply a removal of discernment from those who oppose God, leaving them in spiritual darkness. The imagery recalls the blinding of the Syrian army in <a href="/2_kings/6-18.htm">2 Kings 6:18</a>, where God intervenes to protect His people. It serves as a reminder of the spiritual blindness that accompanies rebellion against God, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39-41</a>.<p><b>and their tongues will rot in their mouths.</b><br>The rotting tongue suggests a silencing of those who speak against God and His purposes. In Scripture, the tongue is often associated with speech and proclamation (<a href="/james/3-5.htm">James 3:5-6</a>). This judgment may indicate the futility of words spoken in opposition to God, as seen in the silencing of false prophets in <a href="/1_kings/18-40.htm">1 Kings 18:40</a>. It highlights the power of God's word over human speech, aligning with the theme in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a> that God's word accomplishes His purposes. This imagery also points to the ultimate accountability of every word spoken, as Jesus teaches in <a href="/matthew/12-36.htm">Matthew 12:36-37</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God who enacts judgment and delivers His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city of God, often representing the people of Israel and the center of God's redemptive plan.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_peoples.htm">The Peoples</a></b><br>Nations or groups that have opposed or attacked Jerusalem, symbolizing opposition to God's purposes.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_plague.htm">The Plague</a></b><br>A divine judgment that causes physical decay, symbolizing the ultimate defeat of those who oppose God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/war_against_jerusalem.htm">War Against Jerusalem</a></b><br>Represents the spiritual and physical opposition to God's chosen people and His plans.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_justice.htm">Divine Justice</a></b><br>God's judgment is certain and just.
