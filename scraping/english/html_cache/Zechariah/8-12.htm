In the context of Zechariah, this prophecy comes after a period of hardship and exile for the Israelites. The seed being prosperous indicates a reversal of the curses found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38-42</a>, where disobedience led to agricultural failure. The prosperity of the seed can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual growth and the flourishing of God's people, reminiscent of the parable of the sower in <a href="/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13:1-23</a>, where the seed represents the word of God.<p><b>The vine will yield its fruit</b><br>The vine is often symbolic of Israel itself, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>. The yielding of fruit suggests a return to favor and blessing from God, contrasting with times when Israel was described as a fruitless vine due to disobedience (<a href="/hosea/10.htm">Hosea 10:1</a>). This promise of fruitfulness can also be seen as a type of Christ, who is the true vine (<a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1-5</a>), and through whom believers bear spiritual fruit.<p><b>The ground will yield its produce</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the restoration of the land, a key theme in the post-exilic period when the Israelites returned to rebuild Jerusalem. The ground yielding produce is a sign of God's blessing and faithfulness to His covenant promises, echoing the blessings of obedience in <a href="/leviticus/26-4.htm">Leviticus 26:4</a>. It also reflects the Edenic ideal of a fruitful land, pointing forward to the ultimate restoration in the new creation (<a href="/revelation/22.htm">Revelation 22:1-2</a>).<p><b>And the skies will give their dew</b><br>Dew in the ancient Near East was crucial for agriculture, especially in the dry seasons. This promise of dew represents God's provision and care, ensuring that the land remains fertile. Dew is also used metaphorically in the Bible to describe God's favor and blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/33-28.htm">Deuteronomy 33:28</a>). The imagery of dew can be connected to the refreshing presence of the Holy Spirit, who brings life and growth to believers.<p><b>To the remnant of this people I will give all these things as an inheritance</b><br>The concept of a remnant is significant in biblical prophecy, referring to those who remain faithful to God amidst judgment and exile. This remnant is promised an inheritance, which includes not only physical blessings but also spiritual restoration and renewal. This promise is fulfilled in part through the return from Babylonian exile and ultimately through the coming of Christ, who secures an eternal inheritance for His people (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11-14</a>). The idea of inheritance also ties back to the Abrahamic covenant, where God promised land and blessing to Abraham's descendants (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1-3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet who ministered to the Jewish people after their return from Babylonian exile.

The verse assures literal agricultural abundance while illustrating the spiritual fruitfulness that flows from renewed covenant relationship. What once lay under drought and curse will flourish under divine blessing, confirming God&#8217;s faithfulness to keep every promise to His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The seed shall be prosperous;</span> literally, (<span class="accented">there shall be</span>) <span class="accented">the seed of peace.</span> The crops sown shall be crops of peace, safe and secure, in contradistinction to the threat in <a href="/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a>, that the seed should be sown in vain, for it should be devoured by an enemy (Knabenbauer). Or, more generally, all farming labours shall succeed and prosper. Jerome's paraphrase is, "There shall be universal peace and joy;" Septuagint," But I will show forth peace." Another way of understanding the words which has found much favour with modern commentators is to take the clause in apposition with the words immediately following; thus: "The seed (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> growth) of peace, the vine, shall give its fruit." But there is no especial reason why the vine should be called "the seed of peace." It is not peculiar among fruit trees for requiring a time of peace for its cultivation. And the term "seed" is very inappropriate to the vine, which was not raised from seed, but from cuttings and layers. Perowne also points out that such a rendering destroys the balance of the three following clauses, which explain and expand the general statement that agriculture shall prosper. Dr. Alexander takes "the seed of peace" to be that from which peace springs; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> that peace should be radically established in the land, and from this fact the results following should ensue. This affords a very good sense; but it is probably a metaphor quite unintended by the prophet. The Syriac reads differently, "The seed shall be safe." <span class="cmt_word">The remnant</span> (see on ver. 11). <span class="cmt_word">To possess;</span> <span class="accented">to inherit</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> (<a href="/revelation/21-7.htm">Revelation 21:7</a>).
