In the context of Zechariah, the Israelites had returned from exile and were being called to genuine repentance and obedience. Historically, this refusal to heed God's word was a recurring issue for Israel, as seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a>, where the people did not listen or incline their ear. This refusal is a heart issue, indicating a willful rejection of God's commands and a preference for their own ways.<p><b>and turned a stubborn shoulder;</b><br>The imagery of a "stubborn shoulder" suggests resistance and rebellion. In ancient Near Eastern culture, turning the shoulder was a metaphor for rejecting authority or instruction. This phrase can be connected to <a href="/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6</a>, where Israel is described as a "stiff-necked people," indicating their persistent rebellion against God. The stubbornness here is not just physical but spiritual, showing a hardened heart against divine guidance.<p><b>they stopped up their ears from hearing.</b><br>This phrase indicates a conscious decision to ignore God's message. The act of stopping up ears is symbolic of a refusal to listen, akin to the behavior described in <a href="/isaiah/6-10.htm">Isaiah 6:10</a>, where the people's hearts are calloused, and their ears are dull. This deliberate deafness to God's word is a serious spiritual condition, as faith comes from hearing the message of Christ (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>). The refusal to hear is a rejection of the opportunity for repentance and restoration, which God continually offers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet who ministered to the people of Judah after their return from Babylonian exile.

They had heard the prophets &#8220;early and often&#8221; (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15&#8211;16</a>) yet, like their fathers, &#8220;they would not listen or incline their ear&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/17-23.htm">Jeremiah 17:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Refusal to listen is the first step toward judgment. In <a href="/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24</a> the Lord laments, &#8220;They did not listen or incline their ear, but followed the stubbornness of their own hearts.&#8221; The same pattern reappears in the New Testament when Jesus warns, &#8220;The one who rejects Me and does not receive My words has a judge&#8221; (<a href="/john/12-48.htm">John 12:48</a>).<p>&#8226; True obedience begins with hearing (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>). When the ear closes, the heart inevitably drifts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and turned a stubborn shoulder</b><p>&#8226; The picture is of an ox stiffening its shoulder to resist the yoke, an image also used in <a href="/nehemiah/9-29.htm">Nehemiah 9:29</a>, &#8220;They acted arrogantly and did not obey Your commandments but sinned against Your ordinances&#8230;and turned a stubborn shoulder.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Stubbornness moves from the ear to the will: once God&#8217;s voice is dismissed, resistance to His authority follows (<a href="/1_samuel/15-23.htm">1 Samuel 15:23</a>).<p>&#8226; God calls His people to humble submission (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>). A &#8220;stubborn shoulder&#8221; rejects that call, inviting the discipline described in <a href="/psalms/32-9.htm">Psalm 32:9</a>&#8212;&#8220;Do not be like the horse or mule, which have no understanding but must be controlled by bit and bridle.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they stopped up their ears from hearing</b><p>&#8226; The phrase intensifies the rebellion.

Yet Scripture urges, &#8220;Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts.&#8221; Persistent rejection ultimately leads to God&#8217;s voice growing silent (<a href="/amos/8-11.htm">Amos 8:11&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/7-11.htm">Zechariah 7:11</a> traces a tragic progression: deliberate refusal to listen, willful resistance, and total shutdown of God&#8217;s voice.
