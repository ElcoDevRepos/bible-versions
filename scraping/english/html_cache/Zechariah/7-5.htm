The inclusion of both groups emphasizes the universal nature of the message and the accountability of all societal levels. In the post-exilic period, the priests held significant influence in guiding the spiritual and communal life of the people. This call to inquiry suggests a need for introspection and communal reflection, highlighting the importance of sincerity in religious practices.<p><b>When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months</b><br>The fifth and seventh months refer to specific times of fasting and mourning observed by the Israelites. The fast in the fifth month commemorated the destruction of the First Temple by the Babylonians in 586 BC, while the fast in the seventh month likely related to the assassination of Gedaliah, the governor appointed by the Babylonians, which led to further calamity for the Jewish remnant. These fasts were part of a broader tradition of lamentation and reflection on national tragedies. The historical context underscores the deep sense of loss and the desire for restoration that characterized the post-exilic community.<p><b>for these seventy years</b><br>The seventy years mentioned here refer to the period of Babylonian exile, a time of punishment and purification for the people of Israel due to their disobedience and idolatry. This timeframe aligns with the prophecy given by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11-12</a>), which foretold the duration of the exile. The completion of these seventy years marked a significant turning point, as the people returned to their land and began rebuilding the Temple, symbolizing a new era of hope and renewal.<p><b>was it really for Me that you fasted?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the sincerity and motivation behind the people's religious observances. It calls into question whether their fasting was genuinely directed towards God or merely a ritualistic practice devoid of true devotion. This echoes the prophetic theme found in <a href="/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3-7</a>, where God critiques superficial religious acts that lack justice and compassion. The inquiry serves as a reminder that true worship involves heartfelt obedience and a genuine relationship with God, rather than mere external observance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet who ministered to the Jewish people after their return from Babylonian exile.
