Here, he interacts with an angelic messenger, a common feature in apocalyptic literature, indicating divine revelation. The question reflects Zechariah's role as an intermediary, seeking understanding on behalf of the people. This interaction underscores the importance of divine guidance in interpreting visions, similar to Daniel's experiences (<a href="/daniel/7-16.htm">Daniel 7:16</a>).<p><b>And he told me, &#8220;These are the horns</b><br>In biblical symbolism, horns often represent power and strength, typically of nations or kings (<a href="/daniel/7-24.htm">Daniel 7:24</a>, <a href="/revelation/17-12.htm">Revelation 17:12</a>). The imagery of horns is rooted in the ancient Near Eastern context, where animals with horns, like bulls, symbolized might. The use of horns here suggests formidable forces or kingdoms that exert influence and control.<p><b>that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.&#8221;</b><br>The scattering refers to the historical exiles of the Jewish people, first the northern kingdom of Israel by Assyria in 722 BC, and then the southern kingdom of Judah by Babylon in 586 BC. This scattering fulfilled earlier prophecies of judgment due to the people's disobedience (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>). The mention of Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem highlights the comprehensive impact on the entire covenant community. Theologically, this scattering serves as a backdrop for the promised restoration and return, a theme prevalent in Zechariah and other prophetic books (<a href="/jeremiah/30-3.htm">Jeremiah 30:3</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet who received visions from God, tasked with encouraging the Israelites during the rebuilding of the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>A divine messenger who communicates God's message to Zechariah, providing explanations for the visions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_horns.htm">The Horns</a></b><br>Symbolic representations of powers or nations that have oppressed and scattered the people of Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah,_israel,_and_jerusalem.htm">Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem</a></b><br>The people and regions that have experienced dispersion and oppression by foreign powers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision.htm">The Vision</a></b><br>Part of a series of visions given to Zechariah, intended to convey God's plans and promises for His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_symbolism.htm">Understanding Symbolism</a></b><br>The horns represent oppressive powers.

The angel&#8217;s answer identifies the horns as literal world powers used to scatter God&#8217;s covenant people. History confirms this scattering, yet the surrounding context promises their ultimate defeat. The passage assures believers that while earthly forces may rage, God remains sovereign, ready to clarify His purposes to any who ask and to deliver His people in His perfect time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Which have scattered,</span> etc. Some see here an allusion to the prophecy of Daniel concerning the Babylonians, Medo-Persians, Macedonians, and Romans. Against this view it is urged that the prophet is speaking of past events, not of a far distant future. Others Lake the four horns to represent Assyria, Egypt, Babylon, and Medo-Persia, all of which had scattered Israel. But it is well to lay no special stress on such explanations of symbolical language, which are at best mere conjectures, liable to be overthrown by a new theory. The word "scattered," which Jerome renders <span class="accented">ventilaverunt</span>, means properly, as Wright observes, "to winnow," to separate and scatter by means of the wind. The perfect tense of this verb must not be pressed so as to exclude all notion of coming events. The prophets see at one glance past and future, and combine in one expression far distant occurrences. Doubtless Zechariah's vision has some relation to Daniel's, and his description of the powers hostile to the Church of God runs on parallel lines with that of his predecessor. Whether be refers to the same four empires must be left in uncertainty. <span class="cmt_word">Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem</span>. All the tribes and the capital. According to Ewald, Judah is named first as occupying the place of honour, even as Benjamin is named before Judah in <a href="/psalms/68-27.htm">Psalm 68:27</a>, because the capital city lay in its territory. Jerusalem was the centre of worship and government for all the people, the northern tribes being represented by Israel. the southern by Judah. Some critics cancel the word "Israel" here, and there is no doubt that it is often written for "Jerusalem" by mistake (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a> [where see Professor Cheyne's note]; 32:30, 32; 51:49; <a href="/zephaniah/3-14.htm">Zephaniah 3:14</a>; <a href="/malachi/2-11.htm">Malachi 2:11</a>). Gratz supposes that in the present passage the scribe discovered his mistake, and wrote the right word "Jerusalem" after the wrong one "Israel," but leaving the latter still in the manuscript. Of course, there is no proof of this supposition. Some manuscripts of the Septuagint omit "Jerusalem" here. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/1-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So I asked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1465;&#1502;&#1463;&#1431;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#333;&#183;mar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
