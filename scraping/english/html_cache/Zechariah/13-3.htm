In the context of Zechariah, this is a time when God is purifying His people and removing idolatry and false teachings. The persistence of false prophecy indicates a rebellion against God's truth. In the broader biblical context, false prophets were a recurring issue in Israel, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>, where false prophecy is condemned.<p><b>his father and mother who bore him will say to him</b><br>The mention of "his father and mother" highlights the seriousness of the offense. In ancient Israelite culture, family loyalty was paramount, and parents were expected to protect and nurture their children. However, the allegiance to God and His commandments supersedes even familial bonds. This reflects the commandment in <a href="/deuteronomy/13-6.htm">Deuteronomy 13:6-11</a>, where even close family members must not be spared if they lead others to idolatry.<p><b>&#8216;You shall not remain alive, because you have spoken falsely in the name of the LORD.&#8217;</b><br>This statement underscores the gravity of speaking falsely in God's name. The use of God's name in vain, especially in prophecy, was a direct violation of the third commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>). The prescribed punishment for false prophecy was death, as it was considered a form of blasphemy and a threat to the spiritual integrity of the community. This reflects the seriousness with which God views the purity of His revelation and the protection of His people from deception.<p><b>When he prophesies, his father and mother who bore him will pierce him through.</b><br>The act of piercing through signifies the execution of judgment. This imagery is stark and emphasizes the complete rejection and eradication of false prophecy. It also symbolizes the internal cleansing of the community, where even those closest to the false prophet must act in obedience to God's law. This can be seen as a type of Christ, who was pierced for our transgressions (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>), highlighting the ultimate judgment and redemption through His sacrifice. The piercing also connects to the broader theme of purification and the removal of sin from among God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet in the post-exilic period who conveyed God's messages to the Israelites, encouraging them to return to God and rebuild the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_prophets.htm">False Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals who claim to speak on behalf of God but deliver messages that are not from Him, leading people astray.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/parents.htm">Parents</a></b><br>The father and mother mentioned in the verse represent the closest familial relationships, emphasizing the seriousness of false prophecy.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, Yahweh, who is the ultimate authority and truth.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/piercing_through.htm">Piercing Through</a></b><br>A metaphorical expression indicating the severe consequences of false prophecy, even to the point of death.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_false_prophecy.htm">The Seriousness of False Prophecy</a></b><br>False prophecy is not a trivial matter; it leads people away from the truth of God.

The earlier prophets continually complain of the favour shown to these deceivers (comp. <a href="/isaiah/9-15.htm">Isaiah 9:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/5-31.htm">Jeremiah 5:31</a>; <a href="/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>); and we never read of the legal punishment being inflicted after due investigation, the test being the nonfulfilment of the prediction (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-22.htm">Deuteronomy 18:22</a>).

The gospel deals more tenderly with heretics (<a href="/luke/9-55.htm">Luke 9:55</a>). "Defendenda religio non est occidendo," says Laetant. ('Div.
