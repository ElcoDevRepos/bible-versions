The "potter" is symbolic, often representing God's sovereignty and authority over creation, as seen in <a href="/jeremiah/18.htm">Jeremiah 18:1-6</a>. The act of throwing the silver to the potter suggests a rejection or disdain for the value placed on the shepherd, which is a prophetic foreshadowing of Judas Iscariot's betrayal of Jesus for thirty pieces of silver (<a href="/matthew/27-3.htm">Matthew 27:3-10</a>). The potter's field, purchased with the returned silver, becomes a burial place for foreigners, fulfilling prophecy and symbolizing the rejection of Christ by His own people.<p><b>this magnificent price at which they valued me.</b><br>The phrase is deeply ironic, as the "magnificent price" is actually a paltry sum, highlighting the contempt and undervaluation of the shepherd, who represents God Himself. In <a href="/exodus/21-32.htm">Exodus 21:32</a>, thirty pieces of silver is the price of a slave, underscoring the insult. This valuation reflects Israel's rejection of God's leadership and foreshadows the betrayal of Jesus, the Good Shepherd, who was also undervalued and betrayed for the same amount.<p><b>So I took the thirty pieces of silver</b><br>Zechariah's action of taking the silver signifies acceptance of the people's valuation, which is a prophetic act symbolizing the future betrayal of Jesus. The thirty pieces of silver are a direct connection to the New Testament account of Judas's betrayal, emphasizing the continuity of God's redemptive plan throughout Scripture.<p><b>and threw them to the potter</b><br>This act of throwing the silver to the potter signifies disdain and rejection. In the New Testament, Judas returns the silver to the temple, and the chief priests use it to buy the potter's field (<a href="/matthew/27-7.htm">Matthew 27:7</a>), fulfilling this prophecy. The act of throwing the silver also symbolizes the ultimate rejection of Christ by the religious leaders of His time.<p><b>in the house of the LORD.</b><br>The location, "in the house of the LORD," underscores the religious and spiritual dimensions of the betrayal. It highlights the hypocrisy and corruption within the religious establishment, as the temple, meant to be a place of worship and reverence, becomes the setting for this transaction. This setting foreshadows the events in the Gospels where the religious leaders conspire against Jesus within the temple precincts, further fulfilling the prophetic imagery of Zechariah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet of the Old Testament, Zechariah is the author of the book bearing his name.

Throughout Scripture God often directs prophets with symbolic acts (<a href="/ezekiel/4-1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1-8</a>; <a href="/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>). Here the command sets up a living illustration of Israel&#8217;s treatment of their Shepherd. <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a> presents Jesus as &#8220;the good shepherd,&#8221; making this scene a foreshadowing of how the nation would respond to Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Throw it to the potter</b><p>God orders that the money be hurled to a potter, echoing Jeremiah&#8217;s trips to the potter&#8217;s house (<a href="/jeremiah/18-1.htm">Jeremiah 18:1-4</a>; 19:1-13) where a shattered vessel pictured judgment. <a href="/matthew/27-7.htm">Matthew 27:7</a> recounts the priests using Judas&#8217;s returned silver to buy &#8220;the potter&#8217;s field as a burial place for foreigners,&#8221; exactly matching the prophecy. <a href="/acts/1-18.htm">Acts 1:18-19</a> reaffirms the event. The potter theme underlines God&#8217;s sovereignty: He shapes clay as He wills (<a href="/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>; <a href="/romans/9-21.htm">Romans 9:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>this magnificent price at which they valued me</b><p>The wording drips with divine sarcasm. Thirty pieces of silver was the compensation for a gored slave (<a href="/exodus/21-32.htm">Exodus 21:32</a>), an insultingly low appraisal for the Shepherd. <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a> says Messiah would be &#8220;despised and rejected.&#8221; <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a> echoes, &#8220;He came to His own, but His own did not receive Him.&#8221; The cheap payment reveals hearts that refuse to honor God&#8217;s chosen Savior.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So I took the thirty pieces of silver</b><p>Zechariah obeys, acting out the insult. Centuries later Judas Iscariot agrees to betray Jesus for the very same amount (<a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>), fulfilling the prophecy in exact detail. After remorse, Judas tries to return the coins (<a href="/matthew/27-3.htm">Matthew 27:3-4</a>), underscoring how hollow the money was.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and threw them to the potter in the house of the LORD</b><p>The prophet flings the coins in the temple, prefiguring Judas&#8217;s action: &#8220;So Judas threw the silver into the temple and left&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/27-5.htm">Matthew 27:5</a>). The priests, unwilling to place &#8220;blood money&#8221; in the treasury, purchase the potter&#8217;s field (<a href="/matthew/27-6.htm">Matthew 27:6-10</a>), welding Zechariah&#8217;s words to historical fulfillment. The house of the LORD, meant for worship, witnesses the rejection of its rightful King (<a href="/luke/19-45.htm">Luke 19:45-46</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/11-13.htm">Zechariah 11:13</a> portrays God&#8217;s Shepherd contemptuously priced at thirty pieces of silver, the slave&#8217;s wage. Commanded to cast the coins to a potter in the temple, the prophet enacts Israel&#8217;s scorn. The scene points unerringly to Jesus Christ: betrayed for the same sum, the silver hurled into the sanctuary, and a potter&#8217;s field bought with the proceeds. The verse exposes humanity&#8217;s undervaluing of the Savior while confirming God&#8217;s sovereign plan and Scripture&#8217;s precise reliability.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord said unto me.</span> The Lord takes the insult as offered to himself in the person of his representative. <span class="cmt_word">Cast it unto the potter;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "Lay them in the foundry, and I will see if it is approved;" Vulgate; <span class="accented">Projice illud ad statuarium</span>; the Syriac and Targum have, "Put it into the treasury" (<a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>). This involves an alteration of the text, and is in itself an improbable reading, as God could not be made to tell the prophet to throw this despicable wage into his treasury, unless, perchance, it is said ironically. There may be an undesigned coincidence here. In <a href="/matthew/27-5.htm">Matthew 27:5</a> the council discuss the propriety of putting the thirty pieces of silver into the treasury. But taking our present text as genuine, commentators usually consider the phrase as a proverbial expression for contemptuous treatment; as the Greeks said, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, as the Germans say, "zum Schinder," "to the knacker," and we, "to the dogs." There is, however, no trace elsewhere of any such proverb, nor do we know how it could have arisen; it likewise does not very well suit the last clause of the verse, "I cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord." If we substitute the supposed analogous expression, "I threw them to the dogs," we see how unseemly would be the proverb in this connection. The rendering of the Jews in old time, adopted recently by Knabenbauer, "Cast them to the Creator," is considered by Dr. Pusey to be unidiomatic, and involves great difficulties. It seems simpler to consider that the command, "cast it to the potter," implies contemptuous rejection of the sum, and at the same time intimates the ultimate destination to which, in the sight of Omniscience, it was directed. The potter is named as the workman who makes the meanest utensils out of the vilest material. That this was ordered and executed in vision is plain; how much the prophet understood we cannot tell. The ambiguous and highly typical order was explained and fulfilled to the letter by the action of Judas Iscariot, as the evangelist testifies (<a href="/matthew/27-5.htm">Matthew 27:5-10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">A</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="cmt_word">goodly price</span>, etc. This is ironical, of course. Such was the price at which they estimated the good Shepherd's services. <span class="cmt_word">Cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord.</span> This rejection of the paltry wage took place in the house of the Lord (in the vision), because the insult had been really offered to him, and this was the natural place where oblations would be made; thus the transaction was represented as formal and national. Whether the potter was seen in the temple we know not. The prophet was made to connect him in some way with the business; and we learn from the fulfilment that the potter did in the end receive the money, which was paid for his field applied to an unclean purpose. In <a href="/matthew/27-9.htm">Matthew 27:9</a> the two verses, 12, 13, with some variations, are quoted as "spoken by Jeremy the prophet." Hence some attribute this part of Zechariah to Jeremiah; and others think that in St. Matthew the present name is a mistake. The probability is that the evangelist did not name any prophet, but that some early transcriber, remembering the purchase of the field in <a href="/jeremiah/32-6.htm">Jeremiah 32:6-12</a>, attributed the quotation to that prophet. Or we may suppose that inspiration did not extend to all minor details, nor save the writers from unimportant errors. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/11-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And the LORD</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1464;&#1436;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(Yah&#183;weh)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3069.htm">Strong's 3069: </a> </span><span class="str2">YHWH</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1448;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
