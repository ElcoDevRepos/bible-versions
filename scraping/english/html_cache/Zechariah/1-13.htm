In the context of Zechariah, this communication comes after a period of silence during the Babylonian exile, highlighting the restoration of the prophetic voice. The LORD's speaking is a reminder of His covenant faithfulness, as seen throughout the Old Testament, where God frequently speaks to guide, correct, and comfort His people (e.g., <a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>, <a href="/exodus/3-4.htm">Exodus 3:4</a>).<p><b>kind and comforting words</b><br>The nature of God's message is one of kindness and comfort, reflecting His compassion and mercy. This is significant given the historical context of the Israelites returning from exile and rebuilding Jerusalem. The words are meant to reassure the people of God's continued presence and support. This echoes other instances in Scripture where God provides comfort, such as <a href="/isaiah/40.htm">Isaiah 40:1-2</a>, where God speaks tenderly to Jerusalem, promising restoration and forgiveness.<p><b>to the angel who was speaking with me</b><br>The angel serves as an intermediary between God and Zechariah, a common role for angels in biblical narratives. This particular angel is part of a series of visions given to Zechariah, acting as a guide and interpreter. The presence of the angel underscores the heavenly origin of the message and the importance of divine revelation. Angels often appear in Scripture to deliver messages or provide assistance, as seen in <a href="/daniel/9-21.htm">Daniel 9:21-23</a> and <a href="/luke/1-26.htm">Luke 1:26-38</a>.<p><b>who was speaking with me</b><br>Zechariah's interaction with the angel highlights the personal nature of prophetic revelation. The phrase indicates an ongoing dialogue, suggesting that Zechariah is not merely a passive recipient but an active participant in understanding God's will. This personal engagement is a hallmark of prophetic literature, where prophets often question, seek clarification, or express concerns, as seen in the dialogues of Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-6.htm">Jeremiah 1:6-10</a>) and Habakkuk (<a href="/habakkuk/1-2.htm">Habakkuk 1:2-4</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet who received visions from God during the post-exilic period, encouraging the Israelites to rebuild the temple and renew their covenant with God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>Refers to Yahweh, the covenant-keeping God of Israel, who communicates His will and comfort to His people through His messengers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>A divine messenger who communicates God's words and visions to Zechariah, serving as an intermediary between God and the prophet.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision.htm">The Vision</a></b><br>This passage is part of a series of visions given to Zechariah, intended to provide hope and assurance to the Israelites after their return from Babylonian exile.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/post-exilic_jerusalem.htm">Post-Exilic Jerusalem</a></b><br>The historical context in which the Israelites are returning to Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile, facing the challenge of rebuilding their city and temple.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_comfort_in_times_of_distress.htm">God's Comfort in Times of Distress</a></b><br>Just as God spoke comforting words to Zechariah, He offers us comfort in our times of distress.
