It suggests a change from previous conditions, highlighting a new era or phase in God's dealings with His people. This transition is often seen in prophetic literature, where God moves from judgment to restoration.<p><b>I will not treat</b><br>This implies a change in God's actions or intentions. Previously, God had allowed consequences for Israel's disobedience, such as exile and suffering. The phrase suggests a move towards mercy and grace, aligning with God's character as both just and compassionate.<p><b>the remnant of this people</b><br>The term "remnant" refers to a small, surviving group of people. In biblical context, it often denotes those who remain faithful to God despite widespread unfaithfulness. This concept is significant throughout the Old Testament, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a> and <a href="/micah/5-7.htm">Micah 5:7-8</a>, where the remnant is preserved for future blessing and restoration.<p><b>as I did in the past,&#8221;</b><br>This phrase recalls the previous judgments and hardships faced by Israel, such as the Babylonian exile. It underscores the contrast between past punishment and future blessing. Historical context includes the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, which were consequences of Israel's disobedience.<p><b>declares the LORD of Hosts.</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power. It is often used in contexts where God is portrayed as a divine warrior or leader of heavenly armies. This declaration assures the people of God's authority and ability to fulfill His promises. The use of this title connects to other scriptures, such as <a href="/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a> and <a href="/psalms/46-7.htm">Psalm 46:7</a>, where God's might and protection are highlighted.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet who ministered to the Jewish people after their return from Babylonian exile.
