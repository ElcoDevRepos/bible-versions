The personification of wickedness as a woman may reflect the cultural context of the time, where female figures were often used to represent abstract concepts. This vision is part of a series of symbolic visions given to Zechariah to convey God's message to the Israelites. The declaration "This is Wickedness" emphasizes the moral corruption and sin that had infiltrated the land, which God was addressing through these visions. The use of the term "wickedness" connects to other biblical passages that speak of sin and iniquity, such as <a href="/proverbs/6-12.htm">Proverbs 6:12-19</a>, which lists things the Lord hates, including a heart that devises wicked plans.<p><b>And he shoved her down into the basket,</b><br>The act of shoving the woman into the basket signifies the containment and control of wickedness. This imagery suggests that God is taking action to restrain and limit the influence of sin among His people. The basket, or ephah, was a common measure used in trade, symbolizing commerce and daily life, indicating that wickedness had permeated everyday activities. This action can be seen as a precursor to the ultimate judgment and eradication of sin, as prophesied in the eschatological visions of Revelation, where evil is finally defeated.<p><b>pushing down the lead cover over its opening.</b><br>The lead cover represents a heavy and secure seal, ensuring that wickedness is contained and cannot escape. Lead, being a dense and weighty material, symbolizes the seriousness and finality of God's judgment against sin. This imagery parallels the sealing of the abyss in <a href="/revelation/20.htm">Revelation 20:1-3</a>, where Satan is bound and sealed for a thousand years, highlighting God's sovereign power to restrain evil. The act of sealing wickedness also points to the future hope of a restored creation, free from the corruption of sin, as promised in the prophetic visions of a new heaven and a new earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet of the post-exilic period, Zechariah was instrumental in encouraging the Jewish people to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem after their return from Babylonian exile.

It is very common to find backsliding Israel represented as a faithless and adulterous woman (comp. <a href="/isaiah/1-21.htm">Isaiah 1:21</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-5.htm">Hosea 2:5</a>; and the parable of the two women in <a href="/ezekiel/23.htm">Ezekiel 23</a>.). <span class="cmt_word">He cast it;</span> <span class="accented">her</span> - the woman. As the woman rose, or tried to rise, from the ephah, the angel flung her down into it. It is possible, as some commentators suppose, that the ephah into which wickedness is thrust represents the measure of iniquity which, being reached, constrains God to punish (see <a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>, where the dispossession of the Amorites is postponed till their iniquity is full). <span class="cmt_word">The weight of lead;</span> literally, as the LXX., <span class="accented">the stone of lead</span>; Vulgate<span class="accented">, massam plumbeam.</span> This is the cover of the ephah, that which is called the "talent of lead" in the preceding verse. This heavy cover the angel cast upon the mouth of the ephah, in order to confine the woman therein (comp. <a href="/genesis/29-2.htm">Genesis 29:2</a>, which passage may explain why the cover is called "a stone"). Dr. Wright and some other commentators, referring the passage to theft and perjury alone, consider that the woman held in her hand the leaden weight with which she weighed her gains, and was sitting in the ephah which she used in her traffic; so that she represents dishonesty in the matter of weight and measure. She is punished by the means of the instruments she had used unrighteously; the weight is dashed upon her lying mouth, and the ephah, her throne, is made the vehicle that carries her out of the land. But it seems a mistake to confine the iniquity mentioned to the two special sins of theft and perjury; nor would the talent and the ephah be natural instruments of stealing and false swearing; and the point of the vision is not the punishment of wickedness, but its expulsion from the land. It is true that the pronominal suffix in the mouth thereof is feminine, and that the LXX. makes it refer to the woman, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>.
