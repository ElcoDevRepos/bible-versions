Historically, this reflects a period when Israel faced consequences for their disobedience and idolatry. The "people of the land" refers to the inhabitants of Israel, who were often warned by prophets about the repercussions of turning away from God. This echoes earlier warnings found in <a href="/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17</a>, where God speaks of hiding His face due to the people's sins.<p><b>but behold, I will cause each man to fall into the hands of his neighbor and his king</b><br>This suggests internal strife and external oppression. The phrase "each man to fall into the hands of his neighbor" implies civil discord and societal breakdown, reminiscent of the chaos described in <a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>, where everyone did what was right in their own eyes. The reference to "his king" points to foreign domination, as seen in the Babylonian and Assyrian captivities, where foreign rulers exerted control over Israel.<p><b>who will devastate the land</b><br>The devastation of the land signifies both physical destruction and spiritual desolation. Historically, this can be linked to the invasions and exiles that Israel experienced, such as the Babylonian conquest. Theologically, it reflects the consequences of breaking the covenant with God, as outlined in <a href="/leviticus/26-32.htm">Leviticus 26:32-33</a>, where disobedience leads to the land becoming desolate.<p><b>and I will not deliver it from their hands.</b><br>This final phrase underscores the severity of the judgment, where God chooses not to intervene. It highlights the seriousness of divine justice when the covenant is broken. This is a sobering reminder of the consequences of persistent rebellion against God, as seen in the exile narratives of <a href="/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24-25</a>. It also contrasts with the hope of deliverance found in other prophetic texts, such as <a href="/isaiah/43.htm">Isaiah 43:1-2</a>, where God promises redemption to a repentant people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet in the post-exilic period who conveyed God's messages to the Israelites.

God had repeatedly intervened (<a href="/judges/2-18.htm">Judges 2:18</a>; <a href="/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a>), but persistent hardness shuts the door to immediate relief (<a href="/proverbs/1-24.htm">Proverbs 1:24-28</a>).<p>&#8226; The warning carries a call to repentance: only turning back to the Lord can re-open the way to deliverance (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/11-6.htm">Zechariah 11:6</a> lays out a solemn progression: when a covenant people harden their hearts, God may lift His hand of compassion, allow societal breakdown, empower flawed leaders to oppress, and withhold rescue until repentance occurs. The verse is a sober reminder that divine mercy is precious, that sin carries real consequences, and that trusting in the Lord&#8217;s character&#8212;both just and merciful&#8212;is the only secure refuge.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The inhabitants of the land</span>. It is a question whether by this expression is meant the Israelites, or the dwellers on earth generally. In the former ease, the verso gives the reason of the calamities depicted in ver. 5, viz. God's displeasure, and expounds the parable of the sheep as meaning men (so Cheyne). In the other case, the signification of the paragraph is that God intends to put an end to the state of things just described, by punishing the oppressing world powers who had so cruelly executed their office of being instruments of God's judgment on his people. The latter seems the correct exposition; for the people of Israel have just been called the flock of slaughter, and they were to be fed, while these "inhabitants" are to be destroyed; nor could the Israelites be said to have kings, as just below. Thus for, at the beginning of the verse, introduces the reason why Jehovah tells the shepherd to feed the flock, because he is about to punish their oppressors; and "the inhabitants of the land" should be "the inhabitants of the earth;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the nations of the world, among whom the Israelites lived. <span class="cmt_word">I will deliver the men,</span> etc. God will give up the nations to intestine commotions and civil war, so that they shall fall by mutual slaughter. <span class="cmt_word">Into the hand of his king.</span> Each of them shall be delivered over helpless unto their tyrant's hands, and God will not interpose to succour them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/11-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1440;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I will no</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1500;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(l&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb - Negative particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3808.htm">Strong's 3808: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, no</span><br /><br /><span class="word">longer</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1435;&#1493;&#1465;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#333;&#183;w&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5750.htm">Strong's 5750: </a> </span><span class="str2">Iteration, continuance, again, repeatedly, still, more</span><br /><br /><span class="word">have compassion</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1495;&#1456;&#1502;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1500;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;e&#7717;&#183;m&#333;&#183;wl)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperfect - first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2550.htm">Strong's 2550: </a> </span><span class="str2">To commiserate, to spare</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;al-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5921.htm">Strong's 5921: </a> </span><span class="str2">Above, over, upon, against</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the people</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1465;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1489;&#1461;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#333;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;&#7687;&#234;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine plural construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3427.htm">Strong's 3427: </a> </span><span class="str2">To sit down, to dwell, to remain, to settle, to marry</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the land,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1430;&#1512;&#1462;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;re&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
