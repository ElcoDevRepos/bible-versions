His leadership in laying the foundation signifies the restoration of worship and the re-establishment of the Jewish community in Jerusalem. This act fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/haggai/2-23.htm">Haggai 2:23</a>, where Zerubbabel is chosen as a signet ring, symbolizing God's authority and approval. The foundation laying is a physical manifestation of God's promise to restore His people and their place of worship.<p><b>and his hands will complete it</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the assurance of divine support in completing the temple. Despite opposition and delays, Zerubbabel is assured that the work he started will be finished. This completion is a testament to God's faithfulness and the perseverance of His people. It also prefigures the ultimate completion of God's redemptive work through Jesus Christ, who is referred to as the cornerstone in <a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>, signifying the foundation and completion of the spiritual temple, the Church.<p><b>Then you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent me to you</b><br>The completion of the temple serves as a sign of divine intervention and validation of the prophetic message. The title "LORD of Hosts" underscores God's sovereignty and power over all heavenly and earthly armies, assuring the people of His protection and provision. This phrase connects to the broader theme of recognizing God's hand in historical events, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/45-3.htm">Isaiah 45:3</a>, where God reveals Himself through His actions.

God publicly acknowledges their initial obedience, reminding them that even small beginnings are precious in His sight (<a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his hands will complete it</b><p>&#8226; The same hands that set the first stones will set the finishing stones; God promises continuity and completion (<a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a> applies this principle broadly: &#8220;He who began a good work in you will perfect it&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The assurance answers discouragement that arose during the long construction pause (<a href="/ezra/4-24.htm">Ezra 4:24</a>). By highlighting Zerubbabel&#8217;s own hands, the Lord pledges personal success&#8212;not a successor, not a foreign ally, but the leader presently in view will see the job through.<p>&#8226; This pledge reflects the unbroken chain of God&#8217;s covenant faithfulness&#8212;from foundation to capstone&#8212;mirroring earlier temple patterns (<a href="/1_kings/6-14.htm">1 Kings 6:14</a>, &#8220;So Solomon built the house and finished it&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent me to you</b><p>&#8226; Completion of the temple becomes the sign validating the prophetic word given through Zechariah, just as the fulfillment of Moses&#8217; signs authenticated his mission (<a href="/exodus/4-5.htm">Exodus 4:5</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;LORD of Hosts&#8221; highlights God&#8217;s sovereign power over every earthly obstacle (<a href="/isaiah/44-24.htm">Isaiah 44:24-28</a>, where He stirs Cyrus to rebuild Jerusalem). When the temple stands finished, the people will see that the Almighty Commander&#8212;not human resolve&#8212;secured the victory.<p>&#8226; The phrase also foreshadows a broader recognition: restored worship in a rebuilt temple will testify to surrounding nations that Israel&#8217;s God lives and acts (<a href="/psalms/126-1.htm">Psalm 126:1-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/4-9.htm">Zechariah 4:9</a> offers a threefold promise: God honors past obedience, guarantees future completion, and ties both to His own reputation. By assuring that Zerubbabel will finish what he started, the Lord silences discouragement, magnifies His covenant faithfulness, and furnishes a visible proof that He truly sent His prophet. For believers today, the verse affirms that the God who empowers beginnings also secures endings, and every completed work of His grace becomes living evidence that He is present, active, and utterly trustworthy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Have laid the foundation.</span> Zerubbabel had commenced the rebuilding in the second year of the return, in the second month (<a href="/ezra/3-8.htm">Ezra 3:8</a>); it had been hindered by the opposition of the neighbouring people (<a href="/ezra/4-1.htm">Ezra 4:1-5, 24</a>), and was not resumed till the second year of Darius. <span class="cmt_word">Shall finish it.</span> The temple was finished in Darius's sixth year (<a href="/ezra/6-15.htm">Ezra 6:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt know,</span> etc. The truth of the angel's mission would be proved by the event, viz. the successful issue (comp. ch. 2:9, 11; 6:15; <a href="/deuteronomy/18-22.htm">Deuteronomy 18:22</a>).
