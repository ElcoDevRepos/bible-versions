It is a time when God will establish His kingdom and bring about significant changes in the world. This concept is prevalent in prophetic literature, indicating a time of both judgment and restoration.<p><b>living water will flow out from Jerusalem</b><br>The imagery of "living water" symbolizes spiritual renewal and life. In biblical terms, living water often refers to water that is fresh, flowing, and life-giving, as opposed to stagnant water. This can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual blessings and eternal life that come from God. In the New Testament, Jesus refers to Himself as the source of living water (<a href="/john/4-10.htm">John 4:10-14</a>), indicating a connection between this prophecy and the messianic age.<p><b>half of it toward the Eastern Sea</b><br>The Eastern Sea is commonly understood to be the Dead Sea. The idea of water flowing into the Dead Sea, which is known for its high salinity and lack of life, suggests a miraculous transformation. This could symbolize the restoration and healing that will occur in the world, as the life-giving water from Jerusalem brings renewal even to the most desolate places.<p><b>and the other half toward the Western Sea</b><br>The Western Sea is typically identified as the Mediterranean Sea. The flow of water in both directions from Jerusalem signifies abundance and the far-reaching impact of God's blessings. It also highlights Jerusalem's central role in God's plan, serving as the source of spiritual nourishment for the entire world.<p><b>in summer and winter alike</b><br>This phrase indicates the continuous and unending nature of the blessings that will flow from Jerusalem. Unlike natural water sources that may dry up or freeze depending on the season, this living water is constant and reliable. It underscores the eternal and unchanging nature of God's provision and presence, reflecting the promise of perpetual peace and prosperity in the messianic kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central city in biblical prophecy, often symbolizing God's presence and the spiritual center for His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/living_waters.htm">Living Waters</a></b><br>Symbolic of life, purity, and the Holy Spirit, representing spiritual renewal and blessing.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/eastern_sea.htm">Eastern Sea</a></b><br>Commonly understood as the Dead Sea, representing the arid and lifeless areas that will be revitalized.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/western_sea.htm">Western Sea</a></b><br>Typically the Mediterranean Sea, symbolizing the reach of God's blessings to the ends of the earth.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/summer_and_winter.htm">Summer and Winter</a></b><br>Indicating the continuous and unending nature of God's provision and blessing, regardless of season.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_living_waters.htm">Symbolism of Living Waters</a></b><br>The living waters represent the Holy Spirit and the life-giving power of God.
