This particular angel is a divine intermediary, conveying God's message to Zechariah. Angels frequently appear in prophetic literature, such as in Daniel and Revelation, to provide clarity and understanding of God's plans.<p><b>Proclaim this word:</b><br>The command to "proclaim" indicates the importance and urgency of the message. Prophets in the Old Testament were often tasked with delivering God's word to His people, serving as His mouthpiece. This proclamation is not just for Zechariah but for the entire community of Israel, emphasizing the communal nature of God's communication.<p><b>This is what the LORD of Hosts says:</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" underscores God's sovereignty and power. It is a military term, reflecting God's command over the armies of heaven and earth. This title is used frequently in the prophetic books to remind the people of God's ultimate authority and ability to fulfill His promises.<p><b>&#8216;I am very jealous for Jerusalem and Zion,</b><br>God's jealousy is not like human jealousy; it is a zealous protection and deep commitment to His people and His chosen city. Jerusalem and Zion are central to God's covenantal promises. Jerusalem is the physical city, while Zion often represents the spiritual and eschatological hope of God's people. This phrase reflects God's enduring love and commitment to restore and protect His people and their land. The jealousy of God is also seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/exodus/34-14.htm">Exodus 34:14</a>, where God desires exclusive devotion from His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet who received visions from God, tasked with encouraging the Israelites during the rebuilding of the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>A divine messenger who communicates God's message to Zechariah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>A title for God emphasizing His sovereignty and command over the heavenly armies.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The central city of worship for the Israelites, representing God's chosen people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/z/zion.htm">Zion</a></b><br>Often synonymous with Jerusalem, it represents the spiritual and physical center of God's covenant with Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_jealousy_reflects_his_love.htm">God's Jealousy Reflects His Love</a></b><br>God's jealousy is not like human envy; it is a passionate commitment to His people and His covenant.
