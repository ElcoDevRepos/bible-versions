The command to be silent is a common biblical motif, seen in passages like <a href="/habakkuk/2-20.htm">Habakkuk 2:20</a>, where silence is a response to God's holiness and sovereignty. It reflects a posture of humility and awe, recognizing that human words are inadequate in the presence of the divine. The call to "all people" indicates the universal scope of God's authority, transcending national and ethnic boundaries, and underscores the idea that all humanity is accountable to Him.<p><b>for He has roused Himself</b><br>This suggests a divine awakening or action, indicating that God is about to intervene in human affairs. The imagery of God rousing Himself can be seen in other scriptures, such as <a href="/psalms/44-23.htm">Psalm 44:23</a>, where God is called to awaken and act on behalf of His people. It implies a shift from a period of waiting or apparent inactivity to decisive action. This phrase can be understood in the context of God's covenant faithfulness, as He prepares to fulfill His promises to Israel and bring about His purposes in history.<p><b>from His holy dwelling</b><br>God's "holy dwelling" refers to His heavenly abode, often depicted as a temple or throne room in biblical literature. This imagery is consistent with passages like <a href="/isaiah/6.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>, where God is seen seated on a throne, high and exalted. The holiness of God's dwelling underscores His purity and separateness from sin. The mention of His holy dwelling highlights the transcendence of God, yet also His immanence, as He chooses to engage with the world. This phrase connects to the theme of God's presence with His people, as seen in the tabernacle and temple, and ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ, who is described as the true temple in <a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, representing God as the sovereign ruler who commands reverence and awe.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/all_people.htm">All People</a></b><br>Refers to all humanity, emphasizing the universal call to silence and reverence before God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/holy_dwelling.htm">Holy Dwelling</a></b><br>Symbolizes God's heavenly abode, indicating His divine presence and authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god.htm">Reverence for God</a></b><br>Recognize the importance of approaching God with a heart of reverence and awe.
