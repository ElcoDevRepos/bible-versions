It signifies a future event when God will act decisively in history. The phrase is common in prophetic books, emphasizing God's sovereignty and the certainty of His plans.<p><b>I will strike every horse with panic</b><br>Horses were a symbol of military power and strength in ancient times. Striking them with panic suggests a divine disruption of military capabilities. This reflects God's ability to undermine human power and control, as seen in other biblical accounts like the confusion of armies in <a href="/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24</a>.<p><b>and every rider with madness</b><br>This indicates a psychological disarray among the enemies of God's people.

It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Judah, reminiscent of passages like <a href="/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a>, where God is described as the vigilant keeper of Israel.<p><b>but I will strike with blindness all the horses of the nations</b><br>Blindness here symbolizes a complete inability to function or perceive, rendering the military forces of the nations ineffective. This mirrors the divine judgment seen in other scriptures, such as the blinding of the Arameans in <a href="/2_kings/6-18.htm">2 Kings 6:18</a>.
