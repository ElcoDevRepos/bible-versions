These warriors were known for their strength, courage, and loyalty. The context here suggests a divine empowerment, where ordinary people are transformed into formidable fighters. Historically, Israel often faced enemies with superior numbers and technology, yet with God's help, they achieved victory. This transformation can also be seen as a type of the spiritual empowerment believers receive through the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><b>trampling the enemy in the mire of the streets</b><br>The imagery of trampling suggests a decisive and overwhelming victory. Streets filled with mire indicate a chaotic and defeated enemy, unable to stand firm. This can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual battles believers face, where God grants victory over sin and evil. The historical context of ancient warfare often involved battles in city streets, where the terrain could become treacherous, symbolizing the complete rout of the enemy.<p><b>They will fight because the LORD is with them</b><br>The assurance of God's presence is a recurring theme in Scripture, providing strength and courage (<a href="/joshua/1-9.htm">Joshua 1:9</a>). This phrase underscores the source of the warriors' confidence and success. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and His people, where His presence ensures victory. This divine accompaniment is a foreshadowing of the promise of Emmanuel, "God with us," fulfilled in Jesus Christ (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>).<p><b>and they will put the horsemen to shame</b><br>Horsemen were considered elite forces in ancient warfare, representing speed, strength, and strategic advantage. To put them to shame indicates a reversal of expectations, where the seemingly weaker force triumphs over the stronger. This echoes the biblical theme of God using the weak to confound the strong (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>). It also points to the ultimate victory of Christ over the powers of darkness, where He disarms principalities and powers (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mighty_men.htm">Mighty Men</a></b><br>Refers to the Israelites who are empowered by God to overcome their enemies.
