This particular angel is a divine guide, providing insight and understanding to the prophet. Angels frequently appear in biblical narratives to deliver God's messages, as seen in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a> with Abraham and in <a href="/luke/1.htm">Luke 1</a> with Mary. The presence of the angel underscores the divine origin and authority of the vision.<p><b>returned and woke me</b><br>The return of the angel suggests a continuation of a previous interaction, indicating that Zechariah is in an ongoing process of receiving divine revelation. The act of waking implies that Zechariah was in a state of spiritual or prophetic slumber, which is a common motif in scripture to describe a lack of awareness or understanding. This awakening is symbolic of enlightenment and readiness to receive God's message, similar to how God calls Samuel in <a href="/1_samuel/3.htm">1 Samuel 3</a>.<p><b>as a man is awakened from his sleep</b><br>This simile emphasizes the suddenness and clarity of the awakening. Sleep often represents a state of unawareness or inactivity in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/romans/13-11.htm">Romans 13:11</a>, where believers are urged to wake from sleep because salvation is near. The awakening signifies a transition from ignorance to understanding, preparing Zechariah to comprehend the vision that follows. This imagery also foreshadows the spiritual awakening that Christ brings, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a>, where believers are called to rise from the dead and let Christ shine on them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet of the post-exilic period, Zechariah is the recipient of visions from God, intended to encourage the Jewish people during the rebuilding of the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>A divine messenger who communicates God's visions and messages to Zechariah.

But the expression in the text is probably only equivalent to "aroused me again" (comp. <a href="/genesis/26-18.htm">Genesis 26:18</a>; <a href="/2_kings/1-11.htm">2 Kings 1:11, 13</a>, etc.). Absorbed in awe and wonder at the contemplation of the preceding vision, the prophet had fallen into a state of exhaustion and torpor, as Daniel slept after his great visions (<a href="/daniel/8-18.htm">Daniel 8:18</a>; <a href="/daniel/10-8.htm">Daniel 10:8, 9</a>), and the apostles were heavy with sleep on the Mount of Transfiguration (<a href="/luke/9-32.htm">Luke 9:32</a>). From this mental prostration the angel arouses him to renewed attention. Or what is meant may be that the change wrought on the faculties by the Divine influence was as great as that between natural sleeping and waking. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/4-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then the angel</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1502;&#1468;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1430;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(ham&#183;mal&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4397.htm">Strong's 4397: </a> </span><span class="str2">A messenger, of God, an angel</span><br /><br /><span class="word">who was speaking</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1491;&#1468;&#1465;&#1489;&#1461;&#1443;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(had&#183;d&#333;&#183;&#7687;&#234;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Verb - Qal - Participle - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1696.htm">Strong's 1696: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arrange, to speak, to subdue</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with me</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1425;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/.htm">Strong's Hebrew</a> </span><span class="str2"></span><br /><br /><span class="word">returned</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1464;&#1429;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#257;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7725.htm">Strong's 7725: </a> </span><span class="str2">To turn back, in, to retreat, again</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and woke me,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1506;&#1460;&#1497;&#1512;&#1461;&#1429;&#1504;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;&#8216;&#238;&#183;r&#234;&#183;n&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Hifil - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular &#124; first person common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5782.htm">Strong's 5782: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rouse oneself, awake</span><br /><br /><span class="word">as a man</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1488;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#601;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-k &#124; Noun - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_376.htm">Strong's 376: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man as an individual, a male person</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is awakened</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1461;&#1506;&#1445;&#1493;&#1465;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#234;&#183;&#8216;&#333;&#183;wr)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Nifal - Imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5782.htm">Strong's 5782: </a> </span><span class="str2">To rouse oneself, awake</span><br /><br /><span class="word">from his sleep.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1468;&#1456;&#1504;&#1464;&#1514;&#1469;&#1493;&#1465;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(mi&#353;&#183;&#353;&#601;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#7791;&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition-m &#124; Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8142.htm">Strong's 8142: </a> </span><span class="str2">Sleep</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/zechariah/4-1.htm">Zechariah 4:1 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/zechariah/4-1.htm">OT Prophets: Zechariah 4:1 The angel who talked with me came (Zech.
