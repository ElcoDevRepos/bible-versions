The imagery of God "camping" suggests a military encampment, emphasizing divine protection. In the historical context, this could refer to the period after the Babylonian exile when the temple was being rebuilt. Theologically, it reflects God's covenant promise to be with His people, reminiscent of His presence in the tabernacle during the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/40-34.htm">Exodus 40:34-38</a>).<p><b>because of an army,</b><br>The "army" likely refers to the foreign powers that threatened Israel throughout its history, such as the Babylonians, Persians, or Greeks. This phrase underscores the constant threat of invasion and oppression faced by Israel. It also highlights God's role as a divine warrior who defends His people against their enemies, a theme seen throughout the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/exodus/15-3.htm">Exodus 15:3</a>).<p><b>because of those who march to and fro,</b><br>This phrase suggests the movement of hostile forces around Israel, possibly indicating the frequent invasions and conflicts in the region. Historically, Israel was situated at a crossroads of major empires, making it a strategic and contested area. The phrase may also symbolize the restlessness and instability of the nations compared to the stability provided by God's protection.<p><b>and never again will an oppressor overrun My people,</b><br>This promise of deliverance from oppression is a recurring theme in prophetic literature. It points to a future time of peace and security for Israel, often associated with the Messianic age. Theologically, it reflects God's justice and His commitment to liberate His people from bondage, as seen in the Exodus narrative (<a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7-8</a>).<p><b>for now I keep watch with My own eyes.</b><br>God's vigilance is emphasized here, indicating His active and personal involvement in the affairs of His people. This assurance of divine oversight provides comfort and hope, affirming that God sees and responds to the needs of His people. It connects to the broader biblical theme of God's omniscience and care, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/121-4.htm">Psalm 121:4</a>, where God is described as the one who neither slumbers nor sleeps.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet in the Old Testament who conveyed God's messages to the Israelites during the post-exilic period.

The phrase, "him that passeth by and him that returneth," is used of an enemy making incursions, or attacking at various points (see note on Zechariah 7:14). The Vulgate gives the whole clause thus: <span class="accented">Circumdabo domum meam ex his, qui militant mihi euntes et revertentes</span>, "I will defend my house with a guard chosen from those who serve me and do my will," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> angels. But this seems far from the signification of the Hebrew. Pusey restricts the meaning to the proceedings of Alexander, who passed by Judaea on his way to Egypt, and returned by the same route, without doing any injury to Jerusalem. Here comes in the Talmudic story related by Josephus ('Ant.,' 11:08). The Jews "repaid the protection of Persia with a devoted loyalty, which prompted them to refuse the demand of submission made by Alexander during the siege of Tyre. He marched to chastise them after the fall of Gaza, and the beautiful city had already risen before his view on the hill of Zion, when he found the high priest Jaddua waiting his approach at the watch station of Sapha, clad in his robes of gold and purple, and followed by a train of priests and citizens in pure white. The conqueror bowed in reverence to the Holy Name upon the high priest's frontlet; and, being asked by Parmenio the reason of his conduct, said that in a dream at Dium, he had seen the God of Jaddua, who encouraged him to pass over into Asia, and promised him success. Then entering Jerusalem, he offered sacrifice in the temple, heard the prophecy of Daniel about himself; and granted certain privileges to all the Jews throughout his empire. The desire to honour a shrine so celebrated as, the Jewish temple is quite in accordance with the conduct of Alexander at Ilium and Ephesus, Gordium and Tyre. The privileges he is said to have conferred upon the Jews were enjoyed under his successors, and some minor matters have been adduced in confirmation of the story. On the other hand, the classical writers are entirely silent on the subject, and the details of Josephus involve grave historical inconsistencies. It seems not an unreasonable conjecture that the story is an embellishment of some incident that occurred when the high priest came to Gaza to tender the submission of the Jews. But we must not dismiss it without a remark on the vast influence which the conquests of Alexander had in bringing the Jews into closer relations with the rest of Asia, and so preparing them to fulfil their ultimate destiny as Christians" (P. Smith, 'History of the World,' 1:60, etc). <span class="cmt_word">Oppressor</span>. The word is used for "taskmaster" in <a href="/exodus/3-7.htm">Exodus 3:7</a>.
