In the historical context, this can be seen as a critique of the leaders and foreign nations who took advantage of Israel. The lack of remorse indicates a hardened heart, reminiscent of the Pharaoh in Exodus who oppressed the Israelites without pity. This also foreshadows the treatment of Jesus, the Good Shepherd, who was betrayed and "slaughtered" by those who should have recognized His value.<p><b>Those who sell them say, &#8216;Blessed be the LORD, for I am rich!&#8217;</b><br>Here, the sellers represent corrupt leaders or false prophets who profit from the exploitation of the people. Their declaration of being blessed by the LORD while engaging in unjust practices highlights their hypocrisy and self-deception. This echoes the warnings in the Old Testament against those who exploit others for personal gain, such as in <a href="/amos/8-4.htm">Amos 8:4-6</a>. It also serves as a reminder of Jesus' teachings in the New Testament about the dangers of wealth and the deceitfulness of riches (<a href="/matthew/19-23.htm">Matthew 19:23-24</a>).<p><b>Even their own shepherds have no compassion on them.</b><br>The shepherds symbolize the leaders and spiritual guides of the people, who are expected to care for and protect their flock. The absence of compassion indicates a failure in their duty, aligning with the prophetic critiques found in <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>, where God condemns the shepherds of Israel for neglecting their responsibilities. This lack of compassion contrasts with Jesus, the ultimate Shepherd, who is moved with compassion for the lost and harassed (<a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>). The failure of these shepherds underscores the need for the coming of the true Shepherd, who will lay down His life for the sheep (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/buyers.htm">Buyers</a></b><br>These are individuals or groups who exploit and harm others for personal gain, representing those who take advantage of the vulnerable.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sellers.htm">Sellers</a></b><br>These are those who profit from the exploitation of others, often justifying their actions with a false sense of piety or divine approval.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/shepherds.htm">Shepherds</a></b><br>Symbolic of leaders or those in positions of authority who neglect their duty of care and compassion towards those they are responsible for.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant name of God, invoked by the sellers in a hypocritical manner to justify their unjust actions.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_flock.htm">The Flock</a></b><br>Represents the people of Israel, or more broadly, those who are vulnerable and oppressed.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_exploitation.htm">The Danger of Exploitation</a></b><br>This verse warns against the exploitation of others for personal gain.

The verse in question describes three groups abusing the flock&#8212;buyers, sellers, and shepherds. The flock pictures God&#8217;s covenant people in a season of discipline for rejecting their true Shepherd (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-2</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37-38</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Whose buyers slaughter them without remorse</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Those who buy them slaughter them and go unpunished&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/11-5.htm">Zechariah 11:5</a>a).<p>&#8226; The buyers represent outside powers&#8212;political occupiers, profiteers, or any force that treats the people as expendable property.<p>&#8226; In Zechariah&#8217;s day this pointed to foreign rulers who would eventually devastate Israel (e.g., Rome in A.D. 70, <a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41-44</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture echoes this heartless exploitation:<p>&#8211; Jeremiah laments, &#8220;Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/12-10.htm">Jeremiah 12:10</a>).<p>&#8211; Jesus warns, &#8220;The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<p>&#8226; God sees every injustice; though the buyers &#8220;go unpunished&#8221; for a season, divine judgment is certain (<a href="/psalms/94-3.htm">Psalm 94:3-7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Those who sell them say, &#8220;Blessed be the LORD, for I am rich!&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Those who sell them say, &#8216;Blessed be the LORD, for I am rich!&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/11-5.htm">Zechariah 11:5</a>b).<p>&#8226; These sellers are middle-men&#8212;corrupt elites within the nation who hand God&#8217;s people over for profit yet cloak their greed with pious language.<p>&#8226; Comparable sins appear throughout Scripture:<p>&#8211; <a href="/amos/2-6.htm">Amos 2:6</a>: &#8220;They sell the righteous for silver.&#8221;<p>&#8211; <a href="/matthew/26-14.htm">Matthew 26:14-16</a>: Judas agrees to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver, fulfilling <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>.<p>&#8226; The irony is chilling: they invoke God&#8217;s name to legitimize their gain (cf. <a href="/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>), revealing a heart that prizes wealth over covenant loyalty.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Even their own shepherds have no compassion on them</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Even their own shepherds do not spare them&#8221; (<a href="/zechariah/11-5.htm">Zechariah 11:5</a>c).<p>&#8226; Shepherds symbolize kings, priests, prophets, or any leaders charged to protect the flock (<a href="/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-4</a> lays the charge bluntly: &#8220;Woe to the shepherds&#8230; you eat the fat, you clothe yourselves with the wool, but you do not feed the flock.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus contrasts such hirelings with Himself: &#8220;The hired hand&#8230; sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-12.htm">John 10:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Lack of compassion from inside the community compounds the external oppression, leaving the flock doubly vulnerable.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Prophetic fulfillment and ongoing relevance</b><p>&#8226; Historically, the prophecy foreshadows the nation&#8217;s rejection of Christ and the devastation that followed (<a href="/zechariah/11-10.htm">Zechariah 11:10-14</a>; <a href="/matthew/27-3.htm">Matthew 27:3-10</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, it warns every generation:<p>&#8211; External forces may exploit God&#8217;s people.<p>&#8211; Religious and civil leaders can mask greed with god-talk.<p>&#8211; Indifference among shepherds invites ruin (<a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29-30</a>).<p>&#8226; The Good Shepherd ultimately judges false shepherds and gathers a remnant who listen to His voice (<a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14-16</a>; <a href="/revelation/7-17.htm">Revelation 7:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/11-5.htm">Zechariah 11:5</a> paints a sober scene: foreign buyers kill the flock without fear, internal sellers profit while praising God, and appointed shepherds look on unfeelingly. The verse exposes greed, hypocrisy, and failed leadership, predicting the national catastrophe that follows Israel&#8217;s rejection of her Messiah. It also stands as a timeless warning&#8212;wherever God&#8217;s people are commodified, exploited, or poorly led, the LORD sees, grieves, and will act. Safety lies only under the care of the true Shepherd who lays down His life for the sheep.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Possessors</span>; or, <span class="accented">buyers.</span> Those who claimed to be owners by right of purchase. <span class="cmt_word">Hold themselves not guilty.</span> They are so blinded by self-interest that they see no sin in thus treating the flock.

The prophet is speaking of chiefs and rulers, civil and ecclesiastical, who played into the enemies' hands, and thought of nothing but how to make a gain of the subject people. Our Lord denounces such untrustworthy shepherds (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-13</a>). Doubtless, too, the expressions in the text refer to the foreign powers which had oppressed the Jews at various times, Egypt, Assyria, etc. Amid all such distresses, from whatever cause, God still had tender care for his people, and punished and will punish their enemies. In this verse the offenders against Israel are of three classes - buyers, sellers, shepherds (see ver. 8).
