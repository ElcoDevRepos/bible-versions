The "mountain valley" could refer to a literal geographical feature, possibly the Mount of Olives, which is mentioned earlier in the chapter. This imagery evokes the idea of God creating a path of safety, reminiscent of the parting of the Red Sea in <a href="/exodus/14-21.htm">Exodus 14:21-22</a>. The mountain valley signifies God's control over nature and His ability to protect His people in times of distress.<p><b>for it will extend to Azal</b><br>Azal is a location that is not clearly identified in modern geography, but it is believed to be near Jerusalem. The extension of the valley to Azal indicates a significant geographical change, possibly a miraculous event. This could symbolize the far-reaching impact of God's deliverance. The mention of Azal emphasizes the completeness of the escape route provided by God, ensuring safety for His people.<p><b>You will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah</b><br>This reference to an earthquake during King Uzziah's reign (mentioned in <a href="/amos/1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>) serves as a historical anchor, reminding the audience of a past event that was well-known for its severity. The comparison suggests that the future event will be equally momentous, prompting a similar reaction of urgency and fear. It highlights the seriousness of the situation and the need for immediate action, while also pointing to God's past faithfulness in delivering His people.<p><b>Then the LORD my God will come</b><br>This phrase is a prophetic declaration of God's intervention in human history. It anticipates a theophany, where God visibly manifests His presence. This coming of the LORD is often associated with the Day of the Lord, a time of judgment and salvation. It aligns with other prophetic scriptures such as <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a> and <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, which speak of God's coming to His people. This event is seen as a fulfillment of God's promises and a demonstration of His sovereignty.<p><b>and all the holy ones with Him</b><br>The "holy ones" could refer to angels or the saints, indicating a heavenly entourage accompanying God. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a> and <a href="/jude/1-14.htm">Jude 1:14</a>, which describe God coming with His holy ones. It underscores the majesty and authority of God's arrival, as well as the participation of the heavenly host in His divine plan. This phrase also points to the ultimate victory and establishment of God's kingdom, as seen in <a href="/revelation/19-14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet who conveyed God's messages to the people of Israel, particularly concerning the future and the coming of the Lord.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/azel.htm">Azel</a></b><br>A location mentioned in this prophecy, though its exact historical or geographical identity is uncertain.

Their panic will echo the flight during Uzziah&#8217;s historic earthquake, yet the outcome differs: immediately after their escape, the Messiah arrives in glory, flanked by innumerable holy ones, to judge the wicked and establish His kingdom. The verse reassures believers that God plans every detail of deliverance, confirms the certainty of Christ&#8217;s physical return, and guarantees that those who belong to Him share in His ultimate victory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains;</span> <span class="accented">ye shall flee by the valley of my mountains</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the ravine made by the cleaving of Olivet into two, which God calls "my mountain," because effected by his special interposition.

If Azal, or Azel, be a proper name, it is with some probability identified with Beth-ezel, mentioned in <a href="/micah/1-11.htm">Micah 1:11</a>, a village on the east of Olivet. The meaning in this case is that the valley should extend from the west unto the east side of the Mount of Olives, and that in it the people shall find an asylum, that they might not be involved in the judgments which fall on the enemy. Some take <span class="accented">Azal</span> to mean "union," and see in it a symbol of the union of the Law and the gospel, or the Jew and Gentile, in one Church - the valley of God's mountain extending to "union;" that is, to enfolding all the faithful (see Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The earthquake in the days of Uzziah.</span> This is mentioned in <a href="/amos/1-1.htm">Amos 1:1</a>, but not in the historical books (see note on Amos, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>).
