It signifies readiness and openness to divine communication.<p><b>four chariots</b><br>Chariots in the ancient Near East were symbols of power and military might. The number four often represents universality or completeness in biblical literature, suggesting that these chariots have a global or comprehensive mission.

This imagery could be linked to the Mount of Olives and Mount Zion, significant locations in biblical prophecy and eschatology.<p><b>mountains of bronze</b><br>Bronze is a metal associated with strength and judgment in the Bible.

Believers today can look up with the same confidence: the God who commands these chariots still directs history, defends His own, and will accomplish every promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - &sect; 10. <span class="accented">The eighth vision: the four chariots.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I turned, and lifted up mine eyes</span> (see note on Zechariah 5:1). <span class="cmt_word">Four chariots.</span> These are war chariots. The angel explains, in vers. 5, etc., what these chariots mean, how that they represent God's judgments on sinners in all the world. Though evil is removed from the Church, God's vengeance pursues it wherever it is located. If we compare this vision with the first (<a href="/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8-11</a>), we shall see that the quiet there spoken of is here broken, and that the shaking of the nations, which is to accompany Messiah's advent (<a href="/haggai/2-7.htm">Haggai 2:7</a>), has begun. That the four chariots are to be identified with the four powers of Daniel's visions (2 and 7.) - the Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Macedonian, and Roman - is an opinion that does not commend itself. These four kingdoms and their fate have been already symbolized in the horns of the second vision (<a href="/zechariah/1-19.htm">Zechariah 1:19-21</a>), and it is most unlikely that they should be again introduced under a different figure. This would mar the orderly development of the revelation. And how could these kingdoms, such as they were, be said to issue from the seat of the theocracy and to be attentive to God's commands? Further, how could the chariots symbolize the kingdoms which were to be the objects of punishment, when at the same time they are themselves the instruments which inflict the chastisement? Neither does the angel's explanation suit this notion; for kingdoms are nowhere found under the figure of winds, and such a symbol would have been unintelligible to the prophet without further elucidation. <span class="cmt_word">Two mountains.</span> The Hebrew has the article, "the two mountains," two well known mountains. The scene of the vision is Jerusalem or its neighbourhood; hence the two mountains mentioned are thought to he those of Zion or the temple mount, and Olives (comp. <a href="/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>; <a href="/joel/3-16.htm">Joel 3:16</a>). It is impossible to identify them; end probably nothing more is meant than that the chariots came forth from a defile between the two mountains which appeared in the vision. <span class="cmt_word">Mountains of brass;</span> or, <span class="accented">copper</span>. These impregnable, undecaying mountains represent the immovable, invincible nature of the theocracy and of God's decrees respecting it. From it the chariots go forth, because for the sake of God's kingdom and to promote its objects the world powers are destroyed (Knabenbauer) (<a href="/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>). The number "four" represents completeness; the judgment shall leave no quarter unvisited. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/6-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">And again</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1464;&#1488;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1467;&#1431;&#1489;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#257;&#183;&#353;u&#7687;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
