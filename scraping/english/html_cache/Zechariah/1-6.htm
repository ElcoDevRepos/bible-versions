The "words and statutes" refer to the divine laws and prophetic messages given to Israel through the prophets. Historically, the prophets warned Israel of the consequences of disobedience, which were realized in events like the Babylonian exile. The term "overtake" suggests inevitability, highlighting that God's decrees are inescapable. This reflects the principle found in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word is described as accomplishing what He desires. The phrase also underscores the authority of the prophets as God's messengers, a theme consistent throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>They repented and said,</b><br>This part indicates a turning point for the people, acknowledging their wrongdoing. Repentance is a recurring theme in the Bible, often leading to restoration. The historical context here is post-exilic, where the Israelites, having experienced the consequences of their actions, recognize the need to return to God. This mirrors the call to repentance found in the ministry of John the Baptist and Jesus, emphasizing the importance of a contrite heart.<p><b>&#8216;Just as the LORD of Hosts purposed to do to us according to our ways and deeds, so He has done to us.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The title "LORD of Hosts" signifies God's supreme authority and power, often used in contexts of divine judgment and deliverance. The acknowledgment that God acted "according to our ways and deeds" reflects the biblical principle of reaping what one sows, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>. This confession by the people shows an understanding of divine justice and the consequences of their actions. It also points to the faithfulness of God in fulfilling His word, whether in blessing or judgment. This realization is crucial for the restoration process, as it aligns with the biblical narrative of returning to God and receiving His mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet who ministered to the people of Judah after their return from Babylonian exile.
