The "basket" refers to an ephah, a unit of measurement, which in this vision symbolizes iniquity or sin. The context of this vision is a series of symbolic acts that convey God's judgment and purification of Israel. The basket contains a woman representing wickedness, and the act of taking the basket away signifies the removal of sin from the land. This imagery aligns with the theme of cleansing and restoration found throughout the book of Zechariah. The question reflects Zechariah's curiosity and desire for understanding, a common trait among prophets who seek to comprehend God's messages.<p><b>I asked the angel who was speaking with me.</b><br>Zechariah's interaction with the angel highlights the role of angels as messengers and interpreters of divine visions. In biblical literature, angels often serve as intermediaries between God and humans, providing clarity and guidance. This particular angelic encounter underscores the importance of divine revelation and the need for interpretation of prophetic visions. The presence of the angel indicates that the vision is not merely a dream but a significant message from God. This interaction is reminiscent of other biblical figures, such as Daniel, who also received angelic explanations of visions. The angel's role is crucial in helping Zechariah understand the implications of the vision for the people of Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet of the post-exilic period, Zechariah was instrumental in encouraging the Jewish people to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem after their return from Babylonian exile.
