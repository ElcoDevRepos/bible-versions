This suggests that God is actively involved in guiding His people, providing them with direction and hope. The repetition of divine messages throughout the book underscores the importance of the prophetic word in the life of Israel.<br><br>"The LORD of Hosts" is a title that highlights God's sovereignty and power over all heavenly and earthly armies. It reflects His authority and ability to accomplish His purposes, reassuring the Israelites of His control over their circumstances. This title is frequently used in the Old Testament to remind the people of God's might and His role as a divine warrior who protects and fights for His people.<br><br>"Came to me" signifies the personal nature of the revelation. Zechariah, as a prophet, serves as a conduit for God's message to the people. This personal encounter with the divine word underscores the intimate relationship between God and His chosen messengers, who are tasked with delivering His truth to the nation.<br><br>"Saying" introduces the content of the message that follows. It prepares the reader for the specific instructions or promises that God is about to reveal. This structure is common in prophetic literature, where the prophet receives a direct communication from God to be conveyed to the people.

Zechariah has already recorded earlier visions (<a href="/zechariah/1-1.htm">Zechariah 1:1</a>; 1:7; 7:8), and here the cycle continues.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s willingness to speak &#8220;again&#8221; echoes His pattern with earlier prophets&#8212;Jeremiah received multiple words in succession (<a href="/jeremiah/1-13.htm">Jeremiah 1:13</a>; 2:1), and Ezekiel&#8217;s oracles likewise came in sequence (<a href="/ezekiel/12-1.htm">Ezekiel 12:1</a>; 13:1).<p>&#8226; The verse therefore prepares us to expect continuity: the Lord who spoke before is still addressing His people, underscoring His steadfast commitment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the word of the LORD of Hosts</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;The word&#8221; affirms divine origin and absolute authority; what follows is not human speculation but revelation, just as &#8220;the word of the LORD&#8221; defined messages to Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1</a>), Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>), and Jonah (<a href="/jonah/1-1.htm">Jonah 1:1</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;LORD&#8221; (Yahweh) points to covenant faithfulness. This is the God who bound Himself to Israel in <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a> and keeps His promises in spite of their failures (<a href="/nehemiah/9-31.htm">Nehemiah 9:31</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;of Hosts&#8221; proclaims His sovereignty over angelic armies and earthly powers alike (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>; <a href="/psalms/24-10.htm">Psalm 24:10</a>). When He speaks, no force can oppose Him. Haggai links this title with restoration after exile (<a href="/haggai/1-5.htm">Haggai 1:5&#8211;7</a>), exactly the context Zechariah addresses.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>came to me</b><p>&#8226; Revelation is personal. The word &#8220;came&#8221; (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/1-2.htm">Jeremiah 1:2</a>) stresses that Zechariah did not invent his message; it invaded his life.<p>&#8226; The phrase highlights the privilege and burden of the prophetic office. Amos felt the same compulsion (<a href="/amos/3-8.htm">Amos 3:8</a>), and Paul later describes being &#8220;entrusted with the gospel&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>).<p>&#8226; For the remnant rebuilding Jerusalem, this assurance that God has spoken to their own contemporary prophet would bolster confidence amid opposition (<a href="/ezra/5-1.htm">Ezra 5:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying</b><p>&#8226; The participle introduces direct speech, inviting the audience to listen attentively. Every time Scripture says &#8220;saying,&#8221; God Himself begins to address readers across generations (<a href="/hebrews/3-7.htm">Hebrews 3:7&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; Verses 2&#8211;23 unfold that message: passionate jealousy for Zion, promises of peace, prosperity, and truth. The simple word &#8220;saying&#8221; thus stands as a doorway to hope, much like the &#8220;Thus says the LORD&#8221; formulas that precede covenant blessings in <a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1&#8211;14</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/8-1.htm">Zechariah 8:1</a> is more than a transitional line; it reassures God&#8217;s people that He still speaks, He alone commands heavenly armies, He personally commissions His servant, and He is about to unveil fresh encouragement. Reading this verse prepares us to receive the rest of chapter 8 with confidence that every promise that follows issues from the faithful, sovereign LORD whose word never fails (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-8.</span> - &sect; 4. <span class="accented">The Lord promises to show his love for Zion, to dwell among his people, and to fill Jerusalem with a happy lace.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Again</span>; rather, <span class="accented">and</span>.
