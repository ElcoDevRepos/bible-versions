The imagery of removing blood signifies purification and a turning away from defilement. Historically, this can be seen as God's intervention to cleanse the nations surrounding Israel, particularly the Philistines, from their idolatrous practices.<p><b>and the abominations from between their teeth.</b><br>Abominations here refer to detestable practices and idolatrous worship, which were prevalent among the Philistines and other neighboring nations. The phrase "between their teeth" suggests the consumption of forbidden foods and participation in rituals that were offensive to God. This cleansing indicates a divine transformation, aligning with the prophetic theme of God purifying the nations (<a href="/isaiah/66-17.htm">Isaiah 66:17</a>).<p><b>Then they too will become a remnant for our God;</b><br>The concept of a remnant is significant in biblical prophecy, often referring to a small, faithful group preserved by God (<a href="/isaiah/10-20.htm">Isaiah 10:20-22</a>). Here, it suggests that even those from pagan nations will be included in God's people, reflecting the inclusive nature of God's salvation plan. This foreshadows the New Testament revelation of the Gentiles being grafted into the people of God (<a href="/romans/11-17.htm">Romans 11:17-24</a>).<p><b>they will become like a clan in Judah,</b><br>This phrase indicates full integration and acceptance into the community of God's people. The clan in Judah represents a recognized and legitimate part of the Israelite nation. This transformation signifies the breaking down of ethnic and cultural barriers, prefiguring the unity of believers in Christ (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-16</a>).<p><b>and Ekron will be like the Jebusites.</b><br>Ekron, one of the five major Philistine cities, symbolizes the enemies of Israel. The Jebusites were a Canaanite tribe that inhabited Jerusalem before David conquered it (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6-9</a>). By comparing Ekron to the Jebusites, the prophecy suggests that even former enemies will be assimilated and live peacefully among God's people. This transformation is a type of the ultimate reconciliation and peace brought by Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places

Mean</div><b>I will remove the blood from their mouths</b><p>&#8226; The nations surrounding Israel had been steeped in bloody warfare and pagan rituals that often included the drinking or sprinkling of sacrificial blood. Here God promises a decisive end to that violence and idolatry (<a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse follows prophecies of judgment on Israel&#8217;s enemies (<a href="/zechariah/9-1.htm">Zechariah 9:1&#8211;6</a>). Yet even in judgment, God&#8217;s aim is redemptive&#8212;He removes what defiles so people can draw near (<a href="/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25</a>; <a href="/acts/15-19.htm">Acts 15:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The initiative is entirely God&#8217;s. Just as He cleansed Israel in the past (<a href="/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10-14</a>), He now intervenes for Gentile cities, showcasing His sovereignty over all nations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the abominations from between their teeth</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Abominations&#8221; signals foods sacrificed to idols and other detestable practices (<a href="/leviticus/11-10.htm">Leviticus 11:10-13</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/10-19.htm">1 Corinthians 10:19-21</a>). God addresses what they consume&#8212;both physically and spiritually&#8212;because idolatry is never merely outward (<a href="/jeremiah/7-30.htm">Jeremiah 7:30-31</a>).<p>&#8226; Removing what is &#8220;between their teeth&#8221; pictures personal, internal cleansing. God&#8217;s sanctifying work reaches the hidden places (<a href="/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-25.htm">Matthew 23:25-26</a>).<p>&#8226; The result anticipates the New Testament vision where formerly pagan believers abandon idols to serve the living God (<a href="/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/9-20.htm">Revelation 9:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then they too will become a remnant for our God</b><p>&#8226; Instead of annihilation, God promises inclusion.

Pagan practices are removed, hearts are cleansed, and former outsiders become full members of God&#8217;s family&#8212;just as the Jebusites were incorporated into Jerusalem. <a href="/zechariah/9-7.htm">Zechariah 9:7</a> previews the gospel&#8217;s reach: through divine intervention, even hostile nations are invited to share in Judah&#8217;s blessings and worship the one true God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - Personifying Philistia, the prophet declares that she shall cease to practise idolatry, and shall be incorporated in Israel. <span class="cmt_word">I will take away his blood out of his mouth.</span> This refers to the practice of drinking the blood of sacrifices as an act of worship, or of eating the victims with the blood - a practice strictly forbidden to the Israelites (see <a href="/leviticus/3-17.htm">Leviticus 3:17</a>; <a href="/leviticus/7-26.htm">Leviticus 7:26</a>; <a href="/leviticus/17-10.htm">Leviticus 17:10, 12</a>; and comp. <a href="/genesis/9-4.htm">Genesis 9:4</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Abominations</span>. Sacrifices offered to idols, and afterwards eaten. The two clauses intimate the entire abolition of idolatry. Many see in this prediction a reference to the doings of the Maccabees; how, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, Judas destroyed the altars and idols in Azotus (1 Macc. 5:68); Jonathan again took that city, and burned it and the neighbouring towns, and, besieging Ashkelon, was received with great honour by the inhabitants, and confirmed in the possession of this place and Ekron (1 Macc. 10:84, etc.); and Simon stormed Gaza (? Gazara, a place near Ashdod), cleansed the houses of idols, "put all uncleanness out of it, and placed such men there as would keep the Law" (1 Macc. 13:47, 48). But though such events partially fulfil the prophecy, the seer looks forward to a greater issue, and in these comparatively petty details beholds the working of the great principle that all nations shall be subdued to the faith. <span class="cmt_word">He that remaineth,</span> <span class="cmt_word">even he, shall be for our God;</span> better, <span class="accented">he too shall be left</span> (or, <span class="accented">a remnant</span>) <span class="accented">for our God.</span> The Philistine shall become a choice and elect remnant unto the God of the Israelites, and no longer regarded as alien and impure. <span class="cmt_word">As a governor;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "head over a thousand." which the word <span class="accented">alluph</span> means (<a href="/zechariah/12-5.htm">Zechariah 12:5, 6</a>). It is used of the chiefs of Edom in <a href="/genesis/36-15.htm">Genesis 36:15, 16</a>, etc., where the Authorized Version gives "dukes." The tribes of Israel were divided into thousands, consisting of families, each of which was held together by closer affinities than the mere tribal bond (see note on Micah 5:2). The meaning is that the Philistine shall be admitted into the commonwealth of Israel as one of her chiefs. <span class="cmt_word">Ekron as a Jebusite.</span> "Ekron" is equivalent to "the Ekronite," who again stands in the place of all the Philistines. The Jebusites were the ancient possessors of Zion, who held their position till the days of David, and, when at last conquered by him (<a href="/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6</a>, etc.), were incorporated into his nation, and, as we may infer from Araunah's conduct, adopted his religion (<a href="/2_samuel/24-22.htm">2 Samuel 24:22</a>; <a href="/1_chronicles/21-23.htm">1 Chronicles 21:23</a>). God promises here that the Philistines, like the Jebusites, shall be absorbed into the Jewish Church. Mr. Drake ('Speaker's Commentary,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) curiously renders, "He shall be as Eleph (<a href="/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>) in Judah, and Ekron as Jebusi," explaining that the cities of Philistia were to be incorporated into Judaea. The conquests of Alexander conduced to the conversion of the heathen and their reception into the Church of God; and the general principle enunciated by all the prophets was tiros abundantly confirmed. But it is rot easy to discover the exact historical fulfilment of the latter part of this prophecy, concerning the merging of the Philistines in the Jewish nation. Josephus ('Ant.,' 13:15. 4) tells us that, about <span class="date">B.C. 100</span>, the Jews held most of their cities, destroying some whose inhabitants refused to become proselytes. In the time of our Lord, by reason of intermarriage and social intercourse, the Philistines had ceased to be regarded as a separate nation; and a little later Philistia, far from being considered as alien and hostile, under the form Palestine, gave its name to the whole country. Christianity, too, made rapid progress in this district, so that the psalmist's words received herein a fulfilment, "Behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Gush; this one was born there" (<a href="/psalms/87-4.htm">Psalm 87:4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/9-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">I will remove</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1492;&#1458;&#1505;&#1460;&#1512;&#1465;&#1514;&#1460;&#1448;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(wa&#183;ha&#774;&#183;si&#183;r&#333;&#183;&#7791;&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
