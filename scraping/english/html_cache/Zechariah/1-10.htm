This setting in a low valley suggests humility and a place of growth, reflecting the state of Israel at the time.<p><b>They are the ones the LORD has sent</b><br>The "they" refers to the horsemen seen earlier in the vision, representing divine messengers or agents. This sending by the LORD indicates divine authority and purpose. It reflects God's sovereignty and His active role in the affairs of the world, a theme consistent throughout the prophetic books. The sending also echoes the commissioning of prophets and messengers in other parts of Scripture, such as Isaiah and Jeremiah.<p><b>to patrol the earth</b><br>The patrol signifies God's omniscience and His watchful care over the nations. This imagery of patrolling suggests a military or protective role, ensuring peace and order.
