In the context of Zechariah, it points to a time when God will act decisively for His people. This is a common prophetic expression found throughout the Old Testament, indicating a significant event in God's redemptive plan (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>, <a href="/joel/3-18.htm">Joel 3:18</a>).<p><b>the LORD their God will save them</b><br>This highlights God's role as the Savior of His people, emphasizing His covenant relationship with Israel. The deliverance mentioned here can be seen as both physical and spiritual, reflecting God's ongoing commitment to protect and redeem His people. This echoes earlier promises of salvation found in passages like <a href="/exodus/14-13.htm">Exodus 14:13-14</a> and <a href="/isaiah/43-11.htm">Isaiah 43:11</a>.<p><b>as the flock of His people</b><br>The imagery of a flock underscores the pastoral care and guidance God provides. It reflects the intimate relationship between God and His people, akin to a shepherd with his sheep. This metaphor is prevalent in Scripture, with <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> and <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-16</a> illustrating God's protective and nurturing nature.<p><b>for like jewels in a crown</b><br>This simile conveys the value and beauty of God's people in His sight. It suggests honor and glory bestowed upon them, indicating their transformation and exaltation. The imagery of jewels is used elsewhere in Scripture to describe the preciousness of God's people (e.g., <a href="/malachi/3-17.htm">Malachi 3:17</a>, <a href="/revelation/21-11.htm">Revelation 21:11</a>).<p><b>they will sparkle over His land</b><br>This phrase suggests a visible manifestation of God's glory through His people. The land, often representing the Promised Land, is a place of blessing and fulfillment of God's promises. The sparkling signifies the radiance and testimony of God's work in His people, reminiscent of <a href="/isaiah/60.htm">Isaiah 60:1-3</a>, where the light of God's glory shines through His people to the nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant-keeping God of Israel, who is portrayed as the Savior and Shepherd of His people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_people.htm">His People (Israel)</a></b><br>The nation of Israel, often referred to as God's flock, whom He promises to save and protect.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_of_salvation.htm">The Day of Salvation</a></b><br>A prophetic reference to a future time when God will deliver His people, often associated with messianic expectations.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewels_in_a_crown.htm">Jewels in a Crown</a></b><br>A metaphor for the value and beauty of God's people, indicating their preciousness and honor in His sight.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the Promised Land, which holds significant covenantal and eschatological importance for Israel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god_as_savior_and_shepherd.htm">God as Savior and Shepherd</a></b><br>Recognize God's role as both Savior and Shepherd in your life, providing guidance, protection, and deliverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/value_and_identity_in_christ.htm">Value and Identity in Christ</a></b><br>Understand your identity as a precious jewel in God's crown, valued and honored by Him.
