It reflects the prophetic vision of a messianic age where the Gentiles are grafted into the spiritual family of God. This is consistent with the Abrahamic promise in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where all families of the earth are to be blessed through Abraham's seed. The phrase anticipates the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations, indicating the universal scope of God's redemptive plan.<p><b>and they will become My people</b><br>This signifies a covenant relationship, echoing the language used in <a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>, where God promises Israel, "I will take you as My people, and I will be your God." The inclusion of many nations as God's people fulfills the prophetic vision of unity and reconciliation found in <a href="/ephesians/2-11.htm">Ephesians 2:11-22</a>, where Paul speaks of breaking down the dividing wall between Jews and Gentiles. It underscores the theme of adoption into God's family, as seen in <a href="/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>, where believers receive the Spirit of adoption as sons.<p><b>I will dwell among you</b><br>This phrase emphasizes God's presence with His people, reminiscent of the tabernacle and temple where God dwelt among the Israelites (<a href="/exodus/25-8.htm">Exodus 25:8</a>, <a href="/1_kings/6-13.htm">1 Kings 6:13</a>). It foreshadows the incarnation of Christ, "Immanuel," meaning "God with us" (<a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>), and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-16.htm">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>). The ultimate fulfillment is seen in <a href="/revelation/21-3.htm">Revelation 21:3</a>, where God's dwelling is with humanity in the new heaven and new earth.<p><b>and you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me to you</b><br>This statement affirms the divine authority and mission of the speaker, often interpreted as a messianic reference to Jesus Christ. The title "LORD of Hosts" denotes God's sovereignty and command over heavenly armies, emphasizing His power and authority. The phrase "has sent Me" suggests a divine commissioning, paralleling Jesus' own declarations in the Gospel of John (<a href="/john/5-36.htm">John 5:36-37</a>, <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>), where He speaks of being sent by the Father.
