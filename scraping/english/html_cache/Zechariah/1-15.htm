Historically, these nations, such as Babylon and Assyria, had been instruments of God's judgment against Israel due to their disobedience. However, they went beyond what God intended, acting with excessive cruelty and pride. The term "at ease" suggests complacency and self-satisfaction, indicating that these nations were unconcerned with their own moral state or the suffering they inflicted. This echoes the sentiment found in <a href="/isaiah/47-6.htm">Isaiah 47:6</a>, where God expresses anger at Babylon for showing no mercy. Theologically, this highlights God's justice and His concern for righteousness, as He holds all nations accountable for their actions.<p><b>For I was a little angry,</b><br>God's initial anger was directed towards Israel due to their persistent idolatry and disobedience, leading to their exile. This "little" anger signifies a measured and purposeful divine response intended for correction and restoration, rather than destruction. It aligns with the concept of divine discipline found in <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>, where God's correction is an expression of His love. The historical context here is the Babylonian exile, a period of seventy years during which God allowed foreign powers to dominate Israel as a means of chastening His people.<p><b>but they have added to the calamity.</b><br>The nations, particularly Babylon, exacerbated Israel's suffering beyond what God had intended. This phrase indicates that these nations acted with excessive harshness and brutality, adding to the calamity that God had decreed. This is reminiscent of the prophecy in <a href="/jeremiah/50-11.htm">Jeremiah 50:11</a>, where Babylon is condemned for its arrogance and excessive cruelty. Theologically, this underscores the principle that while God may use nations as instruments of His will, they are still responsible for their actions and will be judged accordingly. This also foreshadows the ultimate justice and restoration that God promises to His people, as seen in the broader context of Zechariah's visions, which point to a future hope and the coming of the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet who ministered to the Jewish people after their return from Babylonian exile.
