Mourning in biblical times often involved wearing sackcloth, fasting, and lamentation. The context of <a href="/zechariah/12.htm">Zechariah 12</a> suggests a national recognition of sin and a turning back to God. This mourning is connected to the realization of the piercing of the Messiah, as seen in <a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>, which is often interpreted as a prophecy of Jesus Christ's crucifixion. The mourning signifies a deep spiritual awakening and repentance among the people.<p><b>each clan on its own</b><br>The individual mourning of each clan highlights the personal nature of repentance and accountability before God. In ancient Israel, clans were extended family groups, and their separate mourning signifies that this is not just a collective national event but also a deeply personal one. This reflects the biblical principle that while salvation is offered to all, each person must individually respond to God's call.<p><b>the clan of the house of David and their wives</b><br>The house of David refers to the royal lineage from which Jesus Christ descended, as prophesied in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>. The mention of their wives indicates that the mourning is comprehensive, involving both men and women. This inclusion underscores the importance of the Davidic line in biblical prophecy and the fulfillment of God's promises through Jesus, the Son of David. The house of David's mourning may also symbolize the recognition of their role in the rejection of the Messiah.<p><b>the clan of the house of Nathan and their wives</b><br>Nathan, a son of David, represents another branch of the Davidic family. This mention may emphasize the broader scope of mourning beyond just the direct royal line, indicating that all branches of David's descendants are involved. Nathan the prophet, who confronted David about his sin with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 12), is also a figure associated with repentance and divine correction. The inclusion of their wives again highlights the communal and inclusive nature of the mourning. This reflects the comprehensive nature of repentance and the acknowledgment of sin across all levels of society.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_land.htm">The Land</a></b><br>Refers to the land of Israel, which is experiencing a time of mourning and reflection.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_david.htm">The House of David</a></b><br>Represents the royal lineage of King David, a significant family in Israel's history.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_nathan.htm">The House of Nathan</a></b><br>Nathan was a prophet during King David's reign, and this reference may indicate a specific family line or a broader prophetic tradition.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/mourning.htm">Mourning</a></b><br>A period of deep sorrow and repentance, often associated with national or spiritual crises.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/clans_and_wives.htm">Clans and Wives</a></b><br>Indicates a communal and familial aspect to the mourning, emphasizing both individual and collective grief.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_repentance.htm">The Importance of Repentance</a></b><br>Mourning in <a href="/zechariah/12-12.htm">Zechariah 12:12</a> signifies a deep recognition of sin and the need for repentance.

Mentioning this branch of the family tree broadens the circle.<p>&#8226; By pairing David and Nathan, Scripture quietly folds in both legal and biological lines leading to Messiah&#8212;Joseph through Solomon (<a href="/matthew/1-6.htm">Matthew 1:6-16</a>) and Mary through Nathan (<a href="/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23-31</a>). Both sides acknowledge Him.<p>&#8226; Prophetic witness: the name Nathan also recalls the prophet who confronted David over sin (<a href="/bsb/2_samuel/12.htm">2 Samuel 12</a>). Repentance is still the prophetic call.<p>&#8226; Again the phrase &#8220;and their wives&#8221; reminds us that revival in Israel will be holistic, touching every household member (<a href="/zechariah/8-3.htm">Zechariah 8:3-5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/12-12.htm">Zechariah 12:12</a> paints a sweeping yet intimate picture of Israel&#8217;s future repentance when they recognize the pierced Messiah.
