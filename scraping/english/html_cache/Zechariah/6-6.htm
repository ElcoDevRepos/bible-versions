Historically, the "land of the north" often refers to Babylon, a significant power and oppressor of Israel. This direction is symbolic of God's judgment and control over the nations that have oppressed His people. The black horses may symbolize calamity or judgment, aligning with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty over empires. <a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14-15</a> also speaks of disaster coming from the north, reinforcing this interpretation.<p><b>The one with the white horses toward the west</b><br>White horses in biblical literature often symbolize victory, purity, and peace. Their movement toward the west could indicate a mission of conquest or peace. In the context of Zechariah, this may suggest the spread of God's peace and victory over the western regions, possibly referring to the Mediterranean nations. <a href="/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a> describes a rider on a white horse, symbolizing conquest, which may parallel this imagery of divine intervention and triumph.<p><b>And the one with the dappled horses toward the south</b><br>Dappled horses, with their mixed colors, might represent a combination of different divine actions or judgments. The south likely refers to Egypt, a historical adversary of Israel. The mixed colors could symbolize a blend of mercy and judgment, reflecting God's complex dealings with nations. This imagery aligns with the broader biblical narrative of God's justice and mercy, as seen in His interactions with Egypt throughout the Exodus and beyond. The southward movement signifies God's reach and authority extending to all directions, fulfilling His purposes across the earth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet of the post-exilic period who received visions from God, including the vision of the four chariots in <a href="/bsb/zechariah/6.htm">Zechariah 6</a>.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_four_chariots.htm">The Four Chariots</a></b><br>Symbolic representations of God's judgment and sovereignty over the earth, each drawn by horses of different colors.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_black_horses.htm">The Black Horses</a></b><br>These horses are sent toward the north, often associated with Babylon, representing judgment or calamity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_white_horses.htm">The White Horses</a></b><br>These horses head toward the west, symbolizing victory and peace.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_dappled_horses.htm">The Dappled Horses</a></b><br>These horses go toward the south, possibly indicating a mixed outcome of judgment and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The vision of the chariots reminds us that God is in control of the nations and their destinies.

The first chariot carries black horses, and God sends them &#8220;toward the land of the north.&#8221;<p>&#8226; &#8220;The land of the north&#8221; most often points to Babylon (<a href="/jeremiah/1-14.htm">Jeremiah 1:14</a>; <a href="/zechariah/2-6.htm">Zechariah 2:6-7</a>). This fits historically: Judah&#8217;s enemies had marched down from the north and now must face God&#8217;s answering judgment.<p>&#8226; The black horses, a color often linked with calamity or famine (<a href="/revelation/6-5.htm">Revelation 6:5-6</a>), carry out that judgment literally&#8212;God&#8217;s wrath travels the same route the invaders once used.<p>&#8226; The mission fulfills earlier promises: &#8220;I will stir up and destroy the kingdoms of the nations that come against Jerusalem&#8221; (<a href="/haggai/2-22.htm">Haggai 2:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Takeaway: the Lord does not overlook sin. Where oppression came from, His justice returns.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the one with the white horses toward the west</b><p>&#8211; The second chariot holds white horses, which &#8220;went out&#8221; toward the west.<p>&#8226; White in Scripture signals victory and purity (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-14</a>). These horses announce conquering peace after judgment.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Toward the west&#8221; directs our eyes to the Mediterranean coastlands (<a href="/isaiah/24-15.htm">Isaiah 24:15</a>) and beyond. God&#8217;s sovereignty extends there as surely as to Babylon.<p>&#8226; Earlier prophecies promised salvation reaching &#8220;to the ends of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>). The white horses embody that triumphal advance.<p>&#8226; Notice the balance: judgment rides north; victory rides west. The same Lord who punishes wickedness also spreads redemption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the one with the dappled horses toward the south</b><p>&#8211; The third named group, dappled (spotted) horses, heads south.<p>&#8226; South of Judah lies Egypt, long a symbol of human pride and oppression (<a href="/jeremiah/46-13.htm">Jeremiah 46:13-26</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/29-1.htm">Ezekiel 29:1-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Spotted coloring suggests mixed or alternating action&#8212;mercy mingled with discipline (compare <a href="/hosea/14-4.htm">Hosea 14:4-7</a>). Egypt would experience both: devastating defeat (<a href="/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1-4</a>) and eventual revival, when Egyptians &#8220;will worship with the Assyrians and the Israelites&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/19-24.htm">Isaiah 19:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; The vision reassures post-exilic Judah that every direction is under God&#8217;s chariot patrol. No enemy, past or present, escapes His notice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/6-6.htm">Zechariah 6:6</a> pictures three chariots dispatched to the three main compass points that mattered to Judah: north (Babylon), west (Mediterranean world), and south (Egypt). Black horses carry divine judgment northward; white horses signal victorious peace moving westward; dappled horses combine judgment and mercy toward the south. Taken literally, the scene declares that God&#8217;s all-seeing sovereignty marshals angelic forces to execute His perfect justice and salvation in every direction.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - The angel now (vers. 6, 7) indicates the various destinations of the chariots, except the first with the red horses. Why this is omitted has never been satisfactorily explained. Some regard ver. 7 as giving the destination of this chariot, by making a slight change in the word rendered "bay" in the Authorized Version, which would cause it to mean "red." The Syriac, indeed, which omits the word in ver. 3, translates it here by "red." If we retain the Masoretic reading, we must let this difficulty remain unsolved, and suppose that the angel explains only part of the vision, leaving the rest for the prophet's meditation. <span class="cmt_word">The black horses which are therein;</span> literally, <span class="accented">that wherein are the black horses, they go forth</span>, etc.; which is equivalent to "the chariot wherein are the black horses goeth forth." So the Revised Version. <span class="cmt_word">The north country.</span> Babylonia (see note on Zechariah 2:6). <span class="cmt_word">After them;</span> <span class="accented">behind them.</span> The white horses go to the same quarter; and thus is indicated the overwhelming destruction that was coming on Babylon, and the victory and triumph of the conquerors over it. <span class="cmt_word">The south country;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Egypt (<a href="/isaiah/30-6.htm">Isaiah 30:6</a>; <a href="/daniel/11-5.htm">Daniel 11:5</a>), another hostile power, also, perhaps, Edom and Ethiopia. One chariot only is seen to go towards it, drawn by the speckled horses that denote a mixed judgment, perhaps of war and pestilence (see on ver. 3). The north and south symbolize the whole earth and the powers hostile to the true Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/6-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">The one</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1458;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1512;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;a&#774;&#183;&#353;er-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - relative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_834.htm">Strong's 834: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that, when, where, how, because, in order that</span><br /><br /><span class="word">with</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1464;&#1438;&#1492;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(b&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition &#124;
