The presence of others standing by suggests a heavenly court, possibly including other angels or spiritual beings. This setting reflects the judicial and ceremonial aspects of the vision, where Joshua, the high priest, is being judged and cleansed. The angel's authority to command indicates divine intervention and the importance of the proceedings.<p><b>&#8220;Take off his filthy clothes!&#8221;</b><br>The filthy clothes worn by Joshua symbolize sin and impurity, particularly the sins of the people of Israel, as Joshua represents them. In the ancient Near Eastern context, clothing often represented one's status and condition. Filthy garments would be inappropriate for a high priest, especially when serving in the temple. This act of removing the filthy clothes signifies the removal of sin and guilt, a theme echoed in <a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm">Isaiah 64:6</a>, where human righteousness is compared to filthy rags.<p><b>Then he said to Joshua,</b><br>The direct address to Joshua highlights his role as the high priest and the representative of the people. Joshua's experience is both personal and corporate, reflecting the spiritual state of Israel. His name, meaning "The LORD saves," foreshadows the redemptive work of Jesus, whose name in Hebrew is Yeshua, the same as Joshua.<p><b>&#8220;See, I have removed your iniquity,</b><br>The removal of iniquity is a divine act of forgiveness and purification. This phrase emphasizes God's grace and mercy, as He takes the initiative to cleanse Joshua. It reflects the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where God promises to forgive and restore His people. This act is a precursor to the ultimate removal of sin through Christ's atoning sacrifice, as seen in passages like <a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10-14</a>.<p><b>and I will clothe you with splendid robes.&#8221;</b><br>The splendid robes represent righteousness, honor, and restoration. In biblical symbolism, clothing often signifies one's spiritual state; thus, being clothed in splendid robes indicates a transformation from sin to righteousness. This imagery is consistent with the New Testament teaching of being clothed with Christ's righteousness, as in <a href="/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>. The change of garments signifies a new identity and status before God, aligning with the prophetic vision of a renewed priesthood and a restored Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joshua_the_high_priest.htm">Joshua the High Priest</a></b><br>Represents the people of Israel and stands before God in filthy garments, symbolizing sin and impurity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>Acts as an intermediary, commanding the removal of Joshua's filthy clothes and symbolizing divine intervention and grace.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/those_standing_before_him.htm">Those Standing Before Him</a></b><br>Likely other angels or heavenly beings who assist in the symbolic act of cleansing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/filthy_clothes.htm">Filthy Clothes</a></b><br>Symbolize the sin and iniquity of Joshua and, by extension, the people of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/splendid_robes.htm">Splendid Robes</a></b><br>Represent the righteousness and purity granted by God, signifying forgiveness and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_grace_and_cleansing.htm">Divine Grace and Cleansing</a></b><br>God's grace is sufficient to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

The angel commands the removal of Joshua&#8217;s filthy garments, declaring that his iniquity is gone, and promises new, splendid robes. The verse teaches that God Himself takes away sin and clothes His servants in righteousness, enabling restored, holy service. The cleansing of Joshua prefigures the complete salvation provided through Christ, where guilt is removed and believers are robed in His perfect righteousness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He answered.</span> The Angel of Jehovah answered the mute petition of Joshua. <span class="cmt_word">Those that stood before him.</span> The attendant angels, who waited on the Angel of Jehovah to do his pleasure (see note on ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">Take away the filthy garments.</span> This symbolized remission of sins and restoration to favour, as the following words explain, <span class="cmt_word">I will clothe thee with change of raiment;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">with rich apparel.</span> The word <span class="accented">machalatsoth</span> occurs also in <a href="/isaiah/3-22.htm">Isaiah 3:22</a>, and may mean either "change of raiment," or "costly raiment;" or the meanings may be combined in the sense of "festal robes," only worn on great occasions and changed after the occasion. They are used here as symbols of righteousness and glory. Not only is the sin pardoned, but the wearer is restored to the full glory of his state.
