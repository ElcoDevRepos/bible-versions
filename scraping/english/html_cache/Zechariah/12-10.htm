The "house of David" refers to the royal lineage of King David, highlighting the messianic expectations tied to this family line. Jerusalem, as the spiritual and political center of Israel, represents the entire nation. This outpouring suggests a significant spiritual renewal or revival, reminiscent of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17-18</a>). The imagery of pouring out is often associated with abundance and blessing, indicating a transformative event for the people.<p><b>a spirit of grace and prayer</b><br>The "spirit of grace" suggests an unmerited favor from God, enabling the people to receive His mercy and forgiveness. This grace is essential for repentance and reconciliation with God. The "spirit of prayer" implies a renewed relationship with God, characterized by sincere communication and dependence on Him. This aligns with the New Covenant promise of a transformed heart and spirit (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26-27</a>). The combination of grace and prayer indicates a holistic spiritual awakening, leading to genuine repentance and devotion.<p><b>and they will look on Me, the One they have pierced</b><br>This phrase is a prophetic reference to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, where He was literally pierced (<a href="/john/19-34.htm">John 19:34, 37</a>). The act of looking implies recognition and acknowledgment of wrongdoing. The piercing signifies the rejection and suffering of the Messiah, fulfilling the prophecy of a suffering servant (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>). This moment of realization is pivotal, as it leads to repentance and mourning over the rejection of the Messiah. The phrase underscores the connection between Old Testament prophecy and New Testament fulfillment in Christ.<p><b>They will mourn for Him as one mourns for an only child</b><br>The mourning described here is intense and personal, akin to the loss of an only child, which in ancient Near Eastern culture represented the loss of one's future and legacy. This deep sorrow reflects the gravity of realizing the rejection of the Messiah. The mourning is not just individual but communal, indicating a collective acknowledgment of sin and a turning back to God. This parallels the national mourning described in <a href="/joel/2-12.htm">Joel 2:12-13</a>, where repentance is accompanied by fasting and weeping.<p><b>and grieve bitterly for Him as one grieves for a firstborn son</b><br>The grief for a firstborn son is profound, as the firstborn held a place of special significance and blessing in Israelite culture (<a href="/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>). This grief signifies the recognition of the Messiah's unique and irreplaceable role. The bitterness of the grief underscores the depth of repentance and the realization of the consequences of sin. This mourning is a precursor to restoration and redemption, as seen in the promise of God to restore and heal His people (<a href="/hosea/6.htm">Hosea 6:1-2</a>). The imagery of the firstborn also connects to Christ as the "firstborn over all creation" (<a href="/colossians/1-15.htm">Colossians 1:15</a>), emphasizing His preeminence and the ultimate reconciliation through Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/house_of_david.htm">House of David</a></b><br>Refers to the royal lineage of King David, representing the leadership and the messianic line in Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/r/residents_of_jerusalem.htm">Residents of Jerusalem</a></b><br>The inhabitants of Jerusalem, symbolizing the people of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/spirit_of_grace_and_supplication.htm">Spirit of Grace and Supplication</a></b><br>A divine outpouring that leads to repentance and prayer, indicating God's initiative in bringing about spiritual renewal.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_pierced_one.htm">The Pierced One</a></b><br>A prophetic reference to the Messiah, whom Christians identify as Jesus Christ, who was crucified.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mourning_and_grieving.htm">Mourning and Grieving</a></b><br>Represents a deep, heartfelt repentance and recognition of the Messiah, akin to mourning for a beloved family member.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_the_holy_spirit.htm">The Role of the Holy Spirit</a></b><br>The "spirit of grace and supplication" highlights the Holy Spirit's work in convicting hearts and leading people to repentance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognition_of_christ.htm">Recognition of Christ</a></b><br>The prophecy points to a future recognition of Jesus as the Messiah by the Jewish people, encouraging believers to pray for the salvation of Israel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_depth_of_repentance.htm">The Depth of Repentance</a></b><br>The mourning described is profound, teaching us about the seriousness of sin and the depth of true repentance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_plan.htm">God's Sovereign Plan</a></b><br>This passage reassures us of God's control over history and His faithfulness to fulfill His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_reflection.htm">Personal Reflection</a></b><br>Encourages believers to reflect on their own response to Christ's sacrifice and to live in a state of continual repentance and gratitude.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Zechariah_12_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Zechariah 12:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Zechariah_12_10_and_Jesus_crucifixion.htm">How does Zechariah 12:10 foreshadow the crucifixion of Jesus Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_grace_in_believers_lives.htm">What is the significance of "a spirit of grace and supplication" in believers' lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_is_mourning_linked_to_repentance.htm">How does mourning for "the One they have pierced" relate to repentance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Zechariah_12_10_fulfilled_in_John_19_37.htm">Connect Zechariah 12:10 with John 19:37 and its fulfillment in the New Testament.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Cultivate_daily_supplication_and_grace.htm">How can we cultivate a heart of supplication and grace in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Zechariah_12_10_and_Jesus_crucifixion_2.htm">How does Zechariah 12:10 foreshadow the crucifixion of Jesus Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Significance_of_Zech_12_10_piercing.htm">Why is the "piercing" in Zechariah 12:10 significant for Christian theology?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Zechariah_12_10_Repentance_Mourning.htm">How does Zechariah 12:10 relate to the concept of repentance and mourning?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_zechariah_12.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Zechariah 12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_no_evidence_for_zechariah_12_10.htm">If Zechariah 12:10 refers to mourning over &#8220;the one they have pierced,&#8221;

Royal house and common people alike receive grace, leading to fervent prayer, a direct gaze upon the Pierced One, and profound national mourning. The sorrow is compared to losing an only or firstborn son, underscoring the singular worth of Christ and the depth of repentance. This prophecy assures that the same God who was pierced provides both the conviction and the cleansing, culminating in Israel&#8217;s salvation and the vindication of His covenant promises.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-14.</span> - &sect; 2. <span class="accented">There shall ensue an outpouring of God's Spirit upon Israel, which shall produce a great national repentance.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will pour.</span> The word implies abundance (comp. <a href="/ezekiel/39-29.htm">Ezekiel 39:29</a>; <a href="/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The house of David, etc</span>.

"Grace" here means the effects produced in man by God's favour, that which makes the recipient pleasing to God and delighting in his commandments (<a href="/hebrews/10-29.htm">Hebrews 10:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They shall look upon me whom they have pierced.</span> The Speaker is Jehovah. To "look upon or unto" implies trust, longing, and reverence (comp. <a href="/numbers/21-9.htm">Numbers 21:9</a>; <a href="/2_kings/3-14.htm">2 Kings 3:14</a>; <a href="/psalms/34-5.htm">Psalm 34:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>). We may say generally that the clause intimates that the people, who had grieved and offended God by their sins and ingratitude, should repent and turn to him in faith. But there was a literal fulfilment of this piercing, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> slaying (<a href="/zechariah/13-3.htm">Zechariah 13:3</a>; <a href="/lamentations/4-9.htm">Lamentations 4:9</a>), when the Jews crucified the Messiah, him who was God and Man, and of whom, as a result of the hypostatic union, the properties of one nature are often predicated of the other. Thus St. Paul says that the Jews crucified "the Lord of glory" (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-8.htm">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>), and bids the Ephesian elders "feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood" (<a href="/acts/20-28.htm">Acts 20:28</a>; for the reading <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, see the critics). St. John (<a href="/john/19-37.htm">John 19:37</a>) refers to these words of Zechariah as a prophecy of the Crucifixion (camp. <a href="/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>). The LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x20;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, "They shall look to me because they insulted," either reading the last verb differently, or understanding it figuratively in the sense of assailing with cutting words; but there is no doubt about the true reading and interpretation. Vulgate, <span class="accented">Aspicient ad me quem confixerunt.</span> "Me" has been altered in some manuscripts into "him:" but this is an evident gloss received into the text for controversial purposes, or to obviate the supposed impropriety of representing Jehovah as slain by the impious. That St. John seems to sanction this reading is of no critical importance, as he is merely referring to the prophecy historically, and does not profess to give the very wording of the prophet. A suffering Messiah was not an unknown idea in Zechariah's time. He has already spoken of the Shepherd as despised and ill-treated, and a little further on (<a href="/zechariah/13-7.htm">Zechariah 13:7</a>) he intimates that he is stricken with the sword. The prophecies of Isaiah had familiarized him with the same notion (<a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, etc.). And when he represents Jehovah as saying, "Me whom they pierced," it is not merely that in killing his messenger and representative they may be said to have killed him, but the prophet, by inspiration, acknowledges the two natures in the one Person of Messiah, even as Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>) called him the "Mighty God," and the psalmists often speak to the same effect (<a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/45-6.htm">Psalm 45:6, 7</a>; <a href="/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, etc.; comp. <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). The "looking to" the stricken Messiah began when they who saw that woeful sight smote their breasts (<a href="/luke/23-48.htm">Luke 23:48</a>); it was carried on by the preaching of the apostles; it shall continue till all Israel is converted; it is re-enacted whenever penitent sinners turn to him whom they have crucified by their sins. Critics have supposed that the person whose murder is deplored is Isaiah, or Urijah, or Jeremiah; but none of these fulfill the prediction in the text. <span class="cmt_word">They shall mourn for him.</span> There is a change of persons here. Jehovah speaks of the Messiah as distinct in Person from himself. <span class="cmt_word">As one mourneth for his only son... for his firstborn.</span> The depth and poignancy of this mourning are expressed by a double comparison, the grief felt at the loss of an only son, and of the firstborn. Among the Hebrews the preservation of the family was deemed of vast importance, and its extinction regarded as a punishment and a curse, so that the death of an only son would be the heaviest blow that could happen (see <a href="/isaiah/47-9.htm">Isaiah 47:9</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/6-26.htm">Jeremiah 6:26</a>; <a href="/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>). Peculiar privileges belonged to the firstborn, and his loss would be estimated accordingly (see <a href="/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>; <a href="/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>; <a href="/micah/6-7.htm">Micah 6:7</a>). The mention of "piercing," just above, seems to connect the passage with the Passover solemnities and the destruction of the firstborn of the Egyptians (see <span class="accented">Expositor</span>, vol. 6. p. 131, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/12-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then I will pour out</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1508;&#1463;&#1499;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;&#353;&#257;&#183;p&#772;a&#7733;&#183;t&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
