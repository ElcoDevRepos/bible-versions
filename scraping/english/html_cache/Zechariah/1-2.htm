He is the Creator and Sustainer of all things, and His name signifies His eternal and self-existent nature. The use of "LORD" in all capitals indicates the translation of the Hebrew name YHWH, emphasizing His personal relationship with His people.<p><b>was very angry</b><br>The Hebrew word used here for "very angry" conveys intense displeasure and wrath. This anger is not arbitrary but is a response to the covenant unfaithfulness of the people. God's anger is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, often resulting from idolatry and disobedience. It is important to note that God's anger is always just and righteous, reflecting His holiness and justice.<p><b>with your fathers</b><br>This phrase refers to the ancestors of the Israelites, particularly those who lived during the time leading up to the Babylonian exile. The "fathers" had repeatedly turned away from God, despite His warnings through the prophets. This historical context is crucial, as it highlights the pattern of rebellion and the consequences that followed, such as the destruction of Jerusalem and the exile. The mention of "your fathers" serves as a reminder of the past mistakes and a call to repentance for the current generation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is expressing His righteous anger towards the forefathers of the Israelites due to their disobedience and idolatry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet called by God to deliver messages of warning and hope to the Israelites during the post-exilic period.
