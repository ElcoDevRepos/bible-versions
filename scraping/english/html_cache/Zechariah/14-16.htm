The "survivors" indicate a remnant, a concept frequently seen in the Old Testament, where God preserves a portion of people for His purposes. This remnant from the nations suggests a future time when those who opposed God's people will have a change of heart. Historically, Jerusalem has been a focal point of conflict, and this prophecy envisions a time of peace and reconciliation. Theologically, it points to the inclusivity of God's kingdom, where even former enemies are invited to worship.<p><b>will go up year after year</b><br>The phrase "go up" is significant as it reflects the physical ascent to Jerusalem, which is situated on a hill. This pilgrimage is not a one-time event but a recurring annual journey, indicating a sustained commitment to worship. The repetition "year after year" emphasizes the perpetual nature of this worship, suggesting a new era of devotion and acknowledgment of God's sovereignty by all nations.<p><b>to worship the King, the LORD of Hosts</b><br>Here, "the King" refers to God Himself, who is recognized as the ultimate sovereign. The title "LORD of Hosts" underscores His authority over the heavenly armies, a common biblical motif that highlights God's power and majesty. This worship signifies a universal recognition of God's kingship, fulfilling prophecies where all nations acknowledge Him (e.g., <a href="/psalms/22-27.htm">Psalm 22:27-28</a>, <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>). It also foreshadows the New Testament revelation of Jesus Christ as King of Kings.<p><b>and to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles</b><br>The Feast of Tabernacles, or Sukkot, is one of the three major Jewish festivals, commemorating the Israelites' wilderness journey and God's provision. It is a time of joy and thanksgiving, marked by dwelling in temporary shelters. This celebration by the nations signifies a future where all people recognize God's provision and protection. It also symbolizes the gathering of the nations to God, as seen in prophetic visions of a united worship (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/56-6.htm">Isaiah 56:6-8</a>). Theologically, it points to the ultimate fulfillment in Christ, who "tabernacled" among us (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>) and provides eternal shelter.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_survivors_of_the_nations.htm">The Survivors of the Nations</a></b><br>These are the people from various nations who have survived the events described earlier in <a href="/bsb/zechariah/14.htm">Zechariah 14</a>, specifically the battle against Jerusalem.

The verse assures that divine judgment will culminate in global worship, covenant faithfulness, and joyful celebration of God&#8217;s dwelling among His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-19.</span> - &sect; 9. <span class="accented">Warned by these manifestations of God's power, the residue of the heathen shall be converted, and shall join with the Hebrews in the regular worship of Jehovah.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every one that is left.</span> All the heathen that attacked the holy city shall not be destroyed; the remnant saved small become subjects of the Divine kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">Shall go up.</span> This is the usual phrase for going to Jerusalem for the purpose of worship (comp. <a href="/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2, 3</a>; <a href="/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>; <a href="/luke/2-42.htm">Luke 2:42</a>; <a href="/john/7-8.htm">John 7:8</a>). The prophet here and in the following clause speaks as a Jew to Jews, who knew and observed only the prescribed form of worship. It is evident that the announcement could never be literally fulfilled; the Gentile world could never come yearly to pay their devotions at Jerusalem. The prediction can only signify that under Messiah's reign the Gentiles shall be converted to true religion and worship God in regular, orderly fashion, the prophet intimating this in terms derived from the old dispensation, which had the Divine sanction. <span class="cmt_word">The Feast of Tabernacles.</span> The Israelites were required to appear before the Lord three times in the year (<a href="/exodus/23-17.htm">Exodus 23:17</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>) - at the festivals of the Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles. But the Gentiles are here required to present themselves only once. The Feast of Tabernacles is chosen for this occasion owing to its peculiar character and the associations connected with it. It commemorated not only the ingathering of the harvest, but also Israel's sojourn in the wilderness and tide Divine protection there accorded to them, and their entrance into tide promised land; it was therefore a fitting symbol of the rescue of the Gentiles from the devil's kingdom, and their entry into the Church of God, where they enjoyed the blessings of God's grace and protection. It was also a more catholic feast, in one sense, titan the Passover or Pentecost, not being so distinctively Jewish, but one which all nations could keep in gratitude to the Giver of material benefits. We must remember, also, that it was at this feast that our Lord cried (<a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37</a>), "If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink," and likewise he declared himself to be "the Light of the world" (<a href="/john/8-12.htm">John 8:12</a>), wishing us, it may be, to understand that this feast was the one we should need to keep, being the one which specially sets him forth as the Sustainer and Guide through life's pilgrimage. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/14-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then all</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1464;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#257;l-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3605.htm">Strong's 3605: </a> </span><span class="str2">The whole, all, any, every</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the survivors</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;&#1464;&#1512;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#183;&#7791;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
