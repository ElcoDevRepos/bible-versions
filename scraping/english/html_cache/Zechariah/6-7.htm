In the context of Zechariah's visions, these horses are part of the chariots that emerge from between two mountains of bronze, signifying strength and stability. Horses in ancient Near Eastern culture were associated with warfare and conquest, indicating that these horses are agents of God's sovereign will. The strength of the horses underscores the certainty and effectiveness of God's plans.<p><b>they were eager to go and patrol the earth</b><br>The eagerness of the horses reflects the urgency and readiness of God's agents to execute His commands. This eagerness can be seen as a metaphor for the divine zeal in ensuring justice and order throughout the earth. The concept of patrolling the earth suggests a comprehensive oversight, reminiscent of the divine surveillance seen in other parts of Scripture, such as in <a href="/job/1-7.htm">Job 1:7</a>, where Satan roams the earth, and in <a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>, where the eyes of the LORD range throughout the earth.<p><b>and the LORD said, &#8220;Go and patrol the earth.&#8221;</b><br>The direct command from the LORD emphasizes His authority and the initiation of divine action. This command reflects God's active involvement in the affairs of the world, ensuring that His purposes are fulfilled. The repetition of the command to patrol the earth highlights the importance of divine oversight and the establishment of His justice. It also connects to the theme of God's sovereignty over all nations, as seen in other prophetic books like Daniel and Revelation.<p><b>So they patrolled the earth.</b><br>The fulfillment of the LORD's command demonstrates the obedience of His agents and the execution of His will. This patrolling signifies a divine presence and intervention in the world, ensuring that God's plans are carried out. It serves as a reassurance to the faithful that God is in control and actively working to bring about His purposes. The act of patrolling can also be seen as a precursor to the final judgment, where God's justice will be fully realized, as depicted in the eschatological visions of Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet who received visions from God, including the vision of the four chariots in <a href="/bsb/zechariah/6.htm">Zechariah 6</a>.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_strong_horses.htm">The Strong Horses</a></b><br>Symbolic figures in Zechariah's vision, representing God's agents of judgment and peace.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth.htm">The Earth</a></b><br>The domain over which the horses are sent to patrol, symbolizing the entirety of the world under God's sovereignty.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The one commanding the horses, demonstrating His authority and control over the earth.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vision_of_the_four_chariots.htm">The Vision of the Four Chariots</a></b><br>A prophetic vision given to Zechariah, symbolizing God's judgment and the establishment of His peace.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The vision emphasizes God's control over the entire earth.

Because the vision follows chapter 1, where horses symbolize angelic messengers (<a href="/zechariah/1-8.htm">Zechariah 1:8-11</a>), we understand these to be real spirit beings commissioned by God. Scripture consistently presents such heavenly hosts as literal servants who ride or accompany chariots of judgment and protection (<a href="/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a>). Their strength underscores the certainty of God&#8217;s purposes: what He sends them to accomplish will not fail.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They were eager to go and patrol the earth</b><p>Eagerness reveals heaven&#8217;s attitude toward obeying the Lord:<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20-21</a> affirms that angels &#8220;excel in strength, who do His word, obeying the voice of His word.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a> says, &#8220;For the eyes of the LORD roam to and fro over all the earth,&#8221; highlighting the same zeal now expressed by these horses.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2-8</a> shows rider-messengers swift to execute end-time judgments.<p>Their impatience is not reckless but righteous; they long to carry out God&#8217;s watchful and disciplinary work on a world that often forgets Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the LORD said, &#8220;Go and patrol the earth.&#8221;</b><p>Heaven does nothing on its own initiative; God&#8217;s explicit word commissions the mission. The statement echoes <a href="/job/1-7.htm">Job 1:7</a>, where the LORD questions Satan about his roaming, and <a href="/zechariah/1-10.htm">Zechariah 1:10-11</a>, where mounted scouts report back to Him. The contrast is stark: evil roams restlessly, but God&#8217;s servants roam under direct command. By repeating the horses&#8217; desire in His order, the LORD affirms their readiness and authorizes their immediate departure. This reminds us that the whole earth is the LORD&#8217;s vineyard (<a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>), subject to His inspection.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So they patrolled the earth.</b><p>The mission is accomplished exactly as spoken, emphasizing perfect obedience (<a href="/psalms/33-9.htm">Psalm 33:9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a> notes, &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are in every place, keeping watch on the evil and the good.&#8221; Now those &#8220;eyes&#8221; are embodied in these patrols.<p>&#8226; <a href="/jeremiah/25-31.htm">Jeremiah 25:31-33</a> portrays God&#8217;s global reach in judging nations&#8212;a task these patrols foreshadow.<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/5-6.htm">Revelation 5:6</a> depicts the Lamb with &#8220;seven eyes&#8230;sent out into all the earth,&#8221; a later fulfillment of the same worldwide oversight.<p>Zechariah&#8217;s audience, fresh from exile, could rest knowing God actively surveys the nations that once oppressed them and will keep His promises of peace and justice.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/6-7.htm">Zechariah 6:7</a> shows God&#8217;s mighty messengers bursting forth, eager and empowered to survey the world.
