In the context of Zechariah, it points to a time of purification and restoration for Israel. This eschatological theme is common in prophetic literature, indicating a decisive moment when God will act to fulfill His purposes.<p><b>every prophet who prophesies</b><br>The mention of "every prophet" suggests a comprehensive purging of false prophecy. In ancient Israel, prophets were seen as messengers of God, but false prophets often led people astray. This phrase indicates a time when true and false prophecy will be clearly distinguished, aligning with the biblical call for discernment (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>).<p><b>will be ashamed of his vision</b><br>Shame here implies a recognition of wrongdoing and deceit. In biblical culture, shame was a powerful social force, often associated with sin and failure. This phrase suggests that false prophets will be exposed and will feel the weight of their deception, similar to the exposure of false prophets in <a href="/jeremiah/23-30.htm">Jeremiah 23:30-32</a>.<p><b>and he will not put on a hairy cloak</b><br>The "hairy cloak" was a garment traditionally associated with prophets, as seen with Elijah (<a href="/2_kings/1-8.htm">2 Kings 1:8</a>). It symbolized authority and authenticity. The refusal to wear such a cloak indicates a rejection of false appearances and a move towards authenticity in spiritual leadership.<p><b>in order to deceive</b><br>Deception is a key theme here, highlighting the misuse of prophetic office for personal gain or influence. This aligns with warnings against false prophets throughout Scripture (<a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>). The emphasis is on the need for integrity and truthfulness in those who claim to speak for God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Individuals who claim to speak on behalf of God.
