This title underscores God's command over the heavenly armies and His sovereignty over all creation. It is a reminder of God's ultimate authority and His ability to fulfill His promises. This title is frequently used in prophetic literature to assert God's control over historical events and His protection of His people.<p><b>After His Glory has sent Me:</b><br>This phrase suggests a mission or commission that follows the manifestation of God's glory. The "Glory" here can be understood as the divine presence or Shekinah, which was evident in the tabernacle and temple. The speaker, likely the Angel of the LORD or a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ, is sent by God to accomplish a specific task. This reflects the Trinitarian concept where the Son is sent by the Father, aligning with New Testament themes where Jesus is sent to fulfill God's redemptive plan.<p><b>against the nations that have plundered you:</b><br>This refers to the judgment against the nations that have oppressed Israel. Historically, Israel faced invasions and plundering by various empires, including Assyria, Babylon, and later, Persia. This phrase indicates a reversal of fortunes where God will act against those who have harmed His people. It echoes the covenantal promise of protection and retribution found in <a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>, where God promises to bless those who bless Israel and curse those who curse them.<p><b>for whoever touches you touches the apple of His eye&#8212;</b><br>The "apple of His eye" is a metaphor for something precious and highly valued. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the eye was considered the most sensitive and protected part of the body. This imagery conveys God's deep affection and protective care for Israel. It implies that any harm done to Israel is taken personally by God, highlighting the intimate relationship between God and His chosen people. This concept is reinforced in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a> and <a href="/psalms/17-8.htm">Psalm 17:8</a>, where God's protective love for Israel is likened to guarding the pupil of the eye.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>This title emphasizes God's supreme authority and power over the heavenly armies.

That points to the Messiah, the Sent One, acting so that God&#8217;s honor is upheld (<a href="/john/17-4.htm">John 17:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Old-Testament glimpses of this divine mission appear in <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a> (&#8220;The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon Me, because the LORD has anointed Me&#8230;&#8221;) and in <a href="/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a> (&#8220;He will stand and shepherd&#8230;in the majesty of the name of the LORD&#8221;).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s glory is never abstract; it moves toward His people in rescue and vindication (<a href="/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>, <a href="/psalms/96-2.htm">Psalm 96:2-3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Against the nations that have plundered you</b><p>&#8226; Historically, Judah had been ravaged by Babylon (<a href="/2_kings/25-8.htm">2 Kings 25:8-10</a>).

So, any harm against God&#8217;s people provokes immediate divine response.<p>&#8226; <a href="/deuteronomy/32-10.htm">Deuteronomy 32:10</a> celebrates how God &#8220;shielded&#8221; Israel as &#8220;the apple of His eye,&#8221; and David prays, &#8220;Keep me as the apple of Your eye&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/17-8.htm">Psalm 17:8</a>).<p>&#8226; This image conveys:<p>&#8211; Value: God cherishes His people as most precious.<p>&#8211; Sensitivity: He is not indifferent; He feels their pain (<a href="/isaiah/63-9.htm">Isaiah 63:9</a>).<p>&#8211; Protection: He instinctively moves to guard what is dear to Him (<a href="/zechariah/2-5.htm">Zechariah 2:5</a>, &#8220;I will be a wall of fire around her&#8221;).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/2-8.htm">Zechariah 2:8</a> is God&#8217;s emphatic promise that He Himself, in the person of the Sent One, will rise in defense of His covenant people. Their oppressors will face the same armies of heaven that once judged Egypt and Babylon. To injure God&#8217;s people is to poke at the most sensitive part of His own eye&#8212;an act guaranteed to draw swift, protective, and righteous reaction. The verse therefore stands as both warning to the nations and comfort to believers: the LORD of Hosts guards what is precious to Him, and His glory is forever tied to their ultimate vindication.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">After the glory hath he sent me.</span> <span class="accented">After glory</span> (there is no article in the original), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to win honour, <span class="accented">hath Jehovah sent me</span> - the superior angel who speaks.

The angel is sent to get glory over the heathen by taking vengeance on them (comp. <a href="/exodus/14-18.htm">Exodus 14:18</a>).

Israel is very precious to God; and they who vex and harass him are as they who hurt that which God prizes inestimably, and which a mere touch offends and injures. The word rendered "apple" is usually considered in mean "aperture," or "gate," the pupil being the entrance to the visual organ; but Dr. Wright regards it rather as a natural word of endearment, like the Latin, <span class="accented">pupa, pupilla</span>, indicating "a doll," "little maiden of the eye."
