The act of revocation signifies God's judgment and the withdrawal of His protection and blessing from the people. Historically, this can be seen as a foreshadowing of the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple in AD 70. The "day" mentioned is a specific time of divine action, emphasizing the immediacy and certainty of God's judgment.<p><b>and so the afflicted of the flock</b><br>The "afflicted of the flock" refers to the faithful remnant among the people of Israel. Throughout the Old Testament, God often preserves a remnant who remain faithful to Him despite widespread apostasy. This group is characterized by their suffering and oppression, often at the hands of corrupt leaders. In a broader sense, this can be seen as a type of the faithful believers who endure trials and remain steadfast in their faith.<p><b>who were watching me</b><br>The act of watching implies attentiveness and expectation. The afflicted remnant is portrayed as being vigilant and discerning, recognizing the actions and words of the prophet as significant. This vigilance is a mark of true discipleship, as seen in other scriptures where believers are called to be watchful and alert (e.g., <a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42</a>).<p><b>knew that it was the word of the LORD</b><br>This acknowledgment underscores the prophetic authority of Zechariah's message. The afflicted remnant, through their spiritual insight, recognize that the events unfolding are not merely human actions but are divinely orchestrated. This recognition is a testament to their faith and understanding. The phrase also highlights the theme of divine revelation, where God's word is made known to those who are spiritually perceptive. This is consistent with the biblical pattern where God's true followers discern His voice amidst the noise of the world (e.g., <a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zechariah.htm">Zechariah</a></b><br>A prophet of the Old Testament, Zechariah is the author of this book.

That act symbolizes God canceling a protective covenant with Israel.<p>- &#8220;Revoked on that day&#8221; signals a decisive, historical moment when divine patience ran out, much like the flood generation (<a href="/genesis/6-3.htm">Genesis 6:3</a>,13) or the fall of Jerusalem cited in <a href="/2_kings/25-1.htm">2 Kings 25:1&#8211;11</a>.<p>- The timing underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty: He chooses the day, and what He decrees happens immediately (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>- Practical takeaway: when God speaks of judgment or blessing, the fulfillment may arrive suddenly, so remaining responsive is essential (<a href="/luke/12-40.htm">Luke 12:40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and so the afflicted of the flock</b><p>- &#8220;Afflicted&#8221; (also rendered poor or oppressed) identifies the faithful remnant within Israel&#8212;those who feel the weight of national sin yet stay humble before God (<a href="/psalms/34-18.htm">Psalm 34:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>).<p>- Scripture repeatedly highlights God&#8217;s special concern for such believers: He raises the poor from the dust (<a href="/1_samuel/2-8.htm">1 Samuel 2:8</a>) and hears the cry of the humble (<a href="/psalms/10-17.htm">Psalm 10:17</a>).<p>- Here, the remnant becomes a living testimony that God has not abandoned His own, even when judgment falls on the wider community (<a href="/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16&#8211;18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who were watching me</b><p>- The remnant isn&#8217;t passive; they &#8220;watch&#8221; the shepherd&#8212;Zechariah portraying the Messiah-Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>,14).<p>- Watching implies expectation and discernment. While many ignore prophetic signs, these believers stay alert, echoing Jesus&#8217; later command: &#8220;Watch and pray&#8221; (<a href="/mark/13-33.htm">Mark 13:33</a>).<p>- Their watchfulness enables them to recognize God&#8217;s handiwork where others see only political or social upheaval (<a href="/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25&#8211;32</a> with Simeon and Anna).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>knew that it was the word of the LORD</b><p>- Recognition is the reward of faithfulness. Because they had ears to hear, the remnant could say, &#8220;This is God&#8217;s word come true,&#8221; paralleling how the disciples understood Jesus&#8217; predictions after the resurrection (<a href="/john/2-22.htm">John 2:22</a>).<p>- This certainty steadies believers amid crisis; knowing God&#8217;s word is being fulfilled breeds hope, not despair (<a href="/romans/15-4.htm">Romans 15:4</a>).<p>- The scene previews a larger theme: when Christ is rejected (<a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12&#8211;13</a>, cf. <a href="/matthew/27-9.htm">Matthew 27:9&#8211;10</a>), the faithful remnant will still discern God&#8217;s plan unfolding (<a href="/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32&#8211;36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/zechariah/11-11.htm">Zechariah 11:11</a> captures a pivotal instant: God&#8217;s protective covenant is revoked, judgment falls, yet a humble remnant recognizes His hand. Their alert faith confirms the reliability of God&#8217;s word, urging us today to stay watchful, align with the Shepherd, and rest assured that every promise&#8212;whether of discipline or deliverance&#8212;will stand.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It was broken.</span> The covenant just mentioned (ver. 10) was broken. <span class="cmt_word">And so the poor of the flock that waited upon me</span> (<span class="accented">that gave heed unto me</span>) <span class="cmt_word">know</span>. The punishment inflicted on the withdrawal of God's protection had some good result. Though the bulk of the nation took no heed, learned no lesson, yet the humble and the suffering among them, who paid respect to his words, recognized that what happened was according to God's Word, and knew that all the rest would be fulfilled in due season. This was the effect of the Captivity; it forced the Israelites to see the hand of the Lord in the calamities that had befallen them, and it drove the thoughtful among them to repentance and amendment (<a href="/jeremiah/3-13.htm">Jeremiah 3:13, 23</a>; <a href="/daniel/9-8.htm">Daniel 9:8</a>, etc.). The breaking asunder of the first staff refers primarily to the time of the exile, and not to the absolute relinquishment of the flock. One staff is left, and for a time utter destruction is postponed. For "the poor," the LXX. reads, as in ver. 7, "the Cananeans," meaning probably "merchants." Ewald and others, who hold the pre-exilian date of this prophecy, see here an allusion to the invasion of the Assyrians under Pul (<a href="/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/11-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">It was revoked</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1467;&#1508;&#1463;&#1430;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(wat&#183;tu&#183;p&#772;ar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
