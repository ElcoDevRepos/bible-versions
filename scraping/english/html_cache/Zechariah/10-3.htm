In the context of Zechariah, these shepherds are likely the political and spiritual leaders who have failed in their duties to guide and protect the people. The imagery of shepherds is common in the Bible, with leaders like Moses and David being positive examples, while false prophets and corrupt leaders are often criticized (<a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2-10</a>). The anger of God here reflects His righteousness and justice, as He holds leaders accountable for their stewardship.<p><b>and I will punish the leaders</b><br>The punishment of the leaders is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, where God holds those in authority responsible for leading the people astray. This punishment can be seen as both a warning and a corrective measure, aiming to restore proper leadership. Historically, this could refer to the leaders during the post-exilic period who were not fulfilling their roles effectively. The idea of divine retribution is consistent with the covenantal relationship between God and Israel, where blessings and curses are contingent upon obedience (Deuteronomy 28).<p><b>For the LORD of Hosts attends to His flock, the house of Judah</b><br>The term "LORD of Hosts" emphasizes God's sovereignty and power, often used in contexts of divine intervention and warfare. "His flock" refers to the people of Judah, highlighting God's personal care and commitment to His covenant people. This phrase reassures the faithful that despite the failures of human leaders, God Himself will shepherd His people. The imagery of God as a shepherd is prevalent throughout Scripture, notably in <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a> and <a href="/john/10.htm">John 10</a>, where Jesus is described as the Good Shepherd.<p><b>He will make them like His royal steed in battle</b><br>This metaphor of transformation from a flock to a royal steed signifies empowerment and victory. In ancient Near Eastern culture, a royal steed was a symbol of strength, speed, and majesty, often associated with kings and military leaders. This transformation suggests that God will equip Judah with the strength and capability to overcome their adversaries. It also foreshadows the Messianic hope, where the ultimate victory is achieved through Jesus Christ, who is often depicted as a conquering king (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shepherds.htm">The Shepherds</a></b><br>These are the leaders of Israel, both spiritual and political, who have failed in their duties to guide and protect the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord_of_hosts.htm">The LORD of Hosts</a></b><br>A title for God emphasizing His sovereignty and command over the heavenly armies, highlighting His power and authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_house_of_judah.htm">The House of Judah</a></b><br>Represents the southern kingdom of Israel, often used to symbolize the faithful remnant of God's people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_majestic_horse_in_battle.htm">The Majestic Horse in Battle</a></b><br>A metaphor for strength, nobility, and readiness for spiritual warfare, symbolizing how God will empower His people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_punishment.htm">The Punishment</a></b><br>God's judgment against the unfaithful leaders, indicating His commitment to justice and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_righteous_anger.htm">God's Righteous Anger</a></b><br>Understand that God's anger is directed towards leaders who fail in their responsibilities.

God denounces corrupt shepherds, guarantees their punishment, and then turns tenderly to His flock, promising attentive care and a future of victorious strength. Leadership may fail, but the Lord never does; He disciplines the unfaithful, protects His people, and empowers them to advance His kingdom with the boldness and beauty of a royal steed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/zechariah/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3, 4.</span> - &sect; 5. <span class="accented">The evil rulers set over them for their sins shall be removed, and Israel shall be firmly established.</span> Ver. 3, - <span class="cmt_word">Mine anger was</span> (<span class="accented">is</span>) <span class="cmt_word">kindled against the shepherds.</span> These heathen rulers were indeed God's instruments in punishing his people, but they had exceeded their commission, and afflicted Israel in order to carry out their own evil designs, and now they themselves shall be chastised. Some commentators raise "the shepherds" to be the rulers of Israel civil and ecclesiastical, comparing <a href="/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2, 5</a>, etc. But the context leads us to consider them as those who took the place of rulers of Israel when she had no shepherd of her own (ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">I punished</span> (<span class="accented">will punish</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the goats</span> (<span class="accented">bellwethers</span>); literally, <span class="accented">will visit upon</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> will chastise. The same word (<span class="accented">paquad</span>) is used in the next clause in a good sense. The "goats" are the leading men, those powerful for evil, as <a href="/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>. Hath visited his flock. The reason why the evil shepherds are punished is because God visits his flock in love and care, to see their state and to relieve them from trouble (<a href="/zephaniah/2-7.htm">Zephaniah 2:7</a>). The house of Judah here includes all the nation, to which it afterwards gave its name. <span class="cmt_word">Hath made</span> (<span class="accented">shall make</span>) <span class="cmt_word">them as his goodly horse</span>. The Israelites shall not only be delivered from oppression, but God shall use them as a stately war horse, richly caparisoned, to tread down enemies and triumph ever them. So he said before (<a href="/zechariah/9-13.htm">Zechariah 9:13</a>) that he would make Judah his bow and Ephraim his arrow. (For a description of the war horse, see <a href="/job/39-19.htm">Job 39:19-25</a>; comp. <a href="/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-14.htm">Revelation 19:14</a>, where Christ is represented riding on a white horse, and his saints following him on white horses.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/zechariah/10-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;My anger</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1463;&#1508;&#1468;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;ap&#183;p&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine singular construct &#124;
