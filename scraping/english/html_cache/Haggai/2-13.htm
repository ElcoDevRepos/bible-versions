This question is part of a series of inquiries meant to illustrate spiritual truths through the Law.<p><b>&#8220;If one who is defiled by contact with a corpse</b><br>Contact with a corpse was considered one of the most severe forms of ritual impurity under Mosaic Law (<a href="/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11-13</a>). This impurity required a purification process, highlighting the seriousness of death as a result of sin. The defilement symbolizes the pervasive nature of sin and its ability to contaminate.<p><b>touches any of these,</b><br>The "these" refers to the holy offerings and sacrifices. The question implies that holiness cannot be transferred, but impurity can. This reflects the broader biblical theme that sin spreads more easily than holiness, emphasizing the need for vigilance in maintaining purity.<p><b>does it become defiled?&#8221;</b><br>This rhetorical question underscores the principle that impurity is easily transmitted. It serves as a metaphor for the spiritual state of the people, suggesting that their unrepentant hearts could defile their worship and offerings, making them unacceptable to God.<p><b>&#8220;Yes, it becomes defiled,&#8221; the priests answered.</b><br>The priests, experts in the Law, confirm the principle of defilement. Their response aligns with Levitical teachings and underscores the importance of maintaining ritual purity.
