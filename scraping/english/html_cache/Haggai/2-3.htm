The "house" refers to Solomon's Temple, renowned for its grandeur and splendor. The question implies that some among the people had seen the original temple before its destruction in 586 BC. This highlights the historical context of the post-exilic period, where the returnees faced the daunting task of rebuilding the temple. The mention of "former glory" evokes the memory of a time when Israel was united and prosperous, underlining the contrast with their current situation. This also serves as a reminder of God's past blessings and the hope for future restoration.<p><b>How does it look to you now?</b><br>This question invites the people to reflect on the current state of the temple, which was in ruins at the time. The physical desolation of the temple mirrors the spiritual and national desolation of Israel. The rebuilding effort was a significant undertaking, both physically and spiritually, as it symbolized the renewal of the covenant relationship with God. This reflection encourages the people to consider their priorities and the importance of worship in their community life. It also challenges them to see beyond the physical structure to the spiritual significance of the temple as the dwelling place of God's presence.<p><b>Does it not appear to you like nothing in comparison?</b><br>This rhetorical question acknowledges the stark contrast between the former temple's magnificence and the current humble beginnings of the new temple. It addresses the discouragement among the people who may have felt that their efforts were insignificant. This sentiment is echoed in <a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>, which speaks of not despising "the day of small things." The comparison serves to remind the people that God's presence and glory are not limited by physical appearances. It also foreshadows the greater glory to come, as prophesied later in <a href="/haggai/2-9.htm">Haggai 2:9</a>, where the future glory of the temple is promised to surpass the former.

Many have thought that Haggai himself was of the number. It was sixty-eight years ago that the temple was destroyed, and we can well believe that its remarkable features were deeply impressed on the minds of those who as boys or youths had loved and admired it. Ezra tells us (<a href="/ezra/3-12.htm">Ezra 3:12</a>) that "many of the priests and Levites" [when the foundation first was laid] and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house,... wept with a loud voice." This house. The prophet identifies the present with Solomon's temple, as being adapted for the same purposes, to fill the same place in the national life, built on the same hallowed spot, and partly with the same materials. In the Jews' eyes there was one only temple, whatever might be the date of its erection or the comparative worth of its decorations and materials. <span class="cmt_word">First</span>; <span class="accented">former</span>, as ver. 9. <span class="cmt_word">How do ye see it now?</span> (<a href="/numbers/13-18.htm">Numbers 13:18</a>). In what condition do ye see this house now? <span class="cmt_word">Is it not in your eyes in com<span class="accented">parison</span> of it as nothing?</span> The words, "in comparison of it," ought to be omitted, as not required by the Hebrew idiom. Does it not seem in your eyes as if it had no existence? If the injunction of Cyrus (<a href="/ezra/1-3.htm">Ezra 1:3</a>, etc.) had been carried out, the dimensions cf. the new temple would have exceeded those of the old; but Zerubbabel seems to have been unable, with the small resources at his disposal, to execute the original design, though even so the proportions were not greatly inferior to those of the earlier temple. But the chief inferiority lay in the absence of the splendour and enrichment with which Solomon adorned his edifice. The gold which he had lavished on the house was no longer available; the precious stones could not be had. Besides. these defects, the Talmudists reckon five things wanting in this second temple, viz. the ark of the covenant, with the cherubim and mercy seat; the holy fire; the Shechinah; the spirit of prophecy; the Urim and Thnmmim. It was, according to Josephus, only half the height of Solomon's-sixty cubits ('Ant.,' 15:11, 1), and it appears to have been in many respects inferior to the first building ('Ant.,' 4:02). Hecabaeus of Abdera gives the dimensions of the courts as five hundred feet in length and a hundred cubits in breadth (double the width of the court of the tabernacle), and the size of the altar as twenty cubits square and ten cubits high (see Josephus, 'Cont. Ap.,' 1:22; Conder, 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 370). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/haggai/2-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8216;Who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1444;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">is left</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1504;&#1468;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1428;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(han&#183;ni&#353;&#183;&#8217;&#257;r)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
