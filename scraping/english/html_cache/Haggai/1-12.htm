Zerubbabel, a descendant of David, played a crucial role in the rebuilding of the temple, symbolizing the restoration of the Davidic line. Joshua, the high priest, represented the spiritual leadership necessary for the community's renewal. Their partnership highlights the importance of both political and spiritual leadership in guiding the people.<p><b>as well as all the remnant of the people</b><br>The "remnant" refers to those who returned from Babylonian exile. This group was a small fraction of the original population, emphasizing themes of faithfulness and divine preservation. The concept of a remnant is significant throughout Scripture, often representing those who remain faithful to God amidst widespread unfaithfulness.<p><b>obeyed the voice of the LORD their God and the words of the prophet Haggai</b><br>Obedience to God's voice, as conveyed through His prophets, is a recurring biblical theme. Haggai's message was a call to prioritize the rebuilding of the temple, reflecting the need for the community to align their actions with God's will. This obedience is a response to divine authority and prophetic revelation, underscoring the role of prophets as God's messengers.<p><b>because the LORD their God had sent him</b><br>The authority of Haggai's message is rooted in his divine commissioning. The acknowledgment that God sent Haggai reinforces the legitimacy of his prophetic words. This divine sending is a common motif in the prophetic tradition, where the prophet's authority is derived from their calling by God.<p><b>So the people feared the LORD</b><br>The fear of the LORD is a foundational biblical concept, often associated with reverence, awe, and obedience. It signifies a recognition of God's holiness and authority. In this context, the people's fear leads to action, demonstrating a proper response to God's commands and the prophetic message.
