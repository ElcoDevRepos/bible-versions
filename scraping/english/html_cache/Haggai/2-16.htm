The context is the post-exilic period, after the return from Babylonian captivity. The people had begun to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem but had become discouraged and distracted by their own affairs. "From that time" indicates a turning point or a period of reflection on the consequences of their actions, or lack thereof, in prioritizing God's house.<p><b>when one came expecting a heap of twenty ephahs of grain</b><br>An ephah is a unit of dry measure used in ancient Israel, roughly equivalent to 22 liters or about half a bushel. The expectation of a heap of twenty ephahs signifies a hope for abundance and prosperity. However, this expectation is not met, highlighting the theme of unmet expectations due to disobedience. This reflects the covenantal curses found in <a href="/deuteronomy/28.htm">Deuteronomy 28</a>, where disobedience leads to agricultural failure.<p><b>there were but ten</b><br>The actual yield being half of what was expected serves as a tangible sign of God's displeasure with the people. It underscores the principle that spiritual neglect leads to material lack. This reduction in yield is a direct consequence of the people's failure to prioritize the rebuilding of the temple, as God had commanded. It serves as a call to repentance and realignment with God's purposes.<p><b>When one came to the winepress to draw out fifty baths</b><br>A bath is a unit of liquid measure, approximately 22 liters or about 6 gallons. The winepress is a place where grapes are crushed to produce wine, a staple in the diet and economy of ancient Israel. The expectation of drawing out fifty baths indicates a desire for a plentiful harvest. Wine is often symbolic of joy and blessing in Scripture, and the lack thereof points to a spiritual and physical drought.<p><b>there were but twenty</b><br>The shortfall in the winepress yield, similar to the grain, is a sign of divine judgment. The reduction to twenty baths from the expected fifty illustrates the futility of their efforts without God's blessing. This serves as a reminder of the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience brings blessing and disobedience results in curse. It also foreshadows the need for a greater fulfillment in Christ, who is the true vine and source of spiritual abundance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/haggai.htm">Haggai</a></b><br>A prophet who ministered to the Jewish people after their return from Babylonian exile.

That is the &#8220;time&#8221; under review here.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When one came expecting a heap of twenty ephahs of grain</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Expecting&#8221; highlights the normal harvest calculation: sowed seed + God-given increase ought to equal about twenty ephahs.<p>&#8226; God had established the principle of proportional blessing for covenant faithfulness (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-8.htm">Deuteronomy 28:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/67-5.htm">Psalm 67:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Because Judah had neglected the temple, the expected pile never materialized&#8212;echoing earlier warning, &#8220;You have sown much, but bring in little&#8221; (<a href="/haggai/1-6.htm">Haggai 1:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There were but ten</b><p>&#8226; The crop was literally cut in half. The shortfall is not coincidence; it is the LORD&#8217;s direct intervention. &#8220;I blew it away&#8221; (<a href="/haggai/1-9.htm">Haggai 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Half-harvest mirrors covenant curses: &#8220;You shall plant vineyards and cultivate them, but you will not drink the wine&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/28-39.htm">Deuteronomy 28:39</a>).<p>&#8226; The reduction exposes a heart issue: misaligned worship results in measurable loss (<a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9&#8211;10</a> shows the reverse blessing when God is honored).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>When one came to the winepress to draw out fifty baths</b><p>&#8226; Vintage season offered a second chance at abundance&#8212;grapes after grain. Judah anticipated fifty baths (roughly fifty large containers).<p>&#8226; Again, the expectation is grounded in God&#8217;s past faithfulness (<a href="/joel/2-24.htm">Joel 2:24</a>, &#8220;The vats will overflow with new wine&#8221;).<p>&#8226; The winepress scene underscores that every sector of their economy&#8212;field and vineyard&#8212;was under divine review.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>There were but twenty</b><p>&#8226; Sixty percent of the wine is missing. God is not subtle; He withholds exactly enough to get His people&#8217;s attention (<a href="/amos/4-9.htm">Amos 4:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The number echoes earlier judgments on Israel&#8217;s unfaithfulness (<a href="/isaiah/5-10.htm">Isaiah 5:10</a>, &#8220;A ten-acre vineyard will yield only a bath&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Yet the discipline is fatherly, intended to drive Judah back to covenant obedience so He can restore full blessing (<a href="/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10&#8211;11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Summary</b><p><a href="/haggai/2-16.htm">Haggai 2:16</a> records God&#8217;s vivid reminder that before the people put His house first, their harvests came up short&#8212;half the grain, less than half the wine. The shortfall was not random economics; it was the LORD&#8217;s covenant discipline, matching earlier warnings and designed to awaken repentance. Once Judah realigned its priorities, the same God who had withheld could&#8212;and would&#8212;release overflowing provision. The verse therefore stands as a timeless call: honor the LORD wholeheartedly, and trust Him for the full measure of blessing He delights to give.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/haggai/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Since those days were.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">from the time when things were</span> so, or, <span class= "ital">since such things were</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> throughout that whole period of neglect up to the date when they resumed the work of restoration.
