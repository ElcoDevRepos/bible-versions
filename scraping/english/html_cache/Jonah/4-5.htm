This action reflects his internal struggle and dissatisfaction with God's decision to spare the Ninevites. Historically, Nineveh was a significant city in the Assyrian Empire, known for its size and influence. Jonah's exit indicates his desire to distance himself from the people he was sent to warn.<p><b>and sat down east of it</b><br>The eastward direction is often symbolic in biblical texts, sometimes representing exile or separation from God's presence, as seen in <a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a> when Adam and Eve are expelled from Eden. Jonah's choice to sit east of Nineveh may symbolize his self-imposed separation from God's plan and his struggle with accepting divine compassion.<p><b>where he made himself a shelter</b><br>Jonah's construction of a shelter suggests a temporary dwelling, indicating his intention to wait and observe the outcome for Nineveh. This act of building a shelter can be seen as a parallel to the Israelites' experience in the wilderness, where they relied on temporary structures and God's provision.<p><b>and sat in its shade</b><br>The shade provided by the shelter represents Jonah's attempt to find comfort and protection from the harsh elements. In a broader sense, shade in the Bible often symbolizes God's protection and care, as seen in <a href="/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5</a>. However, Jonah's reliance on his own shelter rather than seeking God's guidance highlights his stubbornness and self-reliance.<p><b>to see what would happen to the city</b><br>Jonah's anticipation of Nineveh's fate reveals his hope for the city's destruction, despite God's warning and the people's repentance. This expectation contrasts with God's merciful nature and foreshadows the lesson Jonah is about to learn regarding compassion and divine grace. Jonah's attitude is reminiscent of the elder brother in the parable of the Prodigal Son (<a href="/luke/15-25.htm">Luke 15:25-32</a>), who struggles with accepting the father's forgiveness towards the repentant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonah.htm">Jonah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who was initially reluctant to deliver God's message to Nineveh.

Having preached God&#8217;s word (<a href="/jonah/3-1.htm">Jonah 3:1-4</a>) and seen the people repent (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-10</a>), he removes himself from their midst, distancing himself from a work of mercy he does not yet share.<p>&#8226; Similar withdrawals appear elsewhere: Abraham stepped away to view Sodom&#8217;s fate (<a href="/genesis/19-27.htm">Genesis 19:27-28</a>), and the older brother stood outside the father&#8217;s house in Jesus&#8217; parable (<a href="/luke/15-28.htm">Luke 15:28-30</a>). Both scenes spotlight hearts reluctant to celebrate grace.<p>&#8226; The literal narrative underscores that even a God-sent prophet can resist divine compassion. Scripture never soft-pedals the flaws of its heroes, reminding us that &#8220;all have sinned&#8221; (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and sat down east of it</b><p>&#8220;He sat down east of it&#8221; (<a href="/jonah/4-5.htm">Jonah 4:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Choosing the east places Jonah with the rising sun at his back and the city before him&#8212;an ideal vantage for judgment. Cain moved east after killing Abel (<a href="/genesis/4-16.htm">Genesis 4:16</a>), and the cherubim guarded Eden&#8217;s east gate (<a href="/genesis/3-24.htm">Genesis 3:24</a>); east often carries overtones of separation.<p>&#8226; Jonah&#8217;s posture&#8212;sitting&#8212;signals waiting, not labor. By contrast, Jesus &#8220;sat down&#8221; only after completing redemption (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>). Jonah sits while God is still working.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where he made himself a shelter</b><p>&#8220;He made himself a shelter&#8221; (<a href="/jonah/4-5.htm">Jonah 4:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The temporary booth recalls the Feast of Booths (<a href="/leviticus/23-42.htm">Leviticus 23:42-43</a>), a celebration of God&#8217;s provision in the wilderness. Ironically, Jonah constructs a booth to protect himself while begrudging God&#8217;s protection of Nineveh.<p>&#8226; The prophet acts independently; the text emphasizes &#8220;himself.&#8221; He is relying on personal ingenuity, not divine direction, unlike Elijah who received God-provided shelter at Cherith (<a href="/1_kings/17-3.htm">1 Kings 17:3-6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and sat in its shade</b><p>&#8220;He sat in its shade&#8221; (<a href="/jonah/4-5.htm">Jonah 4:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Shade represents relief and security (<a href="/psalms/121-5.htm">Psalm 121:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>). Jonah seeks comfort even as he hopes for calamity upon others.<p>&#8226; This small detail sets the stage for God&#8217;s lesson through the plant (<a href="/jonah/4-6.htm">Jonah 4:6-8</a>). The God who provides shade will soon remove it to expose Jonah&#8217;s heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to see what would happen to the city</b><p>&#8220;to see what would happen to the city&#8221; (<a href="/jonah/4-5.htm">Jonah 4:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Jonah is still hoping for judgment despite God&#8217;s stated mercy (<a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>). Like the disciples who asked Jesus to call down fire on a Samaritan village (<a href="/luke/9-54.htm">Luke 9:54-55</a>), he misunderstands God&#8217;s purposes.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s patience aims at repentance, not wrath (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>). Jonah&#8217;s attitude contrasts with the heavenly joy when sinners repent (<a href="/luke/15-7.htm">Luke 15:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment frames a showdown between Jonah&#8217;s desire for retribution and God&#8217;s desire for redemption&#8212;an enduring tension resolved at the Cross where justice and mercy meet (<a href="/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24-26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jonah physically removes himself from Nineveh, positions himself eastward, constructs a personal shelter, rests in its shade, and waits for destruction that God has already averted. Each step reveals a prophet clinging to self-interest and national pride while God continues to display boundless mercy. The verse invites readers to recognize any similar reluctance in their own hearts, celebrating instead the gracious character of the Lord who &#8220;is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jonah/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">So Jonah went out.</span>--The explanation given in the preceding note avoids the necessity of giving the verb in this clause a pluperfect force, which else would be necessary to account for the prophet's continued expectation of the destruction of Nineveh after his irritation at the Divine clemency towards it.<p><span class= "bld">Booth</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> of boughs, like those used at the Feast of Tabernacles.
