Throughout the Bible, when God speaks, it often signifies a moment of teaching or correction. In the context of Jonah, God is addressing Jonah's anger and frustration, providing a divine perspective on the situation.<p><b>You cared about the plant</b><br>Jonah's concern for the plant reveals his misplaced priorities. The plant, which provided temporary comfort, became a source of emotional investment for Jonah. This reflects a broader biblical theme where humans often value material or temporary things over eternal truths. It serves as a lesson on the importance of aligning one's values with God's.<p><b>which you neither tended nor made grow</b><br>This highlights Jonah's lack of involvement in the creation or maintenance of the plant, emphasizing God's sovereignty and creative power. It serves as a reminder of human limitations and the divine origin of all creation. This can be connected to other scriptures that speak of God's role as the Creator, such as <a href="/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a> and <a href="/psalms/104.htm">Psalm 104</a>.<p><b>It sprang up in a night and perished in a night</b><br>The rapid growth and demise of the plant symbolize the transient nature of earthly comforts and possessions. This can be seen as a metaphor for the fleeting nature of life and human endeavors, echoing themes found in Ecclesiastes. It also serves as a contrast to God's eternal nature and His enduring compassion for humanity, as seen in His concern for Nineveh.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonah.htm">Jonah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who was sent to Nineveh to proclaim God's message of repentance.

It echoes the elder brother&#8217;s misplaced priorities in <a href="/luke/15-28.htm">Luke 15:28-30</a> and the grumbling workers in <a href="/matthew/20-11.htm">Matthew 20:11-12</a>.<p>- The Lord exposes how easily our affections attach to what benefits us (<a href="/philippians/2-21.htm">Philippians 2:21</a>), whereas He calls us to love what He loves&#8212;souls (<a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>).<p>- Jonah&#8217;s concern for a plant contrasts sharply with his anger over Nineveh&#8217;s deliverance, highlighting the inconsistency that Jesus later confronts in <a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which you neither tended nor made grow</b><p>- God reminds Jonah that he invested nothing&#8212;no labor, no nurturing&#8212;in the plant&#8217;s existence. Similarly, Paul notes, &#8220;Neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-7.htm">1 Corinthians 3:7</a>).<p>- The statement underscores divine sovereignty; every good gift is &#8220;from above&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p>- It challenges the pride that claims ownership of blessings we merely receive (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-17.htm">Deuteronomy 8:17-18</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-7.htm">1 Corinthians 4:7</a>).<p>- By contrasting Jonah&#8217;s zero effort with God&#8217;s total provision, the Lord shows that compassion should flow from gratitude, not entitlement.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It sprang up in a night and perished in a night</b><p>- The plant&#8217;s 24-hour life span illustrates the fleeting nature of earthly things (<a href="/psalms/103-15.htm">Psalm 103:15-16</a>; <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a>).<p>- God deliberately used something temporary to make Jonah feel loss, then connected that feeling to the eternal stakes of human souls (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p>- The momentary plant mirrors Jesus&#8217; image of grass &#8220;here today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-30.htm">Matthew 6:30</a>), yet even that short-lived grass receives God&#8217;s care.<p>- If God attends to ephemeral flora, how much more does He value the 120,000 people of Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>) and, by extension, every person today (<a href="/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>God&#8217;s gentle but firm words expose Jonah&#8217;s misplaced compassion. Jonah wept over a plant he didn&#8217;t create, control, or sustain&#8212;a plant that lasted mere hours&#8212;yet he scorned a city full of eternal souls. The Lord&#8217;s lesson is unmistakable: because He is the sovereign Creator and Sustainer, His heart beats for people far more than for our comforts. By realigning Jonah&#8217;s perspective, God invites us to share His greater compassion, valuing what He values and letting temporary things point us to eternal priorities.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jonah/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Which came up.</span>--The original is one of those forcible idioms impossible to reproduce, <span class= "ital">which son of a night was, and son of a night perished.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord.</span> Jehovah. closing the story, and driving home the lesson with unanswerable force, the prophet himself being the judge. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast had pity;</span> <span class="accented">thou on thy part hast spared</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">For the which thou hast not laboured;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, "for which thou sufferedst no evil."
