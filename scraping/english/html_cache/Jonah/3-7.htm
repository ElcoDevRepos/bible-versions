Nineveh was the capital of the Assyrian Empire, known for its power and cruelty. The king's response indicates a significant shift from the city's previous behavior. This act of issuing a proclamation shows the seriousness with which the message was received, highlighting the power of God's word to bring about repentance.<p><b>By the decree of the king and his nobles:</b><br>The involvement of both the king and his nobles suggests a unified leadership response. In ancient Near Eastern cultures, decrees from the king were binding and carried significant weight. The inclusion of the nobles indicates that this was a collective decision, emphasizing the gravity of the situation and the widespread acknowledgment of the need for repentance.<p><b>Let no man or beast, herd or flock, taste anything at all:</b><br>The call for a fast extended beyond humans to include animals, which is unusual in biblical accounts. This comprehensive fast underscores the depth of repentance and the desire for divine mercy. It reflects the belief that the entire community, including livestock, was under judgment and needed to participate in the act of contrition. This mirrors the seriousness of the situation and the totality of the city's repentance.<p><b>They must not eat or drink:</b><br>The prohibition of both food and water signifies an extreme form of fasting, indicating the urgency and desperation of the Ninevites' plea for forgiveness. Fasting in the Bible is often associated with mourning, repentance, and seeking God's favor. This aligns with other instances in Scripture where fasting is used as a means to humble oneself before God, such as in the cases of Esther (<a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a>) and the Day of Atonement (<a href="/leviticus/16-29.htm">Leviticus 16:29-31</a>).

Just as Josiah gathered all Judah to read the Law aloud (<a href="/2_kings/23-1.htm">2 Kings 23:1&#8211;3</a>), the Ninevite ruler broadcasts the call for change.<p>&#8226; A proclamation implies urgency and authority. We see a similar sense of haste in <a href="/ezra/8-21.htm">Ezra 8:21</a>, where a fast is proclaimed &#8220;so that we might humble ourselves before our God.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The setting&#8212;&#8220;in Nineveh&#8221;&#8212;reminds us that God&#8217;s reach extends beyond Israel (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>). Jonah&#8217;s earlier reluctance (<a href="/jonah/1-3.htm">Jonah 1:3</a>) contrasts sharply with this rapid citywide response.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>By the decree of the king and his nobles</b><p>&#8226; Leadership unites: the king does not act alone but with &#8220;his nobles,&#8221; echoing <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, &#8220;with many counselors there is deliverance.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Civil authority acknowledges divine authority. <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a> tells us that &#8220;there is no authority except from God,&#8221; and here that truth shows as pagan leaders bow to the Lord&#8217;s warning.<p>&#8226; The decree&#8217;s formality underscores accountability. In <a href="/daniel/6-8.htm">Daniel 6:8</a>, a royal edict cannot be revoked; likewise, the Ninevite decree presses the population toward decisive action.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let no man or beast, herd or flock, taste anything at all</b><p>&#8226; The fast is comprehensive. Humans and animals alike participate, highlighting creation&#8217;s shared dependence on God (<a href="/psalms/104-27.htm">Psalm 104:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Including livestock heightens visibility; even the bleating of hungry animals becomes a citywide lament (<a href="/joel/1-18.htm">Joel 1:18</a>).<p>&#8226; This sweeping command recalls the entire community&#8217;s participation in the Passover regulations (<a href="/exodus/12-19.htm">Exodus 12:19</a>), where no home was exempt from obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They must not eat or drink</b><p>&#8226; A total fast&#8212;no food, no water&#8212;mirrors <a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a> and Paul&#8217;s immediate response to Christ&#8217;s appearance (<a href="/acts/9-9.htm">Acts 9:9</a>). Such absolute abstention conveys deep contrition.<p>&#8226; The wording &#8220;must not&#8221; shows that repentance is non-negotiable. Like David pleading for his child (<a href="/2_samuel/12-16.htm">2 Samuel 12:16</a>), the Ninevites throw themselves wholly on God&#8217;s mercy.<p>&#8226; By denying basic sustenance, they admit their utter dependence on the Creator (<a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>). This posture paves the way for the compassion God will show in <a href="/jonah/3-10.htm">Jonah 3:10</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jonah/3-7.htm">Jonah 3:7</a> records a sweeping, public, and uncompromising call to repentance. The ruler of Nineveh, backed by his nobles, issues a binding decree that every person and even every animal must participate in a total fast. The measure&#8217;s breadth reveals the city&#8217;s earnest response to God&#8217;s warning, its leaders&#8217; recognition of divine sovereignty, and the community&#8217;s willingness to humble itself completely&#8212;laying the groundwork for the mercy that follows.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jonah/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">And he caused</span> . . .--The fact that the word rendered "decree" in this verse was a technical name for the edicts of Assyrian and Babylonian kings (see <a href="/daniel/3-10.htm" title="You, O king, have made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image:">Daniel 3:10</a>; <a href="/daniel/3-29.htm" title="Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.">Daniel 3:29</a>) would alone vouch for the accurate acquaintance of the author with the customs he describes. But the very form of the royal edict is here preserved. The verse should probably run: <span class= "ital">And he caused to be proclaimed, and be published in Nineveh </span>"<span class= "ital">According to the decree of the king and his magnates be it proclaimed that,</span>" &c. The word "saying" is apparently formal like our "thus saith," &c.<p><span class= "bld">And his nobles.</span>--For this association of the great men with the autocrat, comp. <a href="/daniel/6-17.htm" title="And a stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.">Daniel 6:17</a>. Traces of the custom can also be discovered in Assyrian inscriptions, <span class= "ital">e.g</span>., "I am Assurbanipal king of nations, king of Assyria, Nabu-damiq and Umbadara the great men," &c. (G. Smith, <span class= "ital">Assyrian Discoveries,</span> p. 413). Ewald thinks the formal "saying" in the edict marks the omission of the names, which in the original would be given.<p><span class= "bld">Beast.</span>--The Hebrew word is general, and might include all the domestic animals, but from the addition of "herd nor flock" we must doubtless here confine it to the <span class= "ital">horses</span> and <span class= "ital">mules,</span> &c., which even, according to our ideas, might have their usual gay housings changed to those suited to a time of mourning. "Men think it strange that the horses at Nineveh were covered with sackcloth, and forget how, at the funerals of the rich, black horses are chosen, and are clothed with black velvet" (Pusey). Herodotus (9:24) and Plutarch (Alexander), have both preserved instances in which horses and mules were associated with human beings in the signs of public mourning. The instinct which underlies the custom is a true one. Not only are the destinies of the animals which minister to man's wants often identical with his own; but there is a <span class= "ital">bond of</span> sympathy between them naturally; and one remarkable feature of this book is the prominence given to this truth. (See <a href="/jonah/4-11.htm" title="And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more then six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?">Jonah 4:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Let them not feed. . . .</span>--Poetically, the beasts are said by Virgil to fast at the death of Daphnis (<span class= "ital">Eclog.,</span> v. 24-28), and in <a href="/joel/1-20.htm" title="The beasts of the field cry also to you: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.">Joel 1:20</a> their mute appeal against suffering is represented as audible to God. In the horror of the impending ruin of Nineveh, superstition exaggerated the true feeling underlying such representations, and to the belief in the sympathy of the lower animals with man was added the hope that their sufferings would help to appease the wrath of God. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He caused it,</span> etc.; literally, <span class="accented">he caused proclamation to be made, and said, i.e.</span> by the heralds. <span class="cmt_word">The decree.</span> The word used here (<span class="accented">taam</span>) is an Accadian term, which had become naturalized in Assyria, Persia, and Babylonia, and was applied to a mandate issued with royal authority.

These great cities contained in their area immense open spaces, like our parks, where cattle were kept. The dumb animals were made to share in their masters' fast and sorrow, as they shared their joy and feasting; their bleating and bellowing were so many appeals to Heaven for mercy; the punishment of these innocent creatures was a kind of atonement for the guilt of their lords (comp. <a href="/hosea/4-3.htm">Hosea 4:3</a>; <a href="/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>; and note how the brute creation is said to sham in the happiness of paradise regained, <a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11</a>.). The commentators quote Virgil, 'Ecl.,' 5:24, etc., where, however, the point is that the grief of the shepherds hinders them from attending to the wants of their flocks. Herodotus (9:24) mentions an instance of the Persians cutting the manes and tails of their horses and mules in a case of general mourning (comp. Eurip., 'Alcest.,' 428, etc.; Plut., 'Alex.,' 72). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/jonah/3-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then he issued a proclamation</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1463;&#1494;&#1456;&#1506;&#1461;&#1431;&#1511;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yaz&#183;&#8216;&#234;q)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
