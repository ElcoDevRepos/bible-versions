This reaction highlights Jonah's struggle with God's mercy towards a nation he viewed as an enemy. Historically, Nineveh was the capital of Assyria, a powerful empire known for its brutality and oppression of Israel. Jonah's displeasure can be seen as a reflection of the deep-seated animosity between Israel and Assyria. This phrase also underscores the theme of God's compassion versus human prejudice, a recurring theme in the Bible, as seen in the parable of the Prodigal Son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>), where the elder brother is displeased with the father's mercy.<p><b>and he became angry</b><br>Jonah's anger reveals his internal conflict and resistance to God's will. Anger in the Bible often signifies a deeper spiritual issue, such as pride or lack of understanding of God's purposes. Jonah's anger can be compared to the anger of Cain in <a href="/genesis/4-5.htm">Genesis 4:5-6</a>, where God questions Cain's anger and encourages him to do what is right. This anger also foreshadows the anger of the Pharisees in the New Testament, who were displeased with Jesus' outreach to sinners and Gentiles (<a href="/luke/15.htm">Luke 15:1-2</a>). Jonah's reaction serves as a reminder of the human tendency to resist God's grace when it challenges personal biases or expectations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonah.htm">Jonah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who was initially reluctant to deliver God's message to Nineveh.

God&#8217;s grace toward Nineveh collides with Jonah&#8217;s narrow expectations, producing deep displeasure and anger. The verse warns that unchecked anger&#8212;even in those who know God&#8212;can oppose His compassionate purposes, urging every believer to align heart and attitude with the gracious character of the Lord who &#8220;desires mercy, not sacrifice&#8221; (<a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/9-13.htm">Matthew 9:13</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jonah/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>IV.<p>JONAH'S DISCONTENT AND CORRECTION.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">But it displeased Jonah.</span>--The Hebrew (<span class= "ital">it was evil to</span>) is stronger.

Selfish jealousy for his own reputation, jealousy for the honour of the prophetic office, a mistaken patriotism disappointed that the great enemy of his country should go unpunished, Jewish exclusiveness which could not endure to see the Divine clemency extended to the heathen, have each been adduced as the motive of Jonah's anger.

The reference is to what is said in the last verse of the preceding chapter, viz. that the predicted destruction was not inflicted. How the knowledge of this reprieve was conveyed to the prophet we am not informed. It probably was made known to him before the expiration of the forty days by Divine communication, in accordance with the saying in <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>, "Surely the Lord will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets" (see ver. 5).
