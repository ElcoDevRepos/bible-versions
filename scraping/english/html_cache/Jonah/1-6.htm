His approach to Jonah highlights the desperation of the crew amidst the storm. In ancient maritime culture, captains were responsible for the safety of the ship and its crew, making his intervention significant. This moment underscores the severity of the storm, as even the captain is seeking divine intervention.<p><b>How can you sleep?</b><br>Jonah's sleep during the storm is symbolic of his spiritual apathy and disobedience. In biblical literature, sleep can represent ignorance or avoidance of responsibility. Jonah's indifference contrasts with the sailors' frantic efforts to save the ship, highlighting his reluctance to fulfill God's command. This echoes the spiritual slumber of those who turn away from God's call.<p><b>Get up and call upon your God.</b><br>The captain's command to Jonah to pray reflects the polytheistic beliefs of the sailors, who were likely calling upon their own gods. This plea for divine intervention shows their desperation and belief in the power of prayer. It also serves as a reminder of Jonah's prophetic role and his duty to intercede with God, despite his current rebellion.<p><b>Perhaps this God will consider us,</b><br>The use of "perhaps" indicates uncertainty and hope. The sailors, unfamiliar with the God of Israel, express a tentative faith that Jonah's God might have the power to save them. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern practice of seeking favor from multiple deities in times of crisis, hoping one would respond.<p><b>so that we may not perish.</b><br>The fear of perishing at sea was a common concern in ancient times, as maritime travel was perilous. The sailors' plea for survival highlights the life-and-death stakes of the situation. This phrase also foreshadows the broader theme of salvation in the book of Jonah, where God's mercy extends beyond Israel to the Gentiles, prefiguring the universal offer of salvation through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonah.htm">Jonah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who is fleeing from God's command to go to Nineveh.
