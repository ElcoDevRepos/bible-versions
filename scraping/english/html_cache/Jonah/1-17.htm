The term "appointed" indicates divine intervention, suggesting that the great fish was specifically prepared by God for this purpose. The identity of the "great fish" has been debated, with some suggesting a whale or a large sea creature. The focus, however, is on God's miraculous provision rather than the species of the creature. This event demonstrates God's ability to use nature to fulfill His purposes, similar to how He used the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 7-11) or the parting of the Red Sea (Exodus 14). The swallowing of Jonah can also be seen as a form of divine discipline and protection, preventing him from drowning and giving him time to repent.<p><b>and Jonah spent three days and three nights in the belly of the fish</b><br>The duration of "three days and three nights" is significant and symbolic in biblical literature. It often represents a period of trial, testing, or transition. This time frame is echoed in the New Testament, where Jesus refers to Jonah's experience as a foreshadowing of His own death and resurrection (<a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>). The phrase emphasizes the completeness of the period Jonah spent in the fish, underscoring the miraculous nature of his survival. In ancient Near Eastern culture, the number three often signifies completeness or perfection, which may indicate the thoroughness of Jonah's transformation during this time. This period in the fish's belly serves as a turning point for Jonah, leading to his eventual obedience to God's command.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The sovereign God who orchestrates events and appoints the great fish to swallow Jonah.

The LORD does not improvise; He &#8220;appointed&#8221; (or prepared) the fish, underscoring His sovereignty over creation (see <a href="/psalms/135-6.htm">Psalm 135:6</a>; <a href="/matthew/10-29.htm">Matthew 10:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Nothing in Jonah&#8217;s flight surprises God. The same God who &#8220;determines the number of the stars&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/147-4.htm">Psalm 147:4</a>) also orchestrates events for His prophet&#8217;s correction.<p>&#8226; This appointment reveals mercy as much as discipline. God&#8217;s providence seeks to reclaim Jonah rather than destroy him (<a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a great fish</b><p>&#8226; Scripture treats the creature as literal. Just as God &#8220;created the great sea creatures&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a>), He now uses one for His purpose.<p>&#8226; The fish&#8217;s magnitude matches the magnitude of Jonah&#8217;s calling; God often employs extraordinary means to get our attention (<a href="/psalms/148-7.htm">Psalm 148:7</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus affirms the historicity of this event, calling it a &#8220;sign&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>). If Christ endorses it, believers can rest in its accuracy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to swallow Jonah</b><p>&#8226; Swallowing sounds like judgment, yet it is preservation. Left in the stormy sea, Jonah would have drowned. In God&#8217;s hands even an unexpected vessel becomes a shelter (<a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Discipline and deliverance arrive in one moment: Jonah is both contained and kept (<a href="/job/5-18.htm">Job 5:18</a>).<p>&#8226; God directs the fish, not vice-versa. Once its mission is finished, it will release Jonah (<a href="/jonah/2-10.htm">Jonah 2:10</a>), demonstrating the Creator&#8217;s absolute control.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and Jonah spent three days and three nights</b><p>&#8226; The precise timeframe matters. Jesus links it to His own burial and resurrection: &#8220;For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>).<p>&#8226; Three days mark a complete, but limited, duration&#8212;long enough for reflection, short enough to retain hope (<a href="/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>).<p>&#8226; God uses time to shape the heart. Jonah&#8217;s prayer in chapter 2 shows repentance formed in those hours of confinement.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the belly of the fish</b><p>&#8226; The belly becomes an unexpected sanctuary. There, &#8220;Jonah prayed to the LORD his God&#8221; (<a href="/jonah/2-1.htm">Jonah 2:1</a>), proving that no place is beyond God&#8217;s reach (<a href="/psalms/139-8.htm">Psalm 139:8</a>).<p>&#8226; Isolation strips away distractions. Surrounded by darkness and water, Jonah finally listens. Similar imagery appears when David speaks of &#8220;the depths of Sheol&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-5.htm">Psalm 18:5-6</a>).<p>&#8226; The fish&#8217;s interior mirrors a grave, foreshadowing Christ&#8217;s tomb, yet both end with deliverance (<a href="/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a> shows God&#8217;s sovereign, merciful intervention. He literally prepares a great fish to rescue and correct His runaway prophet, keeping Jonah alive for three days and nights&#8212;a period that anticipates Jesus&#8217; own burial and resurrection. The verse teaches that the LORD commands nature, employs extraordinary means to reclaim His servants, and turns places of apparent defeat into platforms for redemption.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/jonah/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Now the Lord.</span>--In the Hebrew, Jonah 2 commences with this verse.<p><span class= "bld">Had prepared.--</span>The pluperfect is misleading.

(For the last hypothesis see all that can be collected in Dr. Pusey's commentary on Jonah.) In early Christian paintings the monster appears as a huge dragon.<p><span class= "bld">Three days and</span> <span class= "ital"><span class= "bld">three</span></span> <span class= "bld">nights.</span>--See <a href="/matthew/12-40.htm" title="For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.">Matthew 12:40</a>, <span class= "ital">New Testament Commentary.</span> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - &sect; 4. <span class="accented">Cast into the sea, Jonah is swallowed alive by a great fish, is whose belly he remains unharmed three days and three nights. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Had prepared;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b5;</span>, "appointed;" so in <a href="/jonah/4-6.htm">Jonah 4:6, 7, 8</a> (comp. <a href="/job/7-3.htm">Job 7:3</a>; <a href="/daniel/1-10.htm">Daniel 1:10, 11</a>). The fish was not created then and there, but God so ordered it that it should be at the place and should swallow Jonah. The prophet seems, from some expressions in his psalm (<a href="/jonah/2-5.htm">Jonah 2:5</a>), to have sunk to the bottom of the sea before he was swallowed by the fish. <span class="cmt_word">A great fish;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>). There is nothing in the word to identify the intended animal, and to call it "a whale" is simply a mistranslation. The white shark of the Mediterranean (<span class="accented">Carcharias, vulgaris</span>), which sometimes measures twenty-five feet in length, has been known to swallow a man whole, and even a horse. This may have been the "great fish" in the text (see Dr. Pusey on Jonah, pp. 257, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Was in the belly of the fish.</span> God used the natural agency of the fish, but the preservation of Jonah's life in the animal's belly is plainly supernatural. It is, indeed, analogous to the life of the child in its mother's womb; but it has besides a miraculous element which is unique, unless it was an actual death and revivification, as in the case of Lazarus. Also God ordained this transaction as a type of the resurrection of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Three days and three nights;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to Hebrew usage, parts of the days and nights; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> one whole day, and parts of the day before and after this. Jonah was released on the third day (comp. <a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a> with <a href="/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>; and <a href="/esther/4-16.htm">Esther 4:16</a> with Esther 5:1). The historical nature of this occurrence is substantiated by Christ's reference to it as a figure of his own burial and resurrection. The antitype confirms the truth of the type.
