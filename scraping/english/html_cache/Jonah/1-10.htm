In ancient Near Eastern culture, fear of the divine was common, especially when encountering a deity's wrath. The sailors, likely polytheists, recognize the power of Jonah's God, who controls the sea and the storm. This fear echoes the reverence and awe seen in other biblical accounts, such as the disciples' fear during the storm in <a href="/mark/4-41.htm">Mark 4:41</a>.<p><b>and said to him, &#8220;What have you done?&#8221;</b><br>This question reflects both confusion and accusation. The sailors are bewildered by Jonah's decision to flee from such a powerful God. The phrase is reminiscent of God's question to Adam in <a href="/genesis/3-13.htm">Genesis 3:13</a>, highlighting human disobedience and its consequences. It underscores the seriousness of Jonah's rebellion and the impact of sin on others.<p><b>The men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the LORD,</b><br>Jonah's attempt to escape God's presence is futile, as God is omnipresent (<a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-10</a>). The phrase "fleeing from the presence of the LORD" indicates a deliberate act of disobedience. This mirrors the broader biblical theme of humanity's tendency to run from God, seen in figures like Cain and the prodigal son. It also foreshadows the redemptive pursuit of God, who seeks to restore the disobedient.<p><b>because he had told them.</b><br>Jonah's admission to the sailors reveals his awareness of his sin. This confession is crucial, as it sets the stage for his eventual repentance and the sailors' conversion. It highlights the importance of acknowledging one's wrongdoing, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture, such as in the confessions of David (Psalm 51) and the apostle Paul (<a href="/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a>). Jonah's honesty, despite his initial rebellion, becomes a catalyst for divine intervention and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonah.htm">Jonah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who is fleeing from God's command to go to Nineveh and preach against its wickedness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sailors.htm">The Sailors</a></b><br>Pagan mariners who are caught in a violent storm caused by Jonah's disobedience.
