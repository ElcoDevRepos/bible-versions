This change highlights the transformative power of God's discipline and mercy. Nineveh, the capital of the Assyrian Empire, was a significant city known for its size and influence. Jonah's journey to Nineveh signifies a mission to a Gentile nation, foreshadowing the New Testament's call to spread the Gospel to all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<p><b>in accordance with the word of the LORD</b><br>Jonah's actions align with God's command, emphasizing the importance of obedience to divine instruction. This phrase underscores the authority of God's word, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture (<a href="/psalms/119-105.htm">Psalm 119:105</a>). It also reflects the prophetic role of Jonah, who, like other prophets, was tasked with delivering God's message to people (<a href="/jeremiah/1-7.htm">Jeremiah 1:7</a>).<p><b>Now Nineveh was an exceedingly great city</b><br>Nineveh's description as "exceedingly great" refers to its vast size and importance. Archaeological findings confirm its grandeur, with extensive walls and impressive structures. The city's greatness also symbolizes the significant impact of Jonah's message, as it was a center of power and culture. This phrase sets the stage for the miraculous repentance of its inhabitants, demonstrating God's concern for all people, not just Israel (<a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<p><b>requiring a three-day journey</b><br>The mention of a "three-day journey" likely refers to the time needed to traverse the city, indicating its vastness. This detail highlights the scale of Jonah's task and the comprehensive nature of his mission. The number three often signifies completeness in the Bible, seen in events like Jesus' resurrection on the third day (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>), suggesting the completeness of God's plan for Nineveh's repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonah.htm">Jonah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who initially fled from God's command to go to Nineveh but later obeyed after being swallowed and released by a great fish.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/n/nineveh.htm">Nineveh</a></b><br>The capital city of Assyria, known for its size and wickedness.

In the Hebrew poetic and prophetic writings a finer form is found, <span class= "ital">e.g</span>., "mountains of God," "cedars of God" (<a href="/psalms/36-6.htm" title="Your righteousness is like the great mountains; your judgments are a great deep: O LORD, you preserve man and beast.">Psalm 36:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/80-10.htm" title="The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.">Psalm 80:10</a>), "trees of Jehovah" (<a href="/psalms/104-16.htm" title="The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he has planted;">Psalm 104:16</a>), but in <a href="/genesis/10-9.htm" title="He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: why it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.">Genesis 10:9</a> a precisely similar proverbial use shows itself, also belonging to the Mesopotamian region, "Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the Lord."<p><span class= "bld">Of three days' journey.</span>--Hitzig takes this as giving the diameter of the city, but most commentators refer it to the circumference. The circuit of the walls was the most obvious measurement to give of an ancient city. Herodotus variously reckons a day's journey at about eighteen or twenty-three miles (v. 53, iv. 101), and the circuit of the irregular quadrangle composed of the mounds of Koujunjik, Nimrud, Karamless, and Khorsabad, now generally allowed to represent ancient Nineveh, is about sixty miles. This agrees sufficiently with the obviously vague and general statement of the text.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Arose, and went.</span> He was now as prompt to obey as formerly to flee. <span class="cmt_word">Was</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> when Jonah visited it.

So Nimrod is called (<a href="/genesis/10-9.htm">Genesis 10:9</a>) "a mighty hunter before the Lord;" and Moses, in <a href="/acts/7-20.htm">Acts 7:20</a>, is said to have been" beautiful to God." The expression may also mean that God (<span class="accented">Elohim</span>, God as Governor of the world) regarded this city with interest, as intended in the Divine counsels to perform an important part.
