In the Hebrew Bible, "the word of the LORD" is a common expression indicating a direct communication from God, often associated with prophetic messages (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/1-4.htm">Jeremiah 1:4</a>, <a href="/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>). It underscores the authority and authenticity of the message, as it is not from human origin but from God Himself. This divine communication is central to the role of a prophet, who serves as a mouthpiece for God's will.<p><b>came to Jonah</b><br>Jonah, the son of Amittai, is a prophet from Gath-hepher in the northern kingdom of Israel (<a href="/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>). His story is unique among the prophetic books because it focuses more on the prophet's narrative than on the prophetic message itself. Jonah's initial reluctance and subsequent obedience highlight themes of repentance and God's mercy. The fact that the word comes to Jonah again indicates God's persistence and grace, offering Jonah another opportunity to fulfill his mission.<p><b>a second time</b><br>This phrase highlights God's patience and willingness to give second chances. Jonah had previously fled from God's command to go to Nineveh (<a href="/jonah/1.htm">Jonah 1:1-3</a>), resulting in his dramatic encounter with the great fish. The "second time" signifies a fresh start and God's enduring commitment to His purposes, despite human failure. It reflects the broader biblical theme of redemption and restoration, as seen in the lives of other biblical figures who received second chances, such as Peter after his denial of Christ (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-19</a>). This also prefigures the New Testament message of grace and forgiveness through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonah.htm">Jonah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who initially fled from God's command to go to Nineveh.
