Initially, they were polytheistic, each crying out to their own gods (<a href="/jonah/1-5.htm">Jonah 1:5</a>). Their fear here is not just terror but a reverential awe, recognizing the power and sovereignty of the God of Israel. This fear is consistent with the biblical theme that the fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>). The transformation from fearing the storm to fearing the LORD indicates a shift from natural fear to spiritual reverence, a common theme in Scripture where encounters with God's power lead to worship (<a href="/exodus/14-31.htm">Exodus 14:31</a>).<p><b>and they offered a sacrifice to the LORD</b><br>Offering sacrifices was a common practice in ancient Near Eastern religions as a means of appeasing deities. However, the sailors' sacrifice to the LORD signifies their acknowledgment of His supremacy over their own gods. This act of worship aligns with the Old Testament practice of offering sacrifices as a means of atonement and thanksgiving (Leviticus 1-7). It also prefigures the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who offered Himself once for all (<a href="/hebrews/10-10.htm">Hebrews 10:10</a>). The sailors' actions foreshadow the inclusion of Gentiles in the worship of the true God, a theme that is fully realized in the New Testament (Acts 10).<p><b>and made vows to Him</b><br>Making vows was a serious commitment in the ancient world, often accompanying sacrifices as a pledge of future devotion or obedience (<a href="/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a>). The sailors' vows indicate a genuine conversion experience, as they commit themselves to the LORD beyond the immediate crisis. This mirrors the biblical pattern where deliverance leads to a covenant relationship with God (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). Their vows also reflect the biblical principle that true faith results in a change of heart and behavior (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>). This moment anticipates the New Testament call for believers to present their bodies as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God (<a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_men.htm">The Men (Sailors)</a></b><br>These are the sailors on the ship with Jonah.

Moments earlier the sea raged; now it is perfectly still because the crew obeyed God&#8217;s directive and cast Jonah overboard (<a href="/jonah/1-15.htm">Jonah 1:15</a>). Much like the disciples in <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39&#8211;41</a> who watched Jesus calm a storm and suddenly realized His power, these sailors have just witnessed the LORD&#8217;s direct intervention. When God moves unmistakably, the next events in the narrative always flow from that revelation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The men feared the LORD greatly</b><p>&#8220;Feared&#8221; here is reverent awe, not terror alone.<p>&#8226; The same response appears when Israel sees God&#8217;s deliverance at the Red Sea: &#8220;When Israel saw the great power that the LORD had exercised&#8230; they feared the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/14-31.htm">Exodus 14:31</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/1-7.htm">Proverbs 1:7</a> calls this fear &#8220;the beginning of knowledge,&#8221; showing it is the proper foundation for any relationship with God.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/107-23.htm">Psalm 107:23&#8211;32</a> describes sailors rescued from a storm who &#8220;cry out to the LORD&#8221; and then &#8220;exalt Him,&#8221; echoing Jonah&#8217;s scene.<p>A healthy, worshipful fear replaces their earlier panic. Idols could not still the gale, but the LORD did, proving Himself alone worthy of awe.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They offered a sacrifice to the LORD</b><p>Sacrifice immediately follows genuine fear of God.<p>&#8226; Noah built an altar after the flood subsided (<a href="/genesis/8-20.htm">Genesis 8:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Samuel offered a lamb when Israel repented (<a href="/1_samuel/7-9.htm">1 Samuel 7:9</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/116-17.htm">Psalm 116:17</a> vows, &#8220;I will offer to You a sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the LORD.&#8221;<p>These pagan sailors have now turned from their gods to the true God.

The Chaldee renders accordingly, "They said that they would offer sacrifices." But the text implies that they sacrificed immediately on the cessation of the storm. They may naturally have had some animal on board fit for offering. <span class="cmt_word">And made vows.</span> Vowed to make other offerings when it was in their power.
