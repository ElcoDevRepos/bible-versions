In biblical context, storms often symbolize divine intervention or judgment (e.g., <a href="/psalms/107-25.htm">Psalm 107:25-29</a>). The escalating storm serves as a physical manifestation of God's displeasure and a call for repentance. The worsening conditions also emphasize the urgency and seriousness of the situation, compelling the sailors to seek a solution.<p><b>so they said to Jonah</b><br>The sailors, recognizing Jonah as the cause of their predicament, turn to him for guidance. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern belief in the interconnectedness of human actions and divine responses. Jonah's presence on the ship and his earlier admission of fleeing from God (<a href="/jonah/1-9.htm">Jonah 1:9-10</a>) make him the focal point of the sailors' inquiry. This moment underscores the theme of accountability and the impact of individual actions on the community.<p><b>&#8220;What must we do to you to calm this sea for us?&#8221;</b><br>The sailors' question indicates their desperation and willingness to take drastic measures to appease the divine wrath. It also reflects a common ancient practice of seeking to appease deities through specific actions or sacrifices. This inquiry parallels other biblical instances where individuals seek divine guidance to avert disaster (e.g., <a href="/2_samuel/21.htm">2 Samuel 21:1-14</a>). The question foreshadows Jonah's eventual suggestion to be thrown overboard, which prefigures the concept of substitutionary atonement, a type of Christ's sacrificial death to bring peace between God and humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonah.htm">Jonah</a></b><br>A prophet of God who is fleeing from God's command to go to Nineveh.
