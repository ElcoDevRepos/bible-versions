Tarshish is often identified with a distant location, possibly in Spain, representing the farthest known point in the ancient world. This choice underscores Jonah's intent to escape as far as possible from his divine mission. His actions contrast with the typical prophetic response of obedience, highlighting his reluctance and fear.<p><b>away from the presence of the LORD</b><br>The phrase "away from the presence of the LORD" indicates Jonah's attempt to escape God's omnipresence, which is a theological impossibility. This reflects a misunderstanding or denial of God's nature, as seen in <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-10</a>, which affirms that one cannot flee from God's presence. Jonah's actions symbolize a spiritual rebellion and a desire to avoid accountability.<p><b>He went down to Joppa</b><br>Joppa, a port city on the Mediterranean Sea, serves as a geographical point of departure for Jonah's flight. Historically, Joppa was a significant maritime hub, facilitating trade and travel. Jonah's descent to Joppa is both literal and metaphorical, indicating a downward spiritual trajectory away from God's will.<p><b>and found a ship bound for Tarshish</b><br>The availability of a ship bound for Tarshish suggests the regularity of trade routes and maritime commerce in the ancient world. This detail emphasizes Jonah's determination to pursue his own path, as he actively seeks out a means to escape. The ship represents Jonah's chosen vehicle of disobedience, contrasting with the divine mission he was given.<p><b>So he paid the fare and went aboard</b><br>Jonah's payment of the fare signifies his commitment to his decision, investing in his rebellion. This act of purchasing passage can be seen as a metaphor for the cost of disobedience, both financially and spiritually. Jonah's willingness to pay reflects his resolve to distance himself from God's command.<p><b>to sail for Tarshish, away from the presence of the LORD</b><br>The repetition of Jonah's intent to flee "away from the presence of the LORD" reinforces the futility of his actions. It highlights the central theme of the narrative: human attempts to evade divine will are ultimately in vain. This phrase bookends the verse, emphasizing Jonah's persistent, albeit misguided, effort to escape God's call.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jonah.htm">Jonah</a></b><br>A prophet of God, called to deliver a message to Nineveh, but chooses to flee instead.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tarshish.htm">Tarshish</a></b><br>A distant location, often associated with the farthest reaches of the known world, symbolizing Jonah's attempt to escape God's call.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/joppa.htm">Joppa</a></b><br>A port city where Jonah finds a ship to Tarshish, representing a point of decision and departure from God's directive.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ship.htm">The Ship</a></b><br>Represents Jonah's chosen means of escape, highlighting his determination to avoid God's command.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_presence_of_the_lord.htm">The Presence of the LORD</a></b><br>Indicates God's omnipresence and the futility of trying to escape His will.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_running_from_god.htm">The Futility of Running from God</a></b><br>Jonah's attempt to flee illustrates the impossibility of escaping God's presence and plan.

A man who tries to escape from a clearly-recognised duty--especially if he can at the time supply conscience with a plausible excuse--is in danger of falling all the lower, in proportion as his position was high. Jonah, commanded to <span class= "ital">go</span> to Nineveh, in the far north-east, instantly tries to flee to the then farthermost west. Often between the saintly height and an abyss of sin there is no middle resting-point. The man with the highest ideal, when unfaithful to it, is apt to sink lower than the ordinary mortal.<p><span class= "bld">From the presence of the Lord.--</span>Rather, <span class= "ital">from before the face of Jehovah.</span> The words may imply (1) the belief in a possibility of hiding from the sight of God (as in <a href="/genesis/3-8.htm" title="And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.">Genesis 3:8</a>), a belief which, as we gather from the insistence on its opposite in Psalms 139, lingered late in the popular conception; (2) a renunciation of the prophetic office. (Comp. <a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm" title="At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="/1_kings/17-1.htm" title="And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said to Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel lives, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.">1Kings 17:1</a>); (3) Flight from the Holy Land, where the Divine presence was understood to be especially manifested. Commentators have generally rejected the first of these as implying ignorance unworthy of a prophet; but, on embarking, Jonah went below, as if still more securely to hide, and used the same expression to the mariners, who would certainly take it in its literal and popular sense. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tarshish</span>; probably, <span class="accented">Tartessus</span>, a Phoenician city on the south coast of Spain, and therefore in the opposite direction to Nineveh. He was sent to the far east; he flees to the distant west. <span class="cmt_word">From the presence of the Lord;</span> literally, <span class="accented">from the face of Jehovah.</span> This may mean, from God s special presence in Jerusalem or the Holy Land, as banishment from Cannaan is called "casting out of his sight" (<a href="/2_kings/17-20.htm">2 Kings 17:20, 23</a>; <a href="/2_kings/23-27.htm">2 Kings 23:27</a>); or, from serving the Lord as his minister (<a href="/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>), Jonah preferring to renounce his office as prophet rather than execute his mission. The former seems the most natural explanation of the phrase. Kimchi says that Jonah supposed that the spirit of prophecy would not extend beyond the land of Israel. He could never have thought to escape from God's all-seeing eye. His repugnance to the duty imposed upon him arose partly from national prejudice, which made him loth to interfere in Gentile business, and partly, as he himself says (<a href="/jonah/4-2.htm">Jonah 4:2</a>), because he feared God's compassion would spare the Ninevites on their repentance, and that thus his prediction would be discredited, and mercy shown to heathens already inimical to Israel, if not known to him as the future conquerors of his people. <span class="cmt_word">Joppa.</span> This is the modern <span class="accented">Jaffa</span> (called Japho in <a href="/joshua/19-46.htm">Joshua 19:46</a>), a town on the seacoast thirty miles in a northwesterly direction from Jerusalem. "Jaffa," says Dr. Thomson ('The Land and the Book,' p. 8, etc.), "is one of the oldest cities in the world. It was given to Dan in the distribution of the land by Joshua, and it has been known to history ever since. It owes its existence to the low ledge of rocks which extends into the sea from the extremity of the little cape on which the city stands, and forms a small harbour. Insignificant as it is, and insecure, yet, there being no other on all this coast, it was sufficient to cause a city to spring up around it even in the earliest times, and to sustain its life through numberless changes of dynasties, races, and religions, down to the present hour. It was, in fact, the only harbour of any notoriety possessed by the Jews throughout the greater part of their national existence. To it the timber for both the temples of Jerusalem was brought from Lebanon; and no doubt a lucrative trade in cedar and pine was always carried on through it with the nations who had possession of that goodly mountain. Through it, also, nearly all the foreign commerce of the Jews was conducted, until the artificial pert of Caessarea was built by Herod .... The harbour, howewer, is very inconvenient and insecure. Vessels of any considerable burden must lie out in the open road-stead - a very uneasy berth at all times; and even a moderate wind will oblige them to slip their cables and run out to sea, or seek anchorage at Haifa, sixty miles distant .... The road-stead is liable to sudden and unexpected storms, which stir up a tumultuous sea in a very short time .... The landing also is most inconvenient, and often extremely dangerous. More boats upset, and more lives are lost in the breakers at the north end of the ledge of rocks that defend the inner harbour than anywhere else on this coast." <span class="cmt_word">Went down into it</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span> [<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;</span>, Alex.] <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;</span>, "went up into it" (Septuagint).
