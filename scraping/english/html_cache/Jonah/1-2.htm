It is a call to action, indicating that Jonah must leave his current state and prepare for a mission. Similar calls to action are seen in the lives of other prophets, such as Elijah and Jeremiah, where God commands immediate obedience.<p><b>Go to the great city of Nineveh</b><br>Nineveh was the capital of the Assyrian Empire, known for its size, power, and influence. It was located on the eastern bank of the Tigris River, in what is now modern-day Iraq. Archaeological discoveries have confirmed its grandeur and significance. The city's greatness is not only in its size but also in its historical and cultural impact. Assyria was a dominant force and often an enemy of Israel, making Jonah's mission particularly challenging.<p><b>and preach against it</b><br>Jonah is instructed to deliver a message of impending judgment. This reflects the role of prophets as God's messengers, often tasked with delivering difficult truths. The call to preach against Nineveh highlights God's concern for justice and righteousness. Prophets like Isaiah and Jeremiah also delivered messages of judgment to nations, emphasizing God's sovereignty over all peoples.<p><b>because its wickedness has come up before Me.</b><br>The phrase indicates that Nineveh's sins are significant and have reached a point where divine intervention is necessary. This mirrors the biblical theme of God being aware of human actions and responding to persistent sin. Similar language is used in Genesis regarding Sodom and Gomorrah, where the outcry against the cities' wickedness reached God.

It stood on the left bank of the river Tigris, where it is joined by the Khosr, opposite to the present town of Mosul. The Assyrians had already become known in Syria. In <span class="date">B.C. 854</span> Shal-maneser II. had defeated at Karkar twelve kings confederate against him, among whom is reckoned Ahab King of Israel. Long before his time, Tiglath-Pileser I. had made a great expedition to the west, captured a town at the foot of Lebanon, and reached the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. Jehu was compelled to pay tribute to the Assyrians; and Rimmon-nirari, who reigned from <span class="date">B.C. 810</span> to 781, held the suzerainty of Phoenicia, Samaria, Edom, and Philistia. Jonah, therefore, knew well what his country might expect at the hands of this people. <span class="cmt_word">That great city.</span> It is thus called in <a href="/jonah/3-2.htm">Jonah 3:2, 3</a>; <a href="/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a>; and the epithet is added here in order to show to Jonah the importance of his mission. The size of Nineveh is variously estimated according to the sense attached to the name "Nineveh." This appellation may be restricted to Nineveh proper, or it may comprise the four cities which lay close together in the immediate neighbourhood of each other, and whose remains are now known as the mounds of <span class="accented">Kouyunjik</span>, on the southwest, directly opposite to Mosul; <span class="accented">Nimrud</span>, about eighteen miles to the southeast; <span class="accented">Karamless</span>, twelve miles to the north; and <span class="accented">Khorsabad</span>, the most northerly, about the same distance both from Karamless and Kouyunjik. Khorsabad, however, was not built till some hundred years after Jonah's time (Schrader, 'Keilinschr.,' p. 448). These cities are contained in an irregular parallelogram of some sixty miles in circumference. The following account of Nineveh proper is derived from Professor Rawlinson, 'Ancient Monarchies,' 1:252, etc.: "The ruins consist of two principal mounds, Nebbiyunus and Kouyunjik. The Kouyunjik mound, which lies nearly half a mile northwest of the others, is very much the more considerable of the two. Its shape is an irregular oval, elongated to a point towards the northeast. The surface is nearly flat; the sides slope at a steep angle, and are furrowed with numerous ravines worn in the soft material by the rains of some thirty centuries. The greatest height above the plain is ninety feet, and the area is estimated at a hundred acres. It is an artificial eminence, computed to contain 14,500,000 tons of earth, and on it were erected the palaces and temples of the Assyrian monarchs. The mound of Nebbi-yunus is at its base nearly triangular, and covers an area of nearly forty acres. It is loftier, and its sides are more precipitous than Kouyunjik, especially on the west, where it abutted on the wall of the city. The mass of earth is calculated at six and a half millions of tons. These two vast mounds are both in the same line, and abutted on the western wall of the city, which was some two and a half miles in length. Anciently it seems to have immediately overhung the Tigris, but the river has now receded to the west, leaving a plain of nearly a mile in width between its bank and the old rampart which evidently once followed the course of the river bank. The western wall is joined at fight angles by the northern rampart which runs in a straight line for seven thousand feet. At its other extremity the western wall forms a very obtuse angle with the southern, which impends over a deep ravine, and runs in a straight line for about a thousand yards, when it meets the eastern wall, which is the longest and the least regular of the four. The entire length of this side is sixteen thousand feet, or above three miles. It is divided into two portions by. the Stream of the Khosr-su; which, coming from the northwest, finds its way through the city and then across the low plain to the Tigris. The town is thus of an oblong shape, and the circuit of its walls is somewhat less than eight miles, and the area which they include is eighteen hundred acres. This, at the computation of something less than one hundred inhabitants per acre, would ascribe to Nineveh a population of one hundred and seventy-five thousand souls" (Rawlinson, 'Anc. Men.,' 1. ch. 1). <span class="cmt_word">Cry against it.</span> The message is given in <a href="/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4</a>.
