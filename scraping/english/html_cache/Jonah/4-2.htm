Prayer in the Hebrew tradition is often a dialogue, not just a monologue, indicating Jonah's familiarity and comfort in addressing God directly. This moment of prayer is significant as it reveals Jonah's inner turmoil and his struggle with God's mercy.<p><b>&#8220;O LORD, is this not what I said while I was still in my own country?</b><br>Jonah's reference to his own country underscores his initial reluctance to leave Israel and go to Nineveh. It reflects a common prophetic struggle where the prophet's personal desires conflict with God's command. This phrase also hints at Jonah's foreknowledge of God's character and his expectation of God's mercy towards Nineveh, which he found troubling.<p><b>This is why I was so quick to flee toward Tarshish.</b><br>Tarshish, possibly located in modern-day Spain, represents the farthest point in the known world from Nineveh, indicating Jonah's extreme desire to escape God's mission. This flight symbolizes human attempts to evade divine will, a theme prevalent in biblical narratives. Jonah's actions contrast with the obedience expected of a prophet, highlighting his internal conflict.<p><b>I knew that You are a gracious and compassionate God,</b><br>Jonah's acknowledgment of God's grace and compassion is rooted in the Hebrew understanding of God's nature, as seen in <a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6-7</a>. This recognition of divine attributes is central to the Old Testament portrayal of God, emphasizing His willingness to forgive and show mercy, even to those outside Israel.<p><b>slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion&#8212;</b><br>The phrase "slow to anger" is a testament to God's patience and long-suffering nature, often mentioned in the Psalms and prophetic literature. "Abounding in loving devotion" (hesed) is a key aspect of God's covenantal love, which is steadfast and enduring. This reflects the theological foundation of God's relationship with humanity, emphasizing His faithfulness and commitment.<p><b>One who relents from sending disaster.</b><br>God's willingness to relent from sending disaster upon repentance is a recurring theme in the prophetic books, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7-8</a>. This aspect of God's character underscores the conditional nature of prophecy, where divine judgment can be averted through genuine repentance.

Even when his heart is conflicted, he speaks directly to God. Prayer is dialogue, not mere ritual (<a href="/psalms/62-8.htm">Psalm 62:8</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>). In Jonah&#8217;s story, prayer bookends the narrative&#8212;first from the fish&#8217;s belly (<a href="/jonah/2-1.htm">Jonah 2:1</a>) and now from outside Nineveh&#8212;reminding us that God invites continual conversation whether in desperation or dissatisfaction.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;O LORD, is this not what I said while I was still in my own country?&#8221;</b><p>Jonah recalls a private conversation with God we were not previously told about, revealing that his resistance started long before the ship to Tarshish. Like the older brother in <a href="/luke/15-28.htm">Luke 15:28&#8211;30</a>, Jonah objects to grace shown to outsiders. His words expose a heart that values national comfort over God&#8217;s global mission (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>; <a href="/acts/10-28.htm">Acts 10:28-35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;This is why I was so quick to flee toward Tarshish.&#8221;</b><p>Jonah confesses motive: he ran not from fear of failure but from fear of success&#8212;God&#8217;s mercy on enemies. Tarshish symbolized distance from God&#8217;s calling (<a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-10</a>). Running from obedience never thwarts God&#8217;s plan (<a href="/proverbs/19-21.htm">Proverbs 19:21</a>), but it does rob the runner of joy and fellowship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;I knew that You are a gracious and compassionate God&#8221;</b><p>Jonah quotes God&#8217;s self-revelation to Moses (<a href="/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>). These words anchor Israel&#8217;s hope and ours (<a href="/nehemiah/9-17.htm">Nehemiah 9:17</a>; <a href="/psalms/103-8.htm">Psalm 103:8</a>). Ironically, the prophet resents the very grace that earlier spared his own life in the storm and the fish (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>; 2:9). God&#8217;s character does not change based on the recipient; His grace is consistent (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;slow to anger&#8221;</b><p>God&#8217;s patience allowed time for Nineveh to repent (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>). Jonah wanted swift judgment, forgetting how divine forbearance had benefited him and Israel repeatedly (<a href="/numbers/14-18.htm">Numbers 14:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/86-15.htm">Psalm 86:15</a>). Patience is not weakness but purposeful restraint to open a window for repentance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;abounding in loving devotion&#8221;</b><p>The Hebrew concept behind &#8220;loving devotion&#8221; (steadfast love) speaks of covenant loyalty (<a href="/bsb/psalms/136.htm">Psalm 136</a>). God&#8217;s love overflows; it is not meted out sparingly (<a href="/ephesians/2-4.htm">Ephesians 2:4-5</a>). Jonah acknowledges this abundance yet views it as a problem when applied to Assyrians, revealing selective appreciation of God&#8217;s love.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;One who relents from sending disaster&#8221;</b><p>Relenting does not mean God is fickle; it means He responds to human repentance within His just character (<a href="/jeremiah/18-7.htm">Jeremiah 18:7-8</a>; <a href="/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>). Nineveh&#8217;s turning triggered God&#8217;s mercy, showcasing the gospel pattern later fulfilled in Christ, who bears wrath so repentant sinners receive grace (<a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/jonah/4-2.htm">Jonah 4:2</a> reveals a prophet who intellectually affirms God&#8217;s merciful character yet emotionally resists its implications for his enemies. His prayer uncovers a heart out of step with the God he serves. The verse teaches that God&#8217;s grace is consistent, patient, abundant, and responsive to repentance, inviting us to celebrate&#8212;never begrudge&#8212;His mercy toward all people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/jonah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He prayed.</span> He carried his complaint to God, and was prepared to submit it to him, even while he questioned the wisdom of his clemency. <span class="cmt_word">I pray thee</span> (<span class="accented">anna</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">obsecro</span>.
