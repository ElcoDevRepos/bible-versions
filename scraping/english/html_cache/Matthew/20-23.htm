The "cup" is a metaphor for the experiences, often of suffering or judgment, that one is destined to undergo. In the Old Testament, the cup is frequently associated with God's wrath (<a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/25-15.htm">Jeremiah 25:15</a>). In the New Testament, Jesus refers to His impending suffering and crucifixion as a cup He must drink (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>). Historically, James was martyred (<a href="/acts/12-2.htm">Acts 12:2</a>), and John faced persecution and exile (<a href="/revelation/1-9.htm">Revelation 1:9</a>), fulfilling this prophecy of shared suffering.<p><b>Jesus said.</b><br>This emphasizes the authority of Jesus in making this statement. In the context of the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus is portrayed as the authoritative teacher and Messiah. His words carry weight and are often used to reveal deeper spiritual truths. The use of direct speech here highlights the personal nature of His response to the disciples' request.<p><b>But to sit at My right or left is not Mine to grant.</b><br>This statement underscores the divine order and the roles within the Trinity. While Jesus is fully God, He submits to the Father's will, reflecting the functional subordination within the Godhead. The right and left seats are positions of honor and authority, often associated with a king's closest advisors. In biblical culture, these positions were not given lightly and were often reserved for those with special favor or purpose.<p><b>These seats belong to those for whom My Father has prepared them.</b><br>This phrase indicates God's sovereign will and predestination. It reflects the biblical theme that God has a predetermined plan and purpose for each individual (<a href="/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>). The preparation by the Father suggests a divine election and purpose, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of God's chosen people and His ultimate plan for redemption. This also connects to the idea of rewards in heaven, where positions of honor are determined by God's criteria, not human ambition.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to a request made by the mother of James and John, two of His disciples.

Their mother had asked Jesus for special positions for them in His kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cup.htm">The Cup</a></b><br>Symbolic of suffering and sacrifice, the "cup" refers to the trials and tribulations that Jesus would face, and by extension, what His followers would also endure.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>God the Father, who has the ultimate authority to assign positions in the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_heaven.htm">The Kingdom of Heaven</a></b><br>The spiritual realm over which God reigns, and the ultimate destination for believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_cup.htm">Understanding the Cup</a></b><br>The "cup" represents the trials and sacrifices inherent in following Christ.

Our Lord does not say that it does not belong to Him to give what the disciples asked, but that He could only give it according to His Father's will and the laws which He had fixed. Considered as a prediction, there was a singular contrast in the forms of its fulfilment in the future of the two brothers. James was the first of the whole company of the Twelve to pass through the baptism of blood (<a href="/acts/12-2.htm" title="And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.">Acts 12:2</a>). For John was reserved the weariness and loneliness of an old age surviving all the friendships and companionships of youth and manhood, the exile in Patmos, and the struggle with the great storm of persecution which raged throughout the empire under Nero and Domitian.<p><span class= "bld">To them for whom it is prepared of my Father.</span>--He does not say who these are; but the reappearance of the same words in <a href="/matthew/25-34.htm" title="Then shall the King say to them on his right hand, Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:">Matthew 25:34</a>, throws some light on its meaning here. The kingdom is reserved for those who do Christ-like deeds of love; the highest places in the kingdom must be reserved for those whose love is like His own, alike in its intensity and its width.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall indeed drink,</span> etc. Jesus accepts their venture of faith, and prophesies its fulfilment. St. James first shared in Christ's baptism of blood, being murdered by Herod (<a href="/acts/12-2.htm">Acts 12:2</a>). He was a martyr in will and deed. St. John did not, indeed, undergo a violent death, but he stood by the cross and felt his Master's sufferings; he lived a long life of persecution, banishment, and distress; he saw all his companions drop off one by one, till in extreme old age he was left solitary, with nothing to comfort him but the memory of vanished years, and the hope of an eternal future. Truly he was a martyr in will, if not in deed. The story that he was cast into a cauldron of boiling oil by Nero's command, and that, coming forth unhurt, he was afterwards banished to Patmos, is one which, except as regards the banishment, has not. been accepted by modern criticism. The event is mentioned by Tertullian ('De Praescript.,' 36.), Jerome ('Adv. Jovin.,' 1:26; and 'Comm. in Matthew' 20:27), and is commemorated in the Church Calendar on May 6, under the title of "S. Joh. ante Port. Lat.;" but it appears to have been a legend that first appeared in Tertullian's work, and was copied from him by other writers without examination. <span class="cmt_word">Is not mine to give,</span> <span class="cmt_word">but</span> it shall be given to them <span class="cmt_word">for whom</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">it is prepared</span>.

The Lord does not mean that he was not able to give it, if so he thought fit, or that the boon was solely at his Father's bestowal, not his (which he might have said, speaking in his human nature). What he affirms is this: The prize is awarded, not by favour or on any earthly considerations, but by absolute justice, and only to those who prove themselves worthy to receive it. Christ assigns to the Father the revelation of mysteries and the election to eternal life (see <a href="/matthew/11-26.htm">Matthew 11:26</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a>). <span class="accented">It is prepared</span>; <span class="accented">it hath been prepared</span> (<a href="/matthew/25-34.htm">Matthew 25:34</a>), according to certain impartial laws ordained by God, who is no respecter of persons. "The throne," says St. Bernard, "is the price of toils, not a grace granted to ambition; a reward of righteousness, not the concession of a request." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/20-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;You will indeed drink</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#943;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(piesthe)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Middle - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4095.htm">Strong's 4095: </a> </span><span class="str2">To drink, imbibe.
