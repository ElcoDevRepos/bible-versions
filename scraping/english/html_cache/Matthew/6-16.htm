In the Old Testament, fasting was a common practice during times of mourning, repentance, or seeking God's guidance (e.g., <a href="/2_samuel/12-16.htm">2 Samuel 12:16</a>, <a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-10</a>). Jesus assumes His followers will fast, indicating its continued importance. Fasting is a way to humble oneself before God, seeking spiritual clarity and strength.<p><b>Do not be somber like the hypocrites</b><br>The term "hypocrites" refers to those who perform religious acts for outward show rather than genuine devotion. In the cultural context of Jesus' time, religious leaders often sought public recognition for their piety. Jesus warns against this, emphasizing sincerity in one's relationship with God. The somber appearance was a deliberate act to gain attention and admiration from others, which contradicts the true purpose of fasting.<p><b>For they disfigure their faces</b><br>Disfiguring the face was a way to visibly demonstrate one's fasting to others. This could involve neglecting personal grooming or applying substances to appear pale and weak. Such actions were intended to elicit sympathy or admiration, but they were superficial and missed the spiritual essence of fasting. Jesus criticizes this behavior as it prioritizes human approval over divine approval.<p><b>To show men they are fasting</b><br>The motivation behind the hypocrites' fasting was to gain recognition from people rather than to seek God. This reflects a broader theme in Jesus' teaching: the importance of inner righteousness over outward appearances. The desire to be seen by others undermines the spiritual benefits of fasting, which should be a private act of devotion to God.<p><b>Truly I tell you, they already have their full reward</b><br>Jesus emphasizes that those who fast for public recognition have received their reward in the form of human admiration. This contrasts with the eternal rewards that come from God for genuine acts of faith. The phrase "truly I tell you" underscores the certainty and authority of Jesus' statement. The concept of receiving a "full reward" highlights the futility of seeking temporary, earthly approval over lasting, heavenly rewards.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, which includes teachings on various aspects of righteous living.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hypocrites.htm">Hypocrites</a></b><br>A term used by Jesus to describe those who perform religious acts for outward show rather than genuine devotion.

Other fasts were occasional, in times of distress or penitence, as in <a href="/joel/1-14.htm" title="Sanctify you a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God, and cry to the LORD,">Joel 1:14</a>; <a href="/joel/2-15.htm" title="Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:">Joel 2:15</a>; or as part of a policy affecting to be religious zeal (<a href="/1_kings/21-9.htm" title="And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:">1Kings 21:9</a>; <a href="/1_kings/21-12.htm" title="They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.">1Kings 21:12</a>); or as the expression of personal sorrow (<a href="/1_samuel/20-34.htm" title="So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for David, because his father had done him shame.">1Samuel 20:34</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/12-16.htm" title="David therefore sought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in, and lay all night on the earth.">2Samuel 12:16</a>; <a href="/ezra/10-6.htm" title="Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away.">Ezra 10:6</a>; <a href="/nehemiah/1-4.htm" title="And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven,">Nehemiah 1:4</a>; <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> These were observed with an ostentatious show of affliction which called forth the indignant sarcasm of the prophets (<a href="/isaiah/58-5.htm" title="Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? will you call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?">Isaiah 58:5</a>). The "sackcloth" took the place of the usual raiment, "ashes" on the head, of the usual unguents (<a href="/nehemiah/9-1.htm" title="Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloths, and earth on them.">Nehemiah 9:1</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-13.htm" title="But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into my own bosom.">Psalm 35:13</a>). The tradition of the Pharisees starting from the true principle that fasting was one way of attaining self-control, and that as a discipline it was effectual in proportion as it was systematic, fixed on the fasts "twice in the week," specified in the prayer of the Pharisee (<a href="/luke/18-12.htm" title="I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.">Luke 18:12</a>); and the second and fifth days of the week were fixed, and connected with some vague idea that Moses went up Mount Sinai on the one, and descended on the other. Our Lord, we may note, does not blame the principle, or even the rule, on which the Pharisees acted. He recognises fasting, as He recognises almsgiving and prayer, and is content to warn His disciples against the ostentation that vitiates all three, the secret self-satisfaction under the mask of contrition, the "pride that apes humility." The very words, "when thou fastest" contain an implied command. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-18.</span> - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="accented">Fasting.</span> The third in the series of recognized religious duties (ver. 1, note). (On the prominence given to fasting, see 'Psalms of Solomon,' 3:9, with Ryle's and James's note, and Schurer, II. 2:118; cf. <a href="/matthew/9-14.htm">Matthew 9:14</a>.) Observe <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Christ does not abolish it, but regulates it; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> yet fasting is mentioned much less often in the true text of the New Testament than in that which, developed contemporaneously with eccle-siasticism, became the Received Text. <span class="cmt_word">Be</span> <span class="cmt_word">not as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance.</span> The Revised Version, by inserting a comma between "not" and "as," shows that the true emphasis of the warning lies, not on resemblance to the hypocrites themselves, but on being of a sad countenance, as in fact also the hypocrites were. <span class="accented">The hypocrites</span> (ver. 2, note; cf. also 'Didache,' &sect; 8, "But let not your fasts be with the hypocrites," where, however, the thought is rather of hypocrites as representing the Pharisaic, the typically Jewish party). The early Jewish Christians are bidden in the 'Didache' to avoid the fasting-days chosen by the Jews. <span class="accented">Be not.</span> Our Lord does not forbid even this sad countenance if it be, so to speak, natural; but do not, because you fast, therefore purposely become so (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in sign of your supposed sorrow for sin (cf. Ecclus. 19:26). <span class="accented">Of a sad countenance</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>); gloomy, especially- in knitting the brows. In <a href="/daniel/1-10.htm">Daniel 1:10</a> (Thee-dotion) used of merely physically bad looks (cf. 'Test. XII. Patr.,' &sect; 4, of the look of a man whose liver is out of order). In the New Testament elsewhere only <a href="/luke/24-17.htm">Luke 24:17</a>, "And they stood still, looking sad," Revised Version (cf. <a href="/genesis/40-7.htm">Genesis 40:7</a>; Ecclus. 25:23). <span class="cmt_word">For</span> <span class="cmt_word">they disfigure.</span> The play on the words (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. <span class="accented">. .</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, hardly to be reproduced in English," They <span class="accented">disfigure</span>... that they may <span class="accented">figure</span> before men as fasting") points to the 'Gospel having been originally composed in Greek (see Introduction, p. 13.). It is curious that <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span> comes elsewhere in Matthew only in vers. 19, 20, while in the whole of the New Testament it only comes twice besides: <a href="/acts/13-41.htm">Acts 13:41</a> (from the LXX.) and <a href="/james/4-14.htm">James 4:14</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="/hebrews/8-13.htm">Hebrews 8:13</a>). As ver. 19 is peculiar to Matthew, and ver. 20 is a corollary to it though in part found also in <a href="/luke/12-33.htm">Luke 12:33</a>, the whole passage vers. 16-20 is probably either due to the author of the First Gospel or else derived by him from some one source. In this connexion it may be noticed that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> comes in the New Testament only in ver. 18 (twice). Physical disfigurement, common in many nations as a sign of grief, such as tearing or marking the flesh, is not to be thought of, since this was forbidden (<a href="/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>). <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, too, has no such connotation, but rather hiding out of sight, hence causing to vanish, destroy (ver. 19); here, in the sense of giving a strange, unpleasant appearance, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> by ashes, or by not washing, or even by covering part of the face or the head (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17</a><span class="cmt_word">;</span> <a href="/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>; <a href="/esther/6-12.htm">Esther 6:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That</span> <span class="cmt_word">they may appear unto men to fast</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">that they may be seen</span>, etc.; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not the mere appearance, as though there were appearance only, but the being seen as fasting - conspicuousness, not mere semblance. Hence <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> is expressed (contrast ver. 5), since while in ver. 5 not the praying but the piety that induced it is to be made apparent, here it is the very fact itself of fasting, which, except for these external signs, might escape human notice. <span class="cmt_word">They have</span> (ver. 2, note). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/6-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8013;&#964;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Hotan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3752.htm">Strong's 3752: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, whenever.
