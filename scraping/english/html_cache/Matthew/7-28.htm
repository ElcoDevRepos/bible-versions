The Sermon on the Mount, found in Matthew chapters 5-7, is a collection of teachings that outline the principles of the Kingdom of Heaven. It includes the Beatitudes, the Lord's Prayer, and various ethical teachings. The phrase "finished saying these things" is a literary device used by Matthew to signal the end of a major discourse, which he uses throughout his Gospel (e.g., <a href="/matthew/11.htm">Matthew 11:1, 13</a>:53, 19:1, 26:1). This structure highlights the importance of Jesus' teachings and their role in establishing the new covenant.<p><b>the crowds were astonished</b><br>The reaction of the crowds indicates the profound impact of Jesus' words. The term "astonished" suggests a deep sense of wonder and amazement, often associated with encountering something unexpected or beyond ordinary human experience. This response reflects the authority and wisdom with which Jesus spoke, distinguishing Him from other teachers of the time. The crowds' astonishment can be seen as a fulfillment of prophecies about the Messiah, who would teach with divine authority and insight (<a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2-4</a>).<p><b>at His teaching</b><br>Jesus' teaching was revolutionary, challenging the established religious norms and offering a new understanding of God's law. Unlike the scribes and Pharisees, who relied heavily on tradition and interpretation, Jesus spoke with direct authority, often prefacing His teachings with "But I say to you" (<a href="/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22, 28, 32, 34, 39, 44</a>). His teachings emphasized the spirit of the law rather than mere legalistic adherence, focusing on internal transformation and righteousness. This approach resonated with the crowds, who were accustomed to the burdensome interpretations of the law by religious leaders. Jesus' teaching also fulfilled the role of a prophet, as foretold in <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, where Moses speaks of a prophet like himself who would come and whom the people should listen to.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, whose teachings and actions form the foundation of Christian faith.

Like Moses finishing the law-giving on Sinai (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-24.htm">Deuteronomy 31:24</a>), Jesus now expects listeners to choose obedience built on the rock (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying these things</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;These things&#8221; gathers every instruction from the sermon&#8212;beatitudes, kingdom ethics, prayer, warnings, and the call to enter through the narrow gate.<p>&#8226; His seamless teaching covers every sphere of life, echoing the whole counsel of God (<a href="/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a>) and leaving no room for selective hearing (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22-25</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us that revelation is verbal and clear; God speaks so His people can understand and live (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-11.htm">Deuteronomy 30:11-14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the crowds were astonished</b><p>&#8226; Astonishment is the natural reaction when ordinary people meet divine authority (<a href="/mark/1-27.htm">Mark 1:27</a>; <a href="/luke/4-36.htm">Luke 4:36</a>).<p>&#8226; Their amazement contrasts with the complacency of religious leaders who often resisted Him (<a href="/matthew/12-14.htm">Matthew 12:14</a>; 21:45-46).<p>&#8226; The emotion signals that truth had pierced their conscience, much like Peter&#8217;s sermon &#8220;cut to the heart&#8221; at Pentecost (<a href="/acts/2-37.htm">Acts 2:37</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet astonishment alone is not faith; later multitudes will still choose Barabbas (<a href="/matthew/27-20.htm">Matthew 27:20-23</a>).

Unlike teachers who cited earlier rabbis, He spoke in His own name: &#8220;But I tell you&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22, 28, 32</a>).<p>&#8226; Authority flows from His identity as the Son (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19-24</a>). Even temple guards confessed, &#8220;Never has anyone spoken like this man!&#8221; (<a href="/john/7-46.htm">John 7:46</a>).<p>&#8226; The content is both gracious and uncompromising, offering righteousness that surpasses the scribes and Pharisees (<a href="/matthew/5-20.htm">Matthew 5:20</a>) while warning of judgment for those who ignore His words (<a href="/matthew/7-26.htm">Matthew 7:26-27</a>).<p>&#8226; His teaching remains the foundation for the church&#8217;s faith and practice (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28</a> records the decisive moment after the Sermon on the Mount: Jesus has fully delivered God&#8217;s authoritative word, and the crowds stand stunned by its power.
