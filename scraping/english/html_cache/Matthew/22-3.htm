This aligns with the Old Testament narrative where God repeatedly sent prophets to guide, warn, and call His people back to Him (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25</a>, <a href="/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>). The sending of servants indicates God's initiative and desire to reach out to His people.<p><b>to call those he had invited</b><br>The invitation signifies God's covenant relationship with Israel, who were the initial recipients of His promises and blessings (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The calling reflects the special status of Israel as God's chosen people, who were to be a light to the nations (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>). This invitation is a metaphor for the call to repentance and participation in the Kingdom of God.<p><b>to the banquet</b><br>The banquet symbolizes the Messianic feast, a common theme in Jewish eschatology representing the ultimate fellowship and celebration in God's Kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>, <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>). It signifies the abundance and joy of salvation and the fulfillment of God's promises through the Messiah.<p><b>but they refused to come</b><br>This refusal highlights the historical rejection of God's messengers by Israel, as seen in the repeated disobedience and idolatry throughout their history (<a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15-16</a>). It also foreshadows the rejection of Jesus as the Messiah by many of the Jewish leaders and people of His time (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>). This refusal is a critical turning point, illustrating the consequences of rejecting God's invitation and the opening of the Kingdom to others (Gentiles).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Represents God the Father, who is preparing a wedding banquet for His Son, symbolizing the Kingdom of Heaven.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servants.htm">The Servants</a></b><br>Symbolize the prophets and messengers of God sent throughout history to call people to repentance and to accept God's invitation.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_invited_guests.htm">The Invited Guests</a></b><br>Initially represent the Jewish people, God's chosen people, who were the first to receive the invitation to the Kingdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_banquet.htm">The Banquet</a></b><br>Symbolizes the Kingdom of Heaven and the eternal fellowship with God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_refusal.htm">The Refusal</a></b><br>The rejection of God's invitation by the invited guests, highlighting human resistance to divine grace.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_persistent_invitation.htm">God's Persistent Invitation</a></b><br>God continually reaches out to humanity, inviting us into a relationship with Him.

God personally raises up messengers &#8220;early and often&#8221; (<a href="/jeremiah/26-5.htm">Jeremiah 26:5</a>), showing His persistent love.<p>&#8226; This sending reflects the heart of the Father who &#8220;desires all people to be saved&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>) and mirrors the commission Jesus later gives to His disciples in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19&#8211;20</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to call those he had invited</b><p>&#8226; The invitees are first-century Israel, already chosen and covenanted through Abraham (<a href="/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/romans/9-4.htm">Romans 9:4&#8211;5</a>). The wedding banquet pictures the promised Messianic kingdom feast (<a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Call&#8221; signals both privilege and responsibility. Being invited isn&#8217;t casual; it carries the weight of covenant vows (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6&#8211;8</a>).<p>&#8226; God never breaks His word&#8212;His invitations are irrevocable (<a href="/romans/11-29.htm">Romans 11:29</a>). The verse underscores the literal, historical continuity between Old Testament promises and New Testament fulfillment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but they refused to come</b><p>&#8226; The tragedy is willful rejection, not misunderstanding. Like the vineyard tenants in <a href="/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33&#8211;46</a>, these guests consciously spurn grace (<a href="/acts/7-51.htm">Acts 7:51&#8211;52</a>).<p>&#8226; Refusal fulfills prophecy: &#8220;The ox knows its owner&#8230; but Israel does not understand&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>). Jesus weeps over Jerusalem for this very hardness (<a href="/luke/19-41.htm">Luke 19:41&#8211;44</a>).<p>&#8226; Refusal has consequences. Later in the parable, the king&#8217;s judgment falls (<a href="/matthew/22-7.htm">Matthew 22:7</a>), echoing the literal destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70&#8212;history validating Scripture&#8217;s warnings.<p>&#8226; Yet God&#8217;s plan advances. New guests from &#8220;the highways&#8221; are gathered (<a href="/matthew/22-9.htm">Matthew 22:9&#8211;10</a>), portraying the Gentile inclusion foretold in <a href="/hosea/2-23.htm">Hosea 2:23</a> and fulfilled in <a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46&#8211;48</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/22-3.htm">Matthew 22:3</a> shows a faithful King sending real servants with a real invitation to His covenant people, only to meet deliberate refusal. The verse highlights God&#8217;s persistent grace, mankind&#8217;s accountability, and the unfolding plan that will reach the nations when the original invitees turn away.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Sent forth his servants.</span>--As in the parable of the Vineyard (<a href="/context/matthew/21-33.htm" title="Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and dig a wine press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to farmers, and went into a far country:">Matthew 21:33-46</a>), the servants represent the aggregate work of the prophets up to the time of the Baptist. The refusal of guests invited to what seems to us so great an honour may seem, at first sight, so contrary to human nature as to be wanting in the element of dramatic probability. That refusal, however, would be natural enough, we must remember, in subjects who were in heart rebellious and disloyal; and it is precisely that character which the parable was intended to portray. The summons, it may be noted, came in the first instance to those who had long ago been "bidden" to the wedding. The proclamation of the kingdom was addressed to the Jews, who, as such, had all along been children of the kingdom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sent forth his servants.</span> In the East, the original invitation to a solemn festivity is followed by reminders as the day approaches (comp. <a href="/esther/5-8.htm">Esther 5:8</a>; <a href="/esther/6-14.htm">Esther 6:14</a>). The servants here are John the Baptist, the twelve apostles, the seventy, who first preached the gospel to the Jewish people. <span class="cmt_word">Them that were bidden.</span> The Jews had already been invited to come in; to them already belonged "the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants... and the promises" (<a href="/romans/9-1.htm">Romans 9:1</a>).

Their reasons for refusal are not given here - a fact which differentiates this parable from that of the great supper. A general disinclination or aversion is denoted; no actual outrage is perpetrated as yet, but the invited guests are ripening for this stage, in that they despise the King's Son, and believe not in his Divine mission. This backwardness and obduracy recall Christ's lamentation, "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem!" (<a href="/luke/13-34.htm">Luke 13:34, 35</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/22-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He sent</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#941;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(apesteilen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_649.htm">Strong's 649: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and stello; set apart, i.e. to send out literally or figuratively.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
