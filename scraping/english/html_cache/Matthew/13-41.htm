The sending of angels indicates a divine authority and a fulfillment of eschatological roles, as angels are often depicted as messengers and agents of God's will (<a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>). This action signifies a time of judgment, aligning with other New Testament passages where angels are involved in the end times (<a href="/matthew/24-31.htm">Matthew 24:31</a>, <a href="/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14-20</a>).<p><b>and they will weed out of His kingdom</b><br>The imagery of weeding suggests a separation process, akin to the parable of the wheat and the tares earlier in <a href="/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13</a>. This reflects the agricultural context of first-century Palestine, where separating wheat from weeds was a common practice. The "kingdom" here refers to the realm of God's rule, which includes both the visible church and the world at large. This separation underscores the theme of divine judgment and purification, as seen in other biblical texts like <a href="/matthew/25-31.htm">Matthew 25:31-46</a>.<p><b>every cause of sin</b><br>The phrase "cause of sin" can be understood as stumbling blocks or sources of temptation that lead people away from righteousness. This echoes Jesus' earlier teachings in <a href="/matthew/18-7.htm">Matthew 18:7-9</a>, where He warns against causing others to sin. The removal of these causes signifies a purging of evil influences, aligning with the prophetic vision of a restored and holy kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/35-8.htm">Isaiah 35:8-10</a>).<p><b>and all who practice lawlessness</b><br>"Lawlessness" refers to living in defiance of God's commandments, a theme prevalent throughout Scripture. This phrase highlights the moral and ethical standards expected in God's kingdom, contrasting with the lawlessness that characterizes the world (1 <a href="/john/3-4.htm">John 3:4</a>). The judgment against those who practice lawlessness is consistent with Jesus' warnings in <a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>, where He emphasizes the importance of doing the Father's will. This separation of the righteous from the lawless fulfills the prophetic vision of a kingdom where righteousness dwells (<a href="/2_peter/3-13.htm">2 Peter 3:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son_of_man.htm">The Son of Man</a></b><br>A title Jesus frequently uses for Himself, emphasizing His role in both His humanity and divine authority, particularly in eschatological contexts.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Heavenly beings who serve God and carry out His commands.
