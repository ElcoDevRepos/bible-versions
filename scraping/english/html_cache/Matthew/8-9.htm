In the Roman army, a centurion was a commander of approximately 100 soldiers, indicating a significant level of responsibility and authority. This acknowledgment of authority parallels the spiritual authority of Jesus, who operates under the authority of God the Father. The centurion's insight into authority highlights his recognition of Jesus' divine authority over sickness and the spiritual realm, a theme consistent with the broader biblical narrative of Jesus' mission on earth.<p><b>with soldiers under me</b><br>The centurion's mention of soldiers under his command illustrates the structured and disciplined nature of the Roman military. This structure is a metaphor for the spiritual order in the kingdom of God, where Jesus commands authority over all creation, including spiritual forces. The centurion's role as a leader who commands obedience from his soldiers is a reflection of Jesus' authority over His disciples and followers, as well as over the natural and supernatural realms.<p><b>I tell one to go, and he goes</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the immediate obedience expected in a military context, which the centurion uses to illustrate his faith in Jesus' power to command healing. The centurion's confidence in Jesus' word alone to heal his servant is a testament to his faith, which Jesus later commends. This concept of obedience is echoed in the teachings of Jesus, where faith and action are closely linked, as seen in <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>, which states that faith without works is dead.<p><b>and another to come, and he comes</b><br>The centurion's statement about commanding his soldiers to come and go at his word underscores the authority he wields and his belief that Jesus possesses a similar, if not greater, authority over illness and the spiritual realm. This reflects the biblical principle that Jesus' words have power, as seen in the creation narrative where God speaks the world into existence (Genesis 1). The centurion's faith in Jesus' spoken word is a precursor to the understanding of Jesus as the Word made flesh (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>I tell my servant to do something, and he does it.</b><br>The centurion's expectation of obedience from his servant mirrors the obedience expected of believers to Christ. This obedience is not out of compulsion but out of recognition of Jesus' authority and love. The centurion's faith in Jesus' ability to heal from a distance without physical presence is a profound acknowledgment of Jesus' divine nature. This anticipates the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18-20</a>), where Jesus, with all authority in heaven and on earth, commands His disciples to go and make disciples of all nations, promising His presence with them always.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/centurion.htm">Centurion</a></b><br>A Roman officer in charge of a hundred soldiers.

Accepting His word as final and sufficient is the essence of saving, life-transforming faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">For I am a man under authority.</span>--He gives, not without a certain <span class= "ital">na&#8249;vete,</span> the process of reasoning by which he had been led to this conviction. His own experience had taught that in every well organised system a delegated authority could, in its turn, be delegated to others. The personal presence of the centurion was not wanted where he could send his soldier or his slave to act on his orders. Might he not reason on this analogy, and infer from it that in God's kingdom also One whom He endued with power would have His ministers at hand, the unknown forces (personal or otherwise, he did not care to ask) that govern life and death, to execute His will?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For I am</span> (<span class="accented">for I also am</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">a man under authority, having soldiers under me</span> (<span class="accented">under myself soldiers</span>, Revised Version): <span class="cmt_word">and I say to this man</span> (<span class="accented">this</span> one, Revised Version<span class="cmt_word">), Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it</span>. The centurion says that he knows the power of a command when given by one in authority, through the obedience that he himself shows and through that which he himself receives. Observe, he naturally orders his soldiers movement, and his slave work. Further, may not "and to my slave" represent the climax of his faith? He felt that the powers of nature (at least those concerned in this illness) were not only subordinate to Jesus, but were completely under his power. At his command they would act and the man be healed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/8-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
