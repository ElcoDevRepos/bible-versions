Their response, "We do not know," reveals their unwillingness to commit to an answer that could undermine their position. This reflects their fear of the people, who regarded John as a prophet, and their inability to recognize divine authority. Their indecision highlights a recurring theme in the Gospels: the spiritual blindness of the religious elite. This phrase also underscores the tension between Jesus and the religious authorities, who often challenged His teachings and actions.<p><b>And Jesus replied, &#8220;Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</b><br>Jesus' response is a strategic refusal to disclose His authority to those who are not genuinely seeking truth. By withholding an answer, He exposes their insincerity and lack of spiritual discernment. This moment is significant in the context of Jesus' ministry, as it demonstrates His wisdom in dealing with opposition. The "things" Jesus refers to include His teachings, miracles, and actions in the temple, which were all done under divine authority. This encounter is a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>, where the people's hearts are described as dull and unperceptive. Jesus' authority is a central theme in the Gospels, pointing to His identity as the Messiah and the Son of God, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, where He declares that all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is questioned by the religious leaders about His authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests_and_elders.htm">Chief Priests and Elders</a></b><br>These are the religious leaders of the Jewish community who challenge Jesus' authority.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_in_jerusalem.htm">Temple in Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of this encounter, a significant place of worship and teaching for the Jewish people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, he is referenced in the preceding verses as part of Jesus' question to the leaders.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/authority.htm">Authority</a></b><br>The central theme of the passage, focusing on the source and recognition of Jesus' authority.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_authority.htm">Understanding Authority</a></b><br>Recognize that true authority comes from God, and discernment is needed to identify it in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_truth.htm">Courage in Truth</a></b><br>Like Jesus, we should stand firm in the truth, even when questioned or challenged by those in positions of power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_and_openness.htm">Humility and Openness</a></b><br>The religious leaders' inability to answer Jesus' question highlights the importance of humility and openness to God's revelation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability_to_god.htm">Accountability to God</a></b><br>We are accountable to God for recognizing and submitting to His authority, as demonstrated by Jesus.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_in_response.htm">Wisdom in Response</a></b><br>Jesus' response teaches us to be wise and discerning in how we answer those who question our faith.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_21_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 21:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_21_27_Jesus_authority_today.htm">How does Matthew 21:27 demonstrate the importance of acknowledging Jesus' authority today?

Their debate among themselves exposed that any answer would cost them&#8212;either popularity with the people or their own standing with Rome.<p>&#8226; By saying nothing until cornered, they hoped to escape commitment, yet their silence revealed hearts unwilling to acknowledge truth&#8212;echoing <a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a> and <a href="/john/3-19.htm">John 3:19&#8211;20</a>, where fear of man and love of darkness keep people from confessing what they know.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;We do not know.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; This claim was dishonest; they had witnessed John&#8217;s ministry and its divine hallmark (<a href="/john/1-32.htm">John 1:32&#8211;34</a>).<p>&#8226; Their evasive answer fulfilled what Jesus had already taught: &#8220;Whoever is not with Me is against Me&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-30.htm">Matthew 12:30</a>). Neutrality toward divine revelation is impossible.<p>&#8226; Like Pharaoh hardening his heart (<a href="/exodus/9-34.htm">Exodus 9:34&#8211;35</a>) or the Israelites refusing to enter the land (<a href="/numbers/14-11.htm">Numbers 14:11</a>), these leaders chose unbelief.<p>&#8226; Their admission stripped them of moral authority&#8212;if they could not discern God&#8217;s work in John, they were unqualified to judge Jesus.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And Jesus replied</b><p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; response models perfect wisdom: He neither capitulates nor allows them to trap Him (<a href="/proverbs/26-4.htm">Proverbs 26:4&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; By reflecting their answer back to them, He exposes their hypocrisy without casting pearls before swine (<a href="/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>).<p>&#8226; His reply embodies <a href="/isaiah/11-3.htm">Isaiah 11:3&#8211;4</a>&#8212;Messiah judges not by outward appearance but with righteousness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Neither will I tell you&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Revelation is withheld from the willfully blind (<a href="/matthew/13-11.htm">Matthew 13:11&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/23-8.htm">Luke 23:8&#8211;9</a> shows a similar moment when Jesus stayed silent before Herod; silence is judgment on obstinate unbelief.<p>&#8226; This refusal also anticipates <a href="/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24&#8211;28</a>, where God gives people over to the consequences of suppressing truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;By what authority I am doing these things.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Authority (exousia) in Matthew centers on Jesus as the Son with all power (<a href="/matthew/7-29.htm">Matthew 7:29</a>; 28:18).<p>&#8226; His triumphal entry, temple cleansing, and miracles all demonstrated messianic authority (<a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>; <a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet Jesus will not validate Himself on their terms; true recognition comes by faith (<a href="/john/10-25.htm">John 10:25&#8211;27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/21-27.htm">Matthew 21:27</a> shows religious leaders dodging truth, Jesus exposing their hypocrisy, and divine revelation withheld from unbelief.

The verse warns that evading God&#8217;s clear witness forfeits further light, while affirming that Jesus&#8217; authority stands unshaken, awaiting hearts ready to receive it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">We cannot tell.</span>--The confession of impotence to which the priests and scribes were thus brought was, as has been said, a virtual abdication. Before such a tribunal the Prophet whom they called in question might well refuse to plead. There was, indeed, no need to answer. For those who were not wilfully blind and deaf, the words that He had spoken, the works which He had done, the sinless life which He had led, were proofs of an authority from God.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">We cannot tell;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">we know not</span>; Vulgate, <span class="accented">nescimus</span>. The Authorized Version seems, at first sight, to be intended to give a false emphasis to "tell" in Christ's answer; but our translators often render the verb <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span> in this way (see <a href="/john/3-8.htm">John 3:8</a>; <a href="/john/8-14.htm">John 8:14</a>; <a href="/john/16-18.htm">John 16:18</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/12-2.htm">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>). The questioners could find no way out of the dilemma in which Christ's unerring wisdom had placed them. Their evasive answer was a confession of defeat, and that in the presence of the gaping crowd who stood around listening to the conversation. They had every opportunity of judging the character of John's mission and that of Christ; it was their duty to form an opinion and to pronounce a verdict on such claims; and yet they, the leaders and teachers of Israel, for fear of compromising themselves, evade the obligation, refuse to solve or even to entertain the question, and, like a modern agnostic, content themselves with a profession of ignorance. Many people, to avoid looking a disagreeable truth in the face, respond to all appeals with the stereotyped phrase, "We cannot tell." F.M. appositely quotes the comment of Donatus on Terent., 'Eunuch.,' 5:4, 31, "Perturbatur Parmeno; nec negare potuit, nec consentire volebat; sed quasi defensionis loco dixit, <span class="accented">Nescio</span>." <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>And he said unto them;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">he also said unto them</span>. The Lord answers the thought which had dictated their words to him. <span class="cmt_word">Neither tell I you,</span> etc. With such double-minded men, who could give no clear decision concerning the mission of such a one as John the Baptist, it would be mere waste of words to argue further. They would not accept his testimony, and recognizing their malice and perversity, he declined to instruct them further. "Christ shows," says Jerome, "that they knew and were unwilling to answer; and that he knew, but held his peace, because they refused to utter what they well knew." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(apokrithentes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to Jesus,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Dative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;We do not know.&#8221;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7988;&#948;&#945;&#956;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oidamen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 1st Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1492.htm">Strong's 1492: </a> </span><span class="str2">To know, remember, appreciate. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Neither</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#8016;&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(Oude)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3761.htm">Strong's 3761: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neither, nor, not even, and not.
