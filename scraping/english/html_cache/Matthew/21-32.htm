His "way of righteousness" refers to his call for repentance and preparation for the coming Messiah. John&#8217;s lifestyle and message were consistent with the prophetic tradition, emphasizing moral integrity and spiritual renewal. His ministry fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, "A voice of one calling in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.'" John's baptism of repentance was a symbolic act pointing to the need for inner transformation.<p><b>and you did not believe him</b><br>The religious leaders, particularly the Pharisees and Sadducees, rejected John's message despite his clear alignment with Old Testament prophecies. Their disbelief was not due to a lack of evidence but rather a hardened heart and unwillingness to acknowledge their need for repentance. This rejection is a recurring theme in the Gospels, where the religious elite often fail to recognize God's messengers.<p><b>but the tax collectors and prostitutes did</b><br>Tax collectors and prostitutes were considered social outcasts and sinners in Jewish society. Their acceptance of John's message highlights the theme of God's grace and the reversal of human expectations. These individuals, aware of their sinfulness, were more open to repentance and transformation. This echoes Jesus' teaching that "the last will be first, and the first will be last" (<a href="/matthew/20-16.htm">Matthew 20:16</a>), emphasizing that God's kingdom is accessible to all who repent, regardless of their past.<p><b>And even after you saw this</b><br>The religious leaders witnessed the transformation in the lives of those who accepted John's message. This visible change should have served as a powerful testimony to the truth of John's ministry and the authenticity of his call to repentance. The leaders' continued disbelief, despite this evidence, underscores their spiritual blindness and resistance to God's work.<p><b>you did not repent and believe him</b><br>Repentance and belief are central themes in the New Testament, representing a turning away from sin and a turning towards God. The religious leaders' failure to repent and believe John is indicative of their broader rejection of Jesus, whom John heralded. This phrase serves as a warning about the dangers of spiritual pride and the importance of humility in recognizing and responding to God's truth. The call to repentance is a consistent message throughout Scripture, urging individuals to align their lives with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A prophet who came "in the way of righteousness," calling people to repentance and preparing the way for Jesus Christ.

In relation to the preaching of the Baptist, the scribes and Pharisees were like the first of the two sons in his defiant refusal; they were not like him in his subsequent repentance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For John came unto you.</span> This gives the reason for Christ's assertion at the end of the last verse. John came with a special call to the rulers of the people, and they made some show of interest, by sending a deputation to demand his credentials, and by coming to his baptism; but that was all. They did not alter their lives or change their faulty opinions at his preaching, though they "were willing for a season to rejoice in his light" (<a href="/john/5-35.htm">John 5:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the way of righteousness.</span> In that path of strict obedience to law, and of ascetic holiness, which you profess to regard so highly. If they had followed the path which John indicated, they would have attained to righteousness and salvation. John preached Christ who is "the Way" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). (For "way," meaning doctrine, religious tenet and practice, see <a href="/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16</a>; <a href="/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>; <a href="/acts/19-9.htm">Acts 19:9, 23</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-21.htm">2 Peter 2:21</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Ye believed him not,</span> to any practical purpose, even as it is said elsewhere (<a href="/luke/7-30.htm">Luke 7:30</a>), "The Pharisees and the lawyers rejected for themselves the counsel of God, not having been baptized of him." Those who did receive his baptism were the exception; the great majority stood aloof. <span class="cmt_word">Believed him.</span> Though these sinners may have first rejected him, yet his preaching softened their hearts; they repented, confessed their sins, and were baptized (see for examples, <a href="/luke/3-10.htm">Luke 3:10</a>, etc.; Luke 7:29). This was another call to the Pharisees to go and do likewise. <span class="cmt_word">When ye had seen it;</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the fruits of true repentance in these sinners, which conversion was indeed a loud appeal to the rulers to consider their own ways, and to bow to God's hand. <span class="cmt_word">Repented not</span> (see ver. 29). They profited not by this miracle of grace. <span class="cmt_word">That ye might believe him.</span> The end and result of repentance would be to believe in John's mission, and to attend to his teaching. Christ offers the above explanation of the parable (vers. 31, 32) in view of the purpose for which he uttered it. It has been, and may be, taken in different senses, and in wider application. "What is set forth in individual cases is but a sample of what takes place in whole classes of persons, and even nations" (I. Williams). Many expositors consider the two sons to represent Gentiles and Jews; the former making no profession of serving God, and yet in time being converted and turning to him; the latter making much outward show of obedience, yet in reality denying him and rejecting salvation. It is obvious that such explanation is allowable, and coincides with the letter of the parable; but it does not satisfy the context, and fails in not answering to Christ's intention in uttering this similitude. Others see herein a picture of what happens in Christian lands, and is the experience of every Christian minister - how the irreligious and apparently irreclaimable are by God's grace brought, to repentance unto life; how the seemingly pious often make much show, but fall away, or bring no fruit unto perfection. And as the parable involves a general principle, so it may be applied universally to those who make great professions of religion, and are for a time full of good resolutions, but in practice fall very short; and to those who have been the slaves of lust, covetousness, or some other wickedness, but have been recovered from the snares of the devil, and have learned to lead a godly, righteous, and sober life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
