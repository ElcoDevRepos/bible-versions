These "loads" symbolize the numerous rules and regulations that were difficult to follow, creating a spiritual burden. In the context of first-century Judaism, the Law was central to religious life, but the added traditions made it cumbersome. This reflects the broader biblical theme of legalism versus grace, as seen in passages like <a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>, where Paul speaks of freedom in Christ.<p><b>and lay them on men&#8217;s shoulders</b><br>The imagery of laying burdens on shoulders suggests an oppressive weight, highlighting the leaders' lack of compassion. In ancient times, physical burdens were often carried on the shoulders, making this a vivid metaphor for spiritual and moral obligations. This practice contrasts with Jesus' invitation in <a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>, where He offers rest and an easy yoke, emphasizing His role as the compassionate shepherd who guides rather than oppresses.<p><b>but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them</b><br>This critique underscores the hypocrisy of the religious leaders, who did not practice what they preached. They were more concerned with appearances and maintaining authority than with genuine spiritual leadership. This behavior is reminiscent of <a href="/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a>, where the shepherds of Israel are condemned for neglecting their flock. Jesus, in contrast, exemplifies the true servant-leader, as seen in <a href="/john/13-14.htm">John 13:14-15</a>, where He washes the disciples' feet, demonstrating humility and service.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, addressing the crowds and His disciples about the hypocrisy of the Pharisees and teachers of the law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the law and traditions, often criticized by Jesus for their hypocrisy and legalism.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/teachers_of_the_law.htm">Teachers of the Law (Scribes)</a></b><br>Experts in the Mosaic Law who were responsible for teaching and interpreting the law to the people, often associated with the Pharisees.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where Jesus delivered this discourse, a central place for Jewish religious life and the location of the Temple.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd_and_disciples.htm">The Crowd and Disciples</a></b><br>The audience to whom Jesus was speaking, including His followers and the general public who were listening to His teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/h/hypocrisy_in_leadership.htm">Hypocrisy in Leadership</a></b><br>Leaders should practice what they preach.

Here it finds distinct expression. That it appealed to the witness which men's hearts were bearing, secretly or openly, we see from St. Peter's confession in <a href="/acts/15-10.htm" title="Now therefore why tempt you God, to put a yoke on the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?">Acts 15:10</a>.<p><span class= "bld">They themselves will not move . . .</span>--The rigorous precepts, the high-flown morality were for others, not themselves.

The last epithet, which is very uncommon (<a href="/luke/11-46.htm">Luke 11:46</a>), is omitted by some manuscripts and versions, but it is probably genuine here. The burdens are the minute regulations and prescriptions, the vexatious restrictions, the innumerable traditional observances with which these teachers had garbled and defaced the written Law. We have noticed some of these glosses in the matter of the sabbath and ceremonial purification; and these are only specimens of a system which extended to every relation of life, and to all details of religious practice, binding one rule to another, enforcing useless and absurd minutiae, till the burden became insupportable. Alford considers that not human traditions and observances are signified by the "burdens," but the severity of the Law, the weighty duties inculcated therein, which they enforce on others, but do not observe. It may, however, well be doubted whether Christ would ever have termed the legitimate rites and ceremonies of the Law unbearable burdens, though their rigorous enforcement by men who regarded only the letter, while they had lost the spirit, would naturally deserve censure. (If the epithet is not genuine, of course this remark does not apply.) What Christ denounced was not the Law itself, however severe and grievous to human nature, or even immemorial tradition, but the false inferences and deductions therefrom, leading to injunctions insupportable and impracticable. <span class="cmt_word">Will not move them with one of their fingers;</span> <span class="accented">with their finger.</span> This does not imply (and it would not be true) that the rabbis themselves were all hypocrites, and broke or evaded the Law with impunity. We know that they scrupulously attended to all outward observances. What is meant is that they take no trouble to lighten (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to move away"), to make these burdens easier by explanation or relaxation, or to proportion them to the strength of the disciple. They impose them with all their crushing weight and severity upon others, and uncompromisingly demand obedience to these unscriptural regulations, putting "a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear" (<a href="/acts/15-10.htm">Acts 15:10</a>; <a href="/galatians/5-1.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>). Contrast with this the Christian's service: "My yoke is easy," says Christ, "and my burden is light" (ch. 11:33). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/23-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They tie up</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#949;&#963;&#956;&#949;&#973;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(desmeuousin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1195.htm">Strong's 1195: </a> </span><span class="str2">To bind, put in chains, tie together.
