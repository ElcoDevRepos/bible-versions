The "potter's field" was likely a piece of land used by potters to extract clay, rendering it unsuitable for agriculture. It was bought to serve as a burial place for foreigners, highlighting the theme of redemption and the use of something tainted for a purpose of mercy. This act fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>, where the thirty pieces of silver are cast to the potter in the house of the Lord. The field's purchase with blood money underscores the gravity of Judas's betrayal and the religious leaders' complicity.<p><b>as the Lord had commanded me.</b><br>This phrase indicates divine orchestration and fulfillment of prophecy. The reference to the Lord's command can be seen as a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, specifically in Zechariah, where the prophet is instructed by God regarding the thirty pieces of silver. This connection emphasizes the sovereignty of God in the events leading to Jesus's crucifixion, showing that even acts of betrayal and injustice are woven into God's redemptive plan.

This shows how even their attempt to distance themselves from guilt became part of God&#8217;s plan (<a href="/genesis/50-20.htm">Genesis 50:20</a>; <a href="/proverbs/16-9.htm">Proverbs 16:9</a>).<p>&#8226; The money was Judas&#8217;s wage for betraying Jesus (<a href="/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>). <a href="/exodus/21-32.htm">Exodus 21:32</a> lists thirty shekels as the price for a slave&#8212;highlighting how cheaply Christ was valued.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/1-18.htm">Acts 1:18&#8211;19</a> retells the purchase, calling the place &#8220;Akeldama.&#8221; Luke&#8217;s detail confirms Matthew&#8217;s account, underscoring Scripture&#8217;s internal harmony.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for the potter&#8217;s field</b><p>&#8226; A &#8220;potter&#8217;s field&#8221; was likely land exhausted by clay digging&#8212;cheap, scarred, and suited only for burying strangers (<a href="/matthew/27-7.htm">Matthew 27:7</a>).
