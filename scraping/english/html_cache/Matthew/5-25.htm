In the cultural context of first-century Judea, disputes were often settled outside of court to avoid lengthy and costly legal proceedings. The principle of reconciliation is deeply rooted in biblical teachings, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/25-8.htm">Proverbs 25:8-10</a>, which advises settling matters privately. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of peace and forgiveness, as seen in <a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>, which encourages living at peace with everyone.<p><b>while you are still on the way to court</b><br>The imagery of being "on the way to court" suggests a limited time frame for reconciliation. In ancient times, legal disputes were often settled en route to the judge, reflecting a cultural practice of resolving issues before they escalated. This phrase underscores the importance of addressing grievances promptly, echoing <a href="/ephesians/4-26.htm">Ephesians 4:26</a>, which advises not letting the sun go down on anger.<p><b>Otherwise, he may hand you over to the judge</b><br>This warning highlights the potential consequences of failing to reconcile. In the historical context, a judge had the authority to decide legal matters, and being handed over to one could result in severe penalties. The phrase serves as a cautionary reminder of the importance of taking responsibility for one's actions and seeking resolution before external authorities intervene.<p><b>and the judge may hand you over to the officer</b><br>The "officer" refers to a court official responsible for enforcing the judge's decisions. In the Roman legal system, officers ensured that judgments were carried out, often involving imprisonment or fines. This step in the process illustrates the escalating severity of unresolved disputes and the loss of control over one's fate once the legal system is involved.<p><b>and you may be thrown into prison</b><br>Imprisonment was a common consequence for debtors or those who failed to comply with legal judgments in ancient times. This final outcome serves as a stark warning of the personal and social ramifications of unresolved conflict. It reflects the broader biblical principle of justice and the importance of maintaining right relationships, as seen in passages like <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>, which calls for justice, mercy, and humility.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adversary.htm">Adversary</a></b><br>Represents someone with whom you have a conflict or dispute.

Do not let the sun set upon your anger,&#8221; and <a href="/proverbs/6-2.htm">Proverbs 6:2-3</a> speaks of hurrying to humble oneself and plead with an offended neighbor.<p>&#8226; The initiative belongs to the believer, even if the other party is at fault (see <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm">Matthew 18:15</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a> adds, &#8220;If it is possible on your part, live at peace with everyone.&#8221; Speed matters because unresolved hostility breeds bitterness and invites greater consequences.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>while you are still on the way to court</b><p>The scene unfolds &#8220;on the way&#8221; to an earthly tribunal, but it also pictures life&#8217;s journey toward God&#8217;s final judgment.<p>&#8226; There is still time to act; once the courtroom door closes, options disappear. <a href="/luke/12-58.htm">Luke 12:58</a> (parallel passage) echoes, &#8220;As you are going with your adversary to the magistrate, make every effort to reconcile with him on the way.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a> reminds us, &#8220;Now is the time of favor; now is the day of salvation,&#8221; and <a href="/hebrews/3-13.htm">Hebrews 3:13</a> warns against hardening hearts &#8220;as long as it is called &#8216;Today.&#8217;&#8221;<p>&#8226; The lesson: do not wait for a crisis setting to seek peace or forgiveness&#8212;handle it before matters escalate.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Otherwise, he may hand you over to the judge</b><p>Failure to make things right allows the offended party to invoke higher authority.<p>&#8226; In human terms, that means lawsuits and court rulings; spiritually, it points to standing before the Lord, &#8220;the Judge&#8230;at the door&#8221; (<a href="/james/5-9.htm">James 5:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Unconfessed sins and broken relationships will not stay private; they rise to the level of God&#8217;s perfect justice (<a href="/hebrews/10-30.htm">Hebrews 10:30-31</a>).<p>&#8226; The adversary&#8217;s action becomes a sober wake-up call: delay invites judgment that could have been avoided through humble reconciliation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and the judge may hand you over to the officer</b><p>Once a verdict is rendered, enforcement follows.<p>&#8226; Courts do not merely declare guilt; they assign officers to carry out sentences (cf. <a href="/matthew/18-34.htm">Matthew 18:34</a>, where the unforgiving servant was &#8220;turned&#8230;over to the jailers&#8221;).<p>&#8226; <a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a> pictures the ultimate scene: &#8220;The dead were judged according to their deeds.&#8221; There is no plea-bargaining after judgment is pronounced.<p>&#8226; Jesus underscores that consequences move forward in a chain reaction no one can stop once the initial opportunity for peace is ignored.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you may be thrown into prison</b><p>The climax is incarceration&#8212;literal for earthly courts, eternal for the unrepentant.<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/12-59.htm">Luke 12:59</a> concludes, &#8220;I tell you, you will not get out until you have paid the very last penny,&#8221; emphasizing a debt that must be satisfied.<p>&#8226; Hell is a real, conscious punishment for those who cling to sin (<a href="/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-15.htm">Revelation 20:15</a>).

Delay hands control to earthly courts and, more seriously, exposes us to God&#8217;s unrelenting justice. Swift reconciliation is not optional; it is the wise, obedient path that honors the Lord and delivers us from consequences we may otherwise face both now and forever.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Agree with thine adversary.</span>--The imagery is changed, and returns to that of human tribunals, which has met us in <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.">Matthew 5:22</a>. The man whom we have wronged appears as the "adversary," the prosecutor bringing his charge against us. The impulse of the natural man at such a time, even if conscious of wrong, is to make the best of his case, to prevaricate, to recriminate. The truer wisdom, Christ teaches, is to "agree"--better, <span class= "ital">to be on good terms with</span>--show our own good will, and so win his. The whole teaching, it is obvious, is addressed to one who <span class= "ital">has</span> done wrong. The treatment of a false charge involves different considerations.<p><span class= "bld">The officer.</span>--In this case, the officer of the court, the gaoler.<p>In the application of the words, the judge is clearly God, and the officers, those (angels or others) who execute His judgment, and the "adversary," those whom we have wronged, leaving the wrong unredressed. In <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm" title="Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:">1Peter 5:8</a> the devil is described as the great "adversary," and that meaning is, perhaps, not excluded, though it is not prominent, here. Any evil deed becomes in the end as an accusing Satan, bearing its witness against us; and Satan himself is the embodiment of all such accusers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25, 26.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="/luke/12-58.htm">Luke 12:58, 59</a>. The question of the relation of the two passages, as regards both language and original connexion, is exceedingly difficult. As to the former, the verbal differences seem to be such as would hardly have been made on purpose, and to be rather due to memory; yet the agreement is too minute to be the result of memory of a Gospel only oral. Perhaps memory of a document best satisfies the conditions. As to the original connexion of the verses, they, especially ver. 26, can hardly have been spoken twice. Most critics suppose that St. Luke gives them in their proper context; but if so, it is curious that two of his words, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, seem to recall our preceding ver. 24. One word might have been a mere coincidence, but hardly two. It is not likely that these words in ver. 24 were derived from <span class="accented">Luke</span>, for this <span class="accented">supposes</span> a double process in St. Matthew's mind, rejecting them from ver. 25 and placing them in ver. 24. It is more natural also to regard the first clause of <a href="/luke/12-58.htm">Luke 12:58</a>, "As... him," as an expansion of the corresponding clause in our ver. 25 rather than this as a compression of that. This apparent reminiscence in Luke of what is given in our vers. 24 and 25a points to the connexion of vers. 24-26 in Matthew being original, and to it having been broken by Luke or by the framer of the source that he used. A further stage in our Lord's warning. A man must not only seek reconciliation with the injured person (ver. 23), and that in preference to fulfilling the holiest service (ver. 24), but he must do so the more because of the danger of postponing reconciliation. It is noteworthy that our Lord in this verse does not define on whose side the cause of the quarrel lies. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Agree with</span>. And that not with a merely formal reconciliation, but reconciliation based on a permanent kindly feeling towards him (<span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). Professor Margoliouth suggests that this is a confirmation of what he thinks is the original text of Ecclus. 18:20, "Before judgment beg off" ('Inaugural Lect.,' p. 23: 1890). <span class="cmt_word">Thine adversary</span>. Primarily the injured brother (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Quickly</span>. For such is not the tendency of the human heart. <span class="cmt_word">Whiles</span>. Delay not in making reconciliation while you have opportunity. Thayer compares <a href="/songs/1-12.htm">Song of Solomon 1:12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art</span>. On the indicative, cf. Winer, &sect; 41. b, 3. 2, a, note (p. 371, trans. 1870). <span class="cmt_word">In the way with him</span>; Revised Version, with the manuscripts, <span class="accented">with him in the way.</span> The right reading implies that the proximity of the persons may perhaps not last throughout "the way." "The way" is the road to the judge, as explained in -Luke. But being on the road to him is here not presented as a possibility (Luke), but as a certainty. For so, in fact, it is. <span class="cmt_word">Lest... the adversary</span> (ver. 26, note) <span class="cmt_word">deliver</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee.</span> Translating from the language of parable to that of fact, it is only if reconciliation has not been made, if the heart is still unforgiving and quarrelsome, that God the Judge will take notice of the offence. <span class="cmt_word">And the judge... to the officer</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x1fc3;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the officer whose duty it was to execute the judge's commands (cf. Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.,' for illustrations). The expression here belongs to the figure; but in <a href="/matthew/13-41.htm">Matthew 13:41</a> similar duties are predicated of the angels. If the figure was derived from the synagogue, the officer would doubtless be the <span class="accented">chazzan</span>, of which, indeed, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> is the technical rendering (cf. Schurer, II. 2. p. 66). <span class="cmt_word">And thou be cast</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>). The future indicative (still dependent on "lest") brings out the reality of the danger (cf. Bishop Lightfoot, on <a href="/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/5-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Reconcile</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#8016;&#957;&#959;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(euno&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2132.htm">Strong's 2132: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be favorable, be kindly-disposed.
