Their trembling indicates the extraordinary nature of the event they witnessed. The "him" refers to the angel of the Lord, whose appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. This reaction underscores the divine power and authority of the angelic presence, which even the most hardened soldiers could not withstand. The fear experienced by the guards is reminiscent of other biblical instances where humans encounter the divine, such as the shepherds' fear at the announcement of Jesus' birth (<a href="/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9</a>).<p><b>and became like dead men</b><br>This phrase suggests that the guards were so overwhelmed by fear that they were immobilized, possibly fainting or being paralyzed. This reaction highlights the supernatural aspect of the resurrection event, as the guards were unable to perform their duty of securing the tomb. The imagery of becoming "like dead men" contrasts with the resurrection of Jesus, who conquered death. This moment fulfills the prophecy of the Messiah's victory over death and foreshadows the ultimate defeat of death and sin. The guards' inability to respond also emphasizes the futility of human efforts against God's sovereign plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_guards.htm">The Guards</a></b><br>Roman soldiers assigned to watch over Jesus' tomb to prevent His disciples from stealing His body.

It would seem, from this expression, that the soldiers were sensible, not only of the earthquake and the movement of the stone, but also of the presence of the heavenly messenger, in this respect differing from the companions of Daniel and St. Paul, who were only partially conscious of the visions beheld by the two saints (see <a href="/daniel/10-7.htm">Daniel 10:7</a>; <a href="/acts/22-9.htm">Acts 22:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Did shake.</span> The verb is cognate with the noun "earthquake;" they were shaken, convulsed with terror. If these were some of the company that had watched the Crucifixion, they were already possessed of some feeling respecting the unearthly nature of the Occupant of the tomb which they were guarding, and had a vague expectation of something that might happen. At any rate, they must have heard the late events discussed by their comrades, and were not without apprehension of a catastrophe. Became as dead men. They fell to the ground in deathlike faintness, and, when they recovered from the trance, fled in terror from the tomb into the city (ver. 11). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/28-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
