This event occurs during the final week of Jesus' life, a time filled with significant teaching and symbolic actions. The fig tree represents Israel, often symbolized by a fig tree in the Old Testament (<a href="/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a>). The disciples' observation highlights their role as witnesses to Jesus' teachings and miracles, preparing them for their future mission.<p><b>they marveled</b><br>The disciples' amazement reflects their growing understanding of Jesus' divine authority. Despite witnessing numerous miracles, they continue to be astonished by His power over nature. This reaction underscores the human tendency to be surprised by the supernatural, even when it aligns with God's revealed character and power.<p><b>and asked, &#8220;How did the fig tree wither so quickly?&#8221;</b><br>Their question indicates a lack of understanding of the symbolic nature of Jesus' actions. The rapid withering of the fig tree serves as a prophetic sign of judgment against unfruitfulness, particularly in the context of Israel's spiritual barrenness. This event foreshadows the coming judgment on Jerusalem and the temple, as Jesus later prophesies in <a href="/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a>.

As he relates the facts, the disciples did not perceive that the fig-tree was withered away till they passed by on the following morning. Peter then remembered what had been said the day before, and, as the spokesman of the rest, drew his Master's attention to the fact. The immediate withering may have been inferred from its completeness when seen, or its beginning may have been noticed by some at the time.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They marvelled, saying.</span> The apostles' remark on the incident was made on the Tuesday, as we learn from St. Mark's more accurate account. After Christ had spoken his malediction, the little band went on their way to Jerusalem, where was performed the cleansing of the temple. On their return to Bethany, if they passed the tree, it was doubtless too dark to observe its present condition, and it was not till the next morning that they noticed what had happened. St. Matthew does not name the apostle who was the mouthpiece of the others in expressing astonishment at the miracle; he is satisfied with speaking generally of "the disciples" (comp. <a href="/matthew/26-8.htm">Matthew 26:8</a> with <a href="/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4</a>). We learn from St. Mark that it was Peter who made the observation recorded, deeply affected by the sight of this instance of Christ's power, and awestruck by the speedy and complete accomplishment of the curse. <span class="cmt_word">How soon is the fig tree withered away!</span> better, <span class="accented">How did the fig tree immediately wither away?</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">Quomodo continue aruit?</span> They saw, but could not comprehend, the effect of Christ's word, and wonderingly inquired how it came to pass. They did not at present realize the teaching of this parabolic act - how it gave solemn warning of the certainty of judgment on the unfruitful Jewish Church, which, hopelessly barren, must no longer cumber the earth. Christ did not help them to understand the typical nature of the transaction. He is not wont to explain in words the spiritual significance of his miracles; the connection between miracle and teaching is left to be inferred, to be brought out by meditation, prayer, faith, and subsequent circumstances. The total rejection of the Jews was a doctrine for which the apostles were not yet prepared; so the Lord, in wisdom and mercy, withheld its express enunciation at this moment. In mercy too he exemplified the sternness and severity of God's judgment by inflicting punishment on an inanimate object, and not on a sentient being; he withered a tree, not a sinful man, by the breath of his mouth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
