Historically, the region around Judea was often embroiled in wars, such as the Roman conquests. The mention of "rumors" suggests not only actual conflicts but also the fear and anxiety that accompany potential threats. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of the world's fallen state and the ongoing spiritual battle. In the Old Testament, wars were often seen as judgments or as part of God's plan (e.g., <a href="/2_chronicles/20-15.htm">2 Chronicles 20:15</a>). The phrase also foreshadows the tumultuous period leading up to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD.<p><b>but see to it that you are not alarmed</b><br>Jesus instructs His followers to maintain peace and trust in God despite external chaos. This echoes the biblical call to faith over fear, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, where God reassures His people of His presence and support. The directive to remain calm is a reminder of the sovereignty of God and the assurance that He is in control, even when circumstances seem dire. It reflects the peace that Jesus offers, as mentioned in <a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>.<p><b>These things must happen</b><br>This phrase underscores the necessity of these events in the divine plan. It suggests that wars and conflicts are part of the unfolding of God's purposes, similar to how the prophets spoke of events that must occur before the coming of the Messiah (e.g., <a href="/daniel/9-26.htm">Daniel 9:26</a>). This inevitability is a reminder of the prophetic nature of Jesus' teachings and the fulfillment of God's promises throughout history.<p><b>but the end is still to come</b><br>Here, Jesus clarifies that these events are not the ultimate conclusion but rather signs pointing towards the end times. This distinction is crucial, as it prevents premature conclusions about the final judgment. The "end" refers to the culmination of history and the establishment of God's kingdom, as prophesied in <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>. This phrase encourages believers to remain vigilant and faithful, understanding that while the world may experience turmoil, God's ultimate plan is yet to be fully realized.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this prophecy, providing insight into future events to His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who seek understanding of end times.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/wars_and_rumors_of_wars.htm">Wars and Rumors of Wars</a></b><br>Events that signify turmoil and conflict, both literal and metaphorical, that will occur before the end times.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/end_times.htm">End Times</a></b><br>The period leading up to the return of Christ, characterized by various signs and tribulations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_of_olives.htm">Mount of Olives</a></b><br>The location where Jesus delivered the Olivet Discourse, which includes this prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/do_not_be_alarmed.htm">Do Not Be Alarmed</a></b><br>Jesus instructs believers not to be frightened by the chaos in the world.

He is not exaggerating; history bears this out from the Roman-Jewish wars (A.D. 66-73) through every century since. Similar wording appears in <a href="/luke/21-9.htm">Luke 21:9</a>, reminding believers that the world&#8217;s turbulence does not catch God off guard. Consider also <a href="/james/4-1.htm">James 4:1-2</a>, which traces wars to the sinful cravings of the human heart. Even now, media headlines echo Christ&#8217;s words, affirming Scripture&#8217;s accuracy.<p>Key takeaways:<p>&#8226; Expect global unrest; it validates, rather than contradicts, God&#8217;s Word.<p>&#8226; Do not confuse continual conflict with God&#8217;s absence; <a href="/psalms/2-1.htm">Psalm 2:1-4</a> shows He remains sovereign while nations rage.<p>&#8226; Recognize the prophetic pattern in <a href="/revelation/6-3.htm">Revelation 6:3-4</a> where the second seal releases a rider who &#8220;takes peace from the earth.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but see to it that you are not alarmed</b><p>The command is clear: &#8220;do not be frightened&#8221; (<a href="/luke/21-9.htm">Luke 21:9</a>).

The forty years that intervened before the destruction of Jerusalem were full of these in all directions; but we may probably think of the words <span class= "ital">as</span> referring specially to wars, actual or threatened, that affected the Jews, such, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> as those of which we read under Caligula, Claudius, and Nero (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xx.</span> 1, 6). The title which the historian gave to his second book, "The Wars of the Jews," is sufficiently suggestive. As the years passed on, the watchword, "Be not troubled," must have kept the believers in Christ calm in the midst of agitation. They were not to think that the end was to follow at once upon the wars which were preparing the way for it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall hear</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). Ye are about, ye are destined, to hear. "Futurum complicatum, <span class="accented">audituri eritis"</span> (Bengel). He addresses the apostles as representatives of the whole body of believers. Wars and rumours of wars; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> wars near at hand, and distant wars of which the rumour only reaches you, but which threaten to approach and menace your peace (cf. <a href="/jeremiah/4-19.htm">Jeremiah 4:19</a>). The peace which reigned at Christ's birth was rudely shattered after his death, though the wars before the destruction of Jerusalem were of no great importance. We hear of an in. tended expedition against Aretas (Josephus, 'Ant.,' 18:05. 3), of one of Caligula against the Jews (ibid., 18:8. 2), both of which, however, came to nothing. Then there were certain insurrections in the reigns of Claudius (ibid., 20:5, 3) and Nero (ibid., 20:8. 6-10). The Roman empire was disturbed; four emperors - Nero, Galba, Otho, and Vitellius - died by violence within a short space of time; the restless Parthians were a continual source of trouble. But these and such-like occurrences do little to exhaust the meaning of Christ's prediction. He is looking forward to a distant future, and sees with prophetic eye the state of warfare which has prevailed from the disruption of the Roman empire, and which shall continue unto the end. <span class="cmt_word">See that ye be not troubled;</span> rather, <span class="accented">see, be ye</span> <span class="accented">not troubled</span>, Look on it all, and yet be not affrighted. <span class="cmt_word">All</span> these things (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">must come to pass.</span> All that I announce is sure to occur, not from any absolute necessity, but because of men's passions and perverseness, which will bring it to pass (see on Matthew 18:7; and <a href="/james/4-1.htm">James 4:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The end is not yet.</span> These signs might lead men to think that the final consummation was close at hand.
