In the context of first-century Jewish culture, a rabbi's authority was highly respected, and disciples were expected to follow their teacher's guidance closely. This obedience is a recurring theme in the Gospels, emphasizing the importance of following Jesus' teachings. The disciples' actions here reflect their trust in Jesus, even when the full significance of His instructions might not have been clear to them at the time. This obedience can be seen as a model for Christian discipleship, where believers are called to follow Christ's commands faithfully.<p><b>and prepared the Passover.</b><br>The preparation of the Passover was a significant task, involving the selection and sacrifice of a lamb, as well as the preparation of unleavened bread and bitter herbs, in accordance with the instructions given in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>. The Passover was a central Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from slavery in Egypt, and it held deep historical and spiritual significance. By preparing the Passover, the disciples were participating in a tradition that pointed to God's salvation and deliverance. This event also foreshadows Jesus' role as the Passover Lamb, whose sacrifice would bring about a new covenant and deliverance from sin, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>, where Paul refers to Christ as "our Passover lamb." The preparation of the Passover thus serves as a type of Christ's redemptive work, fulfilling the prophetic symbolism of the Passover lamb.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is preparing for His final Passover before His crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are tasked with preparing the Passover meal, demonstrating their obedience and trust in His instructions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/passover.htm">Passover</a></b><br>A significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, symbolizing redemption and foreshadowing Jesus' sacrificial death.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events take place, a central location for Jewish worship and the fulfillment of many prophecies.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_upper_room.htm">The Upper Room</a></b><br>The specific place where the Passover meal is prepared and later shared, setting the stage for the Last Supper.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_christ's_commands.htm">Obedience to Christ's Commands</a></b><br>The disciples' actions demonstrate the importance of following Jesus' instructions, even when the full picture is not clear.

The Paschal victim would have to be slain in the courts of the Temple by one of the officiating priests. The lamb so slain would then be roasted, the bitter herbs prepared, and the table set out, and then, as sunset drew near, all would be ready for the Master and His disciples, who formed, on this occasion, the household which were to partake of the Paschal Supper.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Made ready the Passover</span> (see on ver. 17). They got the room ready, provided unfermented bread, wine, bitter herbs, sauce, and some dishes necessary for the feast. They would not eat the Paschal lamb at the legal time tomorrow, so the Lord ordained a commemorative and anticipatory solemnity, in which he appointed a rite which should take the place of the Jewish ceremony. We learn from the other synoptists that the householder was not satisfied with offering Christ and his friends the use of the common hall, which they would have had to share probably with other guests; but he assigned to them his best and most honourable chamber, "a large upper room," already properly arranged and furnished for the feast. Tradition has maintained that this apartment was that afterwards used by the apostles as a place of assembling, and where they received the effusion of the Holy Ghost on the Day of Pentecost. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/26-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
