In the Gospels, Jesus often uses this phrase to introduce important teachings or revelations. It underscores His role as a divine teacher and prophet, whose words carry the weight of truth and divine insight.<p><b>that many will come</b><br>This indicates the inclusivity of the Gospel message. The "many" suggests a large number of people, highlighting the expansive reach of God's kingdom. It points to the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through him (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<p><b>from the east and the west</b><br>This phrase signifies the gathering of people from all over the world, not just from Israel. It reflects the universal scope of the Gospel, breaking the boundaries of ethnicity and geography. In biblical times, "east" and "west" were often used to denote the farthest reaches of the known world, indicating that God's kingdom is open to all.<p><b>to share the banquet</b><br>The banquet is a metaphor for the Messianic feast, a common image in Jewish eschatology representing the joy and fellowship in God's kingdom. It signifies abundance, celebration, and the fulfillment of God's promises. This imagery is also seen in <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a> and <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>, where the feast symbolizes the ultimate communion with God.<p><b>with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</b><br>These patriarchs are central figures in Jewish history and faith, representing the covenantal promises of God. Their mention here underscores the continuity of God's plan from the Old Testament to the New Testament. It also affirms that Gentiles will share in the blessings promised to the descendants of Abraham, as seen in <a href="/galatians/3-29.htm">Galatians 3:29</a>.<p><b>in the kingdom of heaven</b><br>This phrase refers to the reign and rule of God, both in the present spiritual sense and the future eschatological fulfillment. The kingdom of heaven is a central theme in Jesus' teachings, representing the realm where God's will is perfectly done. It is both a present reality and a future hope, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-10.htm">Matthew 6:10</a> and <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1-4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing the faith of a Roman centurion and using this moment to teach about the inclusivity of God's kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/abraham,_isaac,_and_jacob.htm">Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob</a></b><br>The patriarchs of Israel, representing the covenantal promises of God and the heritage of faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_heaven.htm">The Kingdom of Heaven</a></b><br>A central theme in Jesus' teachings, representing the reign and rule of God, both present and future.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/east_and_west.htm">East and West</a></b><br>Symbolic of the Gentiles, indicating the global reach of the Gospel and the inclusion of all nations in God's redemptive plan.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_centurion's_faith.htm">The Centurion's Faith</a></b><br>The event that prompts Jesus' statement, highlighting the faith of a Gentile and foreshadowing the inclusion of non-Jews in the kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/inclusivity_of_the_gospel.htm">Inclusivity of the Gospel</a></b><br>The kingdom of heaven is open to all who have faith, regardless of ethnic or cultural background.

An early" Western" reading is, "in the bosom of Abraham," etc. (cf. <a href="/luke/16-23.htm">Luke 16:23</a>). Probably a traditional form current among Jewish Christians. <span class="cmt_word">But the children</span>; <span class="accented">sons</span> (Revised Version). Those who ought rightfully to enjoy its privileges (<a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>, note). In <a href="/matthew/13-38.htm">Matthew 13:38</a> those so called answer fully to the appellation. <span class="cmt_word">Of the kingdom</span>. "Rather than of the king; since many are in the kingdom, whom notwithstanding the king rejects as traitors; whereas all the children of the king are adopted as co-heirs with his only begotten Son" (Beza, in Ford). This interpretation is attractive, but doubtless false. The Hebrew idiom enables the writer to suggest the idea of the Jews, who are by nature heirs of the Divine kingdom, being notwithstanding excluded (cf <a href="/acts/13-46.htm">Acts 13:46</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Shall be cast out</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">forth</span>); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b2;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (<a href="/matthew/7-4.htm">Matthew 7:4</a>, note). The "Western" reading, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, suggests that they shall go out by their own present act of refusing blessing. <span class="cmt_word">Into</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>outer</span> <span class="cmt_word">darkness</span>. The form of the expression, which comes only in Matthew (<a href="/matthew/22-13.htm">Matthew 22:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-30.htm">Matthew 25:30</a>), points to a double conception; they shall be cast into the darkness, and cast outside the palace within which the feast is going on. Such is the loss in its personal (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) and in its social (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) aspect. <span class="cmt_word">There shall be</span> (Revised Version, <span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>weeping and gnashing of teeth</span>. The article, which should strictly be repeated before <span class="accented">gnashing</span>, points to a recognized conception. The phrase occurs (except in the parallel passage, <a href="/luke/13-28.htm">Luke 13:28</a>) only in St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/13-42.htm">Matthew 13:42, 50</a>; <a href="/matthew/22-13.htm">Matthew 22:13</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-51.htm">Matthew 24:51</a>; <a href="/matthew/25-30.htm">Matthew 25:30</a>), in each case contrasting the place into which the wicked are sent with that which they might have enjoyed. Observe the description of "hell" - absence of spiritual light; separation from the company of the saved; lamentation; impotent rage.
