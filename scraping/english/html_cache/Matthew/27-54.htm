Roman soldiers were tasked with maintaining order and ensuring the execution was carried out. The presence of the centurion and his men highlights the Roman involvement in Jesus' death, fulfilling the prophecy of the Messiah being "pierced" (<a href="/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>). The centurion's role underscores the historical reality of Roman occupation in Judea during this period.<p><b>saw the earthquake and all that had happened</b><br>The earthquake is a significant event, symbolizing divine intervention and the cosmic impact of Jesus' death. Earthquakes in biblical times often signified God's presence or judgment (<a href="/exodus/19-18.htm">Exodus 19:18</a>, <a href="/1_kings/19-11.htm">1 Kings 19:11</a>). The events surrounding the crucifixion, including darkness and the tearing of the temple veil (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>), indicate the profound spiritual significance of Jesus' sacrifice. These occurrences fulfill Old Testament prophecies and typologies, such as the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<p><b>they were terrified</b><br>The fear experienced by the centurion and his men reflects a recognition of the supernatural nature of the events. In the ancient world, fear was a common response to divine manifestations. This reaction suggests an acknowledgment of a power greater than Rome, challenging their understanding of authority and divinity. The terror also aligns with the biblical theme of the fear of the Lord as the beginning of wisdom (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>).<p><b>and said, &#8220;Truly this was the Son of God.&#8221;</b><br>This declaration is profound, as it comes from a Roman centurion, a Gentile, acknowledging Jesus' divine identity. The title "Son of God" is central to Christian theology, affirming Jesus' unique relationship with the Father and His divine nature. This confession echoes Peter's earlier declaration (<a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>) and fulfills the messianic expectation of a divine savior. The centurion's statement signifies the breaking of barriers between Jew and Gentile, foreshadowing the spread of the Gospel to all nations (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_centurion.htm">The Centurion</a></b><br>A Roman officer in charge of a hundred soldiers, representing the authority of Rome.

Together they represent the Gentile world looking on.<p>&#8226; Earlier, soldiers had mocked Jesus (<a href="/matthew/27-27.htm">Matthew 27:27-31</a>). Now one of their leaders is about to testify to Him.<p>&#8226; Mark&#8217;s parallel notes, &#8220;When the centurion, who stood facing Him, saw how He breathed His last, he said, &#8216;Truly this man was the Son of God&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/mark/15-39.htm">Mark 15:39</a>), reinforcing that multiple witnesses reached the same conclusion.<p>&#8226; Luke mentions the centurion &#8220;glorified God&#8221; (<a href="/luke/23-47.htm">Luke 23:47</a>), showing that this insight was more than curiosity&#8212;it was worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who were guarding Jesus</b><p>These men had one job: keep the condemned secure until death.

As reported by St. Matthew and St. Mark (<a href="/mark/15-39.htm" title="And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.">Mark 15:39</a>), the words probably meant little more than that. We must interpret them from the stand-point of the centurion's knowledge, not from that of Christian faith, and to him the words "Son of God" would convey the idea of one who was God-like in those elements of character which are most divine--righteousness, and holiness, and love. The form of expression was naturally determined by the words which he had heard bandied to and fro as a taunt (<a href="/matthew/27-43.htm" title="He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him: for he said, I am the Son of God.">Matthew 27:43</a>); and the centurion felt that the words, as he understood them, were true, and not false, of the Sufferer whose death he had witnessed. That the words might have such a sense in the lips even of a devout Jew, we find in the language of a book probably contemporary, and possibly written with some remote reference to our Lord's death--the so-called <span class= "ital">Wisdom of Solomon</span> (Wisd. ii. 13, 16-18). In the last of these verses, it will be noted, the terms "just man" and "son of God" appear as interchangeable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 54.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The centurion, and they that were with him.</span> The officer with the small body of soldiers appointed to perform and take charge of the Crucifixion. St. Matthew relates the impression which these events made upon the soldiers' minds. <span class="cmt_word">Saw those things that were done.</span> Instead of this reading, which has high authority, Alford, Tischendorf, Westcott and Hort read, "that were being done," as the Vulgate, <span class="accented">quae fiebant.</span> This would point especially to the loud cry, in accordance with the words of St. Mark, "saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost." But there is no sufficient reason for altering the Received Text; and plainly it was not merely the closing incident that affected the soldiers, but the whole course of events which they witnessed. They saw the darkness, the earthquake, the rending of the rocks, the Divine meekness of the Sufferer; they heard his last words, his loud cry, and marked his patient death. All these things contributed to their awe and fear. <span class="cmt_word">They feared greatly</span>. This crucified Man must be something more than human, for all these wonders to accompany his death: will he not visit upon us our part in his crucifixion? Have we nothing to fear from his vengeance? Some such course their apprehensions may have taken. But they learned something beyond selfish dread of possible danger. <span class="cmt_word">Truly this was the Son</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, anarthrous, Son) <span class="cmt_word">of God;</span> or, according to St. Luke, "Certainly this was a righteous Man." They recognized his innocence, and acknowledged that he suffered unjustly. What the centurion meant (for the words appear to have been his) by calling him "Son of God" is more doubtful. It may have been on his lips merely an affirmation that Jesus was holy and beloved by God; but more probably it meant much more than this. He knew that Christ claimed to be the Son of God, and in this hour of overwhelming awe he felt that the claim was just, whatever it might mean. This crucified Person was at least a hero or a demigod, or that which the words would imply in a Jewish sense, though he knew only imperfectly what was signified thereby. Tradition affirms that the centurion's name was Longinus, that he became a devoted follower of Christ, preached the faith, and died a martyr's death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-54.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
