It underscores the importance of the message, as it is intended for those who are committed to learning from Him. The context is crucial, as this teaching follows Peter's confession of Jesus as the Messiah and Jesus' prediction of His suffering and death (<a href="/matthew/16-13.htm">Matthew 16:13-23</a>). This setting highlights the gravity of discipleship and the cost associated with following Jesus.<p><b>If anyone wants to come after Me</b><br>This invitation is open to "anyone," suggesting that discipleship is not limited to the twelve apostles but is available to all who desire to follow Jesus. The phrase "come after Me" implies a pursuit or a journey, indicating that following Jesus is an active, ongoing process. It reflects the call to a personal relationship with Christ, where the follower seeks to emulate His life and teachings.<p><b>he must deny himself</b><br>Denying oneself involves a conscious decision to set aside personal desires, ambitions, and comforts in favor of God's will. This concept is counter-cultural, especially in a society that often prioritizes self-fulfillment and individualism. Biblically, it echoes the call to humility and submission found in passages like <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-8</a>, where Jesus' own humility and obedience are highlighted. It is a call to prioritize spiritual values over worldly ones.<p><b>and take up his cross</b><br>The cross, a Roman instrument of execution, symbolizes suffering, sacrifice, and ultimately, death. For Jesus' original audience, this imagery would have been stark and shocking, as crucifixion was a common yet brutal form of punishment. Taking up one's cross signifies a willingness to endure hardship and persecution for the sake of Christ. It is a call to embrace the challenges and sacrifices inherent in living a life devoted to Jesus, as seen in passages like <a href="/galatians/2-20.htm">Galatians 2:20</a>, where Paul speaks of being "crucified with Christ."<p><b>and follow Me</b><br>Following Jesus involves more than just intellectual assent; it requires action and commitment. This phrase calls for a lifestyle that mirrors Jesus' own, characterized by love, service, and obedience to God's commands. It is an invitation to walk in the footsteps of Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/2-21.htm">1 Peter 2:21</a>, where believers are called to follow His example. This path may lead to suffering and sacrifice, but it also promises eternal life and fellowship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is instructing His disciples on the cost of discipleship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all who choose to follow Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/cross.htm">Cross</a></b><br>A symbol of suffering, sacrifice, and the ultimate commitment to the path of Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/self-denial.htm">Self-denial</a></b><br>The act of putting aside personal desires and ambitions to follow Jesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/following_jesus.htm">Following Jesus</a></b><br>The call to live a life modeled after Christ, embracing His teachings and example.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_self-denial.htm">Understanding Self-Denial</a></b><br>Self-denial involves prioritizing God's will over personal desires.

The cost of confessing Christ is now spelled out.<p>&#8226; Because all Scripture is true and living (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>), this moment remains just as binding and relevant today.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>If anyone wants to come after Me</b><p>The invitation is universal&#8212;&#8220;anyone.&#8221; No one is excluded from the possibility, yet the path is exclusive because it centers on coming after Jesus Himself (<a href="/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Wants&#8221; points to desire.

The teaching as to the unworldliness of His kingdom which the disciples so much needed was to be generalised in its widest possible extent. Those who were following Him, as many did, in idle wonder, or with the desire of earthly greatness, must do so knowing its conditions.<p><span class= "bld">If any man will come after me.</span>--The "will" is more than a mere auxiliary; "<span class= "ital">willeth,"</span> "desireth" to come after.<p><span class= "bld">Let him deny himself, and take up his cross.</span>--Our common thoughts of "self-denial," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the denial <span class= "ital">to</span> ourselves of some pleasure or profit, fall far short of the meaning of the Greek. The man is to deny his whole self, all his natural motives and impulses, so far as they come into conflict with the claims of Christ. If he does not so deny himself, he is in danger, as Peter was (it is significant that the same word is used in both instances), of denying his Lord. The self-denial here commanded has, accordingly, its highest type and pattern in the act by which the Son of God, in becoming man, "emptied Himself (see Note on <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm" title="But made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:">Philippians 2:7</a>) of all that constituted, if we may so speak, the "self" of His divine nature. The words "take up his cross," which the disciples had heard before (see Note on <a href="/matthew/10-38.htm" title="And he that takes not his cross, and follows after me, is not worthy of me.">Matthew 10:38</a>), were now clothed with a new and more distinct meaning, by the words that spoke so clearly of the death of which the cross was to be the instrument.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - St. Mark tells us that Jesus called the multitude unto him together with the disciples, as about to say something of universal application. The connection between this paragraph and what has preceded is well put by St. Chrysostom. <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>. "When? when St. Peter said, 'Be it far from thee: this shall not be unto thee,' and was told, 'Get thee behind me, Satan.' For Christ was by no means satisfied with the mere rebuke of Peter, but, willing more abundantly to show both the extravagance of Peter's words and the future benefit of his Passion, he saith, 'Thy word to me is, "Be it far from thee: this shall not be unto thee;" but my word to thee is, "Not only is it hurtful to thee to impede me and to be displeased at my Passion, but it will be impossible for thee even to be saved, unless thou thyself too be continually prepared for death."' Thus, lest they should think his suffering unworthy of him, not by the former words only, but by those that were coming, he teaches them the gain thereof." <span class="cmt_word">If any man will</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">wills to</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>come after me.</span> To come after Christ is to be his follower and disciple, and the Lord here declares what will be the life of such a one (see a parallel passage, <a href="/matthew/10-38.htm">Matthew 10:38, 39</a>). Jesus mentions three points which belong to the character of a true disciple. The first is self-denial. <span class="cmt_word">Let</span> <span class="cmt_word">him deny himself.</span> There is no better test of reality and earnestness in the religious life than this. (See a sermon of Newman's on this subject, vol. 1. serm. 5.) If a man follows Jesus, it must be by his own free will, and he must voluntarily renounce everything that might hinder his discipleship, denying himself even in things lawful that he may approach the likeness of his Master. <span class="cmt_word">Take up his cross.</span> This is the second point. St. Luke adds, "daily." He must not only be resigned to bear what is brought upon him - suffering, shame, and death, which he cannot escape, but be eager to endure it, meet it with a solemn joy, be glad that he is counted worthy of it. <span class="cmt_word">Follow me.</span> The third point. He must be energetic and active, not passive only and resigned, but with all zeal tracking his Master's footsteps, which lead on the way of sorrows.
