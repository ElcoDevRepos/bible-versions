It occurs after His resurrection, emphasizing His physical presence and the reality of His bodily resurrection. The setting is Galilee, where Jesus had instructed His disciples to meet Him (<a href="/matthew/28-10.htm">Matthew 28:10</a>). This moment fulfills His promise to rise again and meet them, reinforcing His reliability and the truth of His words. The act of coming to them signifies His initiative in revealing Himself and His message, highlighting His role as the Good Shepherd who seeks out His followers.<p><b>&#8220;All authority in heaven and on earth</b><br>This declaration of authority is comprehensive, encompassing both the spiritual realm ("in heaven") and the physical realm ("on earth"). It reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the Son of Man is given dominion and glory. This authority is not newly acquired but is now fully realized and manifested through His resurrection. It underscores Jesus' divine nature and His sovereignty over all creation, aligning with <a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>, which speaks of Christ's preeminence in all things. This authority is foundational for the Great Commission that follows, as it legitimizes the disciples' mission to spread the gospel.<p><b>has been given to Me.</b><br>The phrase "has been given" indicates a conferral of authority, suggesting a divine act by God the Father. This aligns with <a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9-11</a>, where God exalts Jesus and gives Him the name above every name. It reflects the completion of Jesus' earthly mission, His obedience unto death, and His subsequent exaltation. The passive construction ("has been given") emphasizes the Father's role in this divine plan, highlighting the unity and cooperation within the Trinity.

If we do this, we lose the great reason for the oft-enjoined meeting on the Galilaean mountain, which seems to have been expressly and with much care arranged to notify at large the fact of Christ's Resurrection and of his supreme authority, and to convey the Lord's commission to the apostles in the presence of many witnesses. We may suppose that Jesus, who had been standing apart, now drew near <span class="cmt_word">to</span> the company, so that all, especially the doubting, might see him closely and hear his familiar voice. <span class="cmt_word">Spake unto them</span> (<span class="greek_word">e)lalhsen au)toi = </span>, <span class="accented">talked unto them</span>). Doubtless he said much more than is here recorded, resolving doubts, confirming faith, infusing comfort. "Thus it is even now; we worship him, and then he draws near, and, by his nearer approaches and secret manifestation of himself to our hearts, we are confirmed in the faith, and see in him God and man" (I. Williams). <span class="cmt_word">All power</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is given (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>, <span class="accented">was given</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>unto me in</span> <span class="cmt_word">heaven and in earth.</span> Jesus here asserts that he, as Son of man, has received from the Father supreme authority in heaven and earth, over the whole kingdom of God in its fullest extent. This is net given to him as Son o! God; for, as God, naught can be added to him or taken from him; it is a power which he has merited by his incarnation, death, and Passion (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8-10</a>), which was foretold in the Old Testament, by psalmist (<a href="/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/8-5.htm">Psalm 8:5-8</a>) and prophet (<a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13, 14</a>), and with which he was indued on the day that he rose victorious from the grave. So the verb "was given" is in the past tense, because it refers to the dotation arranged in God's eternal purpose, and to the actual investiture at the Resurrection. The power is exercised in his mediatorial kingdom, and will continue to be exercised till he hath put all enemies under his feet, and destroyed death itself (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-24.htm">1 Corinthians 15:24-27</a>); but his absolute kingdom is everlasting; as God and Man he reigns forever and ever. This mediatorial authority extends not only over men, so that he governs and protects the Church, disposes bureau events, controls hearts and opinions; but the forces of heaven also are at his command, the Holy Spirit is bestowed by him, the angels are in his employ as ministering to the members of his body. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/28-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(proselth&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4334.htm">Strong's 4334: </a> </span><span class="str2">From pros and erchomai; to approach, i.e. come near, visit, or worship, assent to.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">them</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autois)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
