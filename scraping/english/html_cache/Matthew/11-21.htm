It is mentioned in the Gospels as a place where Jesus performed many of His miracles. The term "woe" is a pronouncement of judgment and lament, indicating the seriousness of the situation. The use of "woe" here reflects the prophetic tradition of the Old Testament, where prophets would pronounce judgment on cities or nations that turned away from God (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8-23</a>). The archaeological remains of Chorazin include a synagogue, which suggests it was a significant Jewish community during Jesus' time.<p><b>Woe to you, Bethsaida!</b><br>Bethsaida was another town near the Sea of Galilee, known as the hometown of several of Jesus' disciples, including Peter, Andrew, and Philip (<a href="/john/1-44.htm">John 1:44</a>). Like Chorazin, Bethsaida witnessed many of Jesus' miracles, yet the people did not respond with repentance. The repeated "woe" emphasizes the gravity of their unrepentance. Bethsaida's location and its connection to the disciples highlight the personal nature of Jesus' lament, as He had close ties to the community.<p><b>For if the miracles that were performed in you</b><br>The miracles refer to the signs and wonders Jesus performed, which were meant to authenticate His divine authority and message. These acts included healing the sick, casting out demons, and other supernatural events. The miracles were a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>) and served as a call to repentance and faith.<p><b>had been performed in Tyre and Sidon,</b><br>Tyre and Sidon were ancient Phoenician cities known for their wealth and commerce. In the Old Testament, they were often associated with paganism and idolatry (<a href="/ezekiel/28-2.htm">Ezekiel 28:2-8</a>). Despite their reputation, Jesus suggests that these Gentile cities would have responded more favorably to His miracles than the Jewish towns of Chorazin and Bethsaida. This comparison underscores the hardness of heart in the Jewish communities that had direct access to Jesus' ministry.<p><b>they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</b><br>Sackcloth and ashes were traditional symbols of mourning and repentance in Jewish culture (<a href="/jonah/3-5.htm">Jonah 3:5-6</a>). The imagery indicates a deep, genuine turning away from sin and toward God. The reference to Tyre and Sidon's hypothetical repentance serves as a rebuke to Chorazin and Bethsaida, highlighting their failure to recognize and respond to the presence of the Messiah. This statement also foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in the Kingdom of God, as seen in the early church's mission to the Gentiles (<a href="/acts/10-45.htm">Acts 10:45</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chorazin.htm">Chorazin</a></b><br>A town in Galilee where Jesus performed many miracles.

By comparing them with Tyre and Sidon&#8212;Gentile cities historically condemned&#8212;He highlights that greater revelation demands greater response. Genuine repentance, pictured by sackcloth and ashes, was absent in these Galilean communities, demonstrating that exposure to truth without obedience invites severe accountability. The verse calls every reader to heed the signs God provides, turn from sin, and embrace the Savior while the opportunity remains.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida!</span>--It is singular enough that no miracles are recorded in the Gospels as wrought at either of these cities. The latter was indeed nigh unto the scene of the feeding of the five thousand, but that comes later on in the Gospel narrative. The former is only known to us through this passage and the parallel words of <a href="/context/luke/10-12.htm" title="But I say to you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.">Luke 10:12-16</a>. We may at least infer from the absence of any such record the genuineness of the words reported and the truthful aim of the Evangelists. The words were not an after-thought dove-tailed into the narrative. The narrative was not expanded or modified in order to explain the words. In St. Luke the "woes" are connected with the mission of the Seventy. They may well have been uttered, as has been said above, more than once.<p>The position of Chorazin is described by Jerome as being on the shore of the lake, about two miles from Capernaum.<p>The Bethsaida here spoken of was probably that on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. The name in Aramaic signifies "House of Fish;" and it was therefore, we may believe, on the shore, and not far from the two cities with which it is here grouped.<p><span class= "bld">Tyre and Sidon.</span>--The two cities are chosen as being, next to Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="/matthew/10-15.htm" title="Truly I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.">Matthew 10:15</a>, and <a href="/matthew/11-24.htm" title="But I say to you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for you.">Matthew 11:24</a>), the great representative instances of the evil of the heathen world, and of the utter overthrow to which that evil was destined (Ezekiel 27, 28). Over and above their immediate import the words are full of meaning as throwing light on the ultimate law of God's dealings with the heathen world. Men are judged not only according to what they have done, but according to what they might or would have done under other circumstances and conditions of life. In other words, they are judged according to their opportunities. The whole teaching of St. Paul in Romans 2, all the wider hopes of later times as to the future of mankind, are but the development of the truth partly declared and partly suggested here.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Woe unto thee, Chorazin</span>.
