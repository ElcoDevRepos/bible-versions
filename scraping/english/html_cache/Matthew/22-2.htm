The "kingdom of heaven" refers to God's sovereign rule and the spiritual realm where His will is fulfilled. The "king" symbolizes God the Father, who holds ultimate authority and power. In biblical times, a king was the highest authority in the land, representing governance, justice, and provision. This imagery sets the stage for understanding God's nature and His relationship with humanity.<p><b>who prepared a wedding banquet</b><br>The wedding banquet is a metaphor for the joyous and celebratory nature of God's kingdom. In ancient Jewish culture, weddings were significant social events, often lasting several days, symbolizing union and covenant. The preparation of such a banquet indicates careful planning and generosity. This reflects God's desire to invite people into a relationship with Him, offering abundant blessings and eternal joy. The imagery of a banquet is also used in <a href="/isaiah/25-6.htm">Isaiah 25:6</a>, where a feast is prepared for all peoples, symbolizing salvation and divine provision.<p><b>for his son.</b><br>The "son" in this parable represents Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The wedding banquet for the son signifies the union between Christ and His bride, the Church, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a> and <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-9</a>. This highlights the intimate relationship between Christ and believers, emphasizing themes of love, commitment, and eternal fellowship. The preparation of the banquet for the son underscores the Father's love and approval of the Son, as well as the central role of Jesus in God's redemptive plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_heaven.htm">The Kingdom of Heaven</a></b><br>Represents God's sovereign rule and the spiritual realm where His will is fulfilled.

Responding to that invitation&#8212;accepting the grace and lordship of Jesus&#8212;brings us into the present blessings and future fullness of the kingdom of heaven.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Which made a marriage for his son.</span>--The germ of the thought which forms the groundwork of the parable is found, in a passing allusion, in <a href="/luke/12-36.htm" title="And you yourselves like to men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he comes and knocks, they may open to him immediately.">Luke 12:36</a>--"When he shall return from the wedding." Here, for the first time, it appears in a fully developed form. The parable of <a href="/context/luke/14-15.htm" title="And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said to him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.">Luke 14:15-24</a> is not specially connected with the idea of a <span class= "ital">wedding</span> feast. The thought itself rested, in part at least, on the language of the older prophets, who spoke of God as the Bridegroom, and Israel as His bride (<a href="/isaiah/62-5.htm" title="For as a young man marries a virgin, so shall your sons marry you: and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you.">Isaiah 62:5</a>), who thought of the idolatries of Israel as the adultery of the faithless wife (<a href="/context/jeremiah/3-1.htm" title="They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return to her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but you have played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 3:1-4</a>) who had abandoned the love of her espousals (<a href="/jeremiah/2-2.htm" title="Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus said the LORD; I remember you, the kindness of your youth, the love of your espousals, when you went after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown.">Jeremiah 2:2</a>). Here the prominent idea is that of the guests who are invited to the feast. The interpretation of the parable lies, so far, almost on the surface. The king is none other than God, and the wedding is that between Christ and His Church, the redeemed and purified Israel (<a href="/context/revelation/19-7.htm" title="Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honor to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife has made herself ready.">Revelation 19:7-9</a>). We have to remember the truth, which the form of the parable excludes, that the guests themselves, so far as they obey the call, and are clothed in the wedding garment, are, in their collective unity, the Church which is the bride. (Comp. <a href="/context/ephesians/5-23.htm" title="For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body.">Ephesians 5:23-27</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The kingdom of heaven is like</span> (comp. <a href="/matthew/20-1.htm">Matthew 20:1</a>. This parable supplements that of the wicked husbandmen. As that referred to Jewish times, so this refers to gospel times.
