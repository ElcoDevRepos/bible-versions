In the cultural context of first-century Judea, public displays of piety were common, especially among the Pharisees, who were known for their strict adherence to the law and public demonstrations of their faith. Jesus warns against the temptation to seek human approval rather than divine approval. This teaching aligns with the broader biblical theme of God valuing the heart's intentions over outward appearances, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God tells Samuel that He looks at the heart rather than outward appearances. The phrase also echoes the prophetic call for genuine worship found in <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, where God criticizes those who honor Him with their lips while their hearts are far from Him.<p><b>If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.</b><br>This part of the verse introduces the concept of divine reward, contrasting it with earthly recognition. The idea of heavenly reward is a recurring theme in the New Testament, particularly in the teachings of Jesus, who often spoke of storing up treasures in heaven rather than on earth (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-20</a>). The notion of God as a Father who rewards His children is rooted in the Jewish understanding of God as a loving and just parent, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/32-6.htm">Deuteronomy 32:6</a>.

Its excellence had been that it laid stress, as the religion of Islam did afterwards, on the three great duties of the religious life, almsgiving, fasting, and prayer, rather than on sacrifices and offerings. Verbally, Pharisaism accepted on this point the widest and most spiritual teaching of the prophets, and so its home was in the Synagogue rather than the Temple, and it gained a hold on the minds of the people which the priests never gained. But a subtle evil found its way even here. Love of praise and power, rather than spontaneous love, and self-denial, and adoration, was the mainspring of their action, and so that which is the essence of all religion was absent even from the acts in which the purest and highest form of religion naturally shows itself.<p><span class= "bld">Your alms.</span>--The better MSS. give <span class= "ital">righteousness,</span> and obviously with a far truer meaning, as the wider word which branches off afterwards into the three heads of alms, fasting, prayer. In Rabbinic language the whole was often used for the part, and "righteousness" was identified with "mercifulness," and that with giving money. The Greek version of the LXX. often renders the Hebrew word for <span class= "ital">righteousness</span> by "alms." In the New Testament, however, there is no such narrowing of its meaning, and here the full significance of the word is fixed by its use in <a href="/matthew/5-20.htm" title="For I say to you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:20</a>. The reading "alms" probably arose from a misconception of the real meaning of the passage, and the consequent assumption that it simply introduced the rule given in <a href="/context/matthew/6-2.htm" title="Therefore when you do your alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:2-3</a>.<p><span class= "bld">To be seen of them.</span>--It is the motive, and not the fact of publicity, that vitiates the action. The high ideal of the disciple of Christ is to let his light shine "before men" (the self-same words are used in <a href="/matthew/5-16.htm" title="Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 5:16</a> as here), and yet to be indifferent to their praise or even their opinion. In most religious men there is probably a mingling of the two motives, and we dare not say at what precise stage the presence of the lower overpowers the higher. It is enough to remember that it is the little speck which may taint the whole character till it loses all its life.<p><span class= "bld">Of your Father which is in heaven.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">with your Father,</span> as meaning, "in His estimate." The act is not done to and for Him, and therefore (speaking after the manner of men) He looks on it as having no claim to payment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-18.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">relation of our Lord and his disciples to the religion of the day</span> (<span class="accented">continued</span>); <span class="accented">vide</span> <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>, note. (<span class="accented">b</span>) Our Lord turns from cases which could be directly deduced from the Law to those which belonged only to recognized religious duty. Of these he instances three: alms (vers. 2-4), prayer (vers. 5-8, 9-15), fasting (vers. 16-18). It is, indeed, true that the performance of these duties on special occasions was implied in the Pentateuch (<a href="/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12-15</a>); but there are no regulations concerning their observance in ordinary and daily life. These were matters of custom and tradition; to this the <span class="accented">Law</span>, in its original aim and method, did not extend. There was therefore the more need for the Law to be supplemented by the instructions of the Jewish leaders. These our Lord does not reject, but only corrects. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">Take heed</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> [<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span>] (Westcott and Hort). If "but" is genuine, as is on the whole more probable, our Lord places this warning in close relation to the preceding charge. Aim at "perfection," but beware of mere show. Rather you must consider the estimate that will be formed of you by your Father which is in heaven. <span class="cmt_word">That ye do not your alms</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">your righteousness</span> (<span class="accented">so</span> the manuscripts). Although one of the Hebrew words for "righteousness" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5e8;&#x5e7;&#x5d4;</span>) was used especially for the righteousness of almsgiving (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/6-25.htm">Deuteronomy 6:25</a>, LXX.; and 'Psalms of Solomon,' 9:6, where see Professor Ryle's and Mr. James's note), yet it is improbable that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> should here be rendered "alms," because <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> it has this meaning nowhere else in the New Testament; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the word for "alms" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>) comes in the next verse; <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the emphatic position of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>), in contrast to <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span> (ver. 2), points to it being a collective expression of which the various parts are mentioned in the following verses. The form also of the sentence, "<span class="accented">when</span>," etc., at the head of each of the other subjects, (vers. 5,16) shows that these are co-ordinated with ver. 2. <span class="accented">Your</span>; in contrast to that of the typical Jews. The limitation implied in <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, gives a more partial and probably more external meaning to "<span class="accented">righteousness"</span> (cf. <a href="/ezekiel/18-22.htm">Ezekiel 18:22, 24</a>) than is to be seen in the corresponding phrase in <a href="/1_john/2-29.htm">1 John 2:29</a>; <a href="/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>. <span class="cmt_word">To be seen of them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>.
