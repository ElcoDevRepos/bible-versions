It marks the beginning of His public teaching ministry, following His baptism and temptation in the wilderness.<br><br>*Historical and Cultural Context:* In the first-century Jewish context, rabbis often taught their disciples by sitting down and speaking to them directly. This method of teaching was both authoritative and intimate, indicating that Jesus was assuming the role of a rabbi or teacher to His followers.<br><br>*Connections to Other Scripture:* The act of teaching is central to Jesus' ministry. In <a href="/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>, it is noted that Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in synagogues, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. This teaching moment is a continuation of His mission to reveal the nature of God's kingdom.<br><br>*Prophecy and Types of Jesus Christ:* Jesus as a teacher fulfills the prophetic expectation of a new Moses, who would deliver God's law to His people. <a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a> speaks of a prophet like Moses whom God would raise up. Jesus' teaching on the mount echoes Moses receiving the Law on Mount Sinai, but Jesus provides a deeper, spiritual interpretation of the Law.<br><br>*Geographical and Archaeological Insights:* The Sermon on the Mount is traditionally believed to have been delivered on a hillside near Capernaum, by the Sea of Galilee. This location allowed Jesus to address a large crowd, as the natural amphitheater of the hillside would carry His voice to many listeners.<br><br>*Relevance for Today:* This introduction to Jesus' teaching emphasizes the importance of His words and the authority with which He spoke. For believers, it underscores the need to listen to and apply Jesus' teachings in their lives, as they are foundational to understanding the Christian faith and living according to God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who begins to teach.

The same One who has just called fishermen (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>) and healed the sick (<a href="/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>) now speaks with divine authority&#8212;every word trustworthy and true (cf. <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Began&#8221; signals a deliberate, fresh act.

Throughout the Gospels, instruction is central to His mission (<a href="/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>; <a href="/luke/4-15.htm">Luke 4:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Teaching reveals God&#8217;s heart. &#8220;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching&#8221; (<a href="/2_timothy/3-16.htm">2 Timothy 3:16</a>). By teaching, Jesus opens the Scriptures and the kingdom to His listeners.<p>&#8226; Teaching carries authority. The crowd later marvels because &#8220;He taught as one who had authority, and not as their scribes&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-29.htm">Matthew 7:29</a>). This reminds us that discipleship rests on submitting to His authoritative Word.<p>&#8226; Teaching is personal. &#8220;Them&#8221; includes both the newly called disciples and the wider multitude. Jesus meets people where they are, yet calls them higher&#8212;echoing <a href="/deuteronomy/6-1.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1</a>, where God commands that His statutes be taught to His people so &#8220;you may live long in the land,&#8221;.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>saying:</b><p>This final word introduces the content of the Sermon on the Mount.<p>&#8226; What follows is not speculation; it is divine proclamation.
