By calling His followers "the salt of the earth," Jesus emphasizes their role in preserving the moral and spiritual fabric of society. Salt's preservative qualities symbolize the influence Christians are to have in preventing moral decay. This metaphor also suggests purity, as salt was used in sacrifices (<a href="/leviticus/2-13.htm">Leviticus 2:13</a>), indicating the call for believers to live holy lives. The phrase implies a global mission, as "the earth" suggests a universal scope for Christian influence.<p><b>But if the salt loses its savor,</b><br>Salt losing its savor refers to the loss of effectiveness or purpose. In the context of the first century, salt could become contaminated with impurities, rendering it useless. This serves as a warning to believers about the dangers of compromise and losing their distinctiveness. Theologically, it underscores the importance of maintaining one's faith and witness. The idea of losing savor can be connected to spiritual lukewarmness, as warned against in <a href="/revelation/3-16.htm">Revelation 3:16</a>, where the church in Laodicea is criticized for being neither hot nor cold.<p><b>how can it be made salty again?</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights the irreversible nature of losing one's spiritual effectiveness. In the natural world, once salt becomes impure, it cannot be restored to its original state. Spiritually, this suggests the difficulty of regaining one's witness once it has been compromised. It serves as a call to vigilance and perseverance in faith. The impossibility of restoring lost saltiness parallels the warning in <a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4-6</a> about the challenges of renewing repentance after falling away.<p><b>It is no longer good for anything,</b><br>This phrase underscores the seriousness of losing one's spiritual influence. Just as unsavory salt is useless, a believer who fails to live out their faith loses their purpose. This reflects the biblical principle that faith without works is dead (<a href="/james/2-26.htm">James 2:26</a>). The statement serves as a sobering reminder of the consequences of spiritual complacency and the importance of living a life that reflects Christ's teachings.<p><b>except to be thrown out and trampled by men.</b><br>In ancient times, unsavory salt was discarded and used to cover pathways, where it would be trampled underfoot. This imagery conveys the idea of judgment and rejection. Spiritually, it warns of the consequences of failing to fulfill one's calling as a disciple of Christ. The notion of being "trampled by men" can be seen as a metaphor for losing respect and influence in the world. This aligns with the broader biblical theme of judgment for unfaithfulness, as seen in parables like the unfruitful fig tree (<a href="/luke/13-6.htm">Luke 13:6-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, a foundational teaching moment in His ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who are called to live out His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_earth.htm">The Earth</a></b><br>Symbolic of the world and society in which believers live and are called to influence.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/salt.htm">Salt</a></b><br>A metaphor for the influence and preservation that believers are to have in the world.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/men.htm">Men</a></b><br>Represents society at large, which interacts with and observes the lives of believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/preservation_and_influence.htm">Preservation and Influence</a></b><br>Believers are called to preserve the moral and spiritual fabric of society, much like salt preserves food.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/distinctiveness.htm">Distinctiveness</a></b><br>Just as salt is distinct in flavor, Christians are to maintain their distinctiveness in values and conduct.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/warning_against_complacency.htm">Warning Against Complacency</a></b><br>Losing one's "savor" implies a warning against becoming ineffective or indistinguishable from the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_action.htm">Call to Action</a></b><br>This verse is a call to actively engage with the world, bringing the flavor of Christ's teachings into every aspect of life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability.htm">Accountability</a></b><br>The imagery of being "trampled by men" serves as a reminder of the consequences of failing to live out one's faith authentically.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_5_13_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 5:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Be_salt_of_the_earth_daily.htm">How can we be "the salt of the earth" in daily life?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_losing_saltiness_mean.htm">What does losing saltiness symbolize in Matthew 5:13?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Matt_5_13_Col_4_6_on_speech.htm">How does Matthew 5:13 connect with Colossians 4:6 about speech?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_Christians_stay_salty_today.htm">In what ways can Christians maintain their "saltiness" in a secular world?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Why_preserve_distinctiveness_Matt_5_13.htm">Why is it important to preserve our distinctiveness as believers, according to Matthew 5:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_salt_of_the_earth_in_Matt_5_13.htm">What does "salt of the earth" mean in Matthew 5:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/How_do_Christians_lose_saltiness.htm">How can Christians lose their "saltiness" according to Matthew 5:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_salt_a_metaphor_in_Matt_5_13.htm">Why is salt used as a metaphor in Matthew 5:13?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_do_biblical_idioms_shape_todayand#8217;s_christian_language.htm">How do biblical idioms shape modern Christian language?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/should_christians_impose_values.htm">Should Christians impose their values on others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_if_salt_isn't_salty_anymore.htm">What happens when salt loses its saltiness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_'salt_of_the_earth'.htm">What makes someone the salt of the earth?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Matthew 5:13 Mean</div><b>You are the salt of the earth</b><p>Jesus declares, &#8220;You are the salt of the earth&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Salt in Scripture stands for preservation and flavor.

The general reference to this antiseptic action of salt is (as in <a href="/colossians/4-6.htm" title=" Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer every man.">Colossians 4:6</a>, and possibly in the symbolic act of Elisha, <a href="/2_kings/2-21.htm" title="And he went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus said the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from there any more death or barren land.">2Kings 2:21</a>) enough to give an adequate meaning to the words, but the special reference to the sacrificial use of salt in <a href="/mark/9-49.htm" title="For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.">Mark 9:49</a> (see Note there) makes it probable enough that there was some allusion to that thought also here.<p><span class= "bld">If the salt have lost his savour.</span>--The salt commonly used by the Jews of old, as now, came from <span class= "ital">Jebel-Usdum,</span> on the shores of the Dead Sea, and was known as the Salt of Sodom. Maundrell, the Eastern traveller (circ. A.D. 1690), reports that he found lumps of rock-salt there which had become partially flavourless, but I am not aware that this has been confirmed by recent travellers. Common salt, as is well known, will melt if exposed to moisture, but does not lose its saltness. The question is more curious than important, and does not affect the ideal case represented in our Lord's words.<p><span class= "bld">Wherewith shall it be salted?</span>--The words imply a relative if not an absolute impossibility. If gifts, graces, blessings, a high calling, and a high work fail, what remains? The parable finds its interpretation in <a href="/context/hebrews/6-1.htm" title="Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,">Hebrews 6:1-6</a>.<p><span class= "bld">To be trodden under foot of men.</span>--The Talmud shows (Schottgen <span class= "ital">in loc.</span>) that the salt which had become unfit for sacrificial use in the store-house was sprinkled in wet weather upon the slopes and steps of the temple to prevent the feet of the priests from slipping, and we may accordingly see in our Lord's words a possible reference to this practice. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye are the salt</span>, etc. (cf. a similar saying in <a href="/mark/9-50.htm">Mark 9:50</a>; <a href="/luke/14-34.htm">Luke 14:34, 35</a>).

It may, indeed, be that its position here is only the result of the inspired guidance of the evangelist; but, on the whole, it seems more probable that so natural a figure was used more than once by our Lord, and that he really spoke these words in his sermon on the mount, as well as on the later occasion indicated by St. Luke. <span class="accented">Ye</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> of ver. 1. <span class="accented">Are</span>, in fact (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;</span>); therefore recognize the responsibility. <span class="accented">The salt of the earth.</span> It has been disputed whether allusion is here made to the preservative properties of salt or to the flavour it imparts; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whether Christ is thinking of his disciples as preserving the world from decay, or as giving it a good flavour to the Divine taste. Surely a useless question; forgetful of the fact that spiritual realities are being dealt with, and that it is therefore impossible for the one effect to be really separated from the other. Our Lord is thinking of the moral tone which his disciples are to give to humanity. The connexion with vers. 11, 12 is - Persecution must be borne unless you are to lose your moral tone, which is to be to the earth what salt is to its surroundings, preserving from corruption and fitting for (in your case Divine) appreciation. What <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is to be to the Christian <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>), that the Christian himself is to be to the world. <span class="cmt_word">If... have lost its savour</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>); so elsewhere in <a href="/luke/14-34.htm">Luke 14:34</a> only. Salt that has lost its distinctive qualities is here said to lack its proper mind or sense. Salt without sharpness is like an <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; for man is a <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. On the fact of salt losing its virtue, cf. Thomson ('Land and the Book,' p. 382: 1887), "It is a well-known fact that the salt <span class="accented">of this country</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Palestine] when in contact with the ground, or exposed to rain and sun, does become insipid and useless. From the manner in which it is gathered [<span class="accented">vide infra</span>], much earth and other impurities are necessarily collected with it. Not a little of it is so impure that it cannot be used at all; and such salt soon effloresces and turns to dust - not to fruitful soil, however. It is not only good for nothing itself, but it actually destroys all fertility wherever it is thrown.... No man will allow it to be thrown on to his field, and the only place for it is the street; and there it is cast, to be trodden under foot of men." It should be observed that the salt used in Palestine is not manufactured by boiling clean salt water, nor quarried from mines, but is obtained from marshes along the seashore, as in Cyprus, or from salt lakes in the interior, which dry up in summer, as the one in the desert north of Palmyra, and the great Lake of Jebbul, south-east of Aleppo. Further, rock-salt is found in abundance at the south end of the Dead Sea (cf. Thomson, <span class="accented">loc. cit</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Wherewith shall it be salted?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not if you will not act as salt, wherewith shall the earth be salted? (apparently Luther and Erasmus); but what quality can take the place of moral tone to produce in you the same result? You are as salt. If you lose your distinctive qualities, where, can you find that which answers to them? <span class="cmt_word">It is thenceforth good for nothing.</span> Our Lord here lays stress, not on want of fitness (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Luke), but on want of inherent power. "It is only useful for that purpose to which one applies what is absolutely useless" (Weiss-Meyer). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/5-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">You</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8025;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Hymeis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
