The crowd, influenced by the chief priests and elders, chose Barabbas. This decision highlights the rejection of Jesus by His own people, fulfilling the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which speaks of the Messiah being despised and rejected. Barabbas, whose name means "son of the father," ironically contrasts with Jesus, the true Son of the Father. This event underscores the substitutionary aspect of Jesus' sacrifice, as the innocent is condemned while the guilty is set free, prefiguring the atonement.<p><b>But he had Jesus flogged,</b><br>Flogging, or scourging, was a brutal Roman punishment involving a whip with multiple leather thongs, often embedded with metal or bone. This punishment was intended to weaken the victim before crucifixion. The severity of the flogging fulfilled <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, which states, "by His stripes we are healed," emphasizing the physical suffering Jesus endured for humanity's sins. The flogging also reflects the fulfillment of <a href="/psalms/129-3.htm">Psalm 129:3</a>, "The plowers plowed upon my back; they made long their furrows."<p><b>and handed Him over to be crucified.</b><br>Crucifixion was a Roman method of execution reserved for the worst criminals and slaves, symbolizing the curse of the law as described in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>, "cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree." By being handed over for crucifixion, Jesus took upon Himself the curse of sin, as explained in <a href="/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>. This act of handing over signifies the fulfillment of Jesus' own predictions about His death (<a href="/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>) and aligns with the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, where the lamb was handed over for slaughter, pointing to Jesus as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (<a href="/john/1-29.htm">John 1:29</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pilate.htm">Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who presided over the trial of Jesus.

Jesus willingly endures flogging and the cross to bear our sin, fulfill prophecy, and secure our salvation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">When he had scourged Jesus.</span>--The word used by St. Matthew, derived from the Latin <span class= "ital">flagellum,</span> shows that it was the Roman punishment with knotted thongs of leather (like the Russian "knout" or the English "cat"), not the Jewish beating with rods (<a href="/context/2_corinthians/11-24.htm" title="Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.">2Corinthians 11:24-25</a>). The pictures of the Stations, so widely used throughout Latin Christendom, have made other nations more familiar with the nature of the punishment than most Englishmen are. The prisoner was stripped sometimes entirely, sometimes to the waist, and tied by the hands to a pillar, with his back bent, so as to receive the full force of the blows. The scourge was of stout leather weighted with lead or bones. Jewish law limited its penalty to forty stripes, reduced in practice to "forty stripes save one" (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-24.htm" title="Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.">2Corinthians 11:24</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/25-3.htm" title="Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes, then your brother should seem vile to you.">Deuteronomy 25:3</a>), but Roman practice knew no limit but that of the cruelty of the executioner or the physical endurance of the sufferer.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Released he Barabbas</span> - "him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired" (Luke). <span class="cmt_word">When he had scourged Jesus.</span> This was the usual preliminary to crucifixion, especially in the case of shires, and was a punishment of a most severe and cruel nature. The verb here used, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, is formed from the Latin <span class="accented">flagellum</span>, and denotes the employment of that terrible implement the Roman scourge. This was no ordinary whip, but commonly a number of leather thongs loaded with lead or armed with sharp bones and spikes, so that every blow cut deeply into the flesh, causing intense pain. The culprit was stripped of his clothes, pinioned, and bound to a stake or pillar, and thus on his bare back suffered this inhuman chastisement. To think that the blessed Son of God was subject to such torture and indignity is indeed a lesson for us written in blood. When "he gave his back to the smiters" (<a href="/isaiah/50-6.htm">Isaiah 50:6</a>), he was taking the punishment of our sin upon his sacred shoulders. "He was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed" (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>). Possibly Pilate thought that the sight of Christ's suffering might arouse at this last moment the pity of the Jews (<a href="/john/19-1.htm">John 19:1-16</a>). But he was mistaken. The appetite of the bloodthirsty crowd was only whetted by this anticipatory taste; they insisted on the whole programme being canted out, and Pilate yielded to the demand, giving up the useless struggle. <span class="cmt_word">He delivered him to be crucified.</span> Pilate delivered Jesus to the will of the people, directing the soldiers to carry out the ordered execution. On the view taken by the Romans themselves of crucifixion, commentators quote Cicero, 'In Verr.,' 2:5. 66, "It is a crime to bind a Roman citizen; to scourge him is an act of wickedness; to put him to death is almost parricide: what shall I say of crucifying him? An act so abominable it is impossible to find any word adequately to express." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[So]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
