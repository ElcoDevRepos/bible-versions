The act of presenting a severed head on a platter reflects the opulence and decadence of Herodian banquets, which were influenced by Roman customs. This event underscores the moral corruption and the extent of Herodias's vindictiveness. The beheading of John the Baptist fulfills his role as a forerunner to Christ, paralleling the suffering and martyrdom that Jesus would later endure.<p><b>and presented to the girl</b><br>The girl, identified earlier in the chapter as Herodias's daughter, Salome, becomes an unwitting participant in this act of violence. Her involvement illustrates the manipulation and use of women in political and familial power struggles of the time. This presentation signifies the completion of Herodias's scheme, using her daughter to achieve her vengeful desires. The act also serves as a stark contrast to the innocence often associated with youth, highlighting the moral decay present in Herod's court.<p><b>who carried it to her mother</b><br>Salome's delivery of John's head to Herodias signifies the culmination of Herodias's long-standing grudge against John for his condemnation of her marriage to Herod Antipas. This act of carrying the head to her mother symbolizes the transfer of guilt and the perpetuation of sin within the family. It also reflects the fulfillment of Herodias's manipulative plan, showcasing her influence over both her daughter and Herod. This event foreshadows the rejection and persecution that Jesus and His followers would face, as those in power often resist the truth of God's message.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A prophet and forerunner of Jesus Christ, known for his call to repentance and baptism.

Shortly after the new society, for which John had prepared the way, had started upon its great career, when her brother, the young Agrippa, had obtained the title of king, through the favour of Caligula, Herodias, consistent in her ambition, stirred up her husband to seek the same honour. With this view she accompanied him to Rome; but they were followed by complaints from the oppressed Galileans, and the result was that he was deposed from his tetrarchy, and banished to Lugdunum (the modern Lyons) in Gaul. Thither she accompanied him, faithful to his fallen fortunes, in spite of overtures from her brother to return to Judaea, and there they died (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xviii. 7, ? 2). A tradition or legend relates that Salome's death was retributive in its outward form. She fell upon the ice, and in the fall her head was severed from the body. Josephus, however, simply records the fact that she married first her great-uncle Philip, the Tetrarch of Trachonitis, and afterwards her first cousin, Aristobulus (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xviii. 5, ? 4).<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/14-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[John&#8217;s]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
