The imagery of hunger is a common biblical motif representing physical need and spiritual longing. In the ancient Near East, hospitality was a crucial cultural value, and providing food to the hungry was a fundamental act of righteousness. The failure to feed the hungry here symbolizes a lack of compassion and neglect of God's commandments to care for the needy, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a> and <a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>. This phrase also echoes the teachings of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount, where He emphasizes the importance of mercy and love in action.<p><b>I was thirsty and you gave Me nothing to drink</b><br>Water, a vital resource in the arid climate of the Middle East, represents life and sustenance. In biblical times, offering water to the thirsty was a basic act of kindness and hospitality. The failure to provide water signifies a deeper spiritual neglect, as water often symbolizes spiritual nourishment and the Holy Spirit (<a href="/john/4-14.htm">John 4:14</a>, <a href="/john/7-37.htm">John 7:37-39</a>). This phrase highlights the importance of recognizing Christ in others and serving them as if serving Christ Himself. The neglect of this duty reflects a heart that is not aligned with God's will, as seen in the parable of the Good Samaritan (<a href="/luke/10-25.htm">Luke 10:25-37</a>), where true neighborly love is demonstrated through acts of mercy and compassion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing the righteous and the unrighteous in the context of the final judgment.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hungry_and_thirsty.htm">The Hungry and Thirsty</a></b><br>Represents those in need, whom Jesus identifies with Himself.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_unrighteous.htm">The Unrighteous</a></b><br>Those who failed to provide for the needs of others, thus failing to serve Christ.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_final_judgment.htm">The Final Judgment</a></b><br>The event where Jesus separates the righteous from the unrighteous based on their actions towards others.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, who are being instructed on the importance of serving others.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_compassion.htm">The Call to Compassion</a></b><br>As followers of Christ, we are called to show compassion and meet the needs of those around us.

Scripture repeatedly portrays God&#8217;s servants meeting it.<p>&#8226; Jesus Himself asked for water from the Samaritan woman (<a href="/john/4-13.htm">John 4:13-14</a>) and on the cross declared, &#8220;I am thirsty&#8221; (<a href="/john/19-28.htm">John 19:28</a>), underscoring His full identification with human weakness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/mark/9-41.htm">Mark 9:41</a> promises a reward &#8220;if anyone gives you even a cup of water because you bear the name of Christ,&#8221; proving God values the smallest act of compassion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and you gave Me nothing to drink</b><p>The indictment is complete: opportunity met with indifference.<p>&#8226; <a href="/job/22-7.htm">Job 22:7</a> rebukes those who &#8220;gave no water to the weary,&#8221; a mirror image of this neglect.<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a> reaffirms that even &#8220;a cup of cold water&#8221; given in Jesus&#8217; name matters for eternity; withholding it likewise carries eternal weight.<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20</a> reminds us, &#8220;If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink,&#8221; showing that love&#8217;s duty extends even toward those hardest to serve.<p>&#8226; <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a> cautions that we reap what we sow; ignoring thirst now reaps divine displeasure later.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/25-42.htm">Matthew 25:42</a> teaches that Jesus so identifies with the suffering poor that our response to their hunger and thirst is counted as our response to Him. The verse calls for tangible, compassionate action&#8212;food offered, water shared&#8212;while warning that neglect exposes a loveless heart and invites judgment. Compassion is not optional charity; it is the authentic evidence of a life transformed by Christ and measured by Him on the last day.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 42, 43.</span> - The Lord gives the ground of the sentence, which proceeds on the same terms as the former one. The crimes for which these souls are punished are those of omission and negligence; they failed to per form the most elementary duties of charity and brotherly love which conscience and natural religion enjoin; they had lived utterly selfish and unprofitable lives. If sins of omission are thus punished, we may infer that positive transgressions shall meet with still heavier retribution. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/25-42.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
