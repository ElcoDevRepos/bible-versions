This timing is significant as it follows the Sabbath, when people were free to travel and seek Jesus without breaking Sabbath laws. It reflects the urgency and desperation of those seeking healing and deliverance.<p><b>many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus</b><br>Demon possession was a recognized condition in the first-century Jewish context, often associated with physical and mental afflictions. The act of bringing the demon-possessed to Jesus indicates the faith of the people in His authority over spiritual realms. This also highlights the widespread impact of demonic influence at the time and the recognition of Jesus as a spiritual authority.<p><b>and He drove out the spirits with a word</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the power and authority of Jesus, who needed only to speak to command the spirits. It reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah's authority over evil (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>). The simplicity of "a word" underscores His divine nature and contrasts with contemporary exorcism practices, which were often elaborate.<p><b>and healed all the sick</b><br>Jesus' healing of all the sick demonstrates His compassion and the comprehensive nature of His ministry. It fulfills prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>, which speaks of the Messiah bearing our infirmities. This act of healing serves as a type of the ultimate healing and restoration that Jesus offers through salvation.

There were two reasons why the time should be thus specified. (1) It was natural that the sick should be brought in the cool of the evening, rather than in the scorching heat of the afternoon; and (2) it was the Sabbath, and the feeling which made the Pharisees question the lawfulness of a man's carrying the bed on which he had been lying (<a href="/john/5-10.htm" title="The Jews therefore said to him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.">John 5:10</a>), would probably have deterred the friends of the sick from bringing them as long as it lasted. But with sunset the Sabbath came to a close, and then they would feel themselves free to act. The prominence given to "those that were possessed with devils," both by St. Matthew and St. Mark, shows that it was the work of the Sabbath morning that had most impressed itself on their minds.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16, 17.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">great number of his miracles</span>, <span class="accented">and the secret of his performing them.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Parallel passages: <a href="/mark/1-32.htm">Mark 1:32-34</a>; <a href="/luke/4-40.htm">Luke 4:40</a>. <span class="cmt_word">When the even</span> <span class="cmt_word">was come;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">and when even-</span>According to the original connexion, preserved, as it seems, in Mark and Luke, this was the evening of the day in which our Lord had healed the man with the withered hand in the synagogue.
