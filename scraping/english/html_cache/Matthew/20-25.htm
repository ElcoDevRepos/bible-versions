This setting underscores the intimate teacher-student relationship Jesus maintained with His disciples. The act of calling them aside suggests a moment of correction or deeper teaching, often seen in rabbinic traditions where a teacher would gather his students for important lessons.<p><b>&#8220;You know that the rulers of the Gentiles</b><br>The term "Gentiles" refers to non-Jewish people, often seen as outsiders to the covenant community of Israel. In the context of the Roman Empire, which ruled over Judea at the time, the "rulers of the Gentiles" would include Roman officials and local client kings. This phrase sets up a contrast between the worldly systems of power and the kingdom of God. Historically, the Roman rulers were known for their authoritarian rule, which often involved heavy taxation and military enforcement.<p><b>lord it over them,</b><br>This phrase highlights the oppressive nature of Gentile leadership, characterized by domination and control. The Greek term used here implies a harsh or tyrannical rule. This contrasts with the servant leadership model that Jesus exemplifies and teaches. The concept of "lording over" is antithetical to the servant-hearted leadership that Jesus advocates, which is a recurring theme in His teachings.<p><b>and their superiors exercise authority over them.</b><br>The structure of authority in the Roman world was hierarchical, with clear distinctions between those in power and those subject to it. This phrase emphasizes the top-down approach to leadership prevalent in the Gentile world. In contrast, Jesus' kingdom operates on principles of humility and service. This teaching is consistent with other scriptural references, such as <a href="/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3-8</a>, where Paul speaks of Christ's humility and servanthood. Jesus' model of leadership is one of self-sacrifice and service, which He ultimately demonstrated through His death on the cross.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a
