This encounter occurs in the wilderness, a place often associated with testing and spiritual struggle in the Bible. The wilderness setting echoes Israel's 40 years of testing in the desert, drawing a parallel between Jesus' 40 days of fasting and Israel's journey. Satan's approach to Jesus after His fasting period highlights the strategic timing of temptation, often occurring during moments of physical or spiritual vulnerability.<p><b>and said,</b><br>The act of speaking signifies the beginning of a direct confrontation. In biblical narratives, dialogue often serves as a means of revealing character intentions and testing faith. This moment marks the first of three temptations, each designed to challenge Jesus' identity and mission. The dialogue format is reminiscent of the serpent's conversation with Eve in Genesis, where questioning and deceit are used to lead astray.<p><b>&#8220;If You are the Son of God,</b><br>This phrase challenges Jesus' divine identity, echoing the declaration made at His baptism, "This is My beloved Son" (<a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>). The conditional "if" is a tactic to sow doubt and provoke Jesus to prove His divine sonship through miraculous means. This challenge is not just about identity but also about trust in God's provision and timing. The title "Son of God" is significant, as it affirms Jesus' unique relationship with the Father, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah (e.g., <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>).<p><b>tell these stones to become bread.&#8221;</b><br>The temptation to turn stones into bread targets Jesus' physical hunger after fasting for 40 days. It also symbolizes a deeper temptation to use divine power for personal gain rather than relying on God's provision. This mirrors Israel's temptation to doubt God's provision in the wilderness when they longed for the bread of Egypt (Exodus 16). Jesus' refusal to perform this miracle underscores His commitment to His mission and His reliance on God's word, as He later responds by quoting <a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>, emphasizing spiritual sustenance over physical needs.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is in the wilderness fasting for forty days and nights.

The narrative is not the less real and true because it lies altogether in the spiritual region of man's life.<p><span class= "bld">If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.</span>--"These stones," as if in union with glance and gesture, pointing to the loaf-like flints of the Jordan desert. The nature of the temptation, so far as we can gauge its mysterious depth, was probably complex. Something there may have been, suggested from without, like that which uttered itself in Esau's cry, "What profit shall this birthright do to me?" (<a href="/genesis/25-32.htm" title="And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?">Genesis 25:32</a>). Hungry, exhausted, as if life were ebbing away in the terrible loneliness of the desert, the "wild beasts" around him, as if waiting for their victim, what would it avail to have been marked out as the Son of God, the long-expected Christ? With this another thought was blended. If He were the Son of God, did not that name involve a lordship over nature? Could He not satisfy His hunger and sustain His life? Would He not in so exercising the power of which now, for the first time it may be, He was the conscious possessor, be establishing his <span class= "ital">status</span> as the Christ in the eyes of others? That thought presented itself to His mind, but it was rejected as coming from the Enemy. It would have been an act of self-assertion and distrust, and therefore would have involved not the affirmation, but the denial of the Sonship which had so recently been attested.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The tempter</span> (<a href="/1_thessalonians/3-5.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:5</a> only; cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Came</span>; came up to him (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>). The word expresses local nearness, and suggests, though we cannot affirm it as certain, that he appeared visibly. The thought of physical nearness is continued in "taketh him" (vers. 5, 8), and "the devil leaveth him" and "angels came near" (ver. 11; cf. ver. 5, note). On the other hand, such expressions may be parabolic, and intended to express the closeness of the spiritual combat. To him; not after "came," but after "said" (Revised Version, with manuscripts). If thou be; <span class="accented">art</span> (Revised Version) (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;</span>) - the "if" of assumption (cf. <a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>). The devil does not attempt to throw doubt on the truth of the utterance in <a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>. His words rather mean, "Thou knowest what was said, thou bast been gradually realizing that assurance of Sonship; use, then, that privilege which thou undoubtedly hast" (comp. <a href="/matthew/27-40.htm">Matthew 27:40</a>, where, in mockery, the same truth is assumed). Wetstein, following Origen and pseudo-Ignatius,' Philipp.,' &sect; 9, says that the tempter did not know, or at least doubted, whether Jesus was really God, for otherwise he would never have tempted him. This is, surely, to miss the meaning of the temptation for our Lord himself; for he was tempted as Man. Satan might well haw known that he was God incarnate, and yet not have known whether as Man he might not yield. Weiss ('Life,' 1:343) mistakenly thinks that the object of this first temptation was to insinuate doubt in the mind of Jesus as to his Messiahship. "Command that these stones become bread, and if thou canst not do so, then thou art not the Son of God." <span class="cmt_word">Command that</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span> (cf.

Farrar (on <a href="/luke/4-3.htm">Luke 4:3</a>; and especially in 'Life of Christ,' illustrated edit., pp. 99, 100) suggests that there is a special reference to the "loaf-shaped fossils," <span class="accented">septaria</span>, which are found in Palestine - as, indeed, in most other countries. But though these "flattened nodules of calcareous clay, ironstone, or other matter" (Page, ' Handbook of Geolog. Terms,' etc., 1859, p. 327) often assume fantastic shapes, perhaps even distantly resembling either an English loaf or a fiat Jewish cake (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>) , it seems quite unnecessary to see any allusion to them here.
