The Sea of Galilee, also known as Lake Gennesaret or the Sea of Tiberias, is a freshwater lake in Israel. It is significant in Jesus' ministry, as many of His miracles and teachings occurred around this area. The act of getting into the boat symbolizes Jesus' readiness to lead His disciples into new experiences and challenges, often used as a metaphor for embarking on a spiritual journey.<p><b>His disciples followed Him</b><br>The disciples' decision to follow Jesus into the boat demonstrates their commitment and trust in Him. This act of following is a recurring theme in the Gospels, emphasizing discipleship and obedience. In the cultural context of the time, a disciple was expected to follow their teacher closely, learning from their actions and teachings. This phrase also foreshadows the upcoming storm, highlighting the disciples' reliance on Jesus in times of uncertainty and danger. It reflects the call to Christians to follow Christ, trusting in His guidance and protection, as seen in other scriptures such as <a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>, where Jesus calls His followers to take up their cross and follow Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who initiates the journey by getting into the boat.

Earlier that day He had taught and healed crowds (<a href="/matthew/8-1.htm">Matthew 8:1&#8211;17</a>), then instructed would-be followers about the cost of discipleship (<a href="/matthew/8-18.htm">Matthew 8:18&#8211;22</a>). Now He steps into a vessel, signaling a shift from ministry on shore to ministry amid the sea.<p>&#8226; <a href="/mark/4-35.htm">Mark 4:35</a> notes Jesus&#8217; specific directive: &#8220;Let us cross to the other side.&#8221; His initiative underscores His authority over the journey, the elements, and the lesson that waits in the storm (<a href="/mark/4-37.htm">Mark 4:37&#8211;41</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/8-22.htm">Luke 8:22</a> echoes the same moment, adding that Jesus Himself said, &#8220;Let us go over to the other side of the lake.&#8221; This reinforces that the trip is not incidental; it is a divine appointment.<p>&#8226; The boat becomes a mobile classroom. Just as Noah&#8217;s ark carried a remnant through judgment (<a href="/genesis/7-1.htm">Genesis 7:1</a>), and Moses&#8217; basket bore him through danger (<a href="/exodus/2-3.htm">Exodus 2:3</a>), this humble craft will carry Christ and His disciples through a tempest to reveal His majesty.<p>&#8226; In stepping aboard, Jesus demonstrates:<p>&#8211; Sovereign foresight: He knows the storm is coming yet enters willingly (<a href="/john/13-19.htm">John 13:19</a>).<p>&#8211; Continual outreach: Crossing the lake will bring Him to the Gentile region of the Gadarenes (<a href="/matthew/8-28.htm">Matthew 8:28</a>), showing His mission extends beyond Israel (<a href="/isaiah/42-6.htm">Isaiah 42:6</a>).<p>&#8211; Peace in preparation: Before chaos erupts, He models calm confidence, soon falling asleep (<a href="/mark/4-38.htm">Mark 4:38</a>), illustrating <a href="/psalms/4-8.htm">Psalm 4:8</a>, &#8220;In peace I will lie down and sleep, for You alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His disciples followed Him</b><p>&#8226; Matthew simply states, &#8220;His disciples followed Him&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/8-23.htm">Matthew 8:23</a>). Their immediate obedience demonstrates genuine discipleship (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Earlier, one prospective follower asked to bury his father first and was told, &#8220;Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/8-22.htm">Matthew 8:22</a>). The twelve now illustrate the right response&#8212;no delay, no conditions.<p>&#8226; They follow into uncertainty. The Sea of Galilee is notorious for sudden storms, yet trust in Jesus overrides natural caution (<a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5&#8211;6</a>).<p>&#8226; Following Christ often leads straight into trials that reveal His glory:<p>&#8211; Israel followed the cloud into the desert and met the Red Sea, only to watch God part the waters (<a href="/exodus/14-19.htm">Exodus 14:19&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8211; Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego followed God into a furnace and saw Him walk with them (<a href="/daniel/3-25.htm">Daniel 3:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Their presence in the boat ensures eyewitness testimony when Jesus stills the storm (<a href="/matthew/8-26.htm">Matthew 8:26</a>). Faith grows by seeing His works (<a href="/john/2-11.htm">John 2:11</a>), and later they will proclaim, &#8220;Even the winds and the sea obey Him!&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/8-27.htm">Matthew 8:27</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment also teaches communal trust. They embark together, illustrating <a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24&#8211;25</a>&#8212;believers strengthen one another as they follow Christ through trials.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/8-23.htm">Matthew 8:23</a> shows Jesus intentionally boarding the boat and His disciples immediately joining Him. His deliberate action sets the stage for a revelation of divine power; their prompt obedience models true discipleship. Together these twin movements invite believers today to trust Christ&#8217;s leadership&#8212;even when it carries us into storms&#8212;confident that every journey He initiates serves His redemptive purposes and displays His sovereign care.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) The two narratives that follow are brought together in all three Gospels; but St. Mark and St. Luke place them, as we have seen, after the parables which St. Matthew gives in chapter 13<p><span class= "bld">Entered into a ship.</span>--The better MSS. give, as often elsewhere, "<span class= "ital">the</span> ship," or boat--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> one which, belonging possibly to Peter or the sons of Zebedee, was always ready at their Master's service. St. Mark adds that "they took Him, even as He was, in the boat," the words indicating apparently extreme exhaustion from the fatigue of teaching. This, we learn, was followed by immediate sleep as He lay in the stern on the boat's cushion as a pillow.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-27.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">storm on the lake.</span> Parallel passages: <a href="/mark/4-35.htm">Mark 4:35-41</a>; <a href="/luke/8-22.htm">Luke 8:22-25</a>.

Did St. Matthew see in the very order of embarking a symbol of the Christian life? It may be so, but a more probable reason for mentioning the order is that our Lord was, perhaps, on this occasion not using a beat that belonged to any of the disciples. Passage may have been given to him at his request, and of course the disciples went where he went. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/8-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[When]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
