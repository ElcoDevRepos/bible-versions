In biblical context, the tree often symbolizes a person or a community, and the fruit represents actions or outcomes. The idea is that a person's character (the tree) determines their actions (the fruit). This concept is echoed in <a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, where a righteous person is likened to a tree planted by streams of water, yielding fruit in season. The imagery of a good tree producing good fruit is also found in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>, where the fruit of the Spirit is described, highlighting virtues such as love, joy, and peace.<p><b>or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad</b><br>Here, the focus shifts to the negative aspect, where a corrupt nature leads to corrupt actions. This reflects the biblical principle that evil intentions and a sinful heart result in sinful behavior. In <a href="/matthew/7-17.htm">Matthew 7:17-18</a>, Jesus similarly teaches that a bad tree cannot bear good fruit, reinforcing the idea that one's inner moral and spiritual state is revealed through their actions. This concept is rooted in the Old Testament, where the prophets often used the metaphor of a fruitless or diseased tree to describe Israel's unfaithfulness (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/17-5.htm">Jeremiah 17:5-8</a>).<p><b>for a tree is known by its fruit</b><br>This concluding phrase underscores the principle of discernment based on observable outcomes. In the cultural context of Jesus' time, agriculture was a common livelihood, making this metaphor relatable and easily understood. The statement serves as a warning against hypocrisy, as seen in <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>, where Jesus criticizes the Pharisees for their outward appearance of righteousness while being inwardly corrupt. The idea that actions reveal true character is a consistent biblical theme, as seen in <a href="/james/2-18.htm">James 2:18</a>, where faith is demonstrated through works. This principle also aligns with the prophetic tradition, where true prophets are distinguished from false ones by the fulfillment of their words and the righteousness of their lives (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-21.htm">Deuteronomy 18:21-22</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, addressing the Pharisees and the crowd.

As spoken to men of neutral, half-hearted character, they might seem a call, not without a touch of indignant rebuke, to consistency. "At least be thorough; lot principles and actions harmonise. Do not think you can produce the fruit of good works from the tree of a corrupt heart." This, however, is not their meaning here. The men to whom our Lord spoke were not neutral, but in direct hostility to Him, and here, therefore, He presses on them logical rather than practical consistency; "make," <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> reckon, the tree and the fruit as having the same character.
