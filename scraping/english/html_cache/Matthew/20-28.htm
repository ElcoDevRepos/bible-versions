He did not arrive seeking applause but offering Himself. Accepting His ransom not only secures salvation; it also redefines greatness for His followers&#8212;true honor is found in humble, self-giving service patterned after the Savior who served us first.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Not</span> <span class= "bld">to be ministered unto.</span>--The words found a symbolic illustration when our Lord, a few days afterwards, washed the feet of the disciples who were still contending about their claims to greatness (<a href="/context/john/13-3.htm" title="Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;">John 13:3-4</a>); and the manner in which St. John connects the act with our Lord's manifested consciousness of His supreme greatness, seems to show that the words which we find here were then present to his thoughts. The Son of Man seemed to the beloved disciple never to have shown Himself so truly king like and divine as when engaged in that menial act. But that act, we must remember, was only an illustration; and the words found their true meaning in His whole life, in His poverty and humiliation, in the obedience of childhood, in service rendered, naturally or super-naturally, to the bodies or the souls of others.<p><span class= "bld">To give his life a ransom for many.</span>--The word rightly rendered "ransom," is primarily "a price made for deliverance," and in this sense it is found in the Greek version of the Old Testament for "the ransom" which is accepted instead of a man's life in <a href="/exodus/21-30.htm" title="If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatever is laid on him.">Exodus 21:30</a>, for the "price of redemption" accepted as an equivalent for an unexpired term of service in <a href="/leviticus/25-50.htm" title="And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him to the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.">Leviticus 25:50</a>, for riches as the "ransom of a man's life" in <a href="/proverbs/13-8.htm" title="The ransom of a man's life are his riches: but the poor hears not rebuke.">Proverbs 13:8</a>. No shade of doubt accordingly rests on the meaning of the word. Those who heard could attach no other meaning to it than that He who spake them was about to offer up His life that others might be delivered. Seldom, perhaps, has a truth of such profound import been spoken, as it were, so incidentally. It is as if the words had been drawn from Him by the contrast between the disputes of the disciples and the work which had occupied His own thoughts as He walked on in silent solitude in advance of them. It is the first distinct utterance, we may note, of the plan and method of His work. He had spoken before of "saving" the lost (<a href="/matthew/18-11.htm" title="For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.">Matthew 18:11</a>): now He declares that the work of "salvation" was to be also one of "redemption." It could only be accomplished by the payment of a price, and that price was His own life. The language of the Epistles as to the "redemption that is in Christ Jesus," our being "bought with a price" (<a href="/romans/3-24.htm" title="Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:">Romans 3:24</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/6-20.htm" title="For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.">1Corinthians 6:20</a>), "redeemed by His precious blood" (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm" title="But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:">1Peter 1:19</a>), the language of all Christendom in speaking of the Christ as our Redeemer, are the natural developments of that one pregnant word. The extent of the redemptive work, "for many," is here indefinite rather than universal, but "the ransom for all" of <a href="/1_timothy/2-6.htm" title="Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.">1Timothy 2:6</a> shows in what sense it was received by those whom the Spirit of God was guiding into all truth. Even the preposition in, "for many" has a more distinct import than is given in the English version. It was, strictly speaking, a "ransom" <span class= "ital">instead of, in the place of, </span>(<span class= "greekheb">????</span> not <span class= "greekheb">????</span>) "many." Without stating a theory of the atonement, it implied that our Lord's death was, in some way, representative and vicarious; and the same thought is expressed by St. Paul's choice of the compound substantive <span class= "greekheb">??????????</span>, when, using a different preposition, he speaks of it as a ransom for (<span class= "greekheb">????</span>,<span class= "ital"> i.e., on behalf of</span>) all men (<a href="/1_timothy/2-6.htm" title="Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.">1Timothy 2:6</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Even as.</span> Christ adduces his own example as a pattern of profound humility. <span class="cmt_word">To minister.</span> By his incarnation Christ assumed the lowliest life of man. He took upon himself the form of a servant, and was ever active in ministering to others' wants, going about doing good, healing the sick, cleansing lepers, casting out demons; always accessible, sympathetic, merciful; never weary of teaching, however fatigued in body; a servant to the race which he came to save. <span class="cmt_word">A ransom for many;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">instead of many</span>. The crowning example of his humility is that he gave his life as a ransom for the souls of men. This is the atonement, the sacrificial act, which (as the Mosaic sacrifices did in a partial and temporary manner) reconciled God and man. Whatever may be the way in which this atonement acts on the Divine mind, the expression here shows that it was vicarious and propitiatory, energizing, not by example, as an effort of superhuman self-denial, courage, and patience, but by an inherent power, as mysterious as it is efficacious. We can only say that, being the act of one who is God, its effects must necessarily be incomprehensible and infinite. The difficulties that beset this doctrine are increased by the fact that Jesus himself says little about the atoning nature of his sufferings and death - a topic which would not at this time have been properly received by friends or enemies, the former refusing to credit his approaching death, the latter being totally unable to conceive how such death could supersede Jewish sacrifices and reconcile the whole world to God (Sadler). Christ certainly died for all, as St. Paul says, "He gave himself a ransom for all (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)" (<a href="/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>), but all do not accept the offered salvation; hence arise the two expressions, "all" and "many," referring to the same object; "not," as an old Father says, "that salvation is limited, but men's efforts to obtain it are limited." The same expression was used by our Lord at the Last Supper, when he said, "This is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins" (<a href="/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>). A comparison of the passages in which the death of Christ is connected with the salvation of men would show a similar interchange of terms, depending on the view which the writer is taking of the doctrine, whether an objective one or a subjective.
