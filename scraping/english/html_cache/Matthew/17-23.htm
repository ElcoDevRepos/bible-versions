The use of "they" indicates the involvement of the Jewish leaders and Roman authorities, as seen in the Gospels. This aligns with prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7-9</a>, which foretells the suffering and death of the Messiah. The act of killing Jesus was both a fulfillment of divine prophecy and a demonstration of human sinfulness. Historically, crucifixion was a Roman method of execution, emphasizing the political and religious tensions of the time.<p><b>and on the third day He will be raised to life.</b><br>This phrase highlights the prophecy of Jesus' resurrection, a cornerstone of Christian faith. The "third day" is significant, as it fulfills Old Testament typology, such as Jonah's three days in the belly of the fish (<a href="/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>) and <a href="/hosea/6-2.htm">Hosea 6:2</a>, which speaks of revival on the third day. The resurrection is a testament to Jesus' victory over sin and death, affirming His divine nature and the truth of His teachings. It also serves as a promise of eternal life for believers, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>.<p><b>And the disciples were deeply grieved.</b><br>The disciples' grief reflects their lack of understanding of the necessity and significance of Jesus' death and resurrection at that time. Their sorrow is indicative of their human perspective, unable to fully grasp the divine plan. This emotional response is consistent with their reactions in other parts of the Gospels, such as Peter's rebuke of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/16-22.htm">Matthew 16:22</a>. The grief also underscores the personal relationship they had with Jesus, highlighting the loss they felt at the thought of His departure.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the passage, who is foretelling His death and resurrection.
