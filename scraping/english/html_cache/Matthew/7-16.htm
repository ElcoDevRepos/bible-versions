In biblical context, "fruit" often symbolizes the visible outcomes of one's actions and character. This concept is rooted in the Old Testament, where fruitfulness is associated with righteousness and obedience to God (<a href="/psalms/1-3.htm">Psalm 1:3</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/17-7.htm">Jeremiah 17:7-8</a>). Jesus uses this metaphor to teach that genuine faith and character are evidenced by one's actions and lifestyle. The imagery of fruit is also connected to the fruit of the Spirit in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>, which includes love, joy, peace, and other virtues.<p><b>Are grapes gathered from thornbushes,</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights the natural order and the impossibility of expecting good outcomes from inherently bad sources. In the agricultural society of ancient Israel, grapes were a common and valued crop, symbolizing abundance and blessing (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-8.htm">Deuteronomy 8:8</a>). Thornbushes, on the other hand, were often associated with desolation and curse (<a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>). The contrast between grapes and thornbushes underscores the idea that true spiritual leaders will produce good fruit, while false prophets will not.<p><b>or figs from thistles?</b><br>Figs were another staple in the diet of the people of Israel, representing prosperity and well-being (<a href="/1_kings/4-25.htm">1 Kings 4:25</a>, <a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>). Thistles, like thornbushes, were seen as a symbol of the fall and the curse upon the earth (<a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>). This comparison further illustrates the principle that one's true nature is revealed by their actions and the results they produce. The use of familiar agricultural imagery would have resonated deeply with Jesus' audience, making the teaching both relatable and memorable. This teaching aligns with the broader biblical theme of discerning true from false teachings and prophets, as seen in passages like 1 <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a> and <a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2

Likewise, a ministry or individual marked by selfishness, pride, or deception cannot suddenly yield the nourishing fruit of righteousness.<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; hearers, many of whom farmed in rocky Galilee, immediately grasped the absurdity: the nature of the plant determines its produce (<a href="/luke/6-43.htm">Luke 6:43</a>).<p>&#8226; Therefore, when evaluating teachers&#8212;or ourselves&#8212;we look for consistent evidence of repentance, humility, and love (<a href="/acts/26-20.htm">Acts 26:20</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12-16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>or figs from thistles?</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;or figs from thistles?&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16</a>c)<p>&#8226; Thistles are prickly weeds; figs were a staple fruit in Israel.

Believers are called to loving discernment, examining conduct and character alongside doctrine. As we abide in Jesus, the Spirit generates observable, nourishing fruit that confirms our testimony and protects the church from deception.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Ye shall know them by their fruits.</span>--The question, What are the fruits? is not directly answered. Those who attach most importance to the ethical side of religion, see in them the practical outcome of doctrine in life, character, and deeds. Others, who live in a constant dread of heresy, dwell on doctrines rather than acts as the "fruits" by which we are to discern the false teachers and the true. Good works, they say, may be but the sheep's clothing that hides the heretic wolf. The analogy of Scriptural language, and even of that of most theologians, the familiar phrases which speak of good works as the fruits of faith and the like, are, it is believed, entirely in favour of the former view. Still more decisive are the "fruits meet for repentance" of <a href="/matthew/3-8.htm" title="Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:">Matthew 3:8</a>. We are to judge of the teaching of those who claim authority by the test of the measure in which, in the long-run, it promotes purity, peace, and holiness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="/luke/6-44.htm">Luke 6:44</a>.
