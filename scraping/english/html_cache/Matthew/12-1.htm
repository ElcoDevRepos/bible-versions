It follows a series of teachings and miracles, indicating a time of growing tension between Jesus and the Pharisees.<p><b>Jesus went through the grainfields</b><br>The grainfields were likely wheat or barley, common crops in ancient Israel. This setting emphasizes Jesus' itinerant lifestyle and His connection to the land and people. It also reflects the agricultural society of first-century Judea.<p><b>on the Sabbath</b><br>The Sabbath was a day of rest and worship, observed from Friday evening to Saturday evening. It was a sign of the covenant between God and Israel, rooted in the creation narrative and the Ten Commandments. The Pharisees had strict interpretations of what constituted work on the Sabbath, which often led to conflicts with Jesus.<p><b>His disciples were hungry</b><br>This detail highlights the human needs of Jesus' followers and sets the stage for the ensuing controversy. It underscores the reality of their dependence on daily provision and the simplicity of their lifestyle.<p><b>and began to pick the heads of grain</b><br>This action was permissible under the Law of Moses, which allowed for gleaning by the poor and travelers (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-25.htm">Deuteronomy 23:25</a>). However, the Pharisees considered it a form of reaping, thus violating their interpretation of Sabbath laws.<p><b>and eat them</b><br>Eating the grain directly from the field was a common practice for those in need. This act of satisfying hunger becomes a point of contention, illustrating the tension between human need and religious legalism. It also foreshadows Jesus' teaching on the Sabbath being made for man, not man for the Sabbath (<a href="/mark/2-27.htm">Mark 2:27</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is traveling with His disciples.

The question, what is meant by that term, will be discussed in the Notes on that passage. The facts of the case place it clearly between the Passover and the Feast of Pentecost, between the beginning of the barley and the end of the wheat harvest. The position which the narrative occupies in <a href="/mark/2-23.htm" title="And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.">Mark 2:23</a>, <a href="/luke/6-1.htm" title="And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.">Luke 6:1</a>, immediately after the feast in Matthew's house, differs so widely from St. Matthew's arrangement, that we are again at sea in attempting to construct a harmony, and can only regard the words "at that time" as belonging to the separate history in some other position than that in which he has placed it.<p><span class= "bld">Began to pluck the ears of corn.</span>--Note St. Mark's stronger phrase, "to make a path, plucking the ears," and St. Luke's description that they ate them, "rubbing them in their hands." The act was permitted by the Law as far as the rights of property were concerned (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-25.htm" title="When you come into the standing corn of your neighbor, then you may pluck the ears with your hand; but you shall not move a sickle to your neighbor's standing corn.">Deuteronomy 23:25</a>), but it was against the Pharisees' interpretation of the law of the Sabbath. To pluck the ears was to reap, to rub the husks from the grain was to thresh; and the new Teacher was therefore, they thought, tacitly sanctioning a distinct breach of the holiness of the day of rest.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-50.</span> - The opposition that our Lord met with <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> from his enemies (vers. 1-45); <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> from his relations (vers. 46-50); and the manner in which he dealt with it. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-45.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">Opposition from his enemies.</span>  . . . <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/12-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">At</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(En)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
