This timing is significant as it aligns with the Passover meal, which is traditionally eaten after sunset. The Passover commemorates the Israelites' deliverance from Egypt, as described in <a href="/exodus/12.htm">Exodus 12</a>. The evening setting also fulfills the prophecy of Jesus as the Lamb of God, who would be sacrificed for the sins of the world, paralleling the Passover lamb.<p><b>Jesus was reclining</b><br>Reclining at a meal was a common practice in the ancient Near East, especially during special occasions like the Passover. This posture indicates a relaxed and intimate setting, emphasizing fellowship and community. It also reflects the freedom and rest that Jesus offers, contrasting with the bondage of sin. The act of reclining is symbolic of the rest believers find in Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/hebrews/4-9.htm">Hebrews 4:9-10</a>.<p><b>with the twelve disciples</b><br>The twelve disciples represent the twelve tribes of Israel, symbolizing the new covenant community that Jesus is establishing. This gathering is significant as it marks the last supper Jesus shares with His disciples before His crucifixion. It is a moment of deep teaching and revelation, as Jesus prepares them for His impending death and resurrection. The number twelve also signifies completeness and divine government, pointing to the establishment of the Church. This moment foreshadows the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>, where the disciples are sent to make disciples of all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is about to face His crucifixion.
