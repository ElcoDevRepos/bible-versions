Pilate's awareness suggests a level of discernment and political acumen. In the Roman judicial system, governors like Pilate were expected to maintain order and justice, often requiring them to assess the motives behind accusations. Pilate's knowledge indicates he was not easily swayed by the religious leaders' outward claims.<p><b>it was out of envy</b><br>The religious leaders' envy of Jesus is a recurring theme in the Gospels. Jesus' popularity, authority, and ability to perform miracles threatened their power and influence over the people. Envy, a destructive emotion, is condemned in various parts of Scripture (e.g., <a href="/proverbs/14-30.htm">Proverbs 14:30</a>, <a href="/james/3-16.htm">James 3:16</a>). This envy led to irrational and unjust actions, fulfilling the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, who was despised and rejected by men.<p><b>that they had handed Jesus over to him</b><br>The religious leaders, unable to execute capital punishment under Roman rule, handed Jesus over to Pilate. This act of handing over is significant, as it fulfills Jesus' own predictions about His death (e.g., <a href="/matthew/20-18.htm">Matthew 20:18-19</a>). The term "handed over" is also used in the context of betrayal, linking Judas Iscariot's actions to the broader rejection by the Jewish leaders. This transfer of Jesus to Roman authority highlights the collaboration between Jewish and Roman powers in the crucifixion, a pivotal event in salvation history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who presided over the trial of Jesus.

They had shown their envy of Christ's influence with the people; they were jealous of his reputation and success; grudged him his marvellous powers; were embittered by his attacks on rabbinism, and the undermining of their popularity. Pilate saw much of this; he penetrated behind their flimsy pretence of averting some possible danger from the Roman dominion, and he laboured in this indirect way to save the victim of this vindictive plot. Of course, Pilate could not fully appreciate Christ's character, nor enter into the question of his supernatural claims; he saw only that he was brought before him from the basest motives, that no real offence was proved against him, and that no fear could be entertained of his heading a popular tumult. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
