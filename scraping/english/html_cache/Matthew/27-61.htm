She was delivered from seven demons by Jesus (<a href="/luke/8-2.htm">Luke 8:2</a>) and became one of His most faithful followers. Her presence at the crucifixion and burial of Jesus highlights her loyalty and love for Him. Her role as a witness to these events is significant, as she later becomes the first to see the resurrected Christ (<a href="/john/20-14.htm">John 20:14-18</a>).<p><b>and the other Mary</b><br>The "other Mary" is identified in <a href="/matthew/27-56.htm">Matthew 27:56</a> as the mother of James and Joseph. She is also referred to as the wife of Clopas in <a href="/john/19-25.htm">John 19:25</a>. Her presence alongside Mary Magdalene underscores the role of women in the early Christian community, who were often the first to witness and testify to key events in Jesus' life and ministry.<p><b>were sitting there</b><br>The act of sitting indicates a prolonged presence and watchfulness. This suggests their deep sorrow and mourning, as well as their commitment to Jesus even after His death. It also reflects the cultural practice of mourning, where sitting was a common posture for those grieving.<p><b>opposite the tomb</b><br>The tomb, likely a rock-hewn cave, was a new tomb belonging to Joseph of Arimathea (<a href="/matthew/27-60.htm">Matthew 27:60</a>). The location of the tomb is significant, as it fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, which states that the Messiah would be buried with the rich. The women's position opposite the tomb indicates their intention to return after the Sabbath to anoint Jesus' body, showing their dedication and care for Him even in death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary_magdalene.htm">Mary Magdalene</a></b><br>A devoted follower of Jesus, Mary Magdalene is often noted for her presence at significant events in Jesus' life, including His crucifixion and resurrection.

These pious women could not tear themselves from the spot where their Lord was buried. The last to leave him dead, they were the first to see him risen. And now they watch the last ceremonies at a distance, intending to complete the imperfect embalmment with loving care as soon as ever the sabbath was over. "Seest thou women's courage?" says Chrysostom; "seest thou their affection? seest thou their noble spirit in expending money [<a href="/mark/16-1.htm">Mark 16:1</a>; <a href="/luke/23-56.htm">Luke 23:56</a>]? their noble spirit even unto death? Let us men imitate the women; let us not forsake Jesus in temptations." We may note that the care of Joseph in providing an inviolable tomb, and the preparations of these good women, showed that they as yet had no faith in the incorruptibility of Christ's body or of his corporeal resurrection from the dead. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-61.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Mary</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#8048;&#956;</span> <span class="translit">(Mariam)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3137.htm">Strong's 3137: </a> </span><span class="str2">Or Mariam of Hebrew origin; Maria or Mariam, the name of six Christian females.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Magdalene</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#945;&#947;&#948;&#945;&#955;&#951;&#957;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(Magdal&#275;n&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3094.htm">Strong's 3094: </a> </span><span class="str2">Magdalene, a woman of Magdala.
