The "little ones" can refer to children or new believers, highlighting their innocence and need for guidance. The concept of causing someone to "stumble" is a metaphor for leading them into sin or causing them to lose faith. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the responsibility of believers to support and edify one another, as seen in <a href="/romans/14-13.htm">Romans 14:13</a>, where Paul warns against putting a stumbling block in a brother's way.<p><b>it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck</b><br>The imagery of a millstone, which was a heavy stone used for grinding grain, signifies the severity of the punishment for leading others into sin. In ancient times, millstones were large and required significant effort to move, symbolizing the weight of the sin of causing others to stumble. This hyperbolic statement underscores the gravity of the offense in the eyes of God.<p><b>and to be drowned in the depths of the sea</b><br>Drowning in the sea was considered a terrifying and shameful death in the ancient world, often associated with judgment and destruction. The "depths of the sea" evoke images of chaos and the unknown, further emphasizing the dire consequences of leading believers astray. This phrase echoes the seriousness of divine judgment, similar to the fate of those who opposed God in the Old Testament, such as the Egyptians in <a href="/exodus/14-27.htm">Exodus 14:27-28</a>.

We gaze on the innocent beauty of childhood with love and admiration. What if that beauty should be marred by the taint of evil? What if those who do the Tempter's work should cause the "little one" to stumble and to fall?<p><span class= "bld">That a millstone were hanged about his neck.</span>--The word for "millstone" indicates the larger stone-mill, in working which an ass was commonly employed, as distinguished from the smaller handmill of <a href="/luke/17-35.htm" title="Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.">Luke 17:35</a>. The punishment was not recognised in the Jewish law, but it was in occasional use among the Greeks (Diod. Sic. xvi. 35), and had been inflicted by Augustus (Sueton. <span class= "ital">Aug.</span> lxvii.) in cases of special infamy. Jerome states (in a note on this passage) that it was practised in Galilee, and it is not improbable that the Romans had inflicted it upon some of the ringleaders of the insurrection headed by Judas of Galilee. Our Lord's words, on this assumption, would come home with a special vividness to the minds of those who heard them. The infamy of offending one of the "little ones" was as great as that of those whoso crimes brought upon them this exceptional punishment. It was obviously a form of death less cruel in itself than many others, and its chief horror, both for Jews and heathen, was, probably, that it deprived the dead of all rites of burial. St. Mark and St. Luke, it may be noted, insert here the complaint of St. John, that he had seen one casting out devils in the name of Jesus, and this must be taken into account as an element in the sequence of thought. He was unconsciously placing himself among those who were hindering the work of Christ, and so "offending" those who believed in him. (See Note on <a href="/mark/9-38.htm" title="And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in your name, and he follows not us: and we forbade him, because he follows not us.">Mark 9:38</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - There is an opposite side to this picture. <span class="cmt_word">Shall offend;</span> <span class="accented">cause to stumble</span> - give occasion for a fall, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. either in faith or morals. This is done by evil example, by teaching to sin, by sneers at piety, by giving soft names to gross offences. <span class="cmt_word">One of these little ones.</span> Whether child or adult, a pure, simple soul, which has a certain faith it be not strong enough to resist all attack. Even the heathen recognized the respect due to the young: "Maxima debetur puero reverentia" (Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 14:47); and guilelessness and purity, wherever found, win some regard, even from worthless and careless observers. To wilfully lead one such astray is a deadly sin, which the Lord denounces in solemn terms. Christ affectionately calls his disciples "little ones" (<a href="/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Believe in</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">me</span>. We must always distinguish between "believe in" (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">or</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">credo in</span>) and "believe" with the simple dative; the former is applied to faith in God alone. Says St. Augustine, "Credimus Paulo, sed non credimus in Paulum." In the present passage the phrase implies the Divinity of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">It were better;</span> literally, <span class="accented">it is profitable</span>. The crime specified is so heinous that a man had better incur the most certain death, if by this means he may avoid the sin and save the soul of his possible victim. <span class="cmt_word">A millstone;</span> <span class="accented">a great millstone</span> - such a one as required an ass to inure. The upper, or movable, stone is meant, which was usually turned by the hand. <span class="cmt_word">Drowned</span>. We do not know that the Jews punished criminals by drowning (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>), though it is probable that it was practised in some cases; but by other nations this penalty was commonly exacted. Among the Romans, Greeks, and Syrians, it was certainly the practice. Commentators quote Suetonius, 'Aug.,' 67; Diod. Sic., 16:35; Livy, 1:51; Aristophanes, 'Schol. ad Equit.,' 1360. The punishment seems to have been reserved for the greatest criminals; and the size of the stone would prevent any chance of the body rising again to the surface and being buried by friends - a consideration which, in the minds of heathens, greatly increased the horror of this kind of death. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/18-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(d&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">if</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7938;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(an)</span><br /><span class="parse">Particle<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_302.htm">Strong's 302: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle, denoting a supposition, wish, possibility or uncertainty.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">anyone</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8011;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Hos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">causes</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#954;&#945;&#957;&#948;&#945;&#955;&#943;&#963;&#8131;</span> <span class="translit">(skandalis&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Subjunctive Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4624.htm">Strong's 4624: </a> </span><span class="str2">From skandalon; to entrap, i.e. Trip up (transitively) or entice to sin, apostasy or displeasure).</span><br /><br /><span class="word">one</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7957;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(hena)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1520.htm">Strong's 1520: </a> </span><span class="str2">One.
