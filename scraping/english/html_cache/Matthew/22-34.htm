News of His debates spread quickly through Jerusalem&#8217;s religious circles, so they &#8220;heard&#8221; immediately (<a href="/john/11-47.htm">John 11:47</a>; <a href="/luke/11-53.htm">Luke 11:53&#8211;54</a>).<p>&#8226; Their listening hearts were not open but defensive. Earlier confrontations had already stirred hostility&#8212;&#8220;the Pharisees went out and conspired against Him, how to destroy Him&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-14.htm">Matthew 12:14</a>).<p>&#8226; This moment shows that every word of Jesus carried weight; even His opponents could not ignore Him (<a href="/mark/12-13.htm">Mark 12:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees</b><p>&#8226; Just moments before, the Sadducees&#8212;who denied bodily resurrection&#8212;had tried to trap Jesus with a hypothetical marriage scenario (<a href="/matthew/22-23.htm">Matthew 22:23</a> - 32).<p>&#8226; Jesus &#8220;silenced&#8221; them by anchoring truth in Scripture: &#8220;He is not the God of the dead, but of the living&#8221; (v. 32). That authoritative answer ended the debate (<a href="/luke/20-37.htm">Luke 20:37-38</a>) and left the Sadducees speechless.<p>&#8226; The incident underscored Jesus&#8217; flawless command of the Law and the Prophets, confirming His divine authority (<a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Resurrection hope, soon to be demonstrated in His own rising, stands firm against every challenge (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51-57</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they themselves gathered together</b><p>&#8226; Seeing their rival faction publicly humbled, the Pharisees regrouped.

The Pharisees, alarmed that Jesus had effortlessly silenced the Sadducees, convened for another calculated challenge.

The Pharisees were informed of, and some of them had witnessed, the discomfiture of the Sadducees (see <a href="/luke/20-40.htm">Luke 20:40</a>); hence they deemed it necessary again to attack Jesus by asking a question which specially appertained to their own teaching. They felt that, if they were ever to compass his overthrow, they must first lower his credit with the people, so that these might no longer care to support or defend him.
