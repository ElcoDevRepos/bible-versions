This reflects the fulfillment of prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>, which speaks of a great light shining on those in darkness. The crowds were drawn by His authority and the hope He offered, contrasting with the religious leaders of the time. This scene is set in Galilee, a region known for its diverse population and openness to new ideas, which may have contributed to the large following.<p><b>that He got into a boat and sat down</b><br>Jesus using a boat as a platform to teach is significant both practically and symbolically. Practically, the boat provided a natural amphitheater effect, allowing His voice to carry over the water to the large crowd. Symbolically, the boat can be seen as a type of the church, a vessel through which Jesus continues to teach and reach the multitudes. Sitting down to teach was a common practice for rabbis, indicating authority and a formal teaching moment, as seen in <a href="/luke/4-20.htm">Luke 4:20</a> when Jesus reads from Isaiah in the synagogue.<p><b>while all the people stood on the shore</b><br>The posture of the people standing while Jesus sat to teach highlights the respect and attentiveness they had for His words. This setting also emphasizes the accessibility of Jesus' message; He was not confined to synagogues or temples but taught in open, accessible spaces. The shore of the Sea of Galilee, where this event likely took place, was a bustling area with fishermen and traders, making it an ideal location for reaching a diverse audience. This scene foreshadows the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>, where Jesus commands His disciples to go out into all the world, teaching all nations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching the crowds.
