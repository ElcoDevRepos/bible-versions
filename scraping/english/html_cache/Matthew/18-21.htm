This reflects the rabbinic tradition of asking questions to gain deeper understanding. Peter's approach signifies a desire for clarity on spiritual and moral issues, a common practice among disciples seeking wisdom from their teacher.<p><b>&#8220;Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother who sins against me?</b><br>The term "brother" here can be understood as a fellow believer or member of the community. Forgiveness was a significant theme in Jewish teaching, but Peter's question suggests a limit to this forgiveness. The cultural context of the time often emphasized justice and retribution, making Peter's inquiry about the extent of forgiveness particularly relevant.<p><b>Up to seven times?&#8221;</b><br>The number seven in Jewish tradition symbolizes completeness or perfection, often used in the Bible to signify fullness. Peter's suggestion of forgiving up to seven times may reflect a generous spirit, as the rabbinic standard of the time was to forgive up to three times. This question sets the stage for Jesus to teach about the boundless nature of forgiveness, contrasting human limitations with divine grace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' twelve apostles, known for his impulsive nature and strong leadership among the disciples.

Peter&#8217;s respectful question highlights the tension between human instinct to keep score and Christ&#8217;s command to keep forgiving. By bringing the issue to Jesus, he models dependence on the Lord&#8217;s wisdom. The verse, together with Jesus&#8217; answer, teaches that forgiveness in God&#8217;s family is meant to be as boundless as the grace we ourselves receive.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">How oft shall my brother sin . . .?</span>--The words of <a href="/matthew/18-15.htm" title="Moreover if your brother shall trespass against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone: if he shall hear you, you have gained your brother.">Matthew 18:15</a> had obviously told on the minds of the disciples, and had roused them to question with themselves. But they could not, all at once, take in the truth that the "commandment" was "exceeding broad." Surely, they thought, there must be some limit to this way of dealing with the brother who has sinned against us? And the sacred number suggested itself as the natural limit. Not, it may be conjectured, without a half-conscious reference to the words of the prophet (<a href="/amos/1-3.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:">Amos 1:3</a>), that "for three transgressions and for four" the punishment thereof should not be turned away, the Apostle made answer to his own question, "Until seven times?" as though the line must be drawn there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 21-35.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> <span class="accented">pardon of injuries, and the parable of the unmerciful servant</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - Peter was greatly struck with what Christ had just said about reconciliation of enemies; and he wanted to know what limits were to be imposed on his generosity, especially, it might be, if the offender made no reparation for his offence, and acknowledged not his wrong doing. <span class="cmt_word">My brother.</span> As ver. 15, fellow disciple, neighbour. <span class="cmt_word">Till seven times?</span> Peter doubtless thought that he was unusually liberal and generous in proposing such a measure of forgiveness. Seven is the number of completeness and plurality, and our Lord had used it in giving his sentence about forgiveness: "If he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn to thee again," etc. (<a href="/luke/17-4.htm">Luke 17:4</a>). Some rabbis had fixed this limit from an erroneous interpretation of <a href="/amos/1-3.htm">Amos 1:3</a>; <a href="/amos/2-1.htm">Amos 2:1</a>. "For three transgressions, and for four," etc.; but the usual precept enjoined forgiveness of three offences only, drawing the line here, and having no pity for a fourth offence. Ben-Sira bids a man admonish an offending neighbour twice, but is silent as to any further forgiveness (Ecclus. 19:13-17). The Jews were very fond of defining and limiting moral obligations, as if they could be accurately prescribed by number. Christ demolishes this attempt to define by law the measure of grace. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/18-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#972;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Tote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5119.htm">Strong's 5119: </a> </span><span class="str2">Then, at that time.
