The term "Golgotha" translates to "skull," and it is traditionally believed to be a hill resembling a skull's shape. This location is outside the walls of Jerusalem, aligning with Jewish customs of executing criminals outside the city (<a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm">Hebrews 13:12</a>). The site is significant in Christian tradition as the place of Jesus' crucifixion, fulfilling the prophecy of the suffering servant in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. The exact location of Golgotha is debated, with the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and Gordon's Calvary being the primary contenders.<p><b>which means The Place of the Skull</b><br>The phrase "The Place of the Skull" is a direct translation of "Golgotha." This name could derive from the hill's appearance or from its association with death and execution. In Roman times, crucifixion was a common method of execution for criminals, and such sites were often located near major roads to serve as a public deterrent. Theologically, the location underscores the gravity of Jesus' sacrifice, as He was crucified in a place associated with death, yet through His resurrection, He conquered death itself (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-55.htm">1 Corinthians 15:55-57</a>). The imagery of the skull also connects to the prophecy in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the seed of the woman would crush the serpent's head, symbolizing Jesus' victory over sin and death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/golgotha.htm">Golgotha</a></b><br>This is the Aramaic name for the location where Jesus was crucified.

The consistency underlines its historical reality.<p>&#8226; Golgotha lay just outside Jerusalem&#8217;s walls, near a well-traveled road. This allowed many to witness the crucifixion, aligning with <a href="/john/19-20.htm">John 19:20</a>, &#8220;Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Being outside the sacred precincts also points back to <a href="/leviticus/16-27.htm">Leviticus 16:27</a>, where the sin offering was burned outside the camp&#8212;prefiguring Christ, &#8220;our sin offering&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Mount Moriah, where Abraham offered Isaac (<a href="/genesis/22-14.htm">Genesis 22:14</a>), sits in the same ridge system.

The verse highlights fulfilled prophecy, the sacrificial pattern of being outside the camp, and the stark contrast between death&#8217;s symbol and Christ&#8217;s victory over it. Golgotha, once only a place of execution, becomes the epicenter of redemption where the Lamb of God turns a skull-strewn hill into the doorway of eternal life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">A place called Golgotha.</span>--The other Gospels give the name with the definite article, as though it were a well-known locality. It is not mentioned, however, by any Jewish writer, and its position is matter of conjecture. It was "nigh unto the city" (<a href="/john/19-20.htm" title="This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was near to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.">John 19:20</a>), and therefore outside the walls (comp. <a href="/hebrews/13-12.htm" title="Why Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.">Hebrews 13:12</a>). There was a garden in it (<a href="/john/19-41.htm" title="Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulcher, wherein was never man yet laid.">John 19:41</a>), and in the garden a tomb, which was the property of Joseph of Arimathaea (<a href="/matthew/27-60.htm" title="And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulcher, and departed.">Matthew 27:60</a>). A tradition, traceable to the fourth century, has identified the spot with the building known as the Church of the Sepulchre. One eminent archaeologist of our own time (Mr. James Fergusson) identifies it with the Dome of the Rock in the Mosque of El Aksa. Both sites were then outside the city, but were afterwards enclosed by the third wall, built by Agrippa II. The name has been supposed by some to point to its being a common place of execution; but it is not probable that the skulls of criminals would have been left unburied, nor that a wealthy Jew should have chosen such a spot for a garden and a burial-place. The facts lead rather to the conclusion (1) that the name indicated the round, bare, skull-like character of the eminence which was so called; and (2) that it may have been chosen by the priests as a deliberate insult to the member of their own body who had refused to share their policy, and was at least suspected of discipleship, and whose garden, or orchard, with its rock-hewn sepulchre, lay hard by (<a href="/mark/15-43.htm" title="Joseph of Arimathaea, an honorable counselor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly to Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.">Mark 15:43</a>; <a href="/luke/23-51.htm" title="(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.">Luke 23:51</a>; <a href="/john/19-38.htm" title="And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, sought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.">John 19:38</a>). A later legend saw in the name a token that the bones of Adam were buried there, and that as the blood flowed from the sacred wounds on his skull his soul was translated to Paradise. The more familiar name of Calvary (<a href="/luke/23-35.htm" title="And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.">Luke 23:35</a>) has its origin in the Vulgate rendering (<span class= "ital">Calvarium=&</span> skull) of the Greek word <span class= "ital">Kranion,</span> or <span class= "ital">Cranium,</span> which the Evangelist actually uses. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">A place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull;</span> <span class="accented">quod est Calvariae locus</span> (Vulgate). Hence the Latinized name Calvary. The word means "a skull;" but why the spot was so called is a doubtful question. That it was the usual place of execution is a suggestion with no proof, and one would expect the designation in this case to be "the place of skulls." Tradition (authorized by Origen) pointed to it as the spot where Adam was buried, and where his skull was found - a story that seems to have arisen from the typical reason that it was congruous that the first Adam and the second Adam should meet in death, the latter winning the victory there where the former showed his defeat. Most probably the name was given to it as descriptive of its appearance, a bare space of rock (not a hill) denuded of verdure, and bearing a distant resemblance to a human skull wanting hair. The actual situation of Calvary is hotly contested by exegetes and travellers, and is still far from being determined. The only criterion offered by our accounts in the Gospels is that it was without the then walls of the city, not far from one or the gates, and by the side of one of the principal roads leading from the city to the country. A certain knoll on the hill Gareb towards the northwest, by which the Damascus road led, and to which Jeremiah (Jeremiah 31:39) refers, is supposed, not very happily, to answer these requirements, If the present Church of the Holy Sepulchre, on the northwest of Jerusalem, really contains the actual Golgotha and the tomb of our Lord, the course of the second wall as usually drawn cannot be correct, as it embraces this site completely (see the <span class="accented">Guardian</span>, August 30, 1893, p. 1353). Opinion, always altering, has lately been inclined to endorse the authenticity of many of the traditional sites in the holy city and its neighbourhood. Further discoveries will set this and other matters at rest. Meantime, judgment must be suspended (see on ver. 51). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And [when]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they came</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#955;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(elthontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1519.htm">Strong's 1519: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition; to or into, of place, time, or purpose; also in adverbial phrases.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a place</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#972;&#960;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(topon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5117.htm">Strong's 5117: </a> </span><span class="str2">Apparently a primary word; a spot, i.e. Location; figuratively, condition, opportunity; specially, a scabbard.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">called</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#949;&#947;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(legomenon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Participle Middle or Passive - Accusative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Golgotha,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#915;&#959;&#955;&#947;&#959;&#952;&#8118;</span> <span class="translit">(Golgotha)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1115.htm">Strong's 1115: </a> </span><span class="str2">Golgotha, a knoll outside the wall of Jerusalem.
