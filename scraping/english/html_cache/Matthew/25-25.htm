In this context, the servant's fear reflects a lack of trust and understanding of his master's character. Biblically, fear can be both a reverence for God (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>) and a paralyzing force that prevents action (<a href="/2_timothy/1-7.htm">2 Timothy 1:7</a>). The servant's fear contrasts with the biblical encouragement to act in faith and trust in God's provision and guidance.<p><b>and went out and hid your talent in the ground.</b><br>The act of hiding the talent in the ground was a common practice in ancient times for safeguarding valuables, as evidenced by archaeological findings of buried treasures. However, in the parable, this action symbolizes a failure to utilize God-given resources and opportunities. The talent, a large sum of money, represents the gifts and responsibilities entrusted to believers. The servant's decision to hide it reflects a lack of initiative and faithfulness, contrasting with the proactive stewardship expected by God (<a href="/1_peter/4-10.htm">1 Peter 4:10</a>).<p><b>See, you have what belongs to you.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase indicates the servant's attempt to justify his inaction by returning the talent without any gain. It highlights a misunderstanding of stewardship, where the expectation is not merely to preserve but to grow and multiply what has been entrusted. This mirrors the biblical principle of bearing fruit (<a href="/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8</a>) and the call to be productive in God's kingdom. The servant's attitude contrasts with the faithful servants who invested their talents and were commended by the master.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>Represents God or Christ, who entrusts His servants with resources and responsibilities.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Symbolizes believers who are given talents or gifts by God to use for His glory.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_talent.htm">The Talent</a></b><br>A large sum of money in biblical times, symbolizing the gifts, abilities, and opportunities God gives to each believer.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ground.htm">The Ground</a></b><br>Represents the act of hiding or not utilizing the gifts and opportunities given by God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_return.htm">The Return</a></b><br>The moment of accountability when the servant must present what he has done with the talent.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/stewardship_and_responsibility.htm">Stewardship and Responsibility</a></b><br>God entrusts each believer with unique gifts and expects us to use them for His kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/o/overcoming_fear.htm">Overcoming Fear</a></b><br>Fear can paralyze us and prevent us from fulfilling God's purpose.

Playing it &#8220;safe&#8221; is unsafe in the kingdom; God expects courageous stewardship that turns His gifts into fruitful service for His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">And I was afraid.</span>--The words are those of simulated rather than real fear. That would have led him to shrink from the unfaithful service which was sure to draw down his master's anger. The excuse did but cover the implied taunt that he dared not venture anything in the service of a master who would make no allowance for intentions where the result was failure. So, in the life of the soul, a man wanting in the spirit of loyalty and trust contents himself with making no use of opportunities, and therefore they are to him as though they were not, except that they increase his guilt and his condemnation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I was afraid</span>. He took as certain the conception which he had formed of his master's character, as harsh, exacting, and unsympathizing, and therefore feared to speculate with his money, or to put it to any use whereby it might be lost or diminished. This is his excuse for negligence. He endeavours to cast the fault from his own shoulders to those of his superior. So evil men persuade themselves that God asks from them more than they can perform, and content themselves by doing nothing; or they consider that their powers and means are their own, to use or not as they like, and that no one can call them to account for the way in which they treat them. <span class="cmt_word">Hid thy talent in the earth</span> (see on ver. 18). Put it away for safety, that it might come to no harm, and not be employed for evil purposes. He recognizes not any duty owed to the giver in the possession of the money, nor the responsibility for work which it imposed. <span class="cmt_word">Lo, there thou hast</span> <span class="cmt_word">that is thine;</span> <span class="accented">lo! thou hast thy own.</span> This is sheer insolence; as if he had said, "You cannot complain; I have not stolen or lost your precious money; here it is intact, just as I received it." What a perverse mistaken view of his own position and of God's nature! The talent was given to him, not to bury, but to use and improve for his lord's profit. Hidden away, it was wasted. The time, too, during which he had the talent in his possession was wasted; he had not honestly used it in his master's service, or laboured, as he was bound to do. He ought to have had much more to show than the original endowment. To vaunt that, if he had done no good, at least he had done no harm, is condemnation. He might not thus shirk his responsibility. His answer only aggravated his fault. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/25-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">in my fear,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#966;&#959;&#946;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(phob&#275;theis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5399.htm">Strong's 5399: </a> </span><span class="str2">From phobos; to frighten, i.e. to be alarmed; by analogy, to be in awe of, i.e. Revere.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I went [and]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(apelth&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_565.htm">Strong's 565: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and erchomai; to go off, aside or behind, literally or figuratively.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">hid</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#954;&#961;&#965;&#968;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(ekrypsa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2928.htm">Strong's 2928: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hide, conceal, lay up.
