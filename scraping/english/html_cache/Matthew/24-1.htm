The temple, a central place of worship and sacrifice for the Jewish people, represents the religious system that Jesus often critiqued for its legalism and hypocrisy. His departure can be seen as a prophetic act, foreshadowing the eventual destruction of the temple in AD 70 by the Romans, as well as the establishment of a new covenant through His death and resurrection. This act also signifies Jesus' role as the true temple, where God's presence dwells among His people.<p><b>His disciples came up to Him</b><br>The disciples, who are often portrayed as learners and followers of Jesus, approach Him with questions and observations. This reflects their ongoing journey of understanding and their desire to comprehend the significance of Jesus' actions and teachings. The disciples' approach indicates their respect and recognition of Jesus as their teacher and leader, seeking His insight into the events unfolding around them.<p><b>to point out its buildings</b><br>The disciples' focus on the temple buildings highlights their awe and admiration for the grandeur and beauty of the temple complex. Herod the Great had expanded and renovated the temple, making it an architectural marvel of the ancient world. This admiration also underscores the disciples' attachment to the physical and traditional aspects of their faith. However, Jesus' subsequent teachings in this chapter will challenge them to look beyond the physical structures to the spiritual realities of God's kingdom. This moment sets the stage for Jesus to deliver the Olivet Discourse, where He speaks about the end times and the coming of the Son of Man, urging His followers to be vigilant and prepared.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who is leaving the temple in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are with Him and draw His attention to the temple buildings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The Jewish temple in Jerusalem, a significant religious and cultural symbol for the Jewish people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the temple is located, a central place in Jewish history and prophecy.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple_buildings.htm">The Temple Buildings</a></b><br>The structures of the temple complex, noted for their grandeur and significance.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_transience_of_earthly_structures.htm">The Transience of Earthly Structures</a></b><br>The disciples' admiration of the temple's buildings highlights human tendency to focus on physical grandeur.

Would not the sight of its glories lead Him to recall those words of evil omen? This seems a far more natural explanation than that which sees in what they were doing only the natural wonder of Galilean peasants at the splendour of the Holy City.

There is no reason to think, with Olshauson, that St. Matthew or his editor has considerably amplified the original discourse of our Lord by introducing details and expressions from other quarters. The discourse, as we now have it (ch. 24. and 25.), forms a distinct whole, divided into certain portions closely related to each other and it would have been unnatural in St. Matthew, and opposed to his simple and veracious style, to have put words into our Lord's mouth at this moment, which were not actually uttered by him on this solemn occasion. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-3.</span> - <span class="accented">Occasion of the discourse.</span> (<a href="/mark/13-1.htm">Mark 13:1-4</a>; <a href="/luke/21-5.htm">Luke 21:5-7</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From the temple;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">went out from the temple, and was going on his way</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). So the best manuscripts and versions. It was while he was proceeding on the route to Bethany that the disciples interrupted him with their remarks about the temple. He had now taken his final leave of the hallowed courts; the prophecy of the desolation of the house was beginning to be fulfilled (see on Matthew 23:38). <span class="cmt_word">His disciples came to him.</span> They were disquieted by Christ's words recorded at the end of the last chapter, which spoke of a terrible retribution about to fall, of the desolation of the temple, of Christ's own departure for a time. St. Mark (<a href="/mark/13-3.htm">Mark 13:3</a>) tells us that Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately when these things should be, and what signs should forewarn of their approach, as in ver. 3. St. Matthew records here that his disciples came to him <span class="cmt_word">for to show</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">to display</span>) <span class="cmt_word">him the buildings of the temple</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, the whole sacred enclosure). They had gathered from his words that destruction awaited this edifice, but as they gazed upon it they could scarcely bring themselves to believe in its coming overthrow. So as they gained some commanding point of view, they drew Christ's attention to its beauty, magnificence, and unequalled solidity, desiring him to explain further the mode and time of the catastrophe.
