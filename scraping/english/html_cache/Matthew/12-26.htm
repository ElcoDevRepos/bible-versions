The logic presented here is that it would be counterproductive for Satan to expel his own forces, as it would weaken his dominion. This reflects the broader biblical theme of spiritual warfare, where the kingdom of darkness is in opposition to the kingdom of God. The idea of a house divided is a common theme in Scripture, emphasizing the importance of unity and the futility of internal conflict.<p><b>he is divided against himself.</b><br>The concept of division within a kingdom or house is used to illustrate the impossibility of sustaining power and authority when internal strife exists. This principle is echoed in other biblical passages, such as <a href="/mark/3-24.htm">Mark 3:24-25</a> and <a href="/luke/11-17.htm">Luke 11:17</a>, where Jesus uses similar language to convey the same message. Theologically, this underscores the unity and coherence of God's kingdom in contrast to the chaos and disorder of Satan's realm.<p><b>How then can his kingdom stand?</b><br>This rhetorical question highlights the logical inconsistency in the Pharisees' accusation. If Satan were to undermine his own efforts, his kingdom would inevitably collapse. This statement also serves to affirm the strength and stability of God's kingdom, which is built on truth and righteousness. The imagery of a kingdom standing or falling is prevalent in biblical prophecy, such as in <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>, where God's eternal kingdom is contrasted with the transient nature of earthly kingdoms.

The Pharisees claim He did it &#8220;by Beelzebul.&#8221; In response, Jesus begins with the simple, observable premise: if the prince of demons were expelling his own agents, he would be working against his own interests.<p>- Cross references underline the same logic: <a href="/mark/3-23.htm">Mark 3:23</a> &#8220;How can Satan drive out Satan?&#8221;; <a href="/luke/11-17.htm">Luke 11:17-18</a> &#8220;Every kingdom divided against itself will be laid waste.&#8221;<p>- By stating &#8220;If,&#8221; Jesus is not granting that Satan really empowered Him; He is exposing the absurdity of their claim. In effect He says, &#8220;Let&#8217;s suppose your accusation is correct and see where it leads.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he is divided against himself</b><p>- A kingdom, army, or household torn by civil war cannot last (<a href="/mark/3-24.htm">Mark 3:24-25</a>). The same principle is true for any sphere of authority&#8212;including Satan&#8217;s.<p>- Scripture shows the destructive power of internal division: <a href="/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31-33</a> with Korah&#8217;s rebellion, <a href="/bsb/2_samuel/15.htm">2 Samuel 15</a> with Absalom, <a href="/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">1 Corinthians 1:10-13</a> within the church. Whenever leaders fight their own followers, collapse follows.<p>- If Satan&#8217;s forces were genuinely attacking each other, their alliance against humanity would crumble. Yet the Gospels consistently portray demons cooperating in opposition to Christ (<a href="/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a>, <a href="/luke/11-26.htm">Luke 11:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>How then can his kingdom stand?</b><p>- Jesus presses the conclusion: a divided kingdom cannot remain. Since Satan&#8217;s kingdom is plainly still operating (<a href="/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>, <a href="/1_john/5-19.htm">1 John 5:19</a>), the Pharisees&#8217; charge falls apart.<p>- The phrase &#8220;his kingdom&#8221; acknowledges that Satan does possess a real but temporary dominion in this present age (<a href="/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>, <a href="/2_corinthians/4-4.htm">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>). Jesus does not deny the existence of that kingdom; He exposes its single-minded hostility toward God.<p>- By demonstrating power over demons without serving Satan, Jesus declares Himself stronger than the &#8220;strong man&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/12-29.htm">Matthew 12:29</a>). His miracles signal the inauguration of a superior kingdom that will ultimately crush the enemy (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>, <a href="/revelation/20-10.htm">Revelation 20:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/12-26.htm">Matthew 12:26</a> shows Jesus dismantling the Pharisees&#8217; accusation with plain logic. If Satan were casting out his own demons, his realm would collapse&#8212;but it plainly continues, proving Jesus&#8217; authority comes from God, not the devil. The verse highlights three truths: Satan&#8217;s kingdom is real, unity is essential for any kingdom&#8217;s survival, and Christ&#8217;s power over demons reveals the arrival of a greater, uncontested kingdom&#8212;the kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">If Satan cast out Satan.</span>--In the Greek the name has the article in both places, as pointing to the one great adversary. It is not that one Satan casts out another, but that he, on the assumption of the Pharisees, casts out himself.

(Comp. <a href="/john/13-27.htm" title="And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus to him, That you do, do quickly.">John 13:27</a>.)
