This was the only area where non-Jews could come to worship the God of Israel. The Temple was the center of Jewish religious life, and its courts were meant to be a place of prayer and reverence. Jesus' entry into the temple courts signifies His authority and His concern for the purity of worship. This act fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/malachi/3.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, where the Lord is said to come suddenly to His temple.<p><b>and drove out all who were buying and selling there.</b><br>The buying and selling in the temple courts were related to the sacrificial system. Pilgrims coming to Jerusalem for Passover needed to purchase animals for sacrifices, and money changers were necessary because Roman currency had to be exchanged for Tyrian shekels, the only currency accepted for the temple tax. However, this commercial activity had become exploitative and was conducted in a manner that disrupted the sanctity of the temple. Jesus' actions demonstrate His zeal for true worship and His condemnation of the corruption and commercialization of religious practices, echoing the prophetic call for justice and righteousness found in <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/7-11.htm">Jeremiah 7:11</a>.<p><b>He overturned the tables of the money changers</b><br>The money changers were essential for the temple economy, but their practices had become corrupt, often involving exorbitant exchange rates. By overturning their tables, Jesus symbolically disrupts the corrupt system and asserts His authority over the temple. This act of cleansing is reminiscent of the prophetic actions of Old Testament prophets who often used dramatic gestures to convey God's message. It also foreshadows the ultimate cleansing and renewal that Jesus would bring through His death and resurrection.<p><b>and the seats of those selling doves.</b><br>Doves were the offerings of the poor, as prescribed in <a href="/leviticus/5-7.htm">Leviticus 5:7</a>. By targeting those selling doves, Jesus highlights the exploitation of the most vulnerable worshippers. His actions emphasize God's concern for justice and the proper treatment of the poor. This act also points to Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice, who would replace the need for animal offerings. The cleansing of the temple serves as a type of Christ's redemptive work, purifying and restoring true worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, demonstrating righteous anger and authority over the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_courts.htm">Temple Courts</a></b><br>The outer area of the temple in Jerusalem, where commercial activities were taking place.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/money_changers.htm">Money Changers</a></b><br>Individuals who exchanged foreign currency for the temple currency, often at a profit.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sellers_of_doves.htm">Sellers of Doves</a></b><br>Merchants selling doves, which were used for sacrifices, particularly by the poor.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the temple was located, a central place of worship for the Jewish people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/righteous_anger.htm">Righteous Anger</a></b><br>Jesus' actions demonstrate that there is a place for righteous anger, especially when it comes to defending the sanctity of worship and God's house.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purity_of_worship.htm">Purity of Worship</a></b><br>The temple was meant to be a place of prayer and worship, not commercial exploitation.

St. Mark (<a href="/mark/11-11.htm" title="And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about on all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.">Mark 11:11</a>) says definitely that on the day of His solemn entry He went into the Temple, "looked round about on all things there,"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> on the scene of traffic and disorder described in this verse--and then, "the evening-tide being come" (or, "the hour being now late"), went back to Bethany, and did what is here narrated on the following day. So, with a like difference of order, St. Mark places the sentence on the barren fig-tree on the next morning, and before the cleansing of the Temple. (Comp. Note on <a href="/matthew/21-17.htm" title="And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.">Matthew 21:17</a>.) St. John (<a href="/context/john/2-13.htm" title="And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.">John 2:13-25</a>) records an act of like nature as occurring at the commencement of our Lord's ministry, on the first visit to Jerusalem after His baptism. Critics who have started with the assumption that the repetition of such an act was impossible, have inferred accordingly that the narrative has been misplaced either by the Three or by St. John, some holding with the latter and some with the former, on grounds more or less arbitrary. From the purest human historical point of view, we may, I believe, accept both narratives as true. If Jesus of Nazareth had been only a patriot Jew, filled with an intense enthusiasm for the holiness of the Temple, what more likely than that He should commence His work with a protest against its desecration? If the evils against which He thus protested, after being suppressed for a time, reappeared in all their enormity, what more probable than that He should renew the protest at this stage of His work, backed as He now was by the equal enthusiasm of the people? What more natural, again, than that the second cleansing should revive the memory of the first, and call up with it the words which are recorded by St. John, and not by the Three, and which served as the basis of the charge that He had threatened to destroy the Temple (<a href="/context/john/2-20.htm" title="Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and will you raise it up in three days?">John 2:20-21</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-61.htm" title="And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.">Matthew 26:61</a>; <a href="/mark/14-58.htm" title="We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.">Mark 14:58</a>). There is--it cannot be concealed--a real difficulty in the omission of the earlier cleansing by the Three, and in the absence of any reference to the later cleansing by the Fourth; but the fact in either case is only one of many like facts incident to the structure of the Gospels. The Three knew nothing--or rather, they record nothing--as to our Lord's ministry in Jerusalem prior to this last entry. The Fourth, writing a Gospel supplementary either to the Three or to the current oral teaching which they embodied, systematically passes over, with one or two notable exceptions, what they had recorded, and confines his work to reporting, with marvellous vividness and fulness, specially selected incidents. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-17.</span> - <span class="accented">The second cleansing of the temple</span>. (<a href="/mark/11-15.htm">Mark 11:15-19</a>; <a href="/luke/19-45.htm">Luke 19:45-48</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Went into the temple.</span> The event here narrated seems to have taken place on the day following the triumphal entry; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. on the Monday of the Holy Week. This can be gathered from St. Mark's narrative, where it is stated that, on the day of triumph, Jesus was escorted to the temple, but merely "looked round about on all things," and then returned for the night to Bethany, visiting the temple again on the following morning, and driving out those who profaned it. St. Matthew often groups events, not in their proper chronological order, but in a certain logical sequence which corresponded with his design. Thus he connects the cleansing with the triumphal entry, in order to display another example of Christ's self-manifestation at this time, and his purpose to show who he was and to put forth his claims publicly. In this visit of Christ we see the King coming to his palace, the place where his honour dwelleth, the fitting termination of his glorious march. This cleansing of the temple must not be confounded with the earlier incident narrated by St. John (<a href="/john/2-13.htm">John 2:13</a>, etc.). The two acts marked respectively the beginning and close of Christ's earthly ministry, and denote the reverence which he taught for the house and the worshiper God. The part of the temple which he now visited, and which was profaned to secular use, was the court of the Gentiles, separated from the sanctuary by a stone partition, and considered of lesser sanctity, though really an integral part of the temple. <span class="cmt_word">Cast out all them that sold and bought.</span> In this large open space a market had been established, with the connivance, and much to the pecuniary emolument, of the priests. These let out the sacred area, of which they were the appointed guardians, to greedy and irreligious traders, who made a gain of others' piety. We find no trace of this market in the Old Testament; it probably was established after the Captivity, whence the Jews brought back that taste for commercial business and skill in financial matters for which they have ever since been celebrated. In the eyes of worldly-minded men the sanctity of a building and its appendages was no impediment to traffic and trade, hence they were glad to utilize the temple court, under the sanction of the priests, for the convenience of those who came from all regions to celebrate the great festivals. Here was sold all that was required for the sacrifices which worshippers were minded to offer - animals for victims, meal, incense, salt, etc. The scandalous abuse of the holy precincts, or the plain traces of it (if, as it was late in the day, the traffickers themselves had departed for a time), Christ had observed at his previous visit, when he "looked round about upon all things" (<a href="/mark/11-11.htm">Mark 11:11</a>), and now he proceeded to remedy the crying evil The details of the expulsion are not given. On the first occasion, we are told, he used "a scourge of small cords;" as far as we know, at this time he effected the purification unarmed and alone. It was a marvellous impulse that forced the greedy crew to obey the order of this unknown Man; their own consciences made them timid; they fled in dismay before the stern indignation of his eye, deserted their gainful trade to escape the reproach of that invincible zeal. <span class="cmt_word">Money changers.</span> These persons exchanged (for a certain percentage) foreign money or other coins for the half shekel demanded from all adults for the service of the temple (see on Matthew 17:24). They may have lent money to the needy. The sellers also probably played into their bands by refusing to receive any but current Jewish money in exchange for their wares. It is also certain that no coins stamped with a heathen symbol, or bearing a heathen monarch's image, could be paid into the temple treasury. <span class="cmt_word">The seats of</span> <span class="cmt_word">them that sold</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="cmt_word">doves.</span> These birds were used by the poor in the place of costlier victims (see <a href="/leviticus/12-6.htm">Leviticus 12:6</a>; <a href="/leviticus/14-22.htm">Leviticus 14:22</a>; <a href="/luke/2-24.htm">Luke 2:24</a>). The sellers were often women, who sat with tables before them on which were set cages containing the doves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">went</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#963;&#8134;&#955;&#952;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eis&#275;lthen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1525.htm">Strong's 1525: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go in, come in, enter.
