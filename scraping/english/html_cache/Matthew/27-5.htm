The act of throwing the silver into the temple signifies Judas's remorse and rejection of the blood money. The temple, specifically the area where the priests operated, was a sacred place, and Judas's action indicates a desperate attempt to rid himself of the guilt associated with his betrayal. The silver coins, likely Tyrian shekels, were used for temple offerings, adding irony to the situation as they were now tainted by betrayal. This act also reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and the gravity of Judas's actions.<p><b>Then he went away and hanged himself.</b><br>Judas's suicide is a tragic end to his story, highlighting the severe consequences of his betrayal. In the cultural context of the time, hanging was a method of suicide that indicated deep shame and despair. This act of self-destruction contrasts with Peter's repentance after denying Jesus, showing different responses to sin and guilt. Judas's death is also mentioned in <a href="/acts/1-18.htm">Acts 1:18</a>, where it describes his body falling and bursting open, which some scholars reconcile as a result of the hanging. Judas's demise serves as a somber reminder of the spiritual and moral consequences of rejecting Christ and the importance of seeking forgiveness and redemption.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the twelve disciples of Jesus, who betrayed Him for thirty pieces of silver.

Some difficulties present themselves on comparing this brief record with <a href="/acts/1-18.htm" title="Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out.">Acts 1:18</a>, which will be best examined in the Notes on that passage. Briefly, it may be said here that the horrors there recorded may have been caused by the self-murderer's want of skill, or the trembling agony that could not tie the noose firm enough. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He cast down the pieces of silver in the temple</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fb7;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1ff7;</span>, <span class="accented">in the sanctuary</span>, or, as good manuscripts read, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">into the sanctuary</span>). The priests were in the priests' court (which would be included in the term <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>), separated by a stone partition from the court of the Gentiles. Into the latter area Judas had pressed; and, hurrying to the wall of division, he flung the cursed shekels with all his force into the inner place, as if to rescind the iniquitous contract and to cast away its pollution. <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">departed.</span> He rushed away from the temple and the city into solitude, down into and across the valley of Hinnom, up the steep sides of the overhanging mountain - anywhere to escape human eyes, and, if it might be, to flee from himself. Vain endeavour! The memory of his useless crime haunts him; he has no hope in earth or heaven; life under this burden is no longer supportable. <span class="cmt_word">Went and hanged himself</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3b3;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, <span class="accented">he strangled himself</span>; <span class="accented">laqueo se suspendit</span>, Vulgate). He mounted some precipitous rock, and unwinding the girdle (for it was unnecessary to find and take a rope with him) which he wore, and in which he had doubtless carried the pieces of silver, fastened it round his neck, and securing it to some tree or projecting stone, flung himself from the height. The horrible result is told by St. Peter in his first address to the disciples (Acts 1:48), "Falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out." This may have resulted from the breaking of the girdle. A fragment of Papias gives another explanation, recounting that he was crushed and disembowelled by a passing waggon.
