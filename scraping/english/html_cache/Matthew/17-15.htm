In Jewish culture, addressing someone as "Lord" signifies respect and acknowledgment of their power. This mirrors other biblical instances where individuals seek Jesus' healing, such as the Canaanite woman in <a href="/matthew/15-22.htm">Matthew 15:22</a>. The request for mercy is a common biblical theme, emphasizing human dependence on divine grace.<p><b>he said.</b><br>The father is the speaker, demonstrating his role as an intercessor for his child.

In the biblical context, such symptoms were sometimes attributed to demonic influence, as seen in other healing narratives. The term "suffering terribly" underscores the severity of the boy's condition, highlighting the urgent need for divine intervention.<p><b>He often falls into the fire or into the water.</b><br>This detail illustrates the physical danger and unpredictability of the boy's condition. Fire and water are elements frequently mentioned in scripture, symbolizing purification and chaos, respectively. The mention of these elements may also evoke the trials faced by believers, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/43-2.htm">Isaiah 43:2</a>, where God promises protection through fire and water.

Jesus embodies that promise by rescuing the boy.<p>- Repeated falls reveal helplessness; only divine intervention can break the cycle, just as Peter sinking beneath the waves cried, &#8220;Lord, save me!&#8221; and Jesus immediately reached out (<a href="/matthew/14-30.htm">Matthew 14:30-31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/17-15.htm">Matthew 17:15</a> records a desperate father&#8217;s faith-filled cry to Jesus: recognizing His lordship, appealing for mercy, honestly naming the suffering, and detailing the peril. The verse teaches that Christ welcomes heartfelt petitions, possesses supreme authority over physical and demonic affliction, and stands ready to deliver those caught in relentless danger.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">Lunatick.</span>--See Note on <a href="/matthew/4-24.htm" title="And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought to him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.">Matthew 4:24</a>. The other Gospels add some further touches. The boy had a "dumb spirit." When the spirit seized him it "tore him," and he foamed at the mouth, and gnashed with his teeth. Slowly, and as with difficulty, the paroxysm passed off, and the sufferer was wasting away under the violence of the attacks. The phenomena described are, it need hardly be said, those of epilepsy complicated with insanity, a combination common in all countries, and likely to be aggravated where the "seizure," which the very word epilepsy implies, was the work of a supernatural power. A prolonged melancholy, an indescribable look of sadness, a sudden falling, and loss of consciousness, with or without convulsions, or passing into a tetanic stiffness, a periodical recurrence coinciding often with the new or full moon (hence probably the description of the boy as "lunatick"), grinding the teeth, foaming at the mouth, are all noted by medical writers as symptoms of the disease. The names by which it was known in the earlier stages of medical science were all indicative of the awe with which men looked on it. It was the "divine," the "sacred" disease, as being a direct supernatural infliction. The Latin synonym, <span class= "ital">morbus comitialis,</span> came from the fact that if a seizure of this kind occurred during the <span class= "ital">comitia,</span> or assemblies of the Roman Republic, it was looked upon as of such evil omen that the meeting was at once broken up, and all business adjourned. Whether there was in this case something more than disease, viz., a distinct possession by a supernatural force, is a question which belongs to the general subject of the "demoniacs" of the Gospel records. (See Note on 8:28.) Here, at any rate, our Lord's words (<a href="/matthew/17-21.htm" title="However, this kind goes not out but by prayer and fasting.">Matthew 17:21</a>) assume, even more emphatically than elsewhere, the reality of the possession. (See <a href="/mark/9-25.htm" title="When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying to him, You dumb and deaf spirit, I charge you, come out of him, and enter no more into him.">Mark 9:25</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - This verse in the Vulgate is contained in ver. 14. <span class="cmt_word">Have mercy on my son.</span> According to St. Luke, the father makes his plea more touching by adding that he was his only son - an appeal to which the Saviour's tender heart was always open, as when he stopped the bier at Nain, and said to the childless widow, "Weep not." <span class="cmt_word">He is lunatic</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). The Revised Version most unnecessarily renders the verb, <span class="accented">he is epileptic</span>. Doubtless the case in many respects simulated epilepsy, and might have been so described; but it seems inexpedient to conceal the actual word used, which gave the popular and probably correct view of one phase of the complaint. Surely a real fact well known to medical science underlies the term <span class="accented">lunacy</span>, in the catalogue of the diseased persons who were brought to Christ to be healed (<a href="/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>), we find a class called lunatics, distinct from the paralytic and possessed. It is by no means an exploded fallacy that the moon has some mysterious influence on certain constitutions, and produces an aggravation of symptoms in accordance with some of its changes. It was from observation of this phenomenon that this form of insanity was termed <span class="accented">seleniasmus</span> or <span class="accented">lunacy</span>. In the present instance the disease was complicated and of no ordinary nature. The other synoptists state that the child was possessed by a demon. This was the fact which differentiated the malady from any merely organic sickness. It was in truth epilepsy accompanied by or occasioned by demoniacal possession. St. Matthew does not mention the possession in his introductory account, but he afterwards (ver. 18) speaks of the demon departing. <span class="cmt_word">Sore vexed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">is in evil case</span>; suffers grievously. He was affected with terrible paroxysms, which are detailed more at length by Mark and Luke. Matthew narrates some of the effects of the mania upon the victim. <span class="cmt_word">Ofttimes he falleth into the fire.</span> The fits, coming on suddenly and without warning, brought the sufferer into imminent dangers, perhaps produced suicidal tendencies, which urged him to destroy himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/17-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Lord,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Kyrie)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Vocative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2962.htm">Strong's 2962: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lord, master, sir; the Lord.
