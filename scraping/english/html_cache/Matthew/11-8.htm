In the context of <a href="/matthew/11.htm">Matthew 11</a>, Jesus is speaking to the crowds about John the Baptist. The rhetorical question implies that the people went out to see something significant, not just an ordinary spectacle. This reflects the human tendency to seek out spiritual truth and the fulfillment of prophecy, as John was the forerunner of the Messiah, fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>.<p><b>A man dressed in fine clothes?</b><br>This phrase contrasts the ascetic lifestyle of John the Baptist with the opulence associated with wealth and power. John was known for his simple clothing made of camel's hair and a leather belt (<a href="/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>), symbolizing his prophetic role and dedication to God. The mention of fine clothes suggests a worldly standard of greatness, which John did not embody. This highlights the biblical theme that true greatness is not measured by external appearances but by one's faithfulness to God's calling.<p><b>Look, those who wear fine clothing are found in kings&#8217; palaces.</b><br>This statement underscores the distinction between worldly and spiritual authority. Fine clothing is associated with royalty and the elite, who reside in palaces. In the historical context, Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee, would have been an example of someone living in luxury. By pointing this out, Jesus emphasizes that John&#8217;s authority and significance come from his divine mission, not from earthly status. This also foreshadows Jesus' own ministry, where He, like John, would not conform to worldly expectations of a king, as seen in His humble birth and life (<a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A prophet and forerunner of Jesus Christ, known for his ascetic lifestyle and powerful preaching of repentance.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker in this passage, addressing the crowd about their expectations and perceptions of John the Baptist.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The people who went out to the wilderness to see John the Baptist, curious about his message and identity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/kings'_palaces.htm">Kings&#8217; Palaces</a></b><br>Symbolic of wealth, power, and worldly status, contrasting with John&#8217;s humble and austere lifestyle.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wilderness.htm">Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting where John the Baptist preached, representing a place of spiritual preparation and encounter with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_humility_and_simplicity.htm">Value of Humility and Simplicity</a></b><br>John the Baptist&#8217;s lifestyle challenges us to prioritize spiritual richness over material wealth and status.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/expectations_vs._reality.htm">Expectations vs. Reality</a></b><br>Jesus prompts us to examine our expectations of spiritual leaders and the Kingdom of God, urging us to seek truth over spectacle.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/true_greatness.htm">True Greatness</a></b><br>True greatness in God&#8217;s Kingdom is not measured by external appearances but by faithfulness and obedience to God&#8217;s call.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/contrast_with_worldly_values.htm">Contrast with Worldly Values</a></b><br>The passage invites believers to reflect on how worldly values can distort our understanding of God&#8217;s work and His messengers.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/focus_on_inner_transformation.htm">Focus on Inner Transformation</a></b><br>Encourages believers to focus on inner transformation and character development, aligning with God&#8217;s perspective.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_11_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 11:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_11_8_Redefining_true_greatness.htm">How does Matthew 11:8 challenge our understanding of true greatness in God's kingdom?

No, not so, again. They that wear soft clothing, or, as in St. Luke's report, "they that are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately," are in kings' houses. The words had a more pointed reference than at first sight appears. Jewish historians (Jost, <span class= "ital">Gesch. Jud.</span> I. 259.) record how in the early days of Herod the Great a section of the scribes had attached themselves to his policy and party, and in doing so had laid aside the sombre garments of their order, and had appeared in the gorgeous raiment worn by Herod's other courtiers. The Herodians of the Gospel history were obviously the successors of these men in policy, and probably also in habits and demeanour; and the reference to "kings' houses" admits of no other application than to the palace of Antipas. We may trace, with very little hesitation, a vindictive retaliation for these very words in the "gorgeous robe" with which Herod arrayed Him in mockery when the Tetrarch and the Christ stood for one brief hour face to face with each other (<a href="/luke/23-11.htm" title="And Herod with his men of war set him at nothing, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.">Luke 23:11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses</span>. Menahem the Essene was by the wish of Herod the Great made deputy to Hillel in the Sanhedrin, but afterwards left his office. "Whither did he go out? Abai said. He went out to destruction. Rabba said, He went out for the service of the king. There is also a Baraitha [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> an 'uncanonical' Mishna] to this effect, that Menahem went out for the service of the king, and there went out with him eighty pairs of disciples clothed in Syrian robes" (Talm. Bab., 'Chagigah,' 16b, edit. Streane). It has been conjectured, though hardly on sufficient evidence, that our Lord was thinking of this case; but the Talmudic passage at least illustrates the gorgeousness of the apparel of the courtiers, and suggests the luxury of living that St. Luke speaks of ("They which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts"). It is, however, only fair to Menahem to say that Gratz ('Geschichte der Judaer,' 3. p. 230, edit. 1877) is able to suppose that he merely went back again to his solitude. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/11-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">What</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(ti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
