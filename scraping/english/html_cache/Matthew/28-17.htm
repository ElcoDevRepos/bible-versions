The setting is significant as Galilee was the region where Jesus began His ministry and performed many miracles. This meeting fulfills Jesus' promise to appear to His disciples after His resurrection (<a href="/matthew/26-32.htm">Matthew 26:32</a>). The physical sighting of Jesus confirms the reality of His bodily resurrection, a cornerstone of Christian faith, affirming His victory over death and His divine nature.<p><b>they worshiped Him</b><br>The act of worship indicates recognition of Jesus' divine status. In Jewish culture, worship was reserved for God alone, so the disciples' worship of Jesus underscores their acknowledgment of His deity. This moment reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies regarding the Messiah's divine nature (<a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>) and aligns with New Testament affirmations of Jesus' divinity (<a href="/john/1.htm">John 1:1</a>, <a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>). Worship here is both a physical act and a spiritual acknowledgment of Jesus as Lord and Savior.<p><b>but some doubted</b><br>This phrase highlights the human struggle with faith and doubt, even among those who were closest to Jesus. The Greek word for "doubted" can imply hesitation or uncertainty. This doubt does not necessarily indicate disbelief but rather a struggle to comprehend the miraculous nature of the resurrection. It serves as a reminder of the disciples' humanity and the process of growing in faith. This moment of doubt is echoed in other Gospel accounts, such as Thomas' skepticism (<a href="/john/20-24.htm">John 20:24-29</a>), and it emphasizes the importance of faith in the unseen (<a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The resurrected Lord who appears to His disciples, affirming His victory over death and His divine nature.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who witness His resurrection.

By accepting it, Jesus unmistakably affirms His deity (<a href="/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a>; 10:30).<p>&#8226; Earlier, the disciples had worshiped Him after He stilled the storm (<a href="/matthew/14-33.htm">Matthew 14:33</a>), but the resurrection seals their conviction that He is &#8220;Lord and God&#8221; (<a href="/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>).<p>&#8226; Their worship likely included falling at His feet (<a href="/matthew/28-9.htm">Matthew 28:9</a>) and verbal praise, echoing the heavenly refrain, &#8220;Worthy is the Lamb&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/5-12.htm">Revelation 5:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but some doubted</b><p>The text candidly adds, &#8220;but some doubted.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Doubt here is hesitation rather than unbelief&#8212;a momentary struggle to process the overwhelming reality before them (compare <a href="/luke/24-41.htm">Luke 24:41</a>, &#8220;they still could not believe it because of their joy and amazement&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Jesus does not rebuke but reassures; immediately after this verse He commissions them (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18&#8211;20</a>), demonstrating that imperfect faith can still be used powerfully (<a href="/mark/9-24.htm">Mark 9:24</a>; Jude 22&#8211;23).<p>&#8226; The honesty of Scripture in recording doubt underscores its reliability; eyewitnesses admit their own weakness, inviting readers to trust the narrative (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5&#8211;7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/28-17.htm">Matthew 28:17</a> shows real disciples encountering the real, risen Jesus.

The act, as has been said, was not new in itself, but it seems certain that our Lord's manifestations of His Presence after the Resurrection had made the faith of the disciples stronger and clearer (comp. <a href="/john/20-28.htm" title="And Thomas answered and said to him, My LORD and my God.">John 20:28</a>), and so the act acquired a new significance.<p><span class= "bld">Some doubted.</span>--It seems hard at first to conceive how those who had been present in the upper chamber at Jerusalem (<a href="/context/john/20-19.htm" title="Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.">John 20:19-26</a>) could still feel doubt; but the narrative of <a href="/john/21-4.htm" title="But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.">John 21:4</a> throws some light upon it. There was something mysterious and supernatural in the manifestation of the glorified body--outlines, at first indistinct and scarcely recognised, and then the whole form seen as it had been seen in life. The more devoted and loving disciples were probably, here as before, the first to recognise their Lord. Others questioned whether it was a phantom (comp. Notes on <a href="/matthew/14-26.htm" title="And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.">Matthew 14:26</a>) or a reality.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They worshipped him.</span> Evidently here they, or the majority of those present (for it is plain that others beside the apostles were there), adored him as God and Lord. This is the first time that this action of supreme worship is mentioned in connection with the disciples, though the women had offered the same homage to him (ver. 9). <span class="cmt_word">But</span> <span class="cmt_word">some doubted</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span> - without <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> - <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). (For the verb, comp. <a href="/matthew/14-31.htm">Matthew 14:31</a>.) The doubters could not have been any of the eleven, for they had seen the Lord more than once at Jerusalem, and had had indubitable proofs that he had risen from the dead, and was no mere spirit or spiritual appearance, but possessed of his former body, with new powers, faculties, and laws. Those who for the moment doubted did not hesitate to acknowledge his resurrection, but his identity. They were, perhaps, at a distance. Christ may have appeared surrounded with heavenly glory; at any rate, in a shape, or vesture, or with an aspect with which they were not familiar; hence in this majestic form, they failed to recognize the "despised and rejected of men," the lowly Jesus whom they had known (cf. <a href="/john/21-4.htm">John 21:4</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/28-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they saw</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7984;&#948;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(idontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Him,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
