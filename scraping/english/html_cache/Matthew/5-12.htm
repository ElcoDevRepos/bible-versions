The Greek words used here, "chairo" (rejoice) and "agalliao" (be glad), suggest an exuberant and triumphant joy. This is a countercultural response, as persecution typically brings sorrow. The call to rejoice is rooted in the understanding that suffering for righteousness aligns believers with Christ's own experiences and promises. This joy is not based on present circumstances but on the assurance of future reward and the presence of the Holy Spirit (<a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>, <a href="/philippians/4-4.htm">Philippians 4:4</a>).<p><b>because great is your reward in heaven</b><br>The promise of a "great reward" in heaven provides motivation and hope for enduring persecution. This reward is not specified in detail but is understood to be eternal and far surpassing any earthly suffering. The concept of heavenly rewards is consistent throughout Scripture, emphasizing the eternal perspective believers are to maintain (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>, <a href="/revelation/22-12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>). This reward is a testament to God's justice and faithfulness, ensuring that sacrifices made for His sake are not in vain.<p><b>for in the same way they persecuted the prophets before you</b><br>This phrase connects the experience of Jesus' followers with the historical persecution of the prophets in the Old Testament. Prophets like Elijah, Jeremiah, and Daniel faced opposition and suffering for delivering God's messages (<a href="/1_kings/19-10.htm">1 Kings 19:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/20-2.htm">Jeremiah 20:2</a>, <a href="/daniel/6-16.htm">Daniel 6:16</a>). This connection serves to validate the experiences of believers, placing them in a long line of God's faithful servants. It also highlights the continuity of God's redemptive plan and the consistent opposition faced by those who stand for His truth. This historical context reassures believers that persecution is not a sign of God's disfavor but rather a mark of fidelity to His mission.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of the Sermon on the Mount, delivering teachings to His disciples and the gathered crowd.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Refers to the Old Testament prophets who were persecuted for their faithfulness to God and His message.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The place of eternal reward and presence with God, promised to those who endure persecution for righteousness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who follow Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/persecution.htm">Persecution</a></b><br>The suffering and opposition faced by believers for their faith, likened to the experiences of the prophets.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/rejoicing_in_persecution.htm">Rejoicing in Persecution</a></b><br>Believers are called to rejoice and be glad even in the face of persecution, as it aligns them with the faithful prophets and Christ Himself.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_perspective.htm">Heavenly Perspective</a></b><br>Maintaining a focus on the eternal reward in heaven helps believers endure present trials and sufferings with hope and joy.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/historical_continuity.htm">Historical Continuity</a></b><br>Understanding that persecution is not new but has been experienced by God's faithful throughout history can provide comfort and solidarity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/endurance_and_faithfulness.htm">Endurance and Faithfulness</a></b><br>Encouragement to remain steadfast in faith, knowing that God sees and rewards those who endure persecution for His sake.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witness_and_testimony.htm">Witness and Testimony</a></b><br>Persecution can serve as a powerful testimony to the truth of the Gospel and the believer's commitment to Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_5_12_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 5:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_5_12_Persevere_in_persecution.htm">How does Matthew 5:12 encourage perseverance during persecution for righteousness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Reward_for_enduring_persecution.htm">What reward is promised in Matthew 5:12 for enduring persecution?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_5_12_OT_prophets_experiences.htm">How does Matthew 5:12 connect to the prophets' experiences in the Old Testament?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_find_joy_in_faith_trials_today.htm">In what ways can you rejoice when facing trials for your faith today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Matthew_5_12_inspire_support.htm">How can Matthew 5:12 inspire you to support persecuted Christians worldwide?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_5_12_s_message_for_persecuted_today.htm">How does Matthew 5:12 encourage believers facing persecution today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Matthew_5_12_s_message.htm">What historical context influenced the message of Matthew 5:12?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_5_12_and_heavenly_rewards.htm">How does Matthew 5:12 relate to the concept of heavenly rewards?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_your_reward_in_heaven_truly_great.htm">Is your reward in heaven truly great?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_is_genuine_love_without_hypocrisy.htm">Is your reward in heaven truly great?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/is_there_a_heaven.htm">Is there a Heaven?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/who_are_jehovah's_witnesses.htm">What are Jehovah's Witnesses and their core beliefs?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Matthew 5:12 Mean</div><b>Rejoice and be glad</b><p>&#8220;Rejoice and be glad&#8230;&#8221;

It may be added that the temper to which the "reward" is promised practically excludes the possibility of such claim as of right.

Our Lord uses no weaker expressions than those which describe the joy of the saints over the marriage of the Lamb (<a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>). The first word expresses joy as such, the second its effect in stirring the emotions; this thought St. Luke carries still further in <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>.

The doctrine of recompense, which has so large a place in Jewish thought (for a not often-sire example, cf. 'Ab.,' 2:19, Taylor) comes also in Christ's teaching. In <a href="/matthew/20-1.htm">Matthew 20:1-16</a> reward is expressly divested of its merely legal side, and exhibited as ultimately dependent on the will of the great Householder. But here it is mentioned without reference to the difficulties involved in the conception. These difficulties centre round the thought of obligation from God to man. But it may be doubted whether these difficulties are not caused by too exclusively regarding the metaphor of contracting, instead of considering the fact indicated by the metaphor. In God's kingdom every action has a corresponding effect, and this effect is the more certain in proportion as the action is in the sphere of morality. The idea of "quantity" hardly enters into the relation of such cause and effect. It is a question of moral correspondence. But such effect may not unfitly be called by the metaphors "hire," "reward," because, on the one hand, it is the result of conditions of moral service, and, on the other, such terms imply a Personal Will at the back of the effect, as well as a will on the part of the human "servant." (For the subject in other connexions, cf. Weiss, 'Bibl. Theol.,' &sect; 32; cf. also ver. 46; <a href="/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1, 2, 4, 5, 6</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">In heaven</span>. Our Lord says, "your reward is <span class="accented">great</span>," <span class="accented">because the</span> effect of your exercise of moral powers will be received in a sphere where the accidents of the surroundings will entirely correspond to moral influences. The effect of your present faithfulness, etc., will be seen in the reception Of powers of work and usefulness and enjoyment, beside which those possessed on earth will appear small. On earth the opportunities, etc., are but "few things;" hereafter they will be "many things" (<a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. Not as giving a reason for the assurance of reward (apparently Meyer and Weiss), but for the command, "rejoice," and be exceeding glad, and perhaps also for the predicate "blessed."
