The imagery of sheep is significant throughout Scripture, symbolizing those who follow God and are part of His flock. In <a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14</a>, Jesus refers to Himself as the Good Shepherd, indicating a personal relationship with His followers. The placement of the sheep on the right signifies their acceptance and approval by Christ. This aligns with the cultural understanding of the right side as a place of honor, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/110.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>, where the Messiah is invited to sit at the right hand of God.<p><b>and the goats on His left.</b><br>Goats, in contrast to sheep, often symbolize those who are rebellious or not part of God's chosen people. In the cultural context of the time, goats were seen as more independent and less obedient than sheep. The left side, in biblical symbolism, is often associated with judgment or disfavor. This distinction between sheep and goats is a metaphor for the final judgment, where Christ will separate those who have followed Him from those who have not. This separation is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/matthew/13-49.htm">Matthew 13:49</a>, where the wicked are separated from the righteous. The imagery underscores the importance of living a life in accordance with Christ's teachings to be counted among the sheep.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, Jesus is the Son of God, who often used parables to teach spiritual truths.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep.htm">Sheep</a></b><br>Symbolically represent the righteous, those who follow Christ and live according to His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/goats.htm">Goats</a></b><br>Symbolically represent the unrighteous, those who reject Christ or fail to live according to His teachings.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_right_hand.htm">The Right Hand</a></b><br>In biblical symbolism, the right hand is often associated with favor, honor, and authority.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_left_hand.htm">The Left Hand</a></b><br>In contrast, the left hand is often associated with disfavor or judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_righteous_living.htm">The Importance of Righteous Living</a></b><br>The distinction between sheep and goats highlights the importance of living a life that reflects Christ's teachings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_judgment.htm">The Role of Judgment</a></b><br>This passage reminds believers of the reality of divine judgment and the separation that will occur based on one's faith and actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_right_and_left.htm">Symbolism of the Right and Left</a></b><br>Understanding the cultural and biblical symbolism of the right and left hand can deepen our understanding of God's favor and judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_follow_the_good_shepherd.htm">The Call to Follow the Good Shepherd</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to follow Jesus, the Good Shepherd, who knows His sheep and leads them to eternal life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_faith_in_action.htm">Practical Faith in Action</a></b><br>The passage challenges Christians to examine their lives and ensure their faith is demonstrated through actions that align with Christ's teachings.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_25_33_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 25:33?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_25_33_Righteous_vs_Unrighteous.htm">How does Matthew 25:33 illustrate the separation of righteous and unrighteous?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Criteria_for_sheep_vs_goats_in_Matt_25_33.htm">What criteria determine who are "sheep" and "goats" in Matthew 25:33?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_be_among_the_sheep_daily.htm">How can we ensure we are among the "sheep" in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/OT_passages_on_Matt_25_33_separation.htm">What Old Testament passages relate to the separation in Matthew 25:33?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_25_33_s_call_to_serve_today.htm">How does Matthew 25:33 encourage us to serve others faithfully today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_sheep_vs_goats_in_Matt_25_33.htm">What does Matthew 25:33 mean by separating sheep from goats?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_25_33_s_impact_on_judgment.htm">How does Matthew 25:33 challenge our understanding of judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Historical_context_of_Matthew_25_33.htm">What historical context influences the interpretation of Matthew 25:33?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_25.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 25?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_social_gospel_entail.htm">What does the social gospel entail?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_defines_hanbali_islam.htm">What parables did Jesus teach in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_does_jesus_judge_actions_in_matt_25.htm">If good works don't save, why does Jesus say people will be judged by their actions in Matthew 25:31-46?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_actions_do_angels_perform.htm">Is Jesus the ultimate judge of humanity?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Matthew 25:33 Mean</div><b>He will place</b><p>&#8226;

This judicial distinction between the right and left hands is found in classical writers. Thus Plato, 'De Republica,' 10:13, tells of what a certain man, who revived after a cataleptic attack, saw when his soul left his body. he came to a mysterious place, where were two chasms in the earth, and two openings in the heavens opposite to them, and the judges of the dead sat between these. And when they gave judgment, they commanded the just to go on the right hand, and upwards through the heavens; but the unjust they sent to the left, and downwards; and both the just and unjust had upon them the marks of what they had done in the body. So Virgil makes the Elysian Fields to lie on the right of the palace of Dis, and the penal Tartarus on the left ('AEn.,' 6:540, etc.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/25-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He will place</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#964;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(st&#275;sei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Future Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2476.htm">Strong's 2476: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary stao stah'-o; to stand, used in various applications.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(ta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
