This approach signifies the culmination of Jesus' ministry and His impending passion. Jerusalem is often seen as a symbol of God's presence and the center of His redemptive work. The city's significance is highlighted in prophecies such as <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, which foretells the coming of a king to Jerusalem.<p><b>and came to Bethphage</b><br>Bethphage is a small village on the Mount of Olives, near Jerusalem.

This location is significant as it is the starting point for Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, fulfilling the prophecy of <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>. Bethphage's proximity to Jerusalem makes it a strategic location for Jesus to prepare for His entry.<p><b>on the Mount of Olives</b><br>The Mount of Olives is a ridge east of Jerusalem, significant in both Jewish and Christian eschatology. It is associated with the Messiah's coming and is the site of Jesus' ascension (<a href="/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9-12</a>). The Mount of Olives provides a panoramic view of Jerusalem, symbolizing the connection between Jesus' ministry and the city. It is also a place of prayer and reflection for Jesus, as seen in the Garden of Gethsemane.<p><b>Jesus sent out two disciples</b><br>Jesus' sending of two disciples reflects His authority and the importance of the task. The number two is significant in Jewish law, where two witnesses are required to establish a matter (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>).

We have to think of the journey up the narrow valley that leads from Jericho to Jerusalem. Our Lord, as before, was followed by the disciples, and they in their turn were followed by the crowds of pilgrims who were drawn to the Holy City either by the coming Passover or by wonder and curiosity to see what part the Prophet of Nazareth would take. Throughout the multitude, including the disciples, there was a feverish expectation that He would at last announce Himself as the Christ, and claim His kingdom (<a href="/luke/19-11.htm" title="And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.">Luke 19:11</a>).

The point of time with which the narrative, which now becomes more continuous, opens, may be fixed at the dawn of the first day of the week, the daybreak of Palm Sunday. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - <span class="accented">Triumphal entry into Jerusalem</span>.

If, as is believed, his crucifixion took place on the fourteenth day of the month Nisan, the triumphal entry must be assigned to the ninth, which day was reckoned to commence at one sunset and to continue till the follow-lug evening. This is regarded as the first day of the Holy Week, and is called by Christians from very early times Palm Sunday (see on ver. 10). He had probably gone straight from Jericho to Bethany. and spent the sabbath there with his friends (<a href="/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6</a>; <a href="/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Bethphage</span>. The name means <span class="accented">House of figs</span>, and was appropriate to a locality where such trees grew luxuriantly. The village has not been identified with certainty, though it is considered with great probability to be represented by <span class="accented">Kefr-et-Tur</span>, on a summit of Olivet, within the bounds of Jerusalem, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. two thousand cubits' distance from the city walls. Bethany is below the summit, in a nook on the western slope and somewhat further from the city. The Mount of Olives is separated from Jerusalem by the valley of the Kedron, and has three summits, the centre one being the highest; but though it is of no great elevation in itself, it stands nearly four thousand feet above the Dead Sea, from which it is distant some thirteen miles. <span class="cmt_word">Then sent Jesus two disciples.</span> Their names are not given, and it is useless to conjecture who they were, though probably Peter was one of them. Alford suggests that the triumphal entry in <a href="/mark/11.htm">Mark 11</a>. is related a day too soon, and that our Lord made two entries into Jerusalem - the first a private one (<a href="/mark/11-11.htm">Mark 11:11</a>), and the second, public, on the morrow But there is no sufficient reason to discredit the common tradition, and St. Mark's language can be otherwise explained. The deliberate preparation for t. he procession, and the intentional publicity, so contrary to Christ's usual habits, are very remarkable, and can be explained only by the fact that he was now assuming the character and claims of Messiah, and putting himself forward in his true dignity and office as "King of the Jews." By this display he made manifest that in him prophecy was fulfilled, and that the seeing eye and the believing heart might now find all that righteous men had long and wearily desired. This was the great opportunity which his mercy offered to Jerusalem, if only she would accept it and turn it to account. In fact, she acknowledged him as King one day, and then rejected and crucified him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
