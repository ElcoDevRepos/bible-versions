Her name suggests she was from Magdala, a town on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. She is mentioned in all four Gospels as a witness to Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection, highlighting her importance in the early Christian community. Her presence at the crucifixion underscores her loyalty and courage, as many of Jesus' male disciples had fled. Mary Magdalene's role as the first to witness the resurrected Christ (<a href="/john/20-11.htm">John 20:11-18</a>) emphasizes her significance in the narrative of the resurrection.<p><b>Mary the mother of James and Joseph</b><br>This Mary is often identified as Mary, the wife of Clopas, mentioned in <a href="/john/19-25.htm">John 19:25</a>. She is the mother of James the Less and Joseph (also called Joses), who were among the early followers of Jesus. James the Less is sometimes equated with James, son of Alphaeus, one of the Twelve Apostles. This Mary is distinct from Mary, the mother of Jesus, and her presence at the crucifixion indicates her dedication to Jesus and His ministry. Her inclusion in this passage highlights the role of women in supporting Jesus and His mission, even in the face of danger and despair.<p><b>and the mother of Zebedee&#8217;s sons</b><br>The mother of Zebedee's sons is identified as Salome in <a href="/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40</a>. She is the mother of James and John, two of Jesus' closest disciples, who were part of His inner circle. Salome's presence at the crucifixion, along with her sons' prominence among the disciples, suggests her active involvement in Jesus' ministry. In <a href="/matthew/20-20.htm">Matthew 20:20-21</a>, she is depicted as asking Jesus for her sons to sit at His right and left in His kingdom, indicating her belief in Jesus' messianic role.

The most natural explanation of it is that she came from the town of Magdala, or Magadan (the reading of the chief MSS.), not far from Tiberias, on the western side of the Sea of Galilee. The two prominent facts in her history prior to her connection with the Resurrection are, (1) that our Lord had cast "seven devils out of her" (<a href="/mark/16-9.htm" title="Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.">Mark 16:9</a>, <a href="/luke/8-2.htm" title="And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,">Luke 8:2</a>)--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> had freed her from some specially aggravated form of demoniacal possession--and that she followed Him and ministered to Him of her substance. The question whether she was identical (1) with Mary the sister of Lazarus, or (2) with the "woman which was a sinner" of <a href="/luke/7-37.htm" title="And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,">Luke 7:37</a>, will be better discussed in the Notes on the latter passage. It may be enough to intimate here my conviction that there is not the shadow of any evidence for either identification.<p><span class= "bld">Mary the mother of James and Joses.</span>--In St. Mark (<a href="/mark/15-40.htm" title="There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;">Mark 15:40</a>) she is described as the mother of "James the Less" (or, better, <span class= "ital">the Little</span>) "and Joses," the epithet distinguishing the former from James the son of Zebedee, and possibly also from James the son of Alphaeus. She may, however, have been identical with the wife of Clopas (possibly another form of Alphaeus) mentioned in <a href="/john/19-25.htm" title="Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.">John 19:25</a> as standing near the cross with the mother of the Lord, and, according to a natural construction of the words, described as her sister. In this case, the word "Little" would attach to the son of that sister. Whether the two names, which occur also in the list of the "brethren of the Lord" (<a href="/mark/6-3.htm" title="Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.">Mark 6:3</a>), indicate that she was the mother of those brethren, is a point which we have no evidence to settle. The presumption seems to me against it, as on this supposition the "brethren" would be identical with the three sons of Alphaeus in the list of the Twelve, a view which we have seen reason to reject (see Note on <a href="/matthew/12-46.htm" title="While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood without, desiring to speak with him.">Matthew 12:46</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 56.</span> - The historian mentions the most prominent of these pious women. <span class="cmt_word">Mary Magdalene</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x1f75;</span>, <span class="accented">the Magdalene</span>). She was a native of Magdala (<a href="/matthew/15-39.htm">Matthew 15:39</a>, where see note), a small village on the shore of Gennesaret. Some have identified her with the sister of Lazarus, chiefly because, taking her to be the "sinner" mentioned in <a href="/luke/7-37.htm">Luke 7:37</a>, she is related to have behaved in a somewhat similar way to our Lord as her namesake. But this is clearly a mistake. Of the two events, the locality, the scene, the occasion, the circumstances, are different. Of this Mary of Magdala we really know nothing, except that out of her Jesus had cast seven devils (<a href="/mark/16-9.htm">Mark 16:9</a>; <a href="/luke/8-2.htm">Luke 8:2</a>). That these were demons of impurity, or that she was the sinful woman who anointed our Lord, there is nothing whatever to prove; though the notion connected with the name Magdalene is so rooted in men's minds and language that it is impossible to eradicate it, however erroneous it may be shown to be. She had probably been one who was melancholy mad, and subject to fits; Christ had seen the spiritual cause of this malady, and removed it by freeing her from demoniacal possession. What wonder is it that she followed him from Galilee, tending him lovingly and anxiously until the end? <span class="cmt_word">Mary the mother of James and Joses.</span> Some manuscripts read <span class="accented">Joseph</span>; but the Received Text is correct. These two persons are mentioned among our Lord's "brethren" in <a href="/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55</a>. The former is called "James the Less" (<a href="/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40</a>), and is the apostle of that name. Mary is usually supposed to be the wife of Cleophas (<a href="/john/19-25.htm">John 19:25</a>), and the sister of the mother of our Lord; so that these two disciples would be Christ's first cousins. The matter is shrouded in difficulty, and cannot be decided with absolute certainty. From the present passage, at any rate, one fact is shown, that they were not Christ's uterine brothers - a truth which needed no mention, were not the dishonouring heresy of Helvidius still rife among us. <span class="cmt_word">The mother of Zebedee's children.</span> Salome (<a href="/matthew/20-20.htm">Matthew 20:20</a>; <a href="/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40</a>).
