The phrase indicates that Jesus is addressing a well-known principle from the Mosaic Law, which His audience would have been familiar with. This method of teaching highlights Jesus' authority to interpret and fulfill the Law, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>, where He states He came to fulfill the Law and the Prophets.<p><b>&#8216;Eye for eye and tooth for tooth.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase refers to the principle of lex talionis, or the law of retaliation, found in the Old Testament (<a href="/exodus/21-24.htm">Exodus 21:24</a>, <a href="/leviticus/24-20.htm">Leviticus 24:20</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/19-21.htm">Deuteronomy 19:21</a>). It was intended to limit retribution and ensure justice by prescribing a punishment equivalent to the offense. In its historical context, this law was a progressive step towards justice, preventing excessive vengeance and promoting fairness. However, by the time of Jesus, this principle was often misapplied, used to justify personal revenge rather than being administered through judicial systems. Jesus' teaching in the following verses (<a href="/matthew/5-39.htm">Matthew 5:39-42</a>) calls His followers to a higher standard of love and forgiveness, reflecting the character of God and pointing to the ultimate example of Jesus Himself, who did not retaliate when wronged (<a href="/1_peter/2-23.htm">1 Peter 2:23</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a

Jesus affirms its truth yet exposes how it was twisted into personal retaliation. Properly understood, &#8220;Eye for eye and tooth for tooth&#8221; restrains vengeance, upholds human worth, and points believers to entrust judgment to God while responding to wrongs with grace&#8212;an ethic fully revealed in the Savior who bore our sins without striking back.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">An eye for an eye.</span>--Here again the scribes first took their stand on the letter, regardless of the aim and purpose, of the Law, and then expanded it in a wrong direction. As originally given, it was a check on the "wild justice" of revenge. It said, where the equilibrium of right had been disturbed by outrage, that the work of the judge was not to do more than restore the equilibrium, unless, as in the case of theft, some further penalty was necessary for the prevention of crime. It was, in its essence, a limit in both directions. Not less than the "eye for an eye," for that might lead to connivance in guilt; not more, for that would open a fresh score of wrong. The scribes in their popular casuistry made the rule one not of judicial action only, but of private retaliation; and it was thus made the sanction of the vindictive temper that forgives nothing.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-48.</span> - The two remaining examples of the current teaching of the Law are very closely connected together, and, in fact, our Lord's corrections of them are intermingled in <a href="/luke/6-27.htm">Luke 6:27-36</a>. Yet the subjects are really distinct. In the first (vers. 38-42) our Lord speaks of the reception of injuries, in the second (vers. 43-48) of the treatment of those who do them. Godet's remarks (in his summary of <a href="/luke/6-27.htm">Luke 6:27-45</a>) on the use made by St. Luke of these examples are especially instructive. "These last two antitheses, which terminate in Matthew in the lofty thought (ver. 48) of man being elevated by love to the perfection of God, furnish Luke with the leading idea of the discourse as he presents it, namely, charity as the law of the new life." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-42.</span> - <span class="accented">The reception of injuries. </span> The Law inculcated that the injured should obtain from those who did the wrong exact compensation (on this being properly a command, not merely a permission, <span class="accented">vide</span> Mozley, 'Ruling Ideas,' etc., pp. 182, sqq.). Our Lord inculcates giving up of all in-sistance upon one's rights as an injured person, and entire submission to injuries, even as far as proffering the opportunity for fresh wrongs. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth</span>. No short phrase could more accurately describe the spirit of the Mosaic legislation. Offences against individuals were to be punished by the injured individual receiving back, as it were, the exact compensation from him who had injured him. While this was originally observed literally, it was in Mishnic times (and probably in the time of our Lord) softened to payment of money (<span class="accented">vide</span> Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.'). The phrase comes three times in the Pentateuch (<a href="/exodus/21-24.htm">Exodus 21:24</a>; <a href="/leviticus/24-20.htm">Leviticus 24:20</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/19-21.htm">Deuteronomy 19:21</a>). Notice: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The LXX. has the accusative in each case, although only in the first does a verb precede. Probably the expression had already become proverbial in Greek even before the translation of the LXX. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The Hebrew of <a href="/deuteronomy/19-21.htm">Deuteronomy 19:21</a> is slightly different from that of the other two passages, and as the preposition there used (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;</span>) is not so necessarily rendered by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;</span>, that passage is perhaps the least likely of the three to have been in our Lord's mind now. It seems likely, however, that he was not thinking of any one of the three passages in particular. The words served him as a summary of the Law in this respect. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/5-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">You have heard</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7976;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(&#274;kousate)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
