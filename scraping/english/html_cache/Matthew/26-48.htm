His actions fulfill the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, where a close friend turns against the psalmist. The arrangement of a signal indicates premeditation and a calculated betrayal. In the cultural context of the time, signals were often used in covert operations to ensure the correct target was identified, especially in a crowded or dimly lit setting like the Garden of Gethsemane at night.<p><b>&#8220;The One I kiss is the man;</b><br>The act of kissing was a common greeting in Jewish culture, symbolizing respect and affection. Judas's use of a kiss as a signal for betrayal is particularly poignant, as it perverts a gesture of love into one of treachery. This act highlights the depth of Judas's betrayal, as he uses an intimate sign to identify Jesus to His captors. The kiss also serves as a stark contrast to the genuine love and loyalty expected among Jesus's followers.<p><b>arrest Him.&#8221;</b><br>The directive to arrest Jesus underscores the legal and political maneuvering at play. The religious leaders sought to arrest Jesus quietly to avoid public uproar, as He was popular among the people. This moment marks the beginning of Jesus's Passion, leading to His crucifixion. The arrest fulfills prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53-7.htm">Isaiah 53:7</a>, where the suffering servant is led like a lamb to the slaughter, and it sets in motion the events that lead to the fulfillment of God's redemptive plan through Jesus's death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the twelve disciples of Jesus, who betrayed Him for thirty pieces of silver.
