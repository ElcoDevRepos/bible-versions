It is known as the City of David, as King David was born and anointed there (<a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>). The mention of Bethlehem in Judea distinguishes it from another Bethlehem located in the region of Zebulun (<a href="/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a>). This town is prophesied as the birthplace of the Messiah, fulfilling the prophecy in <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, which highlights its seemingly insignificant status yet its pivotal role in God's redemptive plan. Bethlehem's connection to David underscores the messianic expectation of a ruler from David's lineage.<p><b>they replied,</b><br>The response comes from the chief priests and scribes, religious leaders who were well-versed in the Hebrew Scriptures. Their knowledge of the prophecies concerning the Messiah's birthplace demonstrates the widespread expectation of a coming deliverer. This interaction occurs during Herod the Great's reign, a time of political tension and messianic hope among the Jewish people. The leaders' ability to quickly reference the prophecy indicates the importance of scriptural literacy and the anticipation of the Messiah's arrival.<p><b>for this is what the prophet has written:</b><br>The prophet referred to here is Micah, whose writings are part of the Twelve Minor Prophets in the Old Testament. <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a> specifically predicts the birthplace of the Messiah, emphasizing God's sovereignty in fulfilling His promises. This prophecy, written approximately 700 years before Christ's birth, highlights the divine orchestration of events leading to Jesus' incarnation. The citation of prophecy underscores the belief in the authority and reliability of Scripture, as well as the continuity of God's plan from the Old Testament to the New Testament. The fulfillment of this prophecy in Jesus' birth affirms His identity as the promised Messiah and King.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethlehem.htm">Bethlehem</a></b><br>A small town in Judea, significant as the prophesied birthplace of the Messiah.

The contrast warns us that familiarity with the Bible, without a willing heart, can leave us unmoved (<a href="/james/4-17.htm">James 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene demonstrates that God can use even indifferent scholars to direct seekers to His truth (<a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>; <a href="/john/11-49.htm">John 11:49-52</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for this is what the prophet has written:</b><p>&#8226; The counselors ground their answer not in speculation but in the written Word&#8212;Micah&#8217;s prophecy (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>).

Their ready reply highlights Scripture&#8217;s authority, clarity, and reliability, while their inaction contrasts with the magi&#8217;s faith-driven pursuit.
