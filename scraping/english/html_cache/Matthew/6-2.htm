The act of giving to the needy is deeply rooted in Jewish tradition, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>, which commands generosity towards the poor. The early church continued this practice, as evidenced in <a href="/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44-45</a>, where believers shared their possessions with those in need. Giving is not just a social duty but a spiritual act of worship and obedience to God.<p><b>do not sound a trumpet before you</b><br>The imagery of sounding a trumpet suggests drawing attention to oneself. In ancient times, trumpets were used to announce significant events or gatherings. Here, it symbolizes the act of seeking public recognition for one's charitable deeds. This behavior contrasts with the humility and discretion that Jesus advocates. The trumpet metaphor may also allude to the practice of announcing almsgiving in a way that seeks human praise rather than divine approval.<p><b>as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets</b><br>The term "hypocrites" refers to those who perform acts of righteousness for show rather than from genuine faith. In the cultural context of first-century Judaism, synagogues were central to community life, and public streets were bustling with activity. By highlighting these locations, Jesus points out the desire for public acclaim. The term "hypocrite" originally referred to an actor in Greek theater, suggesting a person who is pretending or putting on a false front.<p><b>to be honored by men</b><br>This phrase underscores the motivation behind the hypocrites' actions: seeking human approval rather than God's. The desire for honor from others can lead to pride and self-righteousness, which are contrary to the humility that Jesus teaches. This pursuit of human praise is fleeting and ultimately unfulfilling, as it does not align with the eternal values of God's kingdom.<p><b>Truly I tell you, they already have their full reward</b><br>The phrase "Truly I tell you" is a solemn affirmation, emphasizing the certainty of Jesus' statement. The "full reward" refers to the temporary and superficial recognition received from people, which is the only reward the hypocrites will get. This contrasts with the eternal rewards promised by God for those who give with pure motives, as seen in <a href="/matthew/6-4.htm">Matthew 6:4</a>, where Jesus assures that the Father will reward what is done in secret. The concept of reward is a recurring theme in Scripture, highlighting the difference between earthly and heavenly treasures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The speaker of this teaching, providing guidance on righteous living.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hypocrites.htm">Hypocrites</a></b><br>- Individuals who perform acts of righteousness for public recognition rather than genuine compassion.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/synagogues.htm">Synagogues</a></b><br>- Jewish places of worship where hypocrites seek public approval.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/streets.htm">Streets</a></b><br>- Public places where acts of charity are performed for show.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/n/needy.htm">Needy</a></b><br>- Those who are in need of assistance, the intended recipients of genuine charity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sincerity_in_giving.htm">Sincerity in Giving</a></b><br>Our acts of charity should be motivated by genuine love and compassion, not by a desire for recognition or praise from others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_hypocrisy.htm">The Danger of Hypocrisy</a></b><br>Hypocrisy in religious practices is condemned by Jesus.

Generosity is not optional; it is woven into obedience. Other passages reinforce this normal practice: &#8220;There will never cease to be poor in the land; therefore I command you to open wide your hand&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>). Likewise, &#8220;Whoever is kind to the poor lends to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/19-17.htm">Proverbs 19:17</a>) and &#8220;It is more blessed to give than to receive&#8221; (<a href="/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>). The Savior&#8217;s wording&#8212;&#8220;when,&#8221; not &#8220;if&#8221;&#8212;frames almsgiving as a regular, grateful response to God&#8217;s grace.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>do not sound a trumpet before you</b><p>The image is vivid: drawing noisy attention to yourself before you help someone. Even if no literal horn is blown, self-promotion can be loud in other ways&#8212;social media boasts, casual name-dropping, or calculated photo-ops. Paul reminds us, &#8220;If I give all I possess to the poor but have not love, I gain nothing&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/13-3.htm">1 Corinthians 13:3</a>). Quiet giving guards the heart from pride and keeps the spotlight on the Lord who supplies both the gift and the giver.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets</b><p>&#8220;Hypocrites&#8221; refers to religious actors who stage righteousness for an audience. In <a href="/matthew/23-5.htm">Matthew 23:5</a> they &#8220;do all their deeds to be seen by men.&#8221; Whether inside sacred spaces (&#8220;synagogues&#8221;) or public squares (&#8220;streets&#8221;), the motive is the same: applause. Jesus later warns, &#8220;Beware of the scribes&#8230; who like greetings in the marketplaces&#8221; (<a href="/luke/20-46.htm">Luke 20:46</a>). True devotion does not change with the setting; integrity stays consistent whether pews or pavement surround us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to be honored by men</b><p>Human praise is a small, fragile reward, yet it can captivate the heart. <a href="/john/12-43.htm">John 12:43</a> exposes the danger: &#8220;They loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.&#8221; Paul asks, &#8220;Am I now seeking the approval of men, or of God?&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>). When applause becomes the goal, God&#8217;s glory is displaced, and giving turns into self-advertisement.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Truly I tell you</b><p>Jesus introduces an authoritative declaration. Each &#8220;Truly&#8221; (Amen) underscores absolute reliability. Earlier He affirmed, &#8220;Until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest letter&#8230; will by any means disappear from the Law&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>). What follows is not a suggestion; it is a certainty delivered by the One who cannot lie.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they already have their full reward</b><p>Public admiration is immediate, but it exhausts the account&#8212;nothing remains for eternity. <a href="/luke/6-24.htm">Luke 6:24</a> issues the sober verdict: &#8220;Woe to you who are rich, for you have already received your comfort.&#8221; In contrast, hidden generosity stores treasure in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-4.htm">Matthew 6:4</a>), and works done for Christ survive the testing fire (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-14.htm">1 Corinthians 3:14</a>). Choose the reward that lasts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Giving is expected, but motives matter. Quiet, Christ-centered generosity pleases the Father and lays up eternal treasure, while public showmanship earns fleeting applause&#8212;and nothing more.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Alms.</span>--The history of the word is singularly interesting.

It passed with this meaning untranslated into the language of Latin Christendom, and from that again into European languages, in various forms, "aumone," "almose," and at last the word of six syllables and rich fulness of meaning contracts and collapses into our modern English "alms."<p><span class= "bld">Do not sound a trumpet before thee.</span>--Two conjectural interpretations have been given of the words:--It has been supposed (1) that the wealthy Pharisees had a trumpet literally blown before them, to give notice to the poor of the neighbourhood that they were distributing their alms; (2) that the words refer to the clang of the money as it fell into the metal trumpet-shaped alms-boxes which were found in the synagogue, a clang which came as sweet music to the ears of the purse-proud giver. But as regards (1), the best scholars have found no trace of any such practice in Jewish literature, and it is hardly credible that such a thing could have been done in the synagogues; and (2) seems hardly adequate to the active meaning of the verb. There is no reason, however, for taking the words so literally. The figure of speech which describes a vain man as being "his own trumpeter," or making a "flourish of trumpets" about his own acts, has been, or might be. common in every country where trumpets have been used. What is meant is that, whether in the "offertories" of the synagogue or the alms given to beggars in the streets, there was a parade of benevolence which practically summoned men to gaze and admire.<p><span class= "bld">As the hypocrites do.</span>--Here again the word has a history of its own. Derived from a Greek verb which signifies answering, taking part in a dialogue, acting a part in a play, the noun in classical Greek was used simply for an actor, a man who plays a part. In one passage only in the LXX. version of the Old Testament (<a href="/job/36-13.htm" title="But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he binds them.">Job 36:13</a>) it appears in the figurative sense of one who feigns a virtue which he has not. It thus lay ready for the wider use which the Evangelists have given it (it is not used by any writer of the New Testament except St. Matthew, St. Mark, and St. Luke), and passed with this new meaning, hardly altered in form, first into Latin and then into most of the languages of modern Europe.<p><span class= "bld">The streets.</span>--More strictly, the <span class= "ital">lanes</span> or <span class= "ital">alleys</span> of a city, as distinguished from the wider streets, properly so called, of <a href="/matthew/6-5.htm" title="And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:5</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-19.htm" title="He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.">Matthew 12:19</a>, and elsewhere.<p><span class= "bld">They have their reward.</span>--The Greek is more expressive: <span class= "ital">They have to the full, and so exhaust.</span> There is nothing more for them to look for. They bargained for that praise of men, and they get it; but they sought not the honour that cometh of God only, and therefore He gives them none.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - <span class="accented">Almsgiving.</span> Matthew only. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>. A deduction from the general principle laid down in ver. 1. <span class="cmt_word">When thou doest alms</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1fc7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>). The exact phrase comes here and ver. 3 only. In <a href="/luke/11-41.htm">Luke 11:41</a> and Luke 12:33 (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>) alms are con-sidereal rather as a gift; in <a href="/acts/9-36.htm">Acts 9:36</a>; <a href="/acts/10-2.htm">Acts 10:2</a>; <a href="/acts/24-17.htm">Acts 24:17</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), rather as to their separate occasions and materials; here quite generally but rather as an action, a work. <span class="cmt_word">Do not sound a trumpet</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x3c2;</span>). Probably a purely metaphorical expression (cf. our "He is his own trumpeter"). Edersheim, 'Temple,' etc., p. 27 (cf. Schottgen) sees rather in it an ironical allusion to the form and name of the treasure-chests in the court of the women. "The Lord, making use of the word 'trumpet,' describes the conduct of those who, in their almsgiving, sought glory from men as 'sounding a trumpet' before them - that is, carrying before them, as it were, in full display one of these trumpet-shaped alms-boxes (literally called in the Talmud, 'trumpets'), and, as it were, sounding it." This interpretation would have been less fanciful if the substantive had been used instead of the verb. Others (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Calvin, Bengel) have taken it of a literal trumpet; but of this practice there is no evidence whatever. "I have not found, although I have sought for it much and seriously, even the least mention of a trumpet in almsgiving" (J. Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.'). <span class="cmt_word">Before thee;</span> part of the metaphor, since one holds a trumpet up to one's mouth. <span class="cmt_word">As the hypocrites do.</span> The comma after "<span class="accented">do"</span> in the ordinary text of the Authorized Version (not in Scrivener) connects "do not sound a trumpet before thee" with "in the synagogues," etc., and more readily <span class="accented">suggests</span> the literal interpretation of "trumpet" to the English reader. <span class="accented">The hypocrites</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>). In Attic usage the word means those who play a part upon the stage. Hence, by an easy transition to the moral sphere," hypocrisy" became used in later Greek of "the assumption of a part which masked [men's] genuine feelings, and made them appear otherwise than they were" (cf. Bishop Lightfoot, on <a href="/galatians/2-13.htm">Galatians 2:13</a>). Persons who assumed this part would indeed often be identical with <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, and the term <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> may sometimes be used as synonymous with these (an extension of language which would be the more easy as the Hebrew word for "hypocrite" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5e0;&#x5e4;</span>) implies not so much hypocrisy as pollution by sin); but there seems no need (contrast Hatch, 'Essays,' p. 91) to see any other connotation in the New Testament than "hypocrite." To wilfully and continuously attempt to produce a false impression - especially in religion - is, after all, a mark of extreme distance from the truth-loving God. <span class="cmt_word">In</span> <span class="cmt_word">the synagogues and in the streets</span> (ver. 5, note). <span class="cmt_word">That they may have glory of men</span> (<span class="greek_word">o%pw</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); instead of this glory being given to God (ch. 5:16). The thought, however, of the word is rather of the glory given than of their welcome reception of it (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, <a href="/john/5-44.htm">John 5:44</a>; contrast <a href="/luke/4-15.htm">Luke 4:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Verily</span> (ch. 5:18, note). <span class="cmt_word">They have;</span> Revised Version, <span class="accented">they have received</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). The force of the preposition is "correspond<span class="accented">ence</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the contents to the capacity, of the possession to the desire, etc., so that it denotes <span class="accented">the full</span> complement" (Bishop Lightfoot, on <a href="/philippians/4-18.htm">Philippians 4:18</a>). That which fully corresponds to their desires and their rightful expectation they have to the full. They therefore have (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>) no other reward left for them to receive (ver. 1). Schottgen gives several examples of Jewish sayings about men receiving their reward in this life only (cf. Ign., 'Polyc.,' &sect; 5, "If a man boast [of his chastity], he is lost"). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/6-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
