Parables were a common teaching tool in Jewish culture, allowing listeners to engage with the message on multiple levels. This method also fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a>, which speaks of teaching in parables.<p><b>The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed:</b><br>The mustard seed is known for its small size, yet it grows into a large plant. This imagery highlights the kingdom of heaven's humble beginnings and its expansive growth. The mustard seed metaphor is significant in Jewish tradition, often used to represent something small and seemingly insignificant. This reflects the unexpected and transformative nature of God's kingdom.<p><b>that a man took and planted in his field:</b><br>The act of planting signifies intentionality and purpose. In biblical times, fields were valuable assets, and planting a seed was an investment in the future. The man represents those who spread the message of the kingdom, such as Jesus and His disciples. The field can symbolize the world or the hearts of individuals where the kingdom takes root.

And, so far as we can judge, they seem to have been equal to the task. They ask for the meaning of the Tares, but we read of no question about these.<p>It is scarcely necessary to discuss at any length the botany of the parable. What we call mustard (<span class= "ital">Sinapis nigra</span>) does not grow in the East, any more than with us, into anything that can be called a tree. Probably, however, the name was used widely for any plant that had the pungent flavour of mustard, and botanists have suggested the <span class= "ital">Salvadora persica</span> as answering to the description. (See <span class= "ital">Bible Educator,</span> I. 119.)<p>The interpretation of the parable lies almost on the surface. Here again the sower is the Son of Man; but the seed in this case is not so much the "word," as the Christian society, the Church, which forms, so to speak, the firstfruits of the word. As it then was, even as it was on the day of Pentecost, it was smaller than any sect or party in Palestine or Greece or Italy. It was sown in God's field of the world, but it was to grow till it became greater than any sect or school, a tree among the trees of the forest, a kingdom among other kingdoms (comp. the imagery of <a href="/ezekiel/31-3.htm" title="Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.">Ezekiel 31:3</a>; <a href="/daniel/4-10.htm" title="Thus were the visions of my head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the middle of the earth, and the height thereof was great.">Daniel 4:10</a>), a great organised society; and the "birds of the air" (no longer, as before, the emblems of evil)--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the systems of thought, institutions, and the like, of other races--were to find refuge under its protection. History has witnessed many fulfilments of the prophecy implied in the parable, and those who believe that the life of Christendom is an abiding life will look for yet more.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31, 32.</span> - <span class="accented">The parable of the mustard seed.</span> Parallel passages: <a href="/mark/4-30.htm">Mark 4:30-32</a>; <a href="/luke/13-18.htm">Luke 13:18, 19</a>. The central thought of the parable is the growth of the kingdom of heaven considered externally. Although it has small beginnings, it is to have a marvellous expansion, so that even those who naturally are outside it are glad to avail themselves of its protection. Observe that we have no right to limit its growth either to the reputation of its principles alone or to the power of its organization; both are included. Regarded as a prophecy, the parable is partially fulfilled every time that a heathen nation places itself under the protection of a Christian nation, and more truly fulfilled whenever a nation accepts Christianity as its own religion. It is parodied when a nation or a collection of nations submits its political freedom to the dictates of claimants to spiritual superiority, whether these claim to have received such superiority as an inheritance from the past, or to have acquired it in the present. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Another parable put he forth unto them</span> (ver. 24, note), <span class="cmt_word">saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto</span> (ver. 24, note; also <a href="/matthew/11-16.htm">Matthew 11:16</a>, note) <span class="cmt_word">a grain of mustard seed.</span> "The Common Mustard of Palestine is <span class="accented">Sinapis nigra</span>, of the order <span class="accented">Cruciferae</span>, the Black Mustard, which is found abundantly in a wild state, and is also cultivated in the gardens for its seed. It is the same as our own Mustard, but grows especially in the richer soils of the Jordan valley to a much greater size than in this country. We noticed its great height on the banks of the Jordan, as have several other travellers; and Dr. Thomson remarks that in the Plain of Acre he has seen it as tall as a horse and its rider" (Tristram, 'Nat.
