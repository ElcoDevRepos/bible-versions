In the ancient Near East, water was a precious resource, especially in arid regions. Offering a cup of cold water was a basic yet significant gesture of hospitality and care. This act symbolizes the importance of small deeds done with a pure heart. It reflects the biblical principle that God values the intentions behind our actions, not just the actions themselves (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><b>to one of these little ones</b><br>"Little ones" can refer to children or those who are humble and lowly in status. In the context of <a href="/matthew/10.htm">Matthew 10</a>, it likely refers to Jesus' disciples, who were often seen as insignificant by societal standards. This phrase underscores the value Jesus places on those who follow Him, regardless of their worldly status. It aligns with Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/18-3.htm">Matthew 18:3-5</a>, where He emphasizes the importance of humility and receiving the kingdom of heaven like a child.<p><b>because he is My disciple</b><br>The motivation for the act is crucial. The phrase indicates that the kindness is extended because the recipient is a follower of Christ. This highlights the interconnectedness of believers and the importance of supporting one another within the body of Christ. It also reflects the idea that acts of service to believers are acts of service to Christ Himself, as seen in <a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>.<p><b>truly I tell you</b><br>This phrase is a solemn affirmation used by Jesus to emphasize the truth and importance of what He is about to say. It is a common expression in the Gospels, often introducing a significant teaching or promise. It assures the listener of the certainty and reliability of Jesus' words.<p><b>he will never lose his reward.</b><br>The promise of a reward underscores the eternal perspective of Christian service. While the act may seem small and insignificant, it holds great value in God's eyes and will be remembered in eternity. This assurance encourages believers to continue in good works, knowing that their efforts are not in vain (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-58.htm">1 Corinthians 15:58</a>). The concept of reward is consistent with other teachings of Jesus, such as in <a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>, where He speaks of storing up treasures in heaven.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, providing instructions and encouragement to His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are being sent out to preach the Gospel and perform miracles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/little_ones.htm">Little Ones</a></b><br>Refers to those who are humble, possibly new believers or those in need, whom Jesus values.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/cup_of_cold_water.htm">Cup of Cold Water</a></b><br>A simple act of kindness and hospitality, symbolizing care and support.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/reward.htm">Reward</a></b><br>The promise of eternal or spiritual reward for acts of kindness done in Jesus' name.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_small_acts.htm">The Value of Small Acts</a></b><br>Even the smallest acts of kindness, like giving a cup of cold water, are significant in God's eyes when done in His name.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/motivation_matters.htm">Motivation Matters</a></b><br>The motivation behind our actions should be love and obedience to Christ, not seeking personal gain or recognition.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Our actions on earth have eternal consequences.
