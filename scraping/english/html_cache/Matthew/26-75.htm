Jesus had previously predicted Peter's denial during the Last Supper (<a href="/matthew/26-34.htm">Matthew 26:34</a>). This moment of remembrance signifies the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy and underscores His omniscience. It also reflects the human tendency to forget spiritual warnings in moments of fear or pressure. Peter's memory of Jesus' words serves as a catalyst for his repentance, illustrating the power of Christ's words to convict and lead to transformation.<p><b>&#8220;Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.&#8221;</b><br>This prophecy by Jesus is significant for several reasons. The rooster crowing was a common time marker in the ancient world, indicating early morning. The specificity of the prophecy underscores Jesus' divine knowledge and the certainty of His words. The number three often symbolizes completeness in the Bible, suggesting the totality of Peter's denial. This event fulfills Jesus' prediction and serves as a humbling reminder of human frailty and the need for divine grace. It also parallels the threefold restoration of Peter in <a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15-17</a>, where Jesus reaffirms Peter's role despite his earlier failure.<p><b>And he went outside and wept bitterly.</b><br>Peter's response of weeping bitterly indicates deep remorse and repentance. This emotional reaction is a turning point for Peter, marking the beginning of his restoration. The act of going outside may symbolize a separation from the scene of his failure and a step towards reconciliation with God. Bitter weeping reflects genuine sorrow for sin, aligning with the biblical principle that godly sorrow leads to repentance (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>). Peter's tears foreshadow his eventual restoration and leadership in the early church, demonstrating that failure is not final when met with true repentance and God's forgiveness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' closest disciples, known for his impulsive nature and strong declarations of loyalty to Jesus.

And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, Before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice.">Luke 22:61</a>) that it was at this moment, probably as He was passing from the council chamber, mocked and buffeted by the officers, that "the Lord turned and looked upon Peter." That glance, full, we must believe, of tenderest pity and deepest sadness, as of one who was moved not by anger but by sorrow, recalled him to his better self, and the flood-gates of penitence were opened. From that hour we lose sight of him till the morning of the Resurrection. We may infer from his then appearing in company with John (<a href="/john/20-3.htm" title="Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulcher.">John 20:3</a>), that he turned in his contrition to the friend and companion of his early years, who had probably witnessed his denials, and was not repulsed.
