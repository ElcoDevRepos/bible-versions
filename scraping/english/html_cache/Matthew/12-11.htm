His reply is a common rabbinic method of argumentation, using a question to provoke thought and reflection. This approach is consistent with Jesus' teaching style throughout the Gospels, where He often uses questions to challenge prevailing interpretations of the Law.<p><b>If one of you has a sheep</b><br>Sheep were a common and valuable asset in ancient Israel, integral to the agrarian lifestyle. They provided wool, milk, and meat, and were often used in sacrificial offerings. The mention of a sheep would resonate with Jesus' audience, who would understand the importance of caring for such an animal. This reference also subtly connects to Jesus as the Good Shepherd, a theme found in <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>, where He cares for His flock.<p><b>and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath</b><br>The scenario of a sheep falling into a pit is a practical example that the audience could easily relate to. Pits were common hazards in the rocky terrain of Israel. The Sabbath, a day of rest commanded in <a href="/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8-11</a>, was strictly observed by the Jews. However, Jesus highlights the tension between the letter of the Law and the spirit of compassion and mercy. This situation echoes the principle found in <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>, where God desires mercy over sacrifice.<p><b>will he not take hold of it and lift it out?</b><br>Jesus appeals to the common sense and compassion of His listeners. The rhetorical question implies that any reasonable person would rescue their sheep, even on the Sabbath, because the value of life and well-being surpasses strict legalism. This act of mercy aligns with the broader biblical narrative that emphasizes love and compassion, as seen in <a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>. Jesus uses this example to illustrate the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, who prioritize legalistic adherence over genuine care for others, a theme He addresses in <a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing the Pharisees and teaching about the true spirit of the Sabbath.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>- A religious group known for their strict adherence to the Law, often challenging Jesus on His interpretation and application of the Law.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sheep.htm">Sheep</a></b><br>- Used as an example by Jesus to illustrate the value of life and the importance of mercy over ritual.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sabbath.htm">Sabbath</a></b><br>- A day of rest and worship in Jewish tradition, which the Pharisees strictly observed, often leading to legalistic interpretations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pit.htm">Pit</a></b><br>- Represents a situation of need or danger, used metaphorically by Jesus to discuss the appropriateness of doing good on the Sabbath.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_spirit_of_the_law.htm">The Spirit of the Law</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes the importance of understanding the spirit behind the Law rather than adhering to a rigid, legalistic interpretation.

The Talmud discusses the question, but does not decide it. Some casuists solved the problem by a compromise. The sheep was not to be pulled out of the pit till the Sabbath was over, but in the meantime it was lawful to supply it with fodder. In St. Mark and St. Luke the question is given in another form, and without the illustration, which we find in St. Luke, in another connection, in <a href="/luke/14-5.htm" title="And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?">Luke 14:5</a>. Jesus bids the man with the withered hand stand up in the midst, and then puts the question, "Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath day or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?" The alternative thus presented as a dilemma was a practical answer to their casuistry. They would have said, "Leave the man as he is till the Sabbath is over;" and our Lord's answer is that in that case good would have been left undone, and that not to do good when it lies in our power is practically to do evil.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - Matthew alone on this occasion, but comp. <a href="/luke/14-5.htm">Luke 14:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">And he said unto them</span>. Christ's answer appeals from intellectual and theoretical difficulties to the practical common sense of ordinary morality (cf. <a href="/romans/3-5.htm">Romans 3:5-7</a>). Their own feelings would guide them to help a brute, much more a man. According to the parallel passages, our Lord first set the man in the midst of them, wishing, perhaps, to draw out their sympathy, and only afterwards spoke this verse of censure (see Chrysostom). <span class="cmt_word">What man shall there be among you, that</span> <span class="cmt_word">shall have one sheep.</span> One only, and therefore so much the dearer (Meyer). He would feel an interest in it as an animal that he had learned to love; and he would care for it as his property.
