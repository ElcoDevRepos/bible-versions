This connection is significant because John is often seen as the forerunner to Christ, fulfilling the prophecy of Elijah's return (<a href="/malachi/4-5.htm">Malachi 4:5-6</a>). Camel's hair was a coarse material, indicating John's ascetic lifestyle and his separation from the comforts of society. This attire symbolized his prophetic role and his call to repentance, aligning with the tradition of prophets who often lived on the fringes of society to deliver God's message.<p><b>with a leather belt around his waist</b><br>The leather belt further emphasizes John's connection to Elijah, reinforcing his role as a prophet in the tradition of the Old Testament. In biblical times, a leather belt was practical for securing garments and carrying small items, reflecting John's simple and utilitarian lifestyle. This detail highlights John's focus on his mission rather than material wealth or status, embodying the call to repentance and humility.<p><b>His food was locusts and wild honey</b><br>Locusts were considered a permissible food according to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/11-22.htm">Leviticus 11:22</a>), and they were a common source of protein in the region. Wild honey, likely gathered from bees in the wilderness, provided natural sweetness and sustenance. John's diet underscores his ascetic lifestyle and his reliance on God's provision in the wilderness. This choice of food also connects to the theme of living simply and being sustained by God, paralleling the Israelites' experience in the desert.

They are commonly salted and dried, and may be cooked in various ways, pounded, or fried in butter, and they taste like shrimps.

The "wild honey" was that found in the hollows of trees (as in the history of Jonathan, <a href="/1_samuel/14-25.htm" title="And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey on the ground.">1Samuel 14:25</a>), or in the "rocks" (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-13.htm" title="He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/81-16.htm" title="He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied you.">Psalm 81:16</a>).
