It is a rhetorical question that sets the stage for a parable, a common teaching method used by Jesus to convey deeper spiritual truths. The question encourages personal introspection and challenges the audience to evaluate their understanding of God's character and priorities.<p><b>If a man has a hundred sheep</b><br>Sheep were a common part of agrarian life in ancient Israel, and shepherding was a familiar occupation. The number "hundred" signifies completeness and abundance, suggesting a full flock under the shepherd's care. This imagery is used throughout Scripture to represent God's people, with God or Christ as the shepherd (e.g., <a href="/psalms/23.htm">Psalm 23</a>, <a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11-16</a>).<p><b>and one of them goes astray</b><br>Sheep are known for their tendency to wander, symbolizing human beings' propensity to stray from God's path. This phrase highlights the vulnerability and waywardness of individuals, echoing the theme of sin and the need for redemption. <a href="/isaiah/53-6.htm">Isaiah 53:6</a> states, "We all, like sheep, have gone astray," reinforcing the idea of humanity's inclination to deviate from divine guidance.<p><b>will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills</b><br>The shepherd's decision to leave the ninety-nine sheep underscores the value of each individual. The "hills" suggest a place of safety and security for the flock, indicating that the shepherd ensures their well-being before pursuing the lost one. This action reflects God's prioritization of seeking and saving the lost, as seen in <a href="/luke/19-10.htm">Luke 19:10</a>.<p><b>and go out to search for the one that is lost?</b><br>The shepherd's pursuit of the lost sheep illustrates God's relentless love and grace. It emphasizes the personal nature of God's care and His willingness to go to great lengths to restore a wayward soul. This mirrors the mission of Jesus, who came to seek and save the lost (<a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4-7</a>). The parable also foreshadows the sacrificial nature of Christ's ministry, as He actively seeks those who are spiritually lost.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_shepherd.htm">The Shepherd</a></b><br>Represents Jesus Christ, who is the Good Shepherd, caring for His flock with diligence and love.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sheep.htm">The Sheep</a></b><br>Symbolizes believers or followers of Christ.

The fact that it reappears there is significant as to the prominence, in our Lord's thoughts and teaching, of the whole cycle of imagery on which it rests. Here the opening words, "How think ye?" sharpen its personal application to the disciples, as an appeal to their own experience. Even in this shorter form the parable involves the claim on our Lord's part to be the true Shepherd, and suggests the thought that the "ninety and nine" are (1) strictly, the unfallen creatures of God's spiritual universe; and (2) relatively, those among men who are comparatively free from gross offences.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - The parable that follows teaches the same lesson as the preceding verse.

If but one of these stray, the good Shepherd regards only the danger and possible destruction of this wanderer, and puts aside every other care in order to secure its safety. <span class="cmt_word">The ninety and nine.</span> These must be left for a time, if he is to conduct the search in person. It may he that some idea of probation is here intended, as when Jesus let the disciples embark on the lake while he himself remained on the shore. Many of the Fathers interpret the ninety-nine as representing the sinless angels, the lost sheep as man, to seek and save whom Christ left heaven, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. became incarnate. This, indeed, may be a legitimate application of the parable, but is inexact as an exposition of the passage, which regards the whole flock as figuring the human race. The sheep that remained safe and true to their Master are the righteous; the errant are the sinners, which, however few, are the special care of the merciful Lord. <span class="cmt_word">Into the mountains</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f54;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;</span>). There is much doubt whether these words are to be joined with <span class="cmt_word">goeth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>), as in both our versions, or with <span class="cmt_word">leave</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f76;&#x3c2;</span>), as in the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Nonne</span> <span class="accented">relinquit nonaginta novem in montibus?</span> In the former case we have a picture of the toil of the shepherd traversing the mountains in search of the lost. But this does not seem to be the particular point contemplated, nor is any special emphasis assigned to this part of the transaction. In the parable as recounted by St. Luke (<a href="/luke/15-4.htm">Luke 15:4</a>), we read, "Doth he not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go?" So here it is best to render, <span class="accented">Doth he not leave the ninety and nine upon the mountains?</span> The shepherd is not regardless of the safety and comfort of the flock during his temporary absence; he leaves them where they are sure to find pasture, as they roam over (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> with accusative) the hill tops, which, catching clouds and dew, are never without fresh grass. So <a href="/psalms/147-8.htm">Psalm 147:8</a>, "Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains." <span class="cmt_word">Seeketh</span>. The lost sheep would not return of itself. Such erring souls Jesus seeks by the inspiration of his Spirit, by allowing distress and sorrow, by awakening conscience and memory, by ways manifold which may lead the sinner to "come to himself." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/18-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">What</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Ti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
