The disciples find the donkey exactly as He said, and the crowd soon hails Him as &#8220;Son of David.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Matthew records the event as real history, not symbolism.<p>&#8226; God is orchestrating every detail, just as He did when &#8220;when the fullness of time came, God sent His Son&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar moments of divinely arranged circumstance appear in <a href="/john/19-36.htm">John 19:36-37</a> where specific actions around the cross &#8220;took place&#8221; so Scripture &#8220;might be fulfilled.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to fulfill</b><p>Fulfillment is Matthew&#8217;s favorite way of tying Jesus&#8217; life to the Old Testament (cf. <a href="/matthew/1-22.htm">Matthew 1:22</a>; 2:15; 4:14).<p>&#8226; Jesus rides a donkey not for convenience but &#8220;to fulfill&#8221; prophecy, proving He is the promised Messiah.<p>&#8226; He declared, &#8220;Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a> shows the same theme: &#8220;Everything written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms must be fulfilled.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what was spoken</b><p>God&#8217;s Word is living, fixed, and trustworthy.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1</a> reminds us, &#8220;In the past God spoke to our fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a> clarifies that &#8220;men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.&#8221;<p>Therefore, what the prophet said centuries before still stands, and Jesus acts on that unbroken promise.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>through the prophet</b><p>Matthew cites <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a> (and echoes <a href="/isaiah/62-11.htm">Isaiah 62:11</a>).

Literally, <span class= "ital">all this has come to pass.</span> The words are his comment on the act. At the time (as we find from <a href="/john/12-16.htm" title="These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.">John 12:16</a>) the disciples did not understand its significance as connected with the prophecy that follows. The purpose lay in the mind of their Master, not in theirs. It is significant of what St. John records that neither St. Mark nor St. Luke alludes to the prophecy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All this was done;</span> <span class="accented">now</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>) all <span class="accented">this hath come to pass</span>.

This observation of the evangelist is intended to convey the truth that Christ was acting consciously on the lines of old prophecy, working out the will of God declared beforehand by divinely inspired seers. The disciples acted in blind obedience to Christ's command, not knowing that they were thus fulfilling prophecy, or having any such purpose in mind. The knowledge came afterwards (see <a href="/john/12-16.htm">John 12:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That it might be fulfilled</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>). The conjuction in this phrase is certainly used in its final, not in a consecutive or ecbatie sense; it denotes the purpose or design of the action of Christ, not the result. Not only the will of the Father, but the words of Scripture, had delineated the life of Christ, and in obeying that will he purposed to show that he fulfilled the prophecies which spake of him. Thus any who knew the Scriptures, and were open to conviction, might see that it was he alone to whom these ancient oracles pointed, and in him alone were their words accomplished. <span class="cmt_word">By</span> (<span class="accented">through</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the prophet.</span> <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, with a hint of <a href="/isaiah/62-11.htm">Isaiah 62:11</a>, a quotation being often woven from two or more passages (see on Matthew 27:9). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(Touto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">took place</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(gegonen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1096.htm">Strong's 1096: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolongation and middle voice form of a primary verb; to cause to be, i.e. to become, used with great latitude.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7989;&#957;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(hina)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2443.htm">Strong's 2443: </a> </span><span class="str2">In order that, so that.
