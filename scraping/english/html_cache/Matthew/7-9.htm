It is a common teaching method used by Jesus to provoke thought and self-reflection among His listeners. In the context of the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus is addressing a diverse crowd, including His disciples and others from various regions of Judea and beyond. This method of questioning is designed to make the audience consider their own actions and attitudes in light of the teaching.<p><b>if his son asks for bread</b><br>Bread was a staple food in ancient Israel, symbolizing basic sustenance and provision. In the cultural and historical context, a father providing bread for his child would be seen as a fundamental duty, reflecting the familial responsibility and care expected in Jewish society. This request for bread signifies a legitimate need, highlighting the natural expectation of a child for their parent to provide for their basic needs. The imagery of bread also connects to other biblical passages, such as Jesus referring to Himself as the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), emphasizing spiritual nourishment.<p><b>will give him a stone?</b><br>The contrast between bread and a stone is stark, emphasizing the absurdity of a father responding to a child's need with something useless or harmful. Stones were abundant in the region of Judea, and their mention here serves to highlight the inappropriateness of such a response. This rhetorical device underscores the reliability and goodness of God as a Father, who provides for His children. The imagery may also evoke the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness, where Satan suggests turning stones into bread (<a href="/matthew/4-3.htm">Matthew 4:3</a>), further illustrating the theme of trust in God's provision.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, a foundational teaching moment in His ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples_and_followers.htm">Disciples and Followers</a></b><br>The primary audience of the Sermon on the Mount, representing those who seek to live according to Jesus' teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sermon_on_the_mount.htm">Sermon on the Mount</a></b><br>A significant event in the New Testament where Jesus provides moral and spiritual guidance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/father_and_son.htm">Father and Son</a></b><br>Used metaphorically to illustrate the relationship between God and His children.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/bread_and_stone.htm">Bread and Stone</a></b><br>Symbolic elements used to contrast good and bad gifts, emphasizing God's goodness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_nature_as_a_provider.htm">God's Nature as a Provider</a></b><br>God is depicted as a loving Father who desires to give good gifts to His children.
