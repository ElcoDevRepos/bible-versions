Houses in first-century Palestine were typically small and simple, reflecting the humble circumstances in which Jesus often ministered. This setting contrasts with the public spaces where many of His teachings and miracles occurred, highlighting the personal nature of this encounter.<p><b>the blind men came to Him</b><br>The blind men actively sought Jesus, demonstrating their faith and determination. In the cultural context, blindness was often seen as a sign of sin or divine displeasure, yet these men approached Jesus with hope. Their action reflects the belief that Jesus had the power to heal, a common theme in the Gospels where those in need seek Him out, recognizing His authority and compassion.<p><b>&#8220;Do you believe that I am able to do this?&#8221; He asked.</b><br>Jesus' question tests the depth of the blind men's faith. It is not merely about acknowledging His ability but also about trusting in His divine authority. This question echoes the broader biblical theme of faith as a prerequisite for receiving God's blessings, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>, which states that without faith, it is impossible to please God. Jesus often required a confession of faith before performing miracles, emphasizing the importance of belief in His ministry.<p><b>&#8220;Yes, Lord,&#8221; they answered.</b><br>Their response is a confession of faith and recognition of Jesus' lordship. The title "Lord" indicates their acknowledgment of His divine authority and power. This confession aligns with the broader biblical narrative where faith in Jesus as Lord is central to salvation, as seen in <a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a>. Their affirmation also reflects the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah bringing sight to the blind, such as in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, underscoring Jesus as the promised Savior.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/blind_men.htm">Blind Men</a></b><br>Individuals seeking healing from Jesus, representing those in need of physical and spiritual sight.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/indoors.htm">Indoors</a></b><br>The setting where the interaction takes place, indicating a more private and intimate encounter.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_as_a_prerequisite_for_miracles.htm">Faith as a Prerequisite for Miracles</a></b><br>Jesus' question, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" underscores the importance of faith in receiving God's intervention.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/personal_encounter_with_jesus.htm">Personal Encounter with Jesus</a></b><br>The setting "indoors" suggests that personal, intimate encounters with Jesus can lead to transformation and healing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/acknowledging_jesus_as_lord.htm">Acknowledging Jesus as Lord</a></b><br>The blind men's response, "Yes, Lord," signifies their recognition of Jesus' divine authority and power.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_blindness_and_sight.htm">Spiritual Blindness and Sight</a></b><br>Beyond physical healing, this passage invites reflection on spiritual blindness and the need for Jesus to open our eyes to truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/persistence_in_seeking_jesus.htm">Persistence in Seeking Jesus</a></b><br>The blind men&#8217;s determination to follow Jesus indoors demonstrates the importance of persistence in seeking Him for our needs.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_9_28_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 9:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_9_28_Faith_s_role_in_healing.htm">How does Matthew 9:28 demonstrate the importance of faith in Jesus' healing?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Insights_on_Jesus_response_to_believers.htm">What can we learn about Jesus' response to those who believe in Him?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_9_28_Hebrews_11_6_on_faith.htm">How does Matthew 9:28 connect with Hebrews 11:6 on faith's necessity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_deepen_faith_like_the_blind_men.htm">In what ways can we strengthen our faith like the blind men?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Apply_blind_men_s_faith_to_challenges.htm">How can we apply the blind men's faith in our daily challenges today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_9_28_s_insight_on_faith_in_Jesus.htm">What does Matthew 9:28 reveal about the nature of faith in Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_9_28_Belief_vs_Doubt.htm">How does Matthew 9:28 challenge our understanding of belief and doubt?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_ask_blind_men_about_faith_in_Matt_9_28.htm">Why does Jesus ask the blind men about their faith in Matthew 9:28?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_9.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 9?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/did_people_worship_jesus.htm">Did people worship Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_bible_say_on_jesus_worship.htm">What does the Bible say about worshiping Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_no_historical_record_of_jesus'_healings.htm">Matthew 9:27-31: If Jesus truly healed two blind men, why is there no broader historical record or corroboration of such miracles?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_no_proven_cases_of_human_regeneration.htm">Why are there no verifiable instances of spontaneous human regeneration?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Matthew 9:28 Mean</div><b>After Jesus had entered the house</b><p>&#8220;After Jesus had entered the house&#8230;&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/9-28.htm">Matthew 9:28</a>)<p>&#8226; The scene moves from the noisy street to a private setting.
