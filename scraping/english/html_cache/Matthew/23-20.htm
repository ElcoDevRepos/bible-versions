The altar in the Jewish temple was central to worship and sacrifice, symbolizing the place where offerings were made to God. Swearing by the altar implies invoking something sacred, yet the religious leaders had developed intricate rules about which oaths were binding. This reflects a misunderstanding of true devotion and integrity, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-37</a>, where Jesus teaches about the importance of honesty without the need for oaths.<p><b>swears by it and by everything on it.</b><br>The altar was not just a physical structure but a place of consecration where sacrifices were offered to God. Everything on the altar, including the sacrifices, was considered holy. By swearing by the altar and its offerings, one is invoking the sacredness of the entire sacrificial system. This highlights the interconnectedness of the altar and the offerings, emphasizing that one cannot separate the physical from the spiritual significance. This principle is echoed in <a href="/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a>, where the altar is seen as a type of Christ's ultimate sacrifice, underscoring the importance of sincerity and reverence in worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, addressing the scribes and Pharisees, highlighting their hypocrisy and misunderstanding of the law.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/scribes_and_pharisees.htm">Scribes and Pharisees</a></b><br>Jewish religious leaders known for their strict adherence to the law and traditions, often criticized by Jesus for their hypocrisy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_altar.htm">The Altar</a></b><br>A sacred place in the temple where sacrifices were offered to God, symbolizing worship and devotion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where the temple was located, central to Jewish worship and the setting for Jesus' teachings in this chapter.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>The holy place in Jerusalem where the altar was located, representing God's presence among His people.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_sacred.htm">Understanding the Sacred</a></b><br>Recognize the significance of sacred objects and places, such as the altar, and how they point to deeper spiritual truths.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/integrity_in_speech.htm">Integrity in Speech</a></b><br>Emphasize the importance of honesty and integrity in our words, reflecting a heart aligned with God's truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/hypocrisy_vs._true_worship.htm">Hypocrisy vs. True Worship</a></b><br>Examine our own lives for areas of hypocrisy, ensuring that our external actions match our internal devotion to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/reverence_for_god.htm">Reverence for God</a></b><br>Cultivate a deep reverence for God in all aspects of life, understanding that our actions and words are seen by Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_new_covenant.htm">The New Covenant</a></b><br>Reflect on the transition from the old covenant, represented by the temple and altar, to the new covenant in Christ, who is our ultimate sacrifice.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_23_20_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 23:20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_23_20_on_sincere_commitments.htm">How does Matthew 23:20 emphasize the importance of sincerity in our commitments?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_23_20_Oaths_and_accountability.htm">What does Matthew 23:20 reveal about the relationship between oaths and accountability?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Matthew_23_20_s_integrity_today.htm">How can we apply the principle of integrity from Matthew 23:20 today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Matt_23_20_link_to_Jesus_truth.htm">In what ways does Matthew 23:20 connect to the teachings of Jesus on truthfulness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_23_20_Reflect_on_your_faith.htm">How does Matthew 23:20 challenge us to examine our own spiritual practices?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_23_20_on_oaths_in_Christianity.htm">What does Matthew 23:20 reveal about the nature of oaths and promises in Christianity?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_23_20_s_impact_on_leaders.htm">How does Matthew 23:20 challenge the authority of religious leaders?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Key_context_for_Matthew_23_20.htm">What historical context is essential for understanding Matthew 23:20?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_23.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_can't_jesus_choose_who_sits_by_him.htm">Matthew 20:23 - If Jesus is fully divine, why does He imply He has no authority over who sits at His right and left?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_did_women_visit_jesus'_tomb.htm">Why did the women visit the tomb?

Jesus has just exposed their habit of making fine-sounding distinctions between kinds of oaths (<a href="/matthew/23-16.htm">Matthew 23:16-19</a>). With &#8220;So then,&#8221; He draws the unavoidable conclusion: every oath is ultimately made before God Himself.<p>&#8226; Earlier in the Sermon on the Mount He said, &#8220;Do not swear at all&#8230; Let your &#8216;Yes&#8217; be &#8216;Yes,&#8217; and your &#8216;No,&#8217; &#8216;No&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-34.htm">Matthew 5:34, 37</a>).<p>&#8226; James reinforces the point: &#8220;Above all, my brothers, do not swear&#8230; so that you will not fall under judgment&#8221; (<a href="/james/5-12.htm">James 5:12</a>).<p>The phrase signals that what follows is not optional advice but binding truth flowing from God&#8217;s unchanging character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He who swears by the altar</b><p>The altar in the temple was the God-ordained place for sacrifices (<a href="/exodus/27-1.htm">Exodus 27:1-8</a>; <a href="/1_kings/8-64.htm">1 Kings 8:64</a>). Swearing &#8220;by the altar&#8221; sounded pious, yet the religious leaders treated it as a lesser oath, conveniently breakable (<a href="/matthew/23-18.htm">Matthew 23:18</a>). Jesus rejects that loophole.<p>&#8226; Anything connected to God&#8217;s worship carries His authority (<a href="/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6-8</a>).<p>&#8226; Even under the New Covenant the imagery of an altar points to Christ&#8217;s sacrifice (<a href="/hebrews/13-10.htm">Hebrews 13:10</a>).<p>Calling on the altar in an oath is therefore calling on the God who prescribed it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Swears by it</b><p>&#8220;Swears by it&#8221; underscores that the altar itself&#8212;made holy by God&#8217;s command&#8212;cannot be separated from Him.<p>&#8226; &#8220;I will wash my hands in innocence and go around Your altar, O LORD&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/26-6.htm">Psalm 26:6</a>) highlights that the altar belongs to the LORD.<p>&#8226; Isaiah hears the seraph touch the altar&#8217;s coal to his lips, declaring, &#8220;Your guilt is taken away&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-6.htm">Isaiah 6:6-7</a>). Only God can give that power.<p>By invoking the altar, a person is, whether he admits it or not, placing himself under the scrutiny of the Holy One.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And by everything on it</b><p>The leaders claimed that only an oath &#8220;by the gift on the altar&#8221; was binding (<a href="/matthew/23-18.htm">Matthew 23:18-19</a>). Jesus reverses their logic: the altar sanctifies the gift, so an oath by the altar also includes &#8220;everything on it.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Sacrifices placed on the altar were &#8220;a pleasing aroma to the LORD&#8221; (<a href="/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Under the New Covenant, Jesus &#8220;offered for all time one sacrifice for sins&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/10-12.htm">Hebrews 10:12</a>).<p>Every offering points to God&#8217;s ultimate provision, and swearing in its presence calls down His witness and judgment.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jesus demolishes man-made rankings of oaths. The moment someone swears &#8220;by the altar,&#8221; he has already sworn before the God who designed it and accepts the sacrifices upon it. No part of divine worship can be cordoned off as a safe zone for casual promises. Christ&#8217;s words press believers to straightforward truthfulness, knowing that every word is spoken in the presence of the living God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sweareth by it</span>, etc. One can see what an inveterate evil our Lord was denouncing, when he takes such pains to point out its absurdities, which seem to us self-evident. The oath by the altar involves the notion of the victim as well as the altar; one cannot be separated from the other; and, of course, implies him to whom the offering is made. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/23-20.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So then,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
