This connection emphasizes the continuity between the Old and New Testaments, showing that John&#8217;s role was divinely ordained. Isaiah's prophecy was given during a time of impending exile for Israel, promising future restoration. John&#8217;s ministry heralds the coming of Jesus, the ultimate fulfillment of God&#8217;s promise to redeem His people.<p><b>A voice of one calling in the wilderness:</b><br>The wilderness symbolizes a place of preparation and purification in biblical tradition. It is where Israel wandered for 40 years and where Jesus would later be tempted. John&#8217;s ministry in the wilderness signifies a call to repentance and spiritual renewal. The wilderness setting also underscores the idea of separation from worldly distractions, focusing on spiritual readiness for the Messiah.<p><b>Prepare the way for the Lord:</b><br>This phrase echoes the ancient practice of preparing roads for the arrival of a king, ensuring a smooth and unhindered path. Spiritually, it calls for repentance and moral realignment to receive the Lord. The Lord here refers to Jesus, affirming His divine authority and kingship. This preparation involves turning away from sin and embracing righteousness, aligning with the message of repentance that John preached.<p><b>Make straight paths for Him:</b><br>The imagery of straight paths suggests removing obstacles and making a direct route for the Lord&#8217;s coming. It implies a call to ethical and spiritual integrity, removing anything that hinders a relationship with God. This phrase also connects to the broader biblical theme of God making a way for His people, as seen in the Exodus and the return from Babylonian exile. It highlights the need for personal and communal readiness for the transformative work of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, John is the "voice" in the wilderness, fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah.

In each case the reference shows how strongly the great second part of Isaiah had impressed itself on the minds of men. To the Baptist, brooding over the sins of his people, and the long-expected consolation of Israel, there had come "the word of the Lord" (<a href="/luke/3-2.htm" title="Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.">Luke 3:2</a>), bidding him identify himself with that "voice of one crying in the wilderness."<p>Historically, the connection of the opening chapters of this part of Isaiah with the protests against idolatry (<a href="/context/isaiah/40-18.htm" title="To whom then will you liken God? or what likeness will you compare to him?">Isaiah 40:18-24</a>; <a href="/isaiah/41-7.htm" title="So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smoothes with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the soldering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.">Isaiah 41:7</a>; <a href="/context/isaiah/44-9.htm" title="They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>), and with the name of Cyrus (<a href="/isaiah/44-28.htm" title="That said of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="/isaiah/45-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut;">Isaiah 45:1</a>), shows that the prophet blended his glorious visions of the ideal polity of the future with the return of the exiles from Babylon.

In <a href="/john/1-23.htm">John 1:23</a> the following quotation is uttered by the Baptist himself, and some commentators have supposed this to be the case also here. But <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> this is against the parallel passages in Mark and Luke. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The form of the expression in John arises directly from the context. <p><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> In the Baptist's mouth the neuter (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>) rather than the masculine would have been more natural. The expression is doubtless that of the evangelist, suggested to him by John's own utterance, the "is" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) expressing John's permanent character. Contrast <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>, (ver. 4) of his clothing and food. [<span class="accented">He that was</span>] <span class="accented">spoken of.</span> The expression means, not a mere reference found in Isaiah, but the absolute content of the prophet's words. The utterance of God by means of the prophet is - John the:Baptist. <span class="cmt_word">The Prophet Esaias</span>; <span class="accented">Isaiah the prophet</span> (Revised Version); the commoner Greek order (but cf. <a href="/luke/4-17.htm">Luke 4:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The voice</span>, etc. (except "his" for "our God," from the LXX. of <a href="/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>). The Hebrew probably joins "in the wilderness" with "prepare ye," but St. Matthew with "crying" (cf ver. 1, "preaching in the wilderness," as probably the LXX.) In Isaiah the original meaning of the passage was probably, "prepare for the return to Jerusalem." The figure is that of the common and necessary process in semi-civilized countries of repairing roads before a great personage comes along them. Zechariah had; years before, applied the similar expression in <a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a> to his son (<a href="/luke/1-76.htm">Luke 1:76</a>; cf. <a href="/mark/1-2.htm">Mark 1:2</a>). (For a metaphor like in kind, but with contrasted meaning, cf. <a href="/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, breaking up a road to render it impassable.) <span class="cmt_word">Paths</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>). According to Philo, the word is equivalent to "a carriage-road" (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">vide</span> in Wetstein). It is thus equivalent to the Hebrew (<span class="accented">m</span> <span class="accented">sillah</span>, "a highway," "a made road"). Possibly the plural was employed by the LXX. rather than the singular of the original, from their interpreting the passage, not of the return of the Lord to Palestine, but his coming into many hearts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/3-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">This</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(houtos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
