The empty tomb is a central tenet of Christian faith, symbolizing victory over death. The location, a garden tomb near Golgotha, aligns with Jewish burial customs of the time, where bodies were placed in rock-hewn tombs. The absence of Jesus' body was a pivotal point for the disciples and early Christians, as it provided tangible evidence of the resurrection.<p><b>He has risen,</b><br>The resurrection is the cornerstone of Christian belief, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>. It demonstrates Jesus' divine nature and His victory over sin and death. The resurrection was foretold by Jesus Himself in passages like <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a> and <a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-22</a>, affirming His role as the Messiah. This event is celebrated by Christians worldwide, particularly on Easter Sunday.<p><b>just as He said!</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the fulfillment of Jesus' own predictions about His death and resurrection, as seen in <a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a> and <a href="/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>. It underscores Jesus' reliability and the truth of His words, reinforcing His prophetic role. The fulfillment of His predictions serves to strengthen the faith of His followers and validate His teachings.<p><b>Come, see the place where He lay.</b><br>The invitation to see the empty tomb serves as an invitation to witness the evidence of the resurrection firsthand. This aligns with the Jewish legal principle of establishing truth through witnesses, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>. The physical evidence of the empty tomb, combined with the testimony of the women and later the disciples, forms a foundational proof of the resurrection. The location of the tomb, traditionally believed to be the Church of the Holy Sepulchre or the Garden Tomb, remains a site of pilgrimage and reflection for believers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure of the resurrection, fulfilling His prophecy of rising from the dead.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel.htm">The Angel</a></b><br>The messenger of God who announces Jesus' resurrection to the women at the tomb.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_women.htm">The Women</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus, including Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, who came to see the tomb.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tomb.htm">The Tomb</a></b><br>The place where Jesus was laid after His crucifixion, now empty as a testament to His resurrection.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events took place, significant in Jewish and Christian history.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">The Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' resurrection was foretold and fulfilled, affirming the reliability of God's Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_god.htm">The Power of God</a></b><br>The resurrection demonstrates God's power over death, offering hope and assurance of eternal life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_foundation_of_faith.htm">The Foundation of Faith</a></b><br>The resurrection is central to Christian faith;

There was an obvious fitness in the symbolism of the Resurrection of the Son of Righteousness coinciding with the natural "day-spring." (Comp. <a href="/luke/1-78.htm" title="Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high has visited us,">Luke 1:78</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Come, see the place.</span>--Comp. the description in <a href="/context/john/20-5.htm" title="And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.">John 20:5-6</a>, the "linen clothes," or bandages, that had swathed the limbs, the napkin, or <span class= "ital">sudarium,</span> that had veiled the face.<p>The report in St. Mark (<a href="/context/mark/16-6.htm" title="And he said to them, Be not affrighted: You seek Jesus of Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.">Mark 16:6-7</a>) nearly coincides with this. St. Luke is somewhat fuller (<a href="/context/luke/24-5.htm" title="And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said to them, Why seek you the living among the dead?">Luke 24:5-7</a>), introducing the question, "Why seek ye the living among the dead?" and a more detailed reference to our Lord's prophecies of His resurrection.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He is not here.</span> He is not in this tomb; his bodily presence is removed from this his whilom resting place. St. Matthew's account is greatly condensed, and omits many details which harmonists try to fit into our text. The attempt is not to be commended, for it really involves greater confusion, and, after all, is forced and only conjectural. <span class="cmt_word">For he is risen, as he said.</span> If they had believed Christ's often-repeated announcement, they would not have come seeking the living among the dead. (For Christ's predictions concerning his resurrection, see <a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>; <a href="/matthew/17-23.htm">Matthew 17:23</a>; <a href="/matthew/20-19.htm">Matthew 20:19</a>.) On this simple, but pregnant sentence, "He is risen," depends the phenomenon of Christianity, in its origin, existence, continuance, extension, and moral power. "Death began with woman; and to women the first announcement is made of resurrection" (Hilary, quoted by Wordsworth, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <span class="cmt_word">Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</span> The angel invites them to satisfy themselves that Christ's body was no longer in its resting place. That Jesus was designated as "the Lord," <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, by the disciples is obvious (see <a href="/john/20-18.htm">John 20:18</a>; <a href="/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7</a>, etc.), but it is doubtful whether the words are genuine here, though they are found in many good manuscripts and in the Vulgate. They are omitted by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, 33, etc., and by Tischendorf and Westcott and Hort in their editions. Regarding them as genuine, Bengel calls them "gloriosa appellatio," which indeed it is, for it is equivalent to "Jehovah." Harmonists suppose that the angel was at first not seen by the women; that Mary Magdalene, observing the stone removed, at once hurried to the city to tell Peter and John; that, the rest of the women remaining, the angel made himself visible to them and bade them enter the sepulchre; and that, doing so, they beheld another angel sitting on the right side of the recess. Thus, it is conjectured, the accounts in Mark and John may be harmonized with that in our text. (See also Westcott on <a href="/john/20.htm">John 20</a>, where is given a provisional arrangement of the facts of the first Easter Day.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/28-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He is</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(estin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1510.htm">Strong's 1510: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am, exist.
