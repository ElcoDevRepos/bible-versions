In biblical context, the heart often symbolizes the center of one's being, including emotions, will, and intellect. A callous heart indicates a resistance to divine truth, similar to the Israelites' repeated disobedience in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-10</a>). This condition is not unique to Jesus' time but is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, highlighting humanity's tendency to reject God's revelation.<p><b>they hardly hear with their ears,</b><br>This suggests a deliberate refusal to listen to God's word. In the cultural context of the time, hearing was a primary means of learning and understanding, as literacy was not widespread. The phrase implies a willful neglect of spiritual truths, akin to the Israelites' history of ignoring prophetic warnings. This echoes the prophetic tradition where God&#8217;s messages were often ignored or misunderstood (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/5-21.htm">Jeremiah 5:21</a>).<p><b>and they have closed their eyes.</b><br>Closing one's eyes is a metaphor for rejecting or ignoring the truth. In the historical context, this reflects a conscious decision to avoid seeing the reality of God's kingdom and His works. This blindness is not physical but spiritual, indicating a refusal to acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah. It parallels the spiritual blindness described in passages like <a href="/isaiah/42-18.htm">Isaiah 42:18-20</a>.<p><b>Otherwise they might see with their eyes,</b><br>This phrase suggests the potential for spiritual awakening and understanding if the people were willing to open their eyes. It implies that the truth is accessible and visible to those who choose to perceive it. This aligns with the biblical theme of revelation, where God desires to make Himself known to humanity (e.g., <a href="/psalms/119-18.htm">Psalm 119:18</a>).<p><b>hear with their ears,</b><br>Hearing with understanding is a recurring biblical motif, emphasizing the importance of not just hearing words but comprehending and internalizing them. This is a call to active listening, which is essential for faith (<a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>). It underscores the idea that faith comes from hearing the message of Christ.<p><b>understand with their hearts,</b><br>Understanding with the heart involves a deep, transformative comprehension that goes beyond intellectual assent. It signifies a holistic grasp of spiritual truths that leads to genuine change. This is a central theme in Scripture, where true understanding is linked to a relationship with God (<a href="/proverbs/2-2.htm">Proverbs 2:2-5</a>).<p><b>and turn,</b><br>Turning signifies repentance, a fundamental concept in both the Old and New Testaments. It involves a change of mind and direction, moving away from sin and towards God. This is a key aspect of Jesus' message, calling people to repent for the kingdom of heaven is near (<a href="/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>).<p><b>and I would heal them.</b><br>Healing here is both spiritual and, potentially, physical. It represents restoration and reconciliation with God, a promise of wholeness for those who turn to Him. This reflects the messianic prophecy of healing and redemption found in passages like <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>. Jesus' ministry often included physical healing as a sign of the deeper spiritual healing He offers.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is teaching in parables to the crowds and explaining the purpose of parables to His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are given insight into the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowds.htm">The Crowds</a></b><br>The general populace who hear Jesus' parables but do not understand them fully.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/i/isaiah_the_prophet.htm">Isaiah the Prophet</a></b><br>The Old Testament prophet whose words Jesus quotes to explain the spiritual condition of the people.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_heaven.htm">The Kingdom of Heaven</a></b><br>The central theme of Jesus' teaching, representing God's reign and rule.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_perception.htm">Spiritual Perception</a></b><br>The verse highlights the importance of having a heart open to God's truth.
