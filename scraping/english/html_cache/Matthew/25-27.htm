The "money" symbolizes the gifts, talents, and resources God entrusts to individuals. The "bankers" represent safe and productive avenues for investment. In ancient times, bankers were known to lend money at interest, a practice that was common in the Roman Empire. This phrase underscores the importance of using one's resources wisely and productively for the Kingdom of God. Biblically, it aligns with the principle of being faithful in small things (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>).<p><b>and on my return</b><br>This phrase refers to the anticipated return of the master, symbolizing Christ's second coming. The expectation of accountability upon His return is a recurring theme in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/24-42.htm">Matthew 24:42-44</a>). It emphasizes the need for readiness and vigilance among believers, as the timing of His return is unknown. Theologically, it points to the eschatological hope and the final judgment where each person will give an account of their stewardship (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>).<p><b>I would have received it back with interest</b><br>The concept of "interest" here signifies growth and increase. Spiritually, it suggests that God expects His gifts to be used in a way that they multiply and bear fruit (<a href="/john/15-8.htm">John 15:8</a>). The idea of receiving back with interest implies that God values the diligent and fruitful use of what He has entrusted to His followers. This aligns with the biblical principle of sowing and reaping (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-9</a>), where faithful service leads to spiritual rewards. Theologically, it reflects the expectation that believers will contribute to the expansion of God's Kingdom through their actions and decisions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>Represents Jesus Christ, who entrusts His followers with responsibilities and expects them to be faithful stewards.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servants.htm">The Servants</a></b><br>Symbolize believers who are given different talents and resources to manage for the Kingdom of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bankers.htm">The Bankers</a></b><br>Refer to those who can help increase the value of what is entrusted, symbolizing opportunities to grow and expand God's work.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_talents.htm">The Talents</a></b><br>Represent the gifts, resources, and opportunities God gives to each believer to use for His glory.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_return.htm">The Return</a></b><br>The second coming of Christ, when He will hold His followers accountable for their stewardship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_stewardship.htm">Faithful Stewardship</a></b><br>Believers are called to be diligent and responsible with the resources and opportunities God provides.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_investment.htm">Spiritual Investment</a></b><br>Just as the servant was expected to invest the talent, Christians should seek to grow spiritually and expand God's Kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/accountability.htm">Accountability</a></b><br>There will be a time of reckoning when Christ returns, and believers must be prepared to give an account of their stewardship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/utilizing_resources.htm">Utilizing Resources</a></b><br>It is important to recognize and utilize the gifts and talents God has given, rather than letting them go to waste.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Keeping an eternal perspective helps believers prioritize their actions and investments in light of Christ's return.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_25_27_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 25:27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_25_27_on_wise_resource_use.htm">How does Matthew 25:27 encourage wise stewardship of God-given resources?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Spiritual_duty_in_money_management.htm">What does "you should have deposited my money" imply about spiritual responsibilities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/How_to_invest_in_our_spiritual_lives.htm">How can we apply the principle of investment in our spiritual lives today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Matt_25_27_Prov_13_11_on_wealth.htm">Connect Matthew 25:27 with Proverbs 13:11 on wealth gained through diligence.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_use_talents_for_God_s_kingdom_2.htm">In what ways can we ensure our talents are used for God's kingdom?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_25_27_God_s_resource_expectations.htm">What does Matthew 25:27 reveal about God's expectations for using our resources wisely?

These were the bankers referred to in the Note on <a href="/matthew/25-14.htm" title="For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered to them his goods.">Matthew 25:14</a>. In that case, if the servant had been honestly conscious of his own want of power, there would have been at least some interest allowed on the deposit.<p><span class= "bld">Usury.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">interest;</span> the word not necessarily implying, as usury does now, anything illegal or exorbitant. The question--What answers to this "giving to the exchangers" in the interpretation of the parable?--is, as has been said, analogous to that which asks the meaning of "them that sell" in the answer of the wise virgins in <a href="/matthew/25-9.htm" title="But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go you rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.">Matthew 25:9</a>. Whatever machinery or organisation the Church possesses for utilising opportunities which individual men fail to exercise, may be thought of as analogous to the banking-system of the old world. When men in the middle ages gave to a cathedral or a college, when they subscribe largely now to hospitals or missions, doing this and nothing more, they are "giving their money to the exchangers." It is not so acceptable an offering as willing and active service, but if it be honestly and humbly given, the giver will not lose his reward.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou oughtest therefore,</span> etc. Your conception of my character ought to have made you more diligent and scrupulous; and if you were really afraid to rust any risks with my money or invest it in any hazardous speculation, there were many ordinary and safe methods of employing it which would have yielded some profit, and some of these you would have adopted had you been faithful and earnest. The return might have been trifling in amount, but the lord shows that he is not grasping and harsh by being willing to accept even this in token of the servant's labour. <span class="cmt_word">To have put</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;</span>).

These money changers or bankers (for the business seems always to have combined the two branches) were a numerous class in Palestine, and wherever the Jewish community was established. They received deposits at interest, and engaged in transactions such as are usual in modern times. <span class="cmt_word">With usury</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3ba;&#x1ff3;</span>, <span class="accented">with interest</span>). At one time, law had forbidden usurious transactions between Israelites, though the Gentile was left to the mercy of his creditor (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-19.htm">Deuteronomy 23:19, 20</a>); but later such limitations were not observed. The rate of interest varied from four to forty per cent. The spiritual interpretation of this feature of the parable has most unnecessarily exercised the ingenuity of commentators. Some see in the bankers an adumbration of the religious societies and charitable institutions, by means of which persons can indirectly do some work for Christ, though unable personally to undertake such enterprises. Olshausen and Trench regard them as the stronger characters who, by example and guidance, lead the timid and hesitating to employ their gifts aright. But it is more reasonable to consider this detail of the parable as supplementary to its chief purpose, and not to be pressed in the interpretation. The Lord is simply concerned to show that all talents, great or small, must be used in his service according to opportunities; and that, whether the return be large or little, it is equally acceptable, if it show a willing mind and real fidelity in the agent. In illustration he uses two cases which yield most profit, and one which produces the least. Nothing can he inferred hence concerning the morality of usury.
