Women were often marginalized in ancient Jewish society, yet they played a crucial role in Jesus' ministry. Their presence at such a critical moment underscores their faithfulness and courage. This also contrasts with the absence of most of the male disciples, who had fled.<p><b>watching from a distance.</b><br>The women observed from afar, possibly due to the danger and fear associated with being too close to the crucifixion site. This distance could also reflect the Roman practice of keeping onlookers at bay during executions. Despite the physical distance, their emotional and spiritual proximity to Jesus is evident, showcasing their unwavering support.<p><b>They had followed Jesus from Galilee</b><br>This indicates the long-term commitment and dedication of these women to Jesus' ministry. Galilee was the region where Jesus began His public ministry, and these women had been with Him since then, suggesting they were eyewitnesses to His teachings and miracles. Their journey from Galilee to Jerusalem reflects their loyalty and the significant role they played in supporting Jesus.<p><b>to minister to Him.</b><br>The term "minister" implies service and care, which these women provided throughout Jesus' ministry. This service could have included financial support, preparing meals, and other acts of hospitality. Their ministry to Jesus fulfills the biblical principle of serving others, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/20-28.htm">Matthew 20:28</a>, where Jesus speaks of serving rather than being served.
