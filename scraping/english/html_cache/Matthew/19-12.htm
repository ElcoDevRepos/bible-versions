In biblical times, such individuals were often marginalized, yet Jesus acknowledges their existence and inherent value. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's care for all people, regardless of their physical or social status. The mention of eunuchs here can be seen as a metaphor for those who, by nature, are set apart for a specific purpose, aligning with the biblical principle that God has a unique plan for each person.<p><b>others were made that way by men;</b><br>Historically, eunuchs were often castrated males who served in royal courts, particularly in the ancient Near East and other empires, such as Persia and Rome. This practice was common to ensure loyalty and prevent them from engaging in sexual relations with royal women. The mention of eunuchs made by men highlights the societal and cultural practices of the time, where individuals were often subjected to life-altering changes for the sake of service or control. This can be connected to the broader biblical narrative of human authority and its impact on individuals' lives.<p><b>and still others live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.</b><br>This phrase introduces the concept of voluntary celibacy for spiritual purposes. It reflects the idea of self-denial and dedication to God's work, reminiscent of the Apostle Paul's teachings in <a href="/1_corinthians/7.htm">1 Corinthians 7</a>, where he discusses the benefits of singleness for undistracted devotion to the Lord. This voluntary choice is seen as a higher calling, where individuals prioritize spiritual commitments over earthly ties, echoing the sacrificial nature of Christ's own ministry.<p><b>The one who can accept this should accept it.&#8221;</b><br>Here, Jesus acknowledges that the call to celibacy is not for everyone, but for those who are able to embrace it. This statement respects individual capacity and calling, emphasizing that such a lifestyle is a personal decision rather than a universal mandate. It aligns with the biblical theme of free will and personal conviction in one's spiritual journey. This phrase also underscores the importance of discernment and the recognition of one's unique role in God's kingdom, much like the diverse gifts and callings described in <a href="/romans/12.htm">Romans 12</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/12.htm">1 Corinthians 12</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, providing teaching on the nature of celibacy and commitment to the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/e/eunuchs.htm">Eunuchs</a></b><br>Individuals who are either born without the capacity for marriage, made eunuchs by others, or choose celibacy for spiritual reasons.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_heaven.htm">The Kingdom of Heaven</a></b><br>A central theme in Jesus' teachings, representing God's reign and the spiritual realm that believers are called to prioritize.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_eunuchs_in_context.htm">Understanding Eunuchs in Context</a></b><br>The term "eunuch" in Greek (eunouchos) can refer to those physically unable to marry, those made eunuchs by others, or those who choose celibacy for spiritual reasons.

What they teach is, that only those who are in some sense "eunuchs," who are, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> without the impulses that lead men to marriage, either naturally, or by the mutilation which then, as now, was common in the East, or who have conquered those impulses by the power of self-consecration to a higher life, can safely abstain from marriage. The celibacy of self-indulgence, or even of selfish prudence, tends but too fatally to impurity of heart or life. The man who thus makes himself as the eunuch, must do it "for the kingdom of heaven's sake," not, as too many have understood the words to mean, in order to win heaven for himself (that aim is not excluded, but it must not be the only or chief motive), but for the sake of all that the kingdom of heaven implies, in order to enlarge its range, and more effectually to bring the souls of men to receive it. Those who heard the words could hardly fail, as they thought over them, to look on their Master's life as having been the great perfect example of what He thus taught as to the higher form of holiness. The motives which St. Paul states as determining his own choice of the celibate life (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-7.htm" title="For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man has his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.">1Corinthians 7:7</a>), or the counsel which he gave to others (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/7-32.htm" title="But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:">1Corinthians 7:32-34</a>), are identical with this teaching in their principle. They have influenced men in all ages of the Church, leading them to sacrifice the life of home, with all its blessings, for their work as pastors or evangelists. The Church of Rome and the founders of monastic orders were not wrong in their ideal of the highest form of life. Their mistake lay in enforcing that ideal as a rule on those who had not the power to realise it. The boldness (as it seems to us) of our Lord's language seems intended to teach men that the work must be done as effectively as if, like Origen, they had obeyed the implied commandment in its letter. If the impulses still remain; if life is made miserable by the struggle with them; if they taint the soul by not being allowed to flow in their legitimate channel, the man is, <span class= "ital">ipso facto,</span> disqualified for the loftier ideal. He has not made himself a eunuch for the kingdom of heaven's sake, and he is therefore among those who "cannot receive the saying" that it "is not good to marry." On such grounds the conduct of those who have married after pledging themselves, as priests of the Church of Rome, to vows of celibacy is amply justified. The vows were such as ought never to have been imposed, and men ought never to have taken, and therefore, like the tetrarch's oath (<a href="/context/matthew/14-7.htm" title="Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she would ask.">Matthew 14:7-9</a>), when they were distinctly found to clash with the higher law of Nature, and to narrow what God had left free, their obligatory power ceased. The case of the monk who enters deliberately into an order of which celibacy is a condition, may seem at first to stand on a different footing; but here, also, though celibacy may legitimately be made a condition of continuing to belong to an order, the vow of a lifelong celibacy must be held to have been such as men had no right either to impose or take, and therefore as binding only so long as a man chooses to continue a member of the society which requires it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - Our Lord proceeds to note three classes of men to whom it is given to abstain from marriage. <span class="cmt_word">There are some eunuchs, which were so born.</span> The first class consists of those who are physically unable to contract matrimony, or, having the power, lack the inclination. They are compulsorily continent, and are not voluntary abstainers. Neither is the second class: <span class="cmt_word">those which were made eunuchs of men.</span> Such were common enough in the harems and courts of Orientals. The cruel and infamous treatment which such persons underwent was practised against their will, and consequently their continence had no sort of merit. The third is the only class which of choice and for high reasons lived a celibate life: <span class="cmt_word">which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.</span> This is not to be understood of excision; for this would be a contravention of the order of nature and the good work of creation. Origen, who took the passage literally, and with his own hands mutilated himself, was justly condemned by the verdict of the Church. The verb is to be understood in a metaphorical sense of the mortification of the natural desires and impulses at the cost of much pain and trouble, the spirit conquering the flesh by the special grace of God. The motive of such self-denial is high and pure. It is practised "for the kingdom of heaven's sake," that is, to be free from distraction and the cares and dangers involved in a married life. St. Paul carries forward the Lord's teaching when he writes (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-32.htm">1 Corinthians 7:32, 33</a>), "He that is unmarried is careful for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord; but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife" (comp. <a href="/isaiah/56-3.htm">Isaiah 56:3, 4</a>). The celibate life, deliberately embraced for religion's sake, is here approved by Christ, not to the disparagement of matrimony, but as a counsel which some are enabled to follow to their soul's great benefit. It may be added that the counsel applies also to married persons who sacrifice conjugal endearments for spiritual reasons - "have wives as though they had none" (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-29.htm">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Let him receive it.</span> This is not an injunction, but a permission; it is no universal rule, prescribed to all or to the many; it is a special grace allowed to the few, and by few attained. "Each man," says St. Paul, "hath his own gift from God, one after this manner, and another after that" (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-7.htm">1 Corinthians 7:7, 26</a>). Some think the Essenes are here referred to; but it is not likely that our Lord would endorse the practices of a sect which in some of its tenets was by no means commendable. Rather he is laying down a limitation that, while self-sacrifice and self-dedication to God are acceptable and fraught with peculiar blessings, none should attempt to win heaven in this way, unless they are specially prepared for such a life by the grace of God mastering the human will and controlling every earthly desire. The pre-eminent value set on celibacy by the early Church was learned from this and similar passages; but Christ institutes no comparison between the single and married states; and it would have been wiser to imitate his reserve in estimating the spiritual merits of the two conditions. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/19-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
