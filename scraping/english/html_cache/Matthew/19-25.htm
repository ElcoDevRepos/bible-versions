This teaching followed the encounter with the rich young ruler, who went away sorrowful because he was unwilling to part with his wealth. The disciples, who were often present during Jesus' teachings, were attentive to His words and teachings, which often challenged societal norms and expectations.<p><b>they were greatly astonished</b><br>The astonishment of the disciples reflects their cultural understanding of wealth as a sign of God's favor. In Jewish tradition, wealth was often seen as a blessing from God, and the idea that it could be a hindrance to entering the kingdom of heaven was shocking. This reaction underscores the radical nature of Jesus' teachings, which often turned conventional wisdom on its head.<p><b>and asked, &#8220;Who then can be saved?&#8221;</b><br>The disciples' question reveals their concern and confusion about the requirements for salvation. If those who are perceived as blessed and favored by God (the wealthy) find it difficult to be saved, it raises the question of who can achieve salvation. This question sets the stage for Jesus' subsequent teaching on the nature of salvation, emphasizing that it is not dependent on human effort or status but on God's grace. This theme is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>, which emphasizes salvation by grace through faith, not by works.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples about the challenges of entering the kingdom of heaven, particularly for the wealthy.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are present during this teaching.

&#8220;This&#8221; refers to Jesus&#8217; statement, &#8220;It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/19-24.htm">Matthew 19:24</a>).<p>&#8226; The disciples had just watched a wealthy young ruler walk away sorrowful (<a href="/matthew/19-22.htm">Matthew 19:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; words overturned their long-held assumption that material prosperity meant divine favor, an idea woven into their cultural fabric through passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1-11</a> and <a href="/job/1-10.htm">Job 1:10</a>.<p>&#8226; Parallel accounts confirm that all the disciples &#8220;were amazed at His words&#8221; (<a href="/mark/10-24.htm">Mark 10:24</a>) and that &#8220;those who heard&#8221; reacted similarly (<a href="/luke/18-26.htm">Luke 18:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they were greatly astonished</b><p>&#8226; Their astonishment is genuine shock, not mild surprise; the Greek verb translated &#8220;greatly astonished&#8221; shows intensity, mirrored in <a href="/mark/10-26.htm">Mark 10:26</a>: &#8220;They were even more astonished.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In first-century Jewish thought, the rich appeared blessed and therefore closest to salvation; if such people struggled to enter, what hope remained for anyone?<p>&#8226; Moments like this&#8212;<a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28</a>; 13:54&#8212;show how Jesus consistently upended expectations, calling listeners to rethink every human metric for righteousness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and asked</b><p>&#8226; Instead of turning away in silent confusion, the disciples verbalize their concern, modeling the openness Jesus invites (cf. <a href="/matthew/15-15.htm">Matthew 15:15</a>; <a href="/luke/8-9.htm">Luke 8:9</a>).<p>&#8226; Their question arises from humility: they recognize their limits and seek the Lord&#8217;s explanation (<a href="/james/1-5.htm">James 1:5</a> encourages the same posture).<p>&#8226; The disciples&#8217; willingness to ask rather than presume sets the stage for Jesus to reveal deeper truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Who then can be saved?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The heart of the matter surfaces: salvation cannot be earned by status, wealth, or human effort.<p>&#8226; Jesus immediately responds, &#8220;With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/19-26.htm">Matthew 19:26</a>), declaring divine grace as the sole avenue to salvation.<p>&#8226; Other Scriptures echo this truth:<p>&#8211; &#8220;He saved us, not by works of righteousness that we had done, but according to His mercy&#8221; (<a href="/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;For by grace you have been saved through faith&#8230; not by works, so that no one can boast&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p>&#8211; &#8220;What is impossible with man is possible with God&#8221; (<a href="/luke/18-27.htm">Luke 18:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/19-25.htm">Matthew 19:25</a> captures the disciples&#8217; stunned realization that human qualifications&#8212;especially wealth&#8212;cannot purchase entrance into God&#8217;s kingdom. Their honest question, &#8220;Who then can be saved?&#8221; opens the door for Jesus to proclaim that salvation rests solely on God&#8217;s power and grace. The verse exposes the bankruptcy of self-reliance and points every reader to the only One who can make the impossible possible.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Who then can be saved</span>?--There is an almost child-like <span class= "ital">na&#8249;vete</span> in the question thus asked by the disciples. They, whether among their own people or among strangers, had found the desire of wealth to be the universal passion. Even they themselves, when they had forsaken their earthly goods, had done so (as Peter's question showed but too plainly, <a href="/matthew/19-27.htm" title="Then answered Peter and said to him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed you; what shall we have therefore?">Matthew 19:27</a>) as with a far-sighted calculation. They were counting on outward riches in that kingdom as well as outward glory. And now they heard what seemed to them a sweeping condemnation, excluding all who possessed, and, by implication, all who sought after, riches from the kingdom. The feeling which thus showed itself in the disciples has, curiously enough, affected the text of the narrative in St. Mark. What seems an explanatory and softened statement, "How hardly shall they that trust in riches enter into the kingdom of God!" (<a href="/mark/10-24.htm" title="And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answers again, and said to them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!">Mark 10:24</a>), is not found in the best MSS. The omission may have been an accidental error of the copyists, but it is scarcely probable; and its absence from St. Matthew and St. Luke, not less than that it is not our Lord's usual method to soften or explain His teaching, leads to the conclusion that a marginal note, added by some one who felt as the disciples felt, has here found its way into the text.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Exceedingly amazed.</span> The stern teaching of vers. 23 and 24 thoroughly dismayed and perhaps offended them. Temporal prosperity had in their Law been held forth as the reward of righteousness and obedience, a foretaste of future happiness. They must unlearn this principle. Here, as they understood it, was a doctrine novel, unheard of, unnatural! Fancy the astonishment that would be displayed nowadays if such a sentiment were solemnly propounded in the Stock Exchange, the bank, the market! The apostles could not minimize its import, or say that it might suit other days and other states of society, but was inapplicable to their age and nation. We can do this in the case of many seemingly stringent requirements of the gospel; but they accepted the announcement in its full and simple meaning, and asked in sorrowful wonder, <span class="cmt_word">Who then can be saved?</span> If the way to heaven is barred to the rich man, how shall the poor pass therein? The difficulty seemed to apply to everybody. All who are not rich are hoping and struggling to become rich, and therefore fall under the same category. If the apostles thought not of themselves in this question, they were grieved at the reflection that, under the circumstances, the majority of mankind were recklessly endangering their eternal salvation. With their views of a temporal kingdom, the apostles probably were thinking of their own prospects. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/19-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
