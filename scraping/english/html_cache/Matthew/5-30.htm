It was considered the dominant hand for most people, representing strength and capability. The phrase suggests that even something as valuable and essential as the right hand should be sacrificed if it leads to sin. This hyperbolic language emphasizes the seriousness of sin and the drastic measures one should take to avoid it. The concept of sin here is rooted in the Jewish understanding of actions that separate individuals from God, highlighting the need for personal holiness.<p><b>cut it off and throw it away</b><br>This phrase uses hyperbole to stress the importance of removing anything from one's life that leads to sin. The drastic imagery of cutting off a hand underscores the severity with which one should treat sin. In the cultural context of Jesus' audience, physical mutilation was not advocated, but the metaphor served to illustrate the radical commitment required to pursue righteousness. This teaching aligns with the broader biblical theme of repentance and transformation, where believers are called to turn away from sin and live a life pleasing to God.<p><b>It is better for you to lose one part of your body</b><br>This statement reflects the value of spiritual well-being over physical completeness. The idea is that temporary physical loss is preferable to eternal spiritual loss. This teaching is consistent with the biblical principle that spiritual matters take precedence over physical ones. The notion of losing a part of the body can also be seen as a metaphor for the sacrifices required in the Christian life, where believers are called to deny themselves and take up their cross, as seen in <a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>.<p><b>than for your whole body to depart into hell</b><br>The term "hell" here is translated from the Greek word "Gehenna," which referred to the Valley of Hinnom near Jerusalem. This valley was historically associated with idolatrous practices and later became a symbol of divine judgment and eternal punishment. Jesus uses this imagery to convey the seriousness of sin and the reality of eternal separation from God. The teaching emphasizes the eternal consequences of sin and the importance of living a life aligned with God's will to avoid such a fate. This aligns with the broader biblical narrative of salvation and the call to live a life of holiness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, a foundational teaching moment in His ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples_and_the_crowd.htm">The Disciples and the Crowd</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teachings, representing both His followers and the broader public.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sermon_on_the_mount.htm">The Sermon on the Mount</a></b><br>A significant event where Jesus outlines the principles of the Kingdom of Heaven, emphasizing righteousness and moral integrity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/radical_approach_to_sin.htm">Radical Approach to Sin</a></b><br>Jesus uses hyperbolic language to stress the importance of dealing decisively with sin.
