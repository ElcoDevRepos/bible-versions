This directive is consistent with His approach during His early ministry, where He often sought to avoid drawing premature attention to Himself. This reflects His desire to fulfill His mission according to God's timing, avoiding unnecessary confrontation with religious leaders or political authorities. The Greek word used here for "warning" can also imply a stern charge, indicating the seriousness of His instruction.<p><b>not to make Him known</b><br>Jesus' command to maintain secrecy about His identity and works is often referred to as the "Messianic Secret." This concept is seen throughout the Gospels, where Jesus frequently tells those He heals or His disciples not to reveal His identity as the Messiah. This strategy allowed Him to control the spread of His message and avoid the political and social upheaval that might arise from a premature declaration of His messianic role. It also aligns with prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/42.htm">Isaiah 42:1-4</a>, which speak of the Messiah as a servant who would not cry out or raise His voice in the streets. This approach ensured that His ministry would unfold according to divine timing, ultimately leading to His sacrificial death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is performing miracles and teaching, demonstrating His divine authority and compassion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowds.htm">The Crowds</a></b><br>Large groups of people who followed Jesus, witnessing His miracles and teachings.

The clouds were gathering, but the night had not yet come, and He sought to work while it was yet day, and therefore (again giving an example of His own precept that His disciples should be "wise as serpents and harmless as doves," <a href="/matthew/10-16.htm" title="Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the middle of wolves: be you therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.">Matthew 10:16</a>) sought to avoid premature occasions of offence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And charged them that they should not make him known</span>.
