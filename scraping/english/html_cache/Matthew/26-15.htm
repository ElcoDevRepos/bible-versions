Judas, one of the twelve disciples, approaches the chief priests with the intent to betray Jesus. This act fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, where it is foretold that a close friend would betray the Messiah. The question posed by Judas indicates a premeditated decision to betray Jesus for personal gain, reflecting a heart turned away from loyalty and devotion. The act of betrayal for monetary compensation underscores the theme of greed and the corrupting power of money, as echoed in <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, which states that the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil.<p><b>And they set out for him thirty pieces of silver.</b><br>The chief priests agree to pay Judas thirty pieces of silver, a sum that holds significant biblical and historical meaning. In the Old Testament, thirty pieces of silver was the price of a slave, as stated in <a href="/exodus/21-32.htm">Exodus 21:32</a>. This valuation of Jesus' life as equivalent to that of a slave highlights the depth of His humility and the extent of His sacrifice. Additionally, this transaction fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>, where the prophet is paid thirty pieces of silver, which is then thrown to the potter in the house of the Lord. This prophetic fulfillment underscores the divine orchestration of events leading to the crucifixion, emphasizing that Jesus' betrayal and subsequent death were part of God's redemptive plan. The use of silver, a common currency in ancient times, also symbolizes the materialistic motivations behind Judas's actions, contrasting with the spiritual kingdom Jesus preached.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the twelve disciples of Jesus, who betrayed Him to the chief priests for thirty pieces of silver.

He found the rulers as covetous as himself, and disposed to treat both him and his Master with the utmost contempt. Christ had taken upon him the form of a bondservant, and was here reckoned as such. The transaction had been typically shadowed forth when another Judas sold his brother Joseph for twenty pieces of silver (<a href="/genesis/37-27.htm">Genesis 37:27, 28</a>); when Ahithophel gave counsel against David, his familiar friend (<a href="/2_samuel/16.htm">2 Samuel 16</a>.); and when Zechariah wrote, "I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear.
