They often clashed with Jesus over interpretations of the Law and His teachings. This phrase indicates a deliberate action, suggesting a premeditated plan to confront Jesus. The Pharisees' departure signifies their intent to separate themselves from the crowd and strategize against Jesus, highlighting their opposition to His ministry.<p><b>and conspired</b><br>The term "conspired" implies a secretive and deceitful plan. This reflects the growing hostility towards Jesus from the religious leaders. The Pharisees' actions are not just spontaneous but are part of a calculated effort to undermine Jesus' authority. This conspiracy is indicative of the broader rejection Jesus faced from the religious establishment, fulfilling prophecies about the Messiah being despised and rejected (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<p><b>to trap Jesus</b><br>The goal of the Pharisees was to ensnare Jesus in a legal or theological error. This reflects their inability to accept His teachings and their desire to discredit Him publicly. The use of the word "trap" suggests a malicious intent, akin to setting a snare for an animal. This is consistent with other instances in the Gospels where religious leaders sought to catch Jesus in His words (e.g., <a href="/matthew/16.htm">Matthew 16:1</a>, <a href="/mark/12-13.htm">Mark 12:13</a>).<p><b>in His words</b><br>The focus on Jesus' words underscores the power and authority of His teaching. The Pharisees recognized that Jesus' words had a profound impact on the people, often challenging their own authority and interpretations of the Law. By attempting to trap Him in His words, they hoped to find grounds to accuse Him of blasphemy or sedition. This reflects the broader theme in the Gospels of Jesus' words being a source of life and truth (<a href="/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>, <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>), yet also a point of contention for those who opposed Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious and political group in ancient Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law of Moses and traditions.
