It emphasizes the importance of understanding the context of Jesus' teachings on forgiveness, as seen in <a href="/matthew/18-21.htm">Matthew 18:21-22</a>, where Peter asks about the limits of forgiveness.<p><b>the kingdom of heaven</b><br>This term refers to God's sovereign rule and reign, both in the present spiritual sense and the future physical manifestation. It is a central theme in Jesus' teachings, highlighting the values and principles of God's kingdom, which often contrast with worldly values.<p><b>is like a king</b><br>The king in the parable represents God, who is sovereign and just. Kingship imagery is common in Scripture, illustrating authority, judgment, and the responsibility of rulers. This aligns with Old Testament depictions of God as King, such as in <a href="/psalms/47-7.htm">Psalm 47:7-8</a>.<p><b>who wanted to settle accounts</b><br>This phrase indicates a time of reckoning or judgment. In biblical times, settling accounts was a common practice, reflecting the need for accountability and justice. It parallels the final judgment, where God will hold individuals accountable for their actions, as seen in <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>.<p><b>with his servants</b><br>Servants in this context represent believers or those under God's authority. The relationship between a king and his servants illustrates the dynamic between God and humanity, emphasizing obedience, stewardship, and the expectation of faithfulness.

Jesus has just said forgiveness must be lavish&#8212;&#8220;seventy-seven times.&#8221; The parable that follows is His explanation.<p>&#8226; The phrase ties the teaching on forgiveness directly to the story that begins in verse 23.<p>&#8226; It signals cause and effect: since boundless forgiveness is required, here is what the kingdom looks like when that principle is at work.<p>&#8226; Similar linking phrases appear in <a href="/luke/7-47.htm">Luke 7:47</a>, where forgiveness is illustrated through a debtor story, and in <a href="/matthew/13-13.htm">Matthew 13:13</a>, where Jesus explains why He teaches in parables.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the kingdom of heaven is like</b><p>Jesus is not describing a distant realm but God&#8217;s present reign breaking into human lives (<a href="/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Parables open a window on how God rules and how His people are to live under that rule (<a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24, 31, 33</a>).<p>&#8226; The comparison invites listeners to place themselves inside the story and respond (<a href="/mark/4-24.htm">Mark 4:24</a>).<p>&#8226; Other &#8220;kingdom of heaven is like&#8221; parables&#8212;such as the wheat and weeds (<a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24&#8211;30</a>) and the net (<a href="/matthew/13-47.htm">Matthew 13:47&#8211;50</a>)&#8212;also center on accountability and final reckoning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a king</b><p>The king points unmistakably to God Himself. Scripture repeatedly presents God as King, perfectly just and sovereign (<a href="/psalms/47-7.htm">Psalm 47:7</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-15.htm">1 Timothy 6:15</a>).<p>&#8226; A king possesses full authority to demand an accounting and to dispense mercy.<p>&#8226; By using royal imagery, Jesus underlines both majesty and personal involvement. As in <a href="/matthew/22-2.htm">Matthew 22:2</a>, the king is not aloof; he engages directly with his subjects.<p>&#8226; This image prepares the listener to feel the weight of the servant&#8217;s debt and the wonder of the king&#8217;s compassion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who wanted to settle accounts</b><p>&#8220;Settle accounts&#8221; speaks of evaluation, audit, judgment.<p>&#8226; Every debt is brought to light&#8212;nothing overlooked. <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a> affirms, &#8220;So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God&#8221;.<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores divine holiness.

Because unbounded mercy is the Father&#8217;s nature, life under His reign involves both accountability and astonishing grace. God the King calls every servant to stand before Him, exposes the true debt of sin, cancels that debt through His own compassion, and then expects His forgiven people to mirror His heart toward others.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--Over and above the direct teaching of the parable it has the interest, as regards its form, of being, in some sense, an advance on those of chapter 13, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> as more fully bringing out human interests, and so more after the pattern of those that are characteristic of St. Luke.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 23-35.</span> - <span class="accented">Christ illustrates his precept by the parable of the unmerciful servant, and the stern lesson which he himself enunciates at its close</span>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. because such is the infinite nature of the pardon to be meted out to an offending brother. <span class="cmt_word">The kingdom of heaven.</span> The rule observed in the government of Christ's kingdom with regard to forgiveness is represented by the procedure of a certain earthly king. The picture supposes some great Oriental potentate, with numerous viceroys or satraps, who have to render to him an account of revenues received. These are called <span class="cmt_word">servants</span> in the sense that, though they are high officials, they are the monarch's subordinates and dependents. Both Herodotus and Xenophon apply the term "slave" (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) to the great officers of state. Immense sums of money would pass through their hands. This accounts for the enormous debt of the officer in the parable. Webster and Wilkinson compare the East India Company's collectors, who are high civil <span class="accented">servants</span> of the company, that is, now, of the government. If we regard the parable in a general light, as illustrating God's dealings with sinful man, we must see in the "taking account of his servants," not the judgment of the last day, but those many occasions when God makes a man turn his eyes inward and learn how he stands in the sight of his Lord. Such occasions are sickness, misfortune, great change of circumstances, a new year, reproach of conscience, however aroused, - these and such like incidents awaken a man to his true position, show him his delinquencies and misery. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/18-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Because of</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#953;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(Dia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(touto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
