In the context of <a href="/matthew/14.htm">Matthew 14</a>, Peter had stepped out of the boat to walk on water towards Jesus, demonstrating a moment of faith. However, when he saw the wind, he became afraid and began to sink. Jesus' immediate action underscores His readiness to save and His authority over nature. This act of reaching out is symbolic of divine intervention and support, reflecting the Old Testament imagery of God's saving hand (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). The Sea of Galilee, where this event took place, is known for sudden storms, making Jesus' control over the elements even more significant.<p><b>&#8220;You of little faith,&#8221; He said,</b><br>Jesus' address to Peter as "you of little faith" serves as both a rebuke and a teaching moment. It reflects a recurring theme in the Gospels where Jesus challenges His disciples to grow in their faith (<a href="/matthew/8-26.htm">Matthew 8:26</a>, <a href="/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>). The phrase suggests that faith is not just about initial belief but requires perseverance and trust in the face of fear and doubt. This moment is a call for deeper reliance on Jesus, who is the embodiment of faithfulness and divine power.<p><b>&#8220;why did you doubt?&#8221;</b><br>The question "why did you doubt?" points to the internal struggle Peter faced between faith and fear. Doubt, in this context, is seen as a hindrance to experiencing the fullness of God's power and presence. This echoes <a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6</a>, where believers are encouraged to ask in faith without doubting. The question invites reflection on the nature of doubt and its impact on spiritual growth. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of keeping one's focus on Jesus, who is the author and perfecter of faith (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>). This moment foreshadows the greater trials of faith the disciples will face and the need for unwavering trust in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God who performs miracles and teaches His disciples. In this event, He is walking on water and reaches out to Peter.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>One of Jesus' disciples, known for his impulsive nature and strong faith. In this passage, Peter steps out of the boat to walk on water towards Jesus but begins to sink when he doubts.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sea_of_galilee.htm">Sea of Galilee</a></b><br>The body of water where this event takes place.

They represent the early church and the community of believers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_storm.htm">The Storm</a></b><br>The natural event that sets the scene for this miracle. It symbolizes the trials and challenges faced by believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_doubt.htm">Faith and Doubt</a></b><br>Peter's experience teaches us about the importance of maintaining faith even in challenging circumstances. Doubt can cause us to "sink" spiritually, but Jesus is always there to lift us up.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_immediate_response.htm">Jesus' Immediate Response</a></b><br>The phrase "immediately Jesus reached out His hand" (<a href="/matthew/14-31.htm">Matthew 14:31</a>) highlights Jesus' readiness to save and support us. We can trust in His prompt help when we call out to Him.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/focus_on_christ.htm">Focus on Christ</a></b><br>Just as Peter needed to keep his eyes on Jesus to walk on water, we must focus on Christ to navigate life's storms. Distractions and fears can lead us away from His path.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_calling_out.htm">The Power of Calling Out</a></b><br>Peter's cry for help, "Lord, save me!" is a powerful reminder of the simplicity and effectiveness of prayer. In moments of crisis, calling on Jesus is our best recourse.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/growth_through_trials.htm">Growth Through Trials</a></b><br>This event illustrates how trials can strengthen our faith.

He is not a distant observer; He is the ever-present Savior who intervenes at the moment of need.<p>- For believers today, this reminds us that when we call on Him, His help is not eventual but present. See <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a>, which invites us to &#8220;approach the throne of grace with confidence&#8221; for timely help.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and took hold of Peter</b><p>- Jesus&#8217; hand doesn&#8217;t just touch; it grips. The language paints a literal rescue&#8212;Peter is physically supported by Christ.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/41-13.htm">Isaiah 41:13</a> echoes this: &#8220;For I am the LORD your God who takes hold of your right hand&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a> assures that no one can snatch believers out of His hand, reinforcing the security of His hold.<p>- Notice that Peter&#8217;s footing might still be shaky, but Jesus&#8217; grip is sure. Our stability rests not on our circumstances but on His grasp.<p>- This act also restores fellowship; Peter is brought back from isolation on the waves into close communion with Jesus, anticipating how confession and faith restore us when we falter (<a href="/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You of little faith</b><p>- Jesus diagnoses, He does not condemn. &#8220;Little&#8221; describes size, not absence. Peter had faith&#8212;enough to step out of the boat (v. 29)&#8212;but it wavered.<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/6-30.htm">Matthew 6:30 and 8</a>:26 use the same expression to show that worry and fear shrink trust.<p>- The phrase invites reflection: faith is intended to grow. Peter&#8217;s momentary lapse serves as a gentle lesson rather than a final verdict.<p>- Even &#8220;little faith&#8221; receives a saving hand. The effectiveness of rescue lies in Jesus, not in the perfection of the believer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>why did you doubt?</b><p>- The question exposes the root issue: divided focus. Peter took his eyes off Jesus and looked at the wind (v. 30).<p>&#8226; Compare <a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6</a>&#8212;&#8220;the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.&#8221; Doubt destabilizes.<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a> calls us to fix our eyes on Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith, highlighting the antidote to doubt.<p>- Jesus invites Peter (and us) to examine the causes of doubt: fear, distraction, reliance on sight over trust.<p>- The question is restorative: it points Peter back to unwavering faith while reaffirming that relationship is intact.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/14-31.htm">Matthew 14:31</a> showcases the Savior&#8217;s swift compassion, secure hold, gentle correction, and restorative questioning. Jesus acts immediately, grips firmly, identifies small faith without rejecting it, and exposes doubt so faith can deepen. When storms rise and courage sinks, believers can rely on the same Lord whose hand reaches out, holds fast, and strengthens faith.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And immediately.</span> Without any waste of time, just as in ver. 27. <span class="cmt_word">Jesus stretched forth his hand.</span> So that St. Peter had come up to him (ver. 29). <span class="cmt_word">And caught him;</span> <span class="accented">and took hold of him</span> (Revised Version, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>: cf. <a href="/hebrews/2-16.htm">Hebrews 2:16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/8-9.htm">Hebrews 8:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And said</span>; <span class="accented">saith</span> (Revised Version).
