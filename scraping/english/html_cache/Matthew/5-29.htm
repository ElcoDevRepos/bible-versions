The "right eye" symbolizes something valuable or precious. The eye is a metaphor for desire and temptation, as it is through sight that many temptations enter. This phrase emphasizes the seriousness of sin and the need to address it at its source. The concept of sin here is linked to the heart's intentions, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>, where Jesus speaks about lustful looks being equivalent to adultery.<p><b>gouge it out and throw it away</b><br>This hyperbolic language is not meant to be taken literally but underscores the radical measures one should take to avoid sin. The act of "gouging out" signifies a decisive and painful action to remove sin from one's life. It reflects the Jewish teaching style of using vivid imagery to convey moral truths. The idea is to eliminate anything that leads to sin, no matter how valuable it seems, echoing the call for repentance and transformation found throughout the New Testament.<p><b>It is better for you to lose one part of your body</b><br>This phrase highlights the concept of sacrifice for the sake of spiritual well-being. The loss of a body part is a metaphor for giving up something significant to maintain righteousness. It aligns with the biblical theme of self-denial and taking up one's cross, as mentioned in <a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>. The emphasis is on prioritizing eternal life over temporary, earthly pleasures or attachments.<p><b>than for your whole body to be thrown into hell</b><br>The term "hell" here is translated from the Greek word "Gehenna," which refers to the Valley of Hinnom, a place outside Jerusalem associated with idolatry and child sacrifice in the Old Testament (<a href="/2_kings/23-10.htm">2 Kings 23:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>). By Jesus' time, it had become a symbol of final judgment and eternal separation from God. This phrase serves as a warning about the consequences of unrepentant sin, emphasizing the eternal stakes involved. It reflects the broader biblical narrative of judgment and redemption, urging believers to live in a way that aligns with God's kingdom values.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, a foundational teaching moment in His ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples_and_the_crowd.htm">The Disciples and the Crowd</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing both His followers and the broader public.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sermon_on_the_mount.htm">The Sermon on the Mount</a></b><br>A significant event where Jesus outlines the principles of the Kingdom of Heaven, emphasizing righteousness and inner purity.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/radical_measures_against_sin.htm">Radical Measures Against Sin</a></b><br>Jesus uses hyperbolic language to stress the importance of taking drastic actions to avoid sin.

Throughout Scripture the eye is portrayed as a gateway to the heart (<a href="/genesis/3-6.htm">Genesis 3:6</a>; <a href="/joshua/7-21.htm">Joshua 7:21</a>; <a href="/1_john/2-16.htm">1 John 2:16</a>). Jesus singles out the right eye&#8212;often considered the most valued&#8212;showing that nothing is too precious to surrender if it entices us to sin. Practical takeaways:<p>&#8226; Guard the intake. Like Job, &#8220;I have made a covenant with my eyes&#8221; (<a href="/job/31-1.htm">Job 31:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Redirect quickly. <a href="/psalms/119-37.htm">Psalm 119:37</a> prays, &#8220;Turn my eyes from worthless things.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Replace the gaze. <a href="/philippians/4-8.htm">Philippians 4:8</a> urges fixing our minds on what is pure and praiseworthy, not merely avoiding the impure.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>gouge it out and throw it away</b><p>&#8220;Gouge it out and throw it away&#8221; sounds shocking, yet Jesus deliberately uses startling language to stress decisive action. Scripture is literal and true; the Lord employs vivid imagery to call for radical separation from sin, never glorifying self-harm but underlining sin&#8217;s lethal danger (<a href="/romans/8-13.htm">Romans 8:13</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>). Helpful ways to &#8220;gouge out&#8221; an offending eye today include:<p>&#8226; Eliminating access (<a href="/matthew/18-8.htm">Matthew 18:8&#8211;9</a> mirrors this teaching; compare <a href="/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Installing accountability&#8212;inviting a trusted believer to monitor media choices (<a href="/ecclesiastes/4-9.htm">Ecclesiastes 4:9&#8211;10</a>).<p>&#8226; Filling the gap with godly pursuits&#8212;prayer, Scripture memory, service (<a href="/galatians/5-16.htm">Galatians 5:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It is better for you to lose one part of your body</b><p>&#8220;It is better for you&#8221; highlights Christ&#8217;s loving concern. Losing something valuable in this life is preferable to losing eternal life. <a href="/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a> calls us to present our bodies as living sacrifices; here Jesus applies that sacrifice to the eye. The comparison shows:<p>&#8226; Eternal perspective outweighs temporary comfort (<a href="/2_corinthians/4-17.htm">2 Corinthians 4:17&#8211;18</a>).<p>&#8226; Obedience may be costly, but the reward is greater (<a href="/matthew/13-44.htm">Matthew 13:44&#8211;46</a>).<p>&#8226; Personal responsibility&#8212;no excuse that &#8220;others do it&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/6-5.htm">Galatians 6:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>than for your whole body to be thrown into hell</b><p>Hell (Gehenna) is no metaphorical scare tactic; Jesus speaks of a literal place of judgment (<a href="/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>; <a href="/revelation/20-15.htm">Revelation 20:15</a>). The warning underscores:<p>&#8226; Sin&#8217;s endgame is destruction if unrepented (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14&#8211;15</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s justice is as real as His mercy (<a href="/hebrews/10-26.htm">Hebrews 10:26&#8211;27</a>).<p>&#8226; Salvation provides rescue; perseverance in holiness gives evidence of genuine faith (<a href="/1_peter/1-15.htm">1 Peter 1:15&#8211;17</a>; <a href="/2_peter/1-10.htm">2 Peter 1:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Jesus calls for ruthless warfare against sin because the stakes are eternal. Whatever threatens to drag us into disobedience must be removed, no matter how cherished, for it is far better to part with a prized possession now than to face everlasting loss later.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(29) <span class= "bld">If thy right eye offend thee.</span>--The Greek verb means, strictly, to cause another to stumble or fall into a snare, and this was probably the sense in which the translators used the word "offend." It is doubtful, however, whether it ever had this factitive sense in English outside the Authorised version, and the common use of the word gives so different a meaning that it cannot be regarded as a happy rendering. The difficulty of finding an equivalent is shown by the variations in the successive English versions: "offend," in Tyndal's; "hinder thee," in Cranmer's; "cause thee to offend," in the Geneva; "scandalise," in the Rhemish; "offend," again in the Authorised version. Of these the Geneva is, beyond doubt, the best.<p><span class= "bld">Pluck it out.</span>--The bold severity of the phrase excludes a literal interpretation. The seat of the evil lies in the will, not in the organ of sense or action, and the removal of the instrument might leave the inward taint unpurified. What is meant is, that any sense, when it ministers to sin is an evil and not a good, the loss of which would be the truest gain. Translated into modern language, we are warned that taste, culture, aesthetic refinement may but make our guilt and our punishment more tremendous. It were better to be without them than<p>"Propter vitam vivendi perdere causas."<p>[" And for life's sake to lose life's noblest ends."]<p><span class= "bld">It is profitable.</span>--The element of prudential self-love, of a calculation of profit and loss, is not excluded from Christian motives. As addressed to a nation immersed in the pursuit of gain, it conveys the stern, yet pertinent, warning--"If you must think of profit, make your calculations wisely."<p><span class= "bld">Hell.</span>--Gehenna, as in <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.">Matthew 5:22</a>. The language is still symbolical. The horrid picture of a human body thrown into the foul, offal-fed flame of the Valley of Hinnom is again a parable of something more terrible than itself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29, 30.</span> - Also in <a href="/matthew/18-8.htm">Matthew 18:8, 9</a> (parallel passage, <a href="/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43-47</a>); the chief differences being <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that they are there adduced with reference to "offences" generally; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the foot is mentioned, as well as the eye and the hand. It seems not improbable that this saying was spoken twice. <p>The reason why our Lord did not mention the foot here may be either that that member is less immediately connected with sins of the flesh than the other two (cf. Wetstein, <span class="accented">in loc</span>., "Averte oculum a vultu illecebroso: arce manum ab impudicis contrectationibus"), or, as seems more probable, that the eye and the hand represent the two sets of faculties receptive and active, and together express man's whole nature. The insertion of the foot in ch. 18:8, 9, only makes the illustration more definite. "The remark in ver. 29f treats of what is to be done by the subjects of the kingdom when, in spite of themselves, evil desires are aroused" (Weiss, 'Life,' 2:149). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Right</span>. Not in ch. 18, and parallel passage.

Perhaps the verb originally referred to the stick of a trap (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a Hellenistic word, apparently equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) striking the person's foot, and so catching him in the trap; but when found in literature (almost solely in the New Testament) it has apparently lost all connotation of the trap, and only means causing a person to stumble (for an analysis of its use in the New Testament, <span class="accented">vide</span> especially Cremer, <span class="accented">s.v.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Pluck it out, and cast it from</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee.</span> The second clause shows the purely figurative character of the sentence.
