The term "little faith" is used to describe a deficiency in trust and confidence in God's power and provision. In the context of Matthew, it underscores the disciples' struggle to fully grasp Jesus' divine authority, despite witnessing His miracles. This phrase connects to other instances, such as <a href="/matthew/6-30.htm">Matthew 6:30 and 14</a>:31, where Jesus similarly addresses doubt and encourages trust in God.<p><b>Jesus replied,</b><br>Jesus' response is direct and authoritative, emphasizing His role as a teacher and leader. His reply is not just a rebuke but an invitation to deeper faith. This interaction reflects the rabbinic tradition of teaching through questioning, prompting the disciples to reflect on their understanding and belief.<p><b>&#8220;why are you so afraid?&#8221;</b><br>Fear is a natural human response, but Jesus challenges the disciples to rise above it through faith. This question points to the tension between human fear and divine trust. In the biblical context, fear often signifies a lack of trust in God's sovereignty. The question invites the disciples to consider the presence and power of Jesus, who is with them in the storm, echoing the assurance found in passages like <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>.<p><b>Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea,</b><br>Jesus' action demonstrates His authority over nature, affirming His divine identity. The act of rebuking the winds and the sea is reminiscent of God's control over creation, as seen in Psalms 89:9 and 107:29. This miracle serves as a sign of Jesus' messianic role, fulfilling prophecies about the coming of one who has dominion over the earth.<p><b>and it was perfectly calm.</b><br>The immediate calm that follows Jesus' command illustrates the completeness of His power. This transformation from chaos to peace symbolizes the peace that Jesus brings into the lives of believers. It also serves as a type of the ultimate peace and restoration that will be realized in the Kingdom of God, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>.

They had watched Him heal lepers and a centurion&#8217;s servant (<a href="/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2-13</a>), yet their confidence faltered at the first sign of personal danger.<p>- Similar moments appear later: &#8220;Immediately Jesus reached out His hand &#8230; &#8216;You of little faith,&#8217; He said, &#8216;why did you doubt?&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/14-31.htm">Matthew 14:31</a>). Repetition shows how easily worry eclipses trust.<p>- Scripture consistently links &#8220;little faith&#8221; with misplaced focus: &#8220;If God so clothes the grass of the field &#8230; will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-30.htm">Matthew 6:30</a>).<p>- Takeaway: small faith limits our experience of God&#8217;s power, not because He is unwilling, but because fear crowds Him out.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>why are you so afraid?</b><p>- Fear and faith cannot rule the same heart. The Lord asks, not for information, but to expose the root issue: their gaze had shifted from Him to the storm.<p>- <a href="/2_timothy/1-7.htm">2 Timothy 1:7</a> declares, &#8220;For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and love and self-control.&#8221; The disciples temporarily surrendered that gift.<p>- <a href="/psalms/56-3.htm">Psalm 56:3-4</a> illustrates the proper response: &#8220;When I am afraid, I will trust in You.&#8221; Fear is natural; remaining in fear is a choice.<p>- Perfect love casts out fear (<a href="/1_john/4-18.htm">1 John 4:18</a>). The question invites every believer to trade anxiety for assurance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea</b><p>- With a word, the Creator addresses His creation. <a href="/psalms/89-9.htm">Psalm 89:9</a> affirms, &#8220;You rule the raging sea; when its waves mount up, You still them.&#8221; Jesus exercises the very authority attributed to Yahweh.<p>- The action displays His dual nature: moments earlier He slept in human weakness; now He commands in divine power (<a href="/colossians/1-16.htm">Colossians 1:16-17</a>).<p>- <a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39</a> records the same event: &#8220;He rebuked the wind and said to the sea, &#8216;Peace! Be still!&#8217;&#8221; The harmony among the Gospels strengthens the historicity of the miracle.<p>- <a href="/job/38-8.htm">Job 38:8-11</a> reminds us that God set boundaries for the sea; here Jesus enforces them, proving His identity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and it was perfectly calm</b><p>- The instantaneous calm is as miraculous as the rebuke. Nature responds more quickly to Christ than anxious humans often do.<p>- <a href="/psalms/107-29.htm">Psalm 107:29</a> foreshadows: &#8220;He stilled the storm to a whisper; the waves of the sea were hushed.&#8221;<p>- The physical peace parallels the spiritual peace He offers: &#8220;Peace I leave with you; My peace I give you &#8230; Do not let your hearts be troubled&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>).<p>- <a href="/philippians/4-7.htm">Philippians 4:7</a> promises &#8220;the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding,&#8221; a calm that guards hearts even when storms persist.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/8-26.htm">Matthew 8:26</a> confronts the contrast between fear and faith.

Yet the word "of little faith" was singularly appropriate. They had not altogether lost their trust in Him, but they had not learnt the lesson of the centurion's faith, and were only at ease when they heard His voice, and saw that He was watching over them.<p><span class= "bld">Rebuked the winds and the sea.</span>--This seems to have been almost, so to say, our Lord's formula in working miracles.
