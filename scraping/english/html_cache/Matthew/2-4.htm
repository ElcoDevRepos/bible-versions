The chief priests included the high priest and other temple officials, who were primarily Sadducees, a sect known for their aristocratic status and collaboration with Roman authorities. The scribes, often associated with the Pharisees, were experts in the Jewish Law and held significant influence over religious and legal matters. This assembly reflects Herod's concern over the Magi's inquiry about the "king of the Jews" and his desire to understand the prophecies concerning the Messiah. The gathering of these leaders underscores the importance of the event and the threat Herod perceived to his rule.<p><b>he asked them where the Christ was to be born</b><br>Herod's question reveals his awareness of Jewish Messianic expectations. "The Christ" refers to the anointed one, the Messiah, whom the Jews anticipated as a deliverer and king. The inquiry about the birthplace of the Messiah points to the prophecy in <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>, which specifies Bethlehem as the location. This prophecy is significant as it connects Jesus' birth to the lineage of David, fulfilling the expectation that the Messiah would come from David's line. Herod's question also highlights the tension between political power and divine prophecy, as he seeks to use this information for his own ends, contrasting with the Magi's genuine search for worship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_the_great.htm">Herod the Great</a></b><br>The ruling king of Judea at the time of Jesus' birth, known for his paranoia and tyrannical rule.

The "scribes" were the interpreters of the Law, casuists and collectors of the traditions of the Elders, for the most part Pharisees. The meeting thus convened was not necessarily a formal meeting of the Sanhedrim or Great Council, and may have been only as a Committee of Notables called together for a special purpose. With a characteristic subtlety, as if trying to gauge the strength of their Messianic hopes, Herod acts as if he himself shared them, and asks where the Christ, the expected Messiah, the "anointed" of the Lord (<a href="/psalms/2-2.htm" title="The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,">Psalm 2:2</a>; <a href="/psalms/45-7.htm" title="You love righteousness, and hate wickedness: therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.">Psalm 45:7</a>; <a href="/psalms/89-20.htm" title="I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:">Psalm 89:20</a>) was to be born.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he had gathered... together</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>).

The addition helped to bring out the evangelist's thought that the representatives of the chosen people (<a href="/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>) were fully informed of the coming of Christ. The chief priests (cf. also <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>, note) represented the ecclesiastical and Sadducean part, the scribes the more literary and probably the Pharisaic part, of the nation. The width of the term "all," and the double classification, seem to point to this not being a meeting of the Sanhedrin as such.
