Their indignation reflects a recurring theme in the Gospels where religious authorities oppose Jesus. This opposition is rooted in their fear of losing power and influence, as Jesus' teachings and miracles challenge their authority. The term "indignant" suggests a deep-seated anger and resentment, highlighting their inability to recognize Jesus as the Messiah despite the evidence of His works.<p><b>when they saw the wonders He performed</b><br>The wonders refer to the miraculous acts Jesus performed, such as healing the blind and the lame, which are mentioned earlier in the chapter. These miracles serve as signs of Jesus' divine authority and fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speaks of the Messiah bringing healing. The religious leaders' inability to accept these wonders as divine acts underscores their spiritual blindness and hard-heartedness.<p><b>and the children shouting in the temple courts,</b><br>The presence of children in the temple courts is significant, as it demonstrates the widespread impact of Jesus' ministry. Children, often seen as insignificant in ancient society, recognize Jesus' true identity, contrasting with the religious leaders' rejection. This scene fulfills <a href="/psalms/8-2.htm">Psalm 8:2</a>, which speaks of God ordaining praise from the mouths of children, highlighting the purity and sincerity of their worship.<p><b>&#8220;Hosanna to the Son of David!&#8221;</b><br>"Hosanna" is a Hebrew expression meaning "save now" or "save, we pray," and is a cry for deliverance. The title "Son of David" is a messianic designation, acknowledging Jesus as the promised descendant of David who would establish God's kingdom. This acclamation by the children echoes the crowd's earlier praises during Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem (<a href="/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>), reinforcing His identity as the Messiah. The religious leaders' indignation is further fueled by this messianic recognition, which they perceive as a threat to their authority and the established order.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure performing wonders in the temple, fulfilling His messianic role.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests_and_scribes.htm">Chief Priests and Scribes</a></b><br>Religious leaders who were indignant at the children's praises, representing opposition to Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/children.htm">Children</a></b><br>Young ones in the temple courts, recognizing and proclaiming Jesus as the "Son of David."<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/temple_courts.htm">Temple Courts</a></b><br>The setting of this event, a place of worship and teaching, significant in Jewish religious life.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wonders.htm">Wonders</a></b><br>Miraculous acts performed by Jesus, demonstrating His divine authority and power.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/recognition_of_jesus'_authority.htm">Recognition of Jesus' Authority</a></b><br>The children in the temple recognized Jesus as the "Son of David," a messianic title.

God&#8217;s plan advances despite opposition, and praise rises from unexpected lips, affirming that the promised King has arrived in literal fulfillment of Scripture.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">The chief priests.</span>--These, as commonly in the Gospels, were the heads of the twenty-four courses of the priesthood, as well as Annas and Caiaphas, who were designated by the title in its higher sense, the one as actually high priest, the other as president of the Sanhedrin. (See Note on <a href="/luke/3-2.htm" title="Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.">Luke 3:2</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">The children.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">the boys,</span> the noun being masculine. Taking the Jewish classification of ages, they would probably be from seven to fourteen years old, but in such a narrative as this the general phrase does not exclude younger children.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The chief priests.</span> This term is generally applied to the high priest's deputies and the heads of the twenty-four courses, but it seems here to mean certain sacerdotal members of the Sanhedrin, to whom supreme authority was delegated by the Romans or Herodians (see Josephus, 'Ant.,' 20:10, 5). They formed a wealthy, aristocratical body, and were many of them Sadducees. They joined with the scribes in expressing their outraged feeling, whether simulated or real. <span class="cmt_word">The wonderful things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>); an expression found nowhere else in the New Testament. It refers to the cleansing of the temple and the cures lately performed there. <span class="cmt_word">Children crying in the temple.</span> This fact is mentioned only by St. Matthew. Jesus loved children, and they loved and followed him, taking up the cry which they had heard the day before from the multitude, and in simple faith applying it again to Christ. While grown men are silent or blaspheming, little children boldly sing his praises. <span class="cmt_word">Were sore displeased.</span> Their envious hearts could not bear to see Jesus honoured, elevated in men's eyes by his own beneficent actions, and now glorified by the spontaneous acclamations of these little ones. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
