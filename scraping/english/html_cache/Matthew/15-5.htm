Jesus often used this rhetorical device to highlight the difference between God's commandments and human traditions. The "you" refers to the religious leaders who were known for their strict adherence to the oral traditions that sometimes contradicted the written Law.<p><b>that if anyone says to his father or mother</b><br>The reference to "father or mother" underscores the importance of the fifth commandment, which instructs honoring one's parents (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). In Jewish culture, honoring parents included providing for them in their old age. This was a significant aspect of familial duty and social responsibility.<p><b>&#8216;Whatever you would have received from me</b><br>This phrase implies a financial or material support that children were expected to provide to their parents. In the historical context, there was no social security system, so parents relied on their children for sustenance and care as they aged. This support was not just a cultural expectation but a religious obligation.<p><b>is a gift devoted to God,&#8217;</b><br>The term "gift devoted to God" refers to the practice of Corban, a vow dedicating something to God, which is mentioned in <a href="/mark/7-11.htm">Mark 7:11</a>. This practice allowed individuals to declare their possessions as Corban, meaning they were reserved for God and thus not available for any other use, including supporting one's parents. This tradition was manipulated by some to avoid their responsibilities, effectively nullifying the commandment to honor one's parents.

True devotion to God never contradicts or cancels loving, tangible responsibility toward family.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">It is a gift.</span>--St. Mark (<a href="/mark/7-11.htm" title="But you say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatever you might be profited by me; he shall be free.">Mark 7:11</a>) gives the Hebrew term, Corban, which was literally applied to that which had been consecrated--theoretically to God, practically to the service or ornamentation of the Temple. In <a href="/matthew/27-6.htm" title="And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.">Matthew 27:6</a>, the treasury of the Temple is itself called the Corban. The casuistry of the scribes in this matter seems at first so monstrous that it would be hard to understand how it could have approved itself to any intelligent interpreters of the Law, were it not that the teaching of scholastic and Jesuit moralists presents instances, not less striking, of perverted ingenuity. The train of thought which led them to so startling a conclusion would seem to have been this: to divert to lower human uses that which has been consecrated to God is sacrilege, and therefore a man who turned all his property into a Corban was bound not to expend it on the support even of his nearest relations. But the time of fulfilling the vow of consecration was left to his own discretion, and no one had a right to call him to account for delay. With this loophole, the Corban practice became an easy method of evading natural obligations. It might be pleaded in bar of the claims of nearest relationship, and yet all the while the man might retain the usufruct of his property, and defer the fulfilment of his vow to the last hour of life. It would seem, indeed, that this casuistry went still further, and that the consecration might be only relative, as stopping the claims of this or that person, and expiring when they passed away.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But ye say.</span> In direct contradiction to what "God commanded" <span class="cmt_word">It is a gift</span>, etc. This is better rendered, <span class="accented">That wherewith, thou mightest have been benefited by me is Corban</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> is given, dedicated to God. The vow to consecrate his savings, even at death, to the temple absolved a man from the duty of succouring his parents. It was further ruled that if a son, from any motive whatever, pronounced any aid to his parents to be corban, he was thenceforward precluded from affording them help, the claims of the commandment and of natural affection and charity being superseded by the vow. He seems to have been allowed to expend the money thus saved on himself or any other object except his father and mother. So gross an evasion of a common duty could not be placed in the same category as the omission of unnecessary washings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/15-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(hymeis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
