This fulfills the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>, which states that the Messiah would be "numbered with the transgressors." The presence of these criminals highlights the injustice of Jesus' crucifixion, as He was innocent of any crime. This scene underscores the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies and the nature of Jesus' mission to save sinners.<p><b>one on His right and the other on His left</b><br>The positioning of the robbers, one on each side of Jesus, emphasizes His central role in the crucifixion narrative. This arrangement can be seen as a representation of the choices humanity faces regarding Jesus: acceptance or rejection. The Gospel of Luke provides further insight into this scene, where one of the criminals mocks Jesus, while the other acknowledges His innocence and asks to be remembered in His kingdom (<a href="/luke/23-39.htm">Luke 23:39-43</a>). This interaction illustrates the differing responses to Jesus' offer of salvation. Theologically, this moment reflects the division between those who accept Christ and those who do not, a theme prevalent throughout the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure of the crucifixion, the Son of God, who is being crucified for the sins of humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_robbers.htm">Two Robbers</a></b><br>Criminals crucified alongside Jesus, representing humanity's sinfulness and the fulfillment of prophecy.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/golgotha.htm">Golgotha</a></b><br>The place of the crucifixion, also known as "The Place of the Skull," located outside Jerusalem.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_soldiers.htm">Roman Soldiers</a></b><br>Executors of the crucifixion, representing the authority of the Roman Empire.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jewish_leaders_and_bystanders.htm">Jewish Leaders and Bystanders</a></b><br>Observers of the crucifixion, some of whom mocked Jesus, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' crucifixion between two robbers fulfills Old Testament prophecies, affirming the divine plan and sovereignty of God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_two_robbers.htm">Symbolism of the Two Robbers</a></b><br>The two robbers represent the choice every person faces: to accept or reject Jesus.

It would seem, as there is no record of their trial, as if they were already under sentence of death; and it is probable enough that they were members of the same band, and had been sharers in the same insurrection. The legends of the Apocryphal <span class= "ital">Gospel of Nicodemns</span> (i. 10), give their names as Dysmas and Gysmas, and these names appear still in the Calvaries and Stations of Roman Catholic countries.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>. St. Matthew does not give the exact sequence of events, generally grouping them together for ethical and other kindred reasons.

Thus was Christ "numbered with the transgressors" (<a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>). St. Luke alone relates the acceptance of the penitent thief. If he was the one set on the right hand, possibly the careful mention of the position of the two robbers, which is found in the ether evangelists, may have a silent reference to this episode. We know from Josephus ('Ant.,' 16:10, 8; 20:8, 10; 'Belt. Jud.,' 2:12, 2, etc.) that Palestine was infested with banditti, who were rigorously pursued by the Romans, and were commonly crucified when captured. Doubtless these two criminals had been taken red-handed in some act of robbery and murder, and it was an exquisite malice that treated Jesus as their comrade and accomplice, and placed him in the position of their leader. But Augustine sees a spiritual signification in this scene: "The very cross was the tribunal of Christ; for the Judge was placed in the middle; one thief, who believed, was set free; the other, who reviled, was condemned; which signified what he was already about to do with the quick and dead; being about to set some on his right hand, but ethers on his left." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Two</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#973;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(dyo)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1417.htm">Strong's 1417: </a> </span><span class="str2">Two.
