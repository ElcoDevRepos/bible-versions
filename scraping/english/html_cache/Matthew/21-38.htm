The tenants symbolize the religious leaders and the people who have been entrusted with God's vineyard, Israel. The act of seeing the son indicates recognition and awareness of his identity and authority. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God's messengers being rejected by those they are sent to, as seen in the rejection of prophets throughout the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25-26</a>).<p><b>they said to one another</b><br>This phrase highlights the premeditated nature of the tenants' actions. It suggests a conspiracy and collective decision-making process among the tenants, akin to the plotting of the religious leaders against Jesus. This mirrors the council of the Sanhedrin, where the chief priests and Pharisees conspired to arrest and kill Jesus (<a href="/john/11-47.htm">John 11:47-53</a>).<p><b>&#8216;This is the heir.</b><br>The acknowledgment of the son as the heir underscores his rightful claim to the vineyard, symbolizing Jesus' divine authority and messianic role. In Jewish culture, the heir held a position of honor and was entitled to the inheritance. This recognition by the tenants parallels the understanding of Jesus' identity by some religious leaders, who, despite knowing his claims, chose to reject him (<a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>).<p><b>Come, let us kill him</b><br>This phrase reveals the tenants' malicious intent and willingness to commit murder to achieve their goals. It foreshadows the crucifixion of Jesus, where the religious leaders sought to eliminate him to maintain their power and control. The call to kill the son echoes the Old Testament accounts of prophets being killed for delivering God's message (<a href="/matthew/23-37.htm">Matthew 23:37</a>).<p><b>and take his inheritance.&#8217;</b><br>The desire to take the inheritance reflects the tenants' greed and usurpation of authority. It symbolizes the religious leaders' attempt to seize control of God's kingdom for themselves, rejecting the rightful heir, Jesus. This act of rebellion against God's plan is reminiscent of Satan's original rebellion and the ongoing spiritual battle for dominion over God's creation (<a href="/isaiah/14-12.htm">Isaiah 14:12-14</a>). The inheritance ultimately points to the kingdom of God, which Jesus came to establish and which the religious leaders sought to control for their own purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/tenants.htm">Tenants</a></b><br>These are the individuals who were entrusted with the care of the vineyard. In the parable, they represent the religious leaders of Israel who were given the responsibility to lead and care for God's people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son.htm">The Son</a></b><br>This figure represents Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was sent by the Father.

This is the great element in the guilt of his rejection. They might have had the same consciousness of Christ's Divine mission as Nicodemus (<a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>), having possessed the same opportunities of judging. Ancient prophecy, the signs of the times, the miracles and teaching of Christ, the testimony of the Baptist, pointed to one evident conclusion; evidence had been accumulating on all sides. A latent feeling had grown up that he was the Messiah (see <a href="/john/11-49.htm">John 11:49-52</a>), and it was obstinate prejudice and perversity alone that prevented his open acknowledgment. "If I had not come and spoken unto them," said Christ, "they had not had sin; but now they have no cloke for their sin" (<a href="/john/15-22.htm">John 15:22</a>; comp. <a href="/john/9-41.htm">John 9:41</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They said among themselves.</span> They plotted his destruction (see <a href="/john/11-53.htm">John 11:53</a>).

Here the parable bursts from the allegorical form, and becomes history and prophecy. In fact, the possession which the rulers coveted was supremacy over the minds and consciences of men; they wished to lord it over God's heritage; to retain their rights and prerogatives in the present system. This ambition Christ's teaching and action entirely overthrew. They felt no security in their possession of authority while he was present and working in their midst. Were he removed, their position would be safe, their claims undisputed. Hence their conspiracy and its result - a result very far from what they expected. They had their own way, but their gain was ruin. Says St. Augustine, "Ut possiderent, occiderunt; et quia occiderunt, perdiderunt." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-38.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But when</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(Hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
