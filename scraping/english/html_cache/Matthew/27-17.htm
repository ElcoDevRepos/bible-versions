This assembly represents the collective voice of the people, which plays a crucial role in the unfolding events. The crowd's presence also fulfills the prophetic nature of Jesus' trial and crucifixion, as foretold in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as being despised and rejected by men.<p><b>Pilate asked them</b><br>Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor, is a key figure in the trial of Jesus. His role highlights the political tension between Roman authority and Jewish leadership. Pilate's questioning indicates his attempt to placate the crowd and maintain order, while also revealing his own uncertainty about condemning an innocent man. This moment underscores the fulfillment of Jesus' prediction in <a href="/matthew/20-18.htm">Matthew 20:18-19</a>, where He foretold His delivery to the Gentiles for crucifixion.<p><b>&#8220;Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?&#8221;</b><br>The choice between Barabbas and Jesus is laden with symbolic meaning. Barabbas, a known insurrectionist and murderer, represents the sinful nature of humanity and the desire for a political messiah who would overthrow Roman rule. In contrast, Jesus, referred to as "Christ," signifies the true Messiah, the anointed one who brings spiritual salvation. This moment is a profound illustration of substitutionary atonement, where the innocent Jesus is condemned in place of the guilty Barabbas, reflecting the core of the Gospel message as seen in <a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>. The title "Christ" emphasizes Jesus' divine mission and fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the Messiah, such as those found in <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a> and <a href="/daniel/9-25.htm">Daniel 9:25-26</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who presided over the trial of Jesus.
