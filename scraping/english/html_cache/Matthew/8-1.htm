The mountain setting is reminiscent of Moses receiving the Law on Mount Sinai, drawing a parallel between Moses as the lawgiver and Jesus as the fulfillment of the Law. The mountain symbolizes a place of divine revelation and authority. Jesus descending from the mountain signifies His transition from teaching to demonstrating His authority through miracles.<p><b>large crowds followed Him</b><br>The large crowds indicate Jesus' growing popularity and the impact of His teachings. This reflects the people's recognition of His authority and the hope they placed in Him as a potential Messiah. The crowds were likely composed of a diverse group, including Jews from various regions, curious onlookers, and those seeking healing. This following fulfills prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>, which speaks of a great light dawning on those in darkness, and highlights Jesus' role as a shepherd gathering His flock.

St. Matthew has given a lengthy summary of the teaching of the Christ, and he now supplements it by a summary of his daily work.
