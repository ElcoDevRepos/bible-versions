The vineyard is a common biblical metaphor for Israel (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>) and God's kingdom. The landowner represents God, who calls people to work in His kingdom. The invitation to "go into my vineyard" signifies God's call to service and participation in His work. This reflects the inclusivity of God's call, extending to all, regardless of the time or circumstances of their calling. The vineyard setting also highlights the agricultural context of first-century Palestine, where vineyards were a significant part of the economy and daily life.<p><b>&#8216;and I will pay you whatever is right.&#8217;</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the justice and fairness of God. The landowner's promise to pay "whatever is right" suggests a trust in his integrity and fairness, reflecting God's righteous nature. In the parable, this statement challenges human notions of fairness, as later workers receive the same wage as those who worked all day, illustrating the concept of grace. This mirrors the biblical theme that God's ways are higher than human ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). The promise of a fair wage also connects to the broader biblical principle of just compensation for labor (<a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>; <a href="/james/5-4.htm">James 5:4</a>). The phrase invites reflection on the nature of divine justice and grace, which often surpass human understanding and expectations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/landowner.htm">Landowner</a></b><br>Represents God, who is sovereign and just, calling workers into His service.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/v/vineyard.htm">Vineyard</a></b><br>Symbolizes the Kingdom of Heaven, where believers are called to labor.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/l/laborers.htm">Laborers</a></b><br>Represents believers or those called to serve in God's Kingdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/marketplace.htm">Marketplace</a></b><br>The world where people are waiting for purpose and calling.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/w/wages.htm">Wages</a></b><br>Symbolizes the rewards or blessings given by God, which are just and right.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_justice.htm">God's Sovereignty and Justice</a></b><br>God, as the landowner, is sovereign in His calling and just in His rewards.

They did not stipulate for wages, or ask, as the disciples had asked, "What shall we have therefore?" The implied lesson thus suggested is, that a little work done, when God calls us, in the spirit of trust, is better than much done in the spirit of a hireling.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye also;</span> implying that he had already set some to work at fixed wages. <span class="cmt_word">Whatsoever is right</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); just and fair.
