This time reference is significant in understanding the workday in ancient Israel, which typically started early in the morning. The third hour was still early enough for laborers to be hired and complete a full day's work. This timing also reflects the urgency and diligence of the landowner, who is eager to gather workers for his vineyard, symbolizing God's kingdom and His call to service.<p><b>he went out</b><br>The landowner's action of going out himself indicates a proactive and personal approach. This reflects the character of God, who actively seeks out individuals to participate in His work. It emphasizes the initiative of God in reaching out to humanity, rather than waiting for people to come to Him. This mirrors the biblical theme of God as the Good Shepherd who seeks out His sheep.<p><b>and saw others standing</b><br>The act of seeing others standing suggests awareness and compassion. The landowner notices those who are idle, indicating his concern for their well-being and potential. This can be seen as a reflection of God's omniscience and His ability to see the needs and potential of every individual. It also highlights the theme of divine selection and calling, where God sees beyond the surface to the heart and potential of a person.<p><b>in the marketplace</b><br>The marketplace was a central location in ancient towns where people gathered for trade and employment. It was common for day laborers to wait there in hopes of being hired. This setting underscores the reality of economic uncertainty and the dependence of laborers on the mercy of employers. The marketplace serves as a metaphor for the world, where people are waiting for purpose and direction, and God calls them into His service.<p><b>doing nothing</b><br>The phrase "doing nothing" indicates idleness, not necessarily by choice but due to lack of opportunity. It reflects the human condition of spiritual idleness without God's intervention. This highlights the grace of God, who calls individuals not based on their merit or activity but out of His generosity and desire to give purpose. It also connects to the broader biblical theme of God providing for those who are unable to provide for themselves, as seen in the provision of manna in the wilderness or Jesus feeding the 5,000.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/landowner.htm">Landowner</a></b><br>Represents God, who is sovereign and just, calling workers into His vineyard at different times.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/marketplace.htm">Marketplace</a></b><br>Symbolizes the world where people are waiting for purpose and calling.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/w/workers.htm">Workers</a></b><br>Individuals called by God to serve in His kingdom, representing believers at various stages of their spiritual journey.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/v/vineyard.htm">Vineyard</a></b><br>Represents the Kingdom of God, where believers are called to labor and serve.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/third_hour.htm">Third Hour</a></b><br>Refers to approximately 9 a.m. in Jewish timekeeping, indicating the landowner's continued pursuit of workers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_grace.htm">God's Sovereignty and Grace</a></b><br>God initiates the call to service, demonstrating His sovereignty and grace in choosing workers for His vineyard.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_serve.htm">The Call to Serve</a></b><br>Believers are called to be active participants in God's kingdom, responding to His invitation to work in His vineyard.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/purpose_and_timing.htm">Purpose and Timing</a></b><br>God's timing in calling individuals to serve is perfect, and He has a purpose for each person at every stage of life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/diligence_in_service.htm">Diligence in Service</a></b><br>We are encouraged to be diligent and faithful in our service, recognizing that our labor is for the Lord and not in vain.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/unity_in_the_body_of_christ.htm">Unity in the Body of Christ</a></b><br>Regardless of when we are called, we are united in purpose and mission, working together for the glory of God.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_20_3_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 20:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_20_3_God_s_pursuit_of_the_lost.htm">How does Matthew 20:3 illustrate God's pursuit of those not yet serving Him?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_the_third_hour_symbolize.htm">What does the "third hour" symbolize about God's timing in our lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Matthew_20_3_to_daily_work.htm">How can we apply the lesson of Matthew 20:3 in our daily work?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/OT_passages_like_Matthew_20_3_call.htm">What Old Testament passages parallel the laborers' call in Matthew 20:3?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_20_3_Fairness_in_God_s_kingdom.htm">How does Matthew 20:3 challenge our understanding of fairness in God's kingdom?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_20_3_on_God_s_timing_in_calling.htm">What does Matthew 20:3 reveal about God's timing in calling people to His work?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_20_3_Fairness_in_God_s_kingdom_2.htm">How does Matthew 20:3 challenge our understanding of fairness in God's kingdom?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_landowner_go_out_at_various_times.htm">Why does the landowner go out at different times in Matthew 20:3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_20.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_equal_pay_for_latecomers.htm">Why do latecomers receive equal pay as early workers?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_day_14_teach_in_journey.htm">What events transpired during the crucifixion of Jesus?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/bible's_view_on_capitalism.htm">What is the Bible's perspective on capitalism?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_equal_pay_for_latecomers_in_matthew_20.htm">Matthew 20:1-16 - If God is perfectly just, why would He reward latecomers the same as those who worked all day?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Matthew 20:3 Mean</div><b>About the third hour</b><p>&#8220;About the third hour&#8221;

9 a.m. is still early, showing the landowner&#8217;s eagerness to fill his vineyard (cf. <a href="/john/9-4.htm">John 9:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us that God acts at precise moments He ordains; He is never late, never haphazard (<a href="/ecclesiastes/3-1.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he went out</b><p>The initiative is entirely the landowner&#8217;s; the workers do not come to him.<p>&#8226;

The verse assures us that God initiates, notices, and redeems our idle moments, turning availability into fruitful labor by His gracious call.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">About the third hour.</span>--Reckoning the day after the Jewish mode, as beginning at 6 A.M., this would bring us to 8 A.M. The "market-place" of a town was the natural place in which the seekers for casual labour were to be found waiting for employment. In the meaning which underlies the parable we may see a reference to those who, like St. Matthew (<a href="/matthew/9-9.htm" title="And as Jesus passed forth from there, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said to him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.">Matthew 9:9</a>) and the disciples called in <a href="/context/matthew/8-19.htm" title="And a certain scribe came, and said to him, Master, I will follow you wherever you go.">Matthew 8:19-22</a>, were summoned after the sons of Jonas and of Zebedee.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The third hour.</span> It seems that at this time the Jews divided the day, reckoned between sunrise and sunset, into twelve equal parts, the length of these divisions varying according to the season. The day in Palestine at longest consisted of fourteen European hours twelve minutes, and at shortest of nine hours forty-eight minutes, so that the difference between the longest and shortest division of the so called Jewish "hour" was twenty-two minutes. It is usual to consider the Hebrew day as lasting from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., the sixth hour corresponding to our noon, the first hour being 7 o'clock and the third 9 a.m. This estimate, though not absolutely correct, is near enough to the fact to serve all expository purposes. The four periods mentioned in the parable are quarters of the working day, in which a proportional part of the day's wages might be earned. <span class="cmt_word">Standing idle in the marketplace.</span> The Greek agora, the Roman forum, and the Eastern marketplace, was the usual place where idlers and expectant labourers gathered together. Such a scene may often nowadays be witnessed in Oriental cities, and indeed at our own docks, and in many of our small country towns. It must be supposed that the labourers now hired either were not present when the householder first went forth, or that they had then rejected his offer, but now thought better of it. And so, in the case of the others later on. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/20-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">About</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(peri)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4012.htm">Strong's 4012: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the base of peran; properly, through, i.e. Around; figuratively with respect to; used in various applications, of place, cause or time.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the third</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#961;&#943;&#964;&#951;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(trit&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5154.htm">Strong's 5154: </a> </span><span class="str2">Third.
