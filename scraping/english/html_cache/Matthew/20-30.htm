The fact that there are two blind men may emphasize the completeness of their testimony and the certainty of the miracle. Sitting beside the road suggests their marginalization in society, as the blind were often reduced to begging. This setting is near Jericho, a city with a rich biblical history, known for the fall of its walls in the Old Testament, symbolizing the breaking down of barriers.<p><b>When they heard that Jesus was passing by,</b><br>The blind men&#8217;s awareness of Jesus' presence, despite their physical blindness, highlights their spiritual insight. This moment underscores the importance of faith coming by hearing, as noted in <a href="/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a>. Jesus' reputation as a healer and teacher had spread, and even those marginalized by society were aware of His power and authority.<p><b>they cried out,</b><br>Their cry is an act of desperation and faith. In the cultural context, shouting in public was a bold move, especially for those considered lowly. This action reflects their belief that Jesus could change their circumstances, demonstrating a faith that is vocal and persistent.<p><b>&#8220;Lord, Son of David,</b><br>The title "Lord" acknowledges Jesus' authority and divinity. "Son of David" is a messianic title, recognizing Jesus as the promised descendant of David who would establish an everlasting kingdom, as prophesied in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>. This acknowledgment of Jesus as the Messiah is significant, especially coming from those who were physically blind yet spiritually perceptive.<p><b>have mercy on us!&#8221;</b><br>Their plea for mercy indicates a recognition of their need for divine intervention. Mercy, in this context, is not just about physical healing but also encompasses forgiveness and restoration. This request aligns with the biblical theme of God&#8217;s compassion and willingness to respond to those who humbly seek Him, as seen throughout the Psalms and the teachings of Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/two_blind_men.htm">Two Blind Men</a></b><br>These individuals represent those in need of physical and spiritual healing.

The verse teaches that Jesus welcomes those who call on Him, fulfills messianic prophecy, and delights to answer humble, persistent pleas for mercy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">Behold, two blind men sitting.</span>--Two difficulties present themselves on comparing this narrative with the accounts of the same or a similar event in St. Mark and St. Luke. (1.) The former agrees with St. Matthew as to time and place, but speaks of <span class= "ital">one</span> blind man only, and gives his name as "Bartimseus, the son of Timaeus." (2.) The latter speaks of one only, and fixes the time of the miracle at our Lord's entry into Jericho. The probable explanation of (1) is, that of the two men, the one whom St. Mark names was the more conspicuous and better known, and of (2), that St. Luke, visiting the scene and having the spot pointed out to him outside the gates of the city, was left to conjecture, or was misinformed, as to the work having been done when our Lord drew nigh unto it. The fact that St. Luke alone records the incident connected with Zacchaeus (<a href="/context/luke/19-1.htm" title="And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.">Luke 19:1-10</a>) indicates either that he had been on the spot as an inquirer, or had sought for local sources of information. The assumption that he recorded a different miracle from St. Matthew and St. Mark is possible, but hardly probable, and certainly needless, except on a very rigid and <span class= "ital">a priori</span> theory of inspiration. It is possible, again, that St. Luke's local inquiries may have made his narrative more accurate than the recollection on which St. Matthew's and St. Mark's rested.<p><span class= "bld">O Lord, thou son of David.</span>--The blind men probably echoed the whispered murmurs of the crowd that was sweeping by, or, in any case, used (as did the woman of Canaan, <a href="/matthew/15-22.htm" title="And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried to him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, you son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.">Matthew 15:22</a>) the most popular and widely diffused of the names of the Messiah. They were beggars, and they appealed to the pity of the King.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Two blind men.</span> St. Matthew is doubtless accurate in this statement. Tradition might easily drop one of the sufferers in the course of time, but it is not likely to have multiplied one into two. These sufferers had heard of the miracles of healing performed by Jesus in his various circuits, and especially of the late cure at Jerusalem of one born blind, and they were ready to believe in his power and to profit by his mercy. <span class="cmt_word">Heard</span>. The beggars (<a href="/mark/10-46.htm">Mark 10:46</a>), debarred from sight, had their attention aroused by the tread of numerous feet, and the voices of the excited crowd, and naturally asked the bystanders to tell them what it all meant. When they heard that Jesus was there, the hope of relief immediately rushed into their mind. <span class="cmt_word">Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David!</span> "O Lord" is only the usual respectful address of an inferior to one in higher station; but to call on Jesus as "Son of David" was virtually to acknowledge him to be the Messiah, who, as old prophets foretold, was to open the eyes of the blind (<a href="/isaiah/29-18.htm">Isaiah 29:18</a>; <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>).
