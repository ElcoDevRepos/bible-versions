The imperative "Get up!" signifies urgency and divine intervention. In biblical narratives, dreams often serve as a medium for God&#8217;s communication, as seen with Joseph in Genesis. The angel's appearance underscores the importance of obedience to divine instructions.<p><b>&#8220;Take the Child and His mother</b><br>The Child refers to Jesus, and His mother is Mary. This phrase emphasizes the protective role Joseph plays in the Holy Family. The order of mention, with the Child first, highlights Jesus' centrality. Joseph's responsibility is to safeguard the Messiah, fulfilling his role as a guardian chosen by God.<p><b>and go to the land of Israel,</b><br>The land of Israel is significant as the Promised Land, central to Jewish identity and God's covenant with His people. Returning to Israel signifies a fulfillment of prophecy and divine plan. This journey mirrors the Exodus, where God leads His people back to the land He promised.<p><b>for those seeking the Child&#8217;s life are now dead.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase refers to Herod the Great, who sought to kill Jesus, fearing the loss of his throne. Herod's death is historically placed around 4 B.C. The phrase echoes God's protection over His chosen ones, similar to how He protected Moses from Pharaoh.
