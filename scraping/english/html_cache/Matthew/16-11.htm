The context is crucial: Jesus had just performed the miracles of feeding the 5,000 and the 4,000, demonstrating His power over physical needs. The disciples' concern about physical bread shows their lack of spiritual insight. This reflects a common theme in the Gospels where Jesus' teachings are often misunderstood by His followers, who focus on the literal rather than the spiritual. This phrase challenges believers to seek deeper spiritual truths beyond the surface level.<p><b>But beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.&#8221;</b><br>Leaven, or yeast, is used metaphorically here. In Jewish culture, leaven often symbolizes corruption or sin, as seen in the Passover tradition where unleavened bread is used to signify purity. The Pharisees and Sadducees were influential Jewish sects during Jesus' time, known for their strict adherence to the law and their political power, respectively. Jesus warns against their teachings, which were marked by hypocrisy, legalism, and a lack of true understanding of God's will. This warning is a call to discernment, urging believers to be cautious of doctrines that deviate from the truth of the Gospel. The reference to leaven connects to other scriptures, such as <a href="/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6-8</a>, where Paul warns about the corrupting influence of sin. This phrase emphasizes the importance of maintaining purity in doctrine and practice, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of holiness and truth.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples about spiritual discernment and the dangers of false teachings.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are being instructed.

And the disciples, slow of heart as they were, followed the clue thus given. "Then understood they." Memory did at last quicken faith, and faith imparted the imaginative insight which sees its way through parables and dark sayings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">That I spake it not to you,</span> etc. The Revised Version, following many modern editors, divides the clause into two, thus: <span class="accented">that I spake not to you concerning bread? But beware of the leaven</span>, etc. This is the second ground for the Lord's reproof administered to the apostles. They had taken in a carnal, literal sense a word which he had used in a symbolical or mystical meaning. It is the want of spiritual discernment which he censures. They had had frequent opportunities of hearing and appreciating his mode of teaching: miracles, parables, discourses, had an inner signification, which it was their duty to apprehend. The want of understanding was a moral fault for which they were answerable. We may say it would have been easier for our Lord to have spoken of doctrine without using the misunderstood figure of leaven. But it is in the way of his providence to speak words which need thought and grace to make them fully comprehended. They are thus more impressed upon the heart and memory, and bring forth better fruit. A well instructed Hebrew ought to have no difficulty in understanding metaphorical allusions. His Scriptures were full of them, and could not be intelligently read without the light thus cast upon them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/16-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">How</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#8182;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#333;s)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4459.htm">Strong's 4459: </a> </span><span class="str2">Adverb from the base of pou; an interrogative particle of manner; in what way?; also as exclamation, how much!</span><br /><br /><span class="word">can you not understand</span><br /><span class="grk">&#957;&#959;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(noeite)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3539.htm">Strong's 3539: </a> </span><span class="str2">From nous; to exercise the mind, i.e. to comprehend, heed.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">that</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(hoti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3754.htm">Strong's 3754: </a> </span><span class="str2">Neuter of hostis as conjunction; demonstrative, that; causative, because.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I was not telling you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
