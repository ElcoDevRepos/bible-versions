"That day" is often associated with the Day of the Lord, a time of divine reckoning and fulfillment of prophecy. In the context of <a href="/matthew/7.htm">Matthew 7</a>, Jesus is addressing the reality that not everyone who appears to be a follower will enter the kingdom of heaven. This highlights the importance of genuine faith and obedience over mere outward appearances or verbal professions.<p><b>&#8216;Lord, Lord,</b><br>The repetition of "Lord" signifies urgency and desperation. In biblical times, repeating a name was a way to express deep emotion or emphasis. This reflects the speakers' recognition of Jesus' authority and divinity, yet it also underscores the irony that mere acknowledgment of His lordship is insufficient for salvation. This echoes the warning in <a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21</a>, where Jesus emphasizes doing the will of the Father as the true mark of discipleship.<p><b>did we not prophesy in Your name,</b><br>Prophesying in Jesus' name suggests that these individuals were engaged in religious activities and claimed to speak on behalf of God. In the early church, prophecy was a spiritual gift (<a href="/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>), but the presence of false prophets was also a concern (<a href="/matthew/24-11.htm">Matthew 24:11</a>). This phrase warns against relying on spiritual gifts or religious activities as evidence of a right relationship with God, emphasizing the need for true obedience and alignment with God's will.<p><b>and in Your name drive out demons</b><br>Casting out demons was a sign of the authority given by Jesus to His disciples (<a href="/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14-15</a>). However, the ability to perform such acts does not guarantee a genuine relationship with Christ. The mention of driving out demons highlights the power of Jesus' name, but also serves as a caution against equating miraculous works with spiritual authenticity. This is further illustrated in <a href="/acts/19-13.htm">Acts 19:13-16</a>, where the sons of Sceva attempt to use Jesus' name without true faith.<p><b>and perform many miracles?&#8217;</b><br>Miracles, or "mighty works," were often seen as evidence of divine power and authority. In the Gospels, Jesus performed numerous miracles to demonstrate His messianic identity and compassion. However, this phrase underscores that performing miracles is not synonymous with being a true follower of Christ. The emphasis is on the heart and obedience to God's will, as seen in the parable of the wise and foolish builders (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>). This serves as a reminder that external signs and wonders are not the ultimate measure of one's faith or standing before God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, which is a foundational teaching of Christian ethics and discipleship.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_disciples.htm">False Disciples</a></b><br>Individuals who claim to have performed works in Jesus' name but lack a true relationship with Him.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_day.htm">Judgment Day</a></b><br>The future event when all individuals will stand before Christ to be judged for their deeds and relationship with Him.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/true_relationship_over_works.htm">True Relationship Over Works</a></b><br>The emphasis is on knowing Christ personally rather than merely performing religious acts.<br><br>Works done without a genuine relationship with Jesus are insufficient for salvation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/self-examination.htm">Self-Examination</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to examine their hearts and motives to ensure their faith is genuine.<br><br>It is crucial to assess whether one's actions stem from a true love for Christ or from a desire for self-glorification.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_self-deception.htm">The Danger of Self-Deception</a></b><br>This verse warns against the danger of self-deception, where individuals believe they are saved based on their works rather than their relationship with Christ.<br><br>It is a call to humility and repentance, recognizing that salvation is by grace through faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_obedience.htm">The Importance of Obedience</a></b><br>Genuine faith is evidenced by obedience to Christ's teachings.<br><br>Obedience is not merely about external actions but about a heart transformed by the Holy Spirit.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_7_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 7:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Align_works_with_God_s_will_in_Matt_7_22.htm">How can we ensure our works align with God's will in Matthew 7:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_7_22_Genuine_faith_vs_actions.htm">What does Matthew 7:22 teach about the importance of genuine faith over actions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Matthew_7_22_James_2_17_on_faith.htm">How does Matthew 7:22 connect with James 2:17 on faith and works?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_identify_false_prophets_2.htm">In what ways can we discern false prophets as warned in Matthew 7:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Matthew_7_22_to_today_s_spirituality.htm">How can we apply Matthew 7:22 to evaluate our spiritual life today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_7_22_s_entry_criteria_for_heaven.htm">What does Matthew 7:22 reveal about the criteria for entering the kingdom of heaven?

At the commencement of His ministry, in a discourse which, though it is spoken in the tone of authority, gives no prominence to His mission as the Messiah, He yet claims, with the calmness of assured conviction, to be the Judge before whom the faithful and the hypocrites will alike have to give an account. In "that day" (the words, though they would not suggest, as afterwards, the thought of His own advent, would yet carry the minds of men to the "great and dreadful day" of <a href="/malachi/4-5.htm" title="Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:">Malachi 4:5</a>) the words "Lord, Lord," would mean more than the expression of human courtesy.<p><span class= "bld">Have we not prophesied in thy name?</span>--Here, also, there is the implied calm assertion of a supernatural power, not resting in Himself alone, but imparted to His followers, and exercised, or at least claimed, by some who did not themselves fulfil the conditions of His kingdom.
