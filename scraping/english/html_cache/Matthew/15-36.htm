The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in the Bible, suggesting the sufficiency of God's provision. The act of taking the loaves and fish is reminiscent of the earlier feeding of the five thousand, highlighting Jesus' compassion and ability to meet physical needs. This miracle occurs in a predominantly Gentile region, indicating the extension of God's blessings beyond Israel.<p><b>He gave thanks</b><br>Giving thanks before a meal was a common Jewish practice, reflecting gratitude to God as the ultimate source of provision. This act of thanksgiving by Jesus underscores the importance of acknowledging God's role in providing for our needs. It also sets an example for believers to cultivate a heart of gratitude. The act of giving thanks before the miracle emphasizes faith and trust in God's provision.<p><b>and broke them</b><br>Breaking the bread is a significant action that foreshadows the Last Supper, where Jesus breaks bread as a symbol of His body given for humanity. This act of breaking also signifies the distribution and sharing of resources, emphasizing the abundance that comes from God's hand. It reflects the idea that in God's kingdom, resources are multiplied and shared among all.<p><b>Then He gave them to the disciples</b><br>Jesus involving the disciples in the distribution process highlights the role of His followers in ministry. It demonstrates the principle of stewardship and partnership in God's work. The disciples act as intermediaries, receiving from Jesus and passing on to others, which is a model for Christian service and evangelism. This also teaches reliance on Jesus for provision and guidance in ministry.<p><b>and the disciples gave them to the people</b><br>The disciples distributing the food to the people illustrates the communal aspect of the miracle. It shows the importance of serving others and meeting their needs. This act of distribution is a practical demonstration of love and care, reflecting the heart of Jesus' ministry. It also signifies the spreading of the Gospel, as the disciples are tasked with sharing the message and blessings of Christ with the world.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, performing the miracle of feeding the multitude.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who distribute the food to the people.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_multitude.htm">The Multitude</a></b><br>A large crowd of people who have been following Jesus and are in need of food.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/seven_loaves_and_fish.htm">Seven Loaves and Fish</a></b><br>The small amount of food that Jesus uses to feed the multitude, symbolizing God's provision.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_miracle_of_feeding.htm">The Miracle of Feeding</a></b><br>An event where Jesus miraculously multiplies the loaves and fish to feed thousands.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/gratitude_before_provision.htm">Gratitude Before Provision</a></b><br>Jesus gives thanks before the miracle occurs, teaching us to express gratitude in anticipation of God's provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_abundant_provision.htm">God's Abundant Provision</a></b><br>The multiplication of loaves and fish demonstrates God's ability to provide abundantly beyond our limited resources.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_discipleship.htm">Role of Discipleship</a></b><br>The disciples are active participants in the miracle, showing that God often works through His people to accomplish His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The act of distributing the food required faith from the disciples, reminding us to trust in God's provision even when resources seem insufficient.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_nourishment.htm">Spiritual Nourishment</a></b><br>This miracle points to the deeper truth of Jesus as the spiritual sustenance for our lives, encouraging us to seek Him for our spiritual needs.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_15_36_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 15:36?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_15_36_Jesus_dual_provision.htm">How does Matthew 15:36 demonstrate Jesus' provision for physical and spiritual needs?

Jesus remains the Source; disciples are the channels; the people experience the fullness of His compassionate provision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 36.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He took.</span> The account differs little from that on the former occasion. <span class="cmt_word">Gave thanks</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>). This represents the blessing of the viands. Thanksgiving was a specially enjoined accompaniment of meals. The Talmud said, "He that enjoys anything without an act of thanksgiving is as one that robs the Almighty." The blessing here was the efficient cause of the multiplication of the food. Without any fresh creation Jesus used the materials ready to his hands, and only increased them by his Almighty power. <span class="cmt_word">Brake</span> them, and <span class="cmt_word">gave</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). Looking to the tenses used, we should say that Jesus brake the viands once, and then kept continually giving of them to the twelve for the purpose of distribution. We do not read how the multitude was arranged in the present case. Possibly the locality did not admit of methodical division into ranks and companies, or, on the other hand, its natural terraces may have obviated the necessity for any such formal arrangement, the company falling naturally into convenient sections. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/15-36.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Taking</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#955;&#945;&#946;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(elaben)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2983.htm">Strong's 2983: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I receive, get, (b) I take, lay hold of. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(tous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
