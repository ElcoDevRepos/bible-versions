It is a common introduction in Jesus' teachings, underscoring His authority and the truthfulness of His words. This phrase is often used to introduce significant teachings or prophecies, as seen in other parts of the Gospels.<p><b>wherever this gospel is preached in all the world</b><br>Jesus is referring to the global spread of the Gospel, indicating the universal nature of His message. This anticipates the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) where Jesus commands His disciples to make disciples of all nations. The phrase "in all the world" highlights the inclusivity of the Gospel, transcending cultural and geographical boundaries, and foreshadows the missionary work of the early church as recorded in the Book of Acts.<p><b>what she has done</b><br>This refers to the act of the woman who anointed Jesus with expensive perfume, an act of devotion and worship. In the context of <a href="/matthew/26.htm">Matthew 26</a>, this woman is identified as Mary of Bethany in <a href="/john/12-3.htm">John 12:3</a>. Her action is a demonstration of sacrificial love and recognition of Jesus' impending death and burial. It contrasts with the betrayal of Judas, highlighting the theme of true discipleship versus false allegiance.<p><b>will also be told in memory of her</b><br>Jesus promises that the woman's act of devotion will be remembered wherever the Gospel is preached. This statement underscores the value Jesus places on acts of genuine love and worship. It serves as an encouragement to believers that their acts of faithfulness, though seemingly small, have eternal significance.

"Who then proclaimed if, and caused it to be spread abroad? It was the power of him who is speaking these words. And while of countless kings and generals the noble exploits, even of those whose memorials remain, have sunk into silence; and having overthrown cities, and encompassed them with walls, and set up trophies, and enslaved many nations, they are not known so much as by hearsay, nor by name, though they have both set up statues, and established laws; yet that a woman who was a harlot poured out oil in the house of some leper, in the presence of ten men, - this all men celebrate throughout the world; and so great a time has passed, and yet the memory of that which was done hath not faded away, but alike Persians and Indians, Scythians and Thracians, and Sarmatians, and the race or the Moors, and they that inhabit the British Islands, spread abroad that which was done secretly in a house by a woman" ('Ham. 80. in Matthew'). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/26-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Truly</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#956;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(am&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Hebrew Word <br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_281.htm">Strong's 281: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; properly, firm, i.e. trustworthy; adverbially, surely.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I tell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
