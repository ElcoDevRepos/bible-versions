In the context of this parable, the master represents God, who is moved by the plight of the servant. Compassion is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/103-13.htm">Psalm 103:13</a>, where God is described as a compassionate father. This compassion is not merely an emotional response but leads to action, as seen in the subsequent forgiveness of the debt. The cultural context of the time emphasized a hierarchical relationship between masters and servants, making the master's compassion even more striking and countercultural.<p><b>forgave his debt</b><br>Forgiveness of debt in the ancient world was a significant act, often involving a legal or formal declaration. In Jewish law, the Year of Jubilee (Leviticus 25) was a time when debts were forgiven, reflecting God's desire for restoration and freedom. Theologically, this phrase points to the forgiveness of sins, a central tenet of Christian faith, where God forgives the insurmountable debt of sin through Jesus Christ. This act of forgiveness is a type of the ultimate forgiveness offered through Christ's sacrifice, as seen in <a href="/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13-14</a>, where the record of debt is canceled.<p><b>and released him</b><br>The release of the servant signifies liberation and freedom, echoing the biblical theme of redemption. In the historical context, a debtor could be imprisoned or enslaved until the debt was paid, so release was a profound act of grace. This release parallels the spiritual freedom believers receive through Christ, as described in <a href="/galatians/5.htm">Galatians 5:1</a>, where Paul speaks of freedom from the yoke of slavery. The release also prefigures the eschatological hope of ultimate liberation from sin and death, as promised in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>, where God will wipe away every tear and free humanity from the consequences of sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>Represents God in the parable, demonstrating divine mercy and forgiveness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Symbolizes humanity, burdened by an unpayable debt of sin.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_debt.htm">The Debt</a></b><br>Represents the weight and consequence of sin that humanity cannot repay on its own.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/forgiveness.htm">Forgiveness</a></b><br>The act of the master releasing the servant from his debt, illustrating God's grace.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/c/compassion.htm">Compassion</a></b><br>The emotional response of the master, highlighting the depth of God's love and mercy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_divine_compassion.htm">Understanding Divine Compassion</a></b><br>Recognize that God's compassion is the foundation of His forgiveness.

It touches the heart of the "lord of that servant," and is met with more than it asked for--not with patience and long-suffering only, but with the pity that forgives freely. The sinner is absolved, and the vast debt which he could never pay is forgiven freely. So far as he believes his Lord's assurance, he is now "justified by faith."<p><span class= "bld">Forgave him the debt.</span>--The Greek noun in this case expresses a debt contracted through a loan, and in the interpretation of the parable suggests a thought like that in the parables of the Pounds, the Talents, and the Unjust Steward.

But (to revert to the spiritual interpretation) the pardoned sinner must not forget the past; he must live as one forgiven.
