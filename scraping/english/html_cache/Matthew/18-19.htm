The repetition of "again" suggests that Jesus is reinforcing a principle He has taught before, highlighting its significance. The use of "truly" (or "verily" in other translations) is a common method Jesus uses to underscore the truth and reliability of His words, akin to an oath or solemn declaration.<p><b>that if two of you on the earth</b><br>The mention of "two" underscores the importance of community and agreement in prayer. In Jewish tradition, the testimony of two witnesses was required to establish a matter (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-15.htm">Deuteronomy 19:15</a>). This principle is applied here to the spiritual realm, indicating the power of collective faith and unity. The phrase "on the earth" contrasts with "in heaven," emphasizing the connection between earthly actions and heavenly responses.<p><b>agree about anything you ask for</b><br>The concept of agreement in prayer suggests a harmonious and unified request, reflecting the unity of believers. This agreement is not merely a verbal consensus but a spiritual alignment with God's will. The scope of "anything" indicates the vast potential of prayer, though it is understood within the context of God's will and purpose (1 <a href="/john/5-14.htm">John 5:14-15</a>).<p><b>it will be done for you</b><br>This promise highlights the efficacy of prayer when offered in unity and faith. The assurance "it will be done" reflects the power and willingness of God to respond to the prayers of His people. This aligns with other scriptural promises about answered prayer (<a href="/john/14-13.htm">John 14:13-14</a>, <a href="/james/5-16.htm">James 5:16</a>).<p><b>by My Father in heaven</b><br>The phrase "My Father" emphasizes the intimate relationship between Jesus and God, inviting believers into that relationship. The location "in heaven" signifies God's sovereignty and authority over all creation. This assurance of divine intervention from heaven underscores the connection between the believer's earthly petitions and God's heavenly power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, providing instruction to His disciples about the power of agreement in prayer.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing believers who are called to live in unity and prayer.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/heaven.htm">Heaven</a></b><br>The dwelling place of God the Father, from where divine intervention and answers to prayer are promised.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/earth.htm">Earth</a></b><br>The realm where believers live and where the agreement in prayer is to take place.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>The one who answers prayers made in agreement, emphasizing His role in the divine response to unity in prayer.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_agreement.htm">The Power of Agreement</a></b><br>Unity in prayer is emphasized as a powerful tool for believers.
