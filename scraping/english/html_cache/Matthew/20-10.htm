This phrase sets the stage for the expectation of reward based on tenure and effort. In the cultural context of first-century Palestine, laborers would gather in the marketplace to be hired for the day, and those hired first would naturally expect greater compensation for their longer hours.<p><b>they assumed they would receive more</b><br>This assumption reflects a human tendency to equate time and effort with greater reward. It highlights the theme of human expectations versus divine grace. Biblically, this can be connected to the idea that God's ways are not our ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). The workers' assumption also mirrors the attitude of the Pharisees and religious leaders who believed their adherence to the law entitled them to greater favor from God.<p><b>But each of them also received a denarius</b><br>A denarius was a common day's wage for a laborer at the time, indicating fairness and sufficiency in the eyes of the landowner. This phrase underscores the parable's message about the kingdom of heaven, where God's grace is given equally, regardless of human calculations of worthiness. The equal payment symbolizes the equal gift of salvation offered to all believers, whether they come early or late to faith. This can be seen as a type of Christ's teaching on grace, where the last will be first, and the first will be last (<a href="/matthew/20-16.htm">Matthew 20:16</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/landowner.htm">Landowner</a></b><br>Represents God, who is sovereign and just in His dealings with humanity.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/laborers.htm">Laborers</a></b><br>Symbolize believers or followers of Christ, each called to work in God's vineyard (the world).<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/vineyard.htm">Vineyard</a></b><br>Represents the Kingdom of Heaven, where God's work is carried out.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/denarius.htm">Denarius</a></b><br>A day's wage, symbolizing the reward of eternal life or God's grace.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hired_first.htm">Hired First</a></b><br>Those who have been serving God for a long time, possibly representing the Jewish people or long-time believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_and_grace.htm">God's Sovereignty and Grace</a></b><br>God's ways are not our ways; His grace is given according to His will, not human merit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/equality_in_the_kingdom.htm">Equality in the Kingdom</a></b><br>The reward of eternal life is the same for all believers, regardless of when they come to faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/guard_against_envy.htm">Guard Against Envy</a></b><br>Believers should rejoice in the salvation of others and avoid comparing their spiritual journey with others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_justice.htm">Trust in God's Justice</a></b><br>Trust that God is just and fair, even when His actions do not align with human expectations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/focus_on_faithfulness.htm">Focus on Faithfulness</a></b><br>Our focus should be on being faithful in the work God has given us, rather than on the rewards.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_20_10_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 20:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_20_10_Fairness_in_God_s_kingdom.htm">How does Matthew 20:10 challenge our understanding of fairness in God's kingdom?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_20_10_on_God_s_grace_to_all.htm">What does Matthew 20:10 teach about God's generosity and grace towards all believers?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Matthew_20_10_daily.htm">How can we apply the lesson of Matthew 20:10 in our daily lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Which_scriptures_show_God_s_equal_treatment.htm">What other scriptures emphasize God's equal treatment of His followers?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Matthew_20_10_on_envy.htm">How should Matthew 20:10 influence our attitude towards others' blessings?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_expect_more_in_Matthew_20_10.htm">Why did the early workers expect more in Matthew 20:10?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_20_10_Fairness_questioned.htm">How does Matthew 20:10 challenge our understanding of fairness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Matthew_20_10_show_God_s_grace.htm">What does Matthew 20:10 reveal about God's grace?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_20.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 20?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'first_will_be_last'_mean.htm">What did Jesus mean by 'first will be last'?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_equal_pay_for_latecomers_in_matthew_20.htm">Matthew 20:1-16 - If God is perfectly just, why would He reward latecomers the same as those who worked all day?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/how_many_blind_men_healed_near_jericho.htm">How many blind men did Jesus heal near Jericho?

Now the first-hired men step forward. Literally, they are &#8220;the original workers&#8221;&#8212;those who started at daybreak.<p>&#8226; Their arrival reminds us that God truly does call some to serve Him for a lifetime (compare Samuel in <a href="/1_samuel/3-1.htm">1 Samuel 3:1-10</a>, or Timothy in <a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>).<p>&#8226; The narrative assures us that God sees and remembers faithful service (<a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Yet this moment also sets up a heart check: what will these early workers value more&#8212;relationship with the Master or the size of the paycheck?<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they assumed they would receive more</b><p>Expectation slips in. Because the last group received a denarius for one hour, simple math says twelve hours ought to equal twelve denarii. So they &#8220;assumed&#8221; a greater reward.<p>&#8226; The text exposes the fallen tendency to compare (<a href="/galatians/6-4.htm">Galatians 6:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Envy can appear even among obedient servants; see the older brother&#8217;s reaction in <a href="/luke/15-25.htm">Luke 15:25-30</a>.<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s dealings with others often test whether we serve Him for who He is or for what we hope to gain (<a href="/job/1-9.htm">Job 1:9-11</a>).<p>&#8226; The assumption also reveals a works-based mindset. By contrast, salvation and every good gift are rooted in grace, &#8220;not by works, so that no one can boast&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But each of them also received a denarius</b><p>The Master keeps His original agreement (<a href="/matthew/20-2.htm">Matthew 20:2</a>). He is perfectly just while remaining startlingly generous.<p>&#8226; God never shortchanges His people; He simply retains the right to bless as He chooses (<a href="/romans/9-14.htm">Romans 9:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; The equal payment pictures the common salvation shared by all believers, whether they come early or late in life (<a href="/titus/3-4.htm">Titus 3:4-7</a>).<p>&#8226; It underscores that eternal life is of equal worth for every disciple; no one gets a &#8220;second-class&#8221; inheritance (<a href="/john/14-2.htm">John 14:2-3</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The moment foreshadows the warning in <a href="/matthew/20-16.htm">Matthew 20:16</a>: &#8220;So the last will be first, and the first last.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/20-10.htm">Matthew 20:10</a> confronts the measuring spirit that creeps into devoted hearts. The first workers arrive confident, calculating, and disappointed, even though the Master gives them exactly what He promised. The verse teaches that God&#8217;s justice is flawless and His generosity boundless. We are called to rejoice in His grace toward others and trust that in Christ every servant receives the full &#8220;denarius&#8221; of eternal life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more.</span>--Up to this time we may think of the disciples as having listened with an eager interest, yet only half-perceiving, if at all, the drift of the parable, looking, it may be, for some payment to the first-called labourers proportionate to the duration of their service. Now, unless they were altogether blind, they must have seen their own thoughts reflected in the parable. They too, as their question showed, had been expecting to receive more. Eternal life was not enough for them, without some special prerogative and precedence over others. The fact that the first labourers <span class= "ital">were</span> paid their wages gives a touch of gentleness to what would otherwise have seemed the severity of the parable. The presence of a self-righteous, self-seeking spirit mars the full blessedness of content; but if the work has been done, it does not deprive men altogether of their reward. The labourers who murmured are, in this respect, in the same position as the elder son in the parable of the Prodigal, who was told, in answer to his complaints, that all that his father had was his (<a href="/luke/15-31.htm" title="And he said to him, Son, you are ever with me, and all that I have is yours.">Luke 15:31</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They supposed that they should have received more.</span> The text varies between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (<span class="accented">plus</span>, Vulgate) and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, the former implying "a greater sum" than the stated hire, the latter hinting indefinitely at "more" things, more in number.
