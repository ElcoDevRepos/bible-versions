In this context, Jesus placing His hands on the children signifies a blessing. This act reflects the Jewish tradition where blessings were imparted through touch, as seen in <a href="/genesis/48-14.htm">Genesis 48:14</a> when Jacob blessed Ephraim and Manasseh. Jesus' actions here emphasize the value and importance of children in the Kingdom of God, countering cultural norms that often marginalized them. This gesture also prefigures the spiritual blessings believers receive through Christ.<p><b>He went on from there</b><br>This phrase indicates a transition in Jesus' ministry, as He continues His journey towards Jerusalem. The movement from one place to another is a recurring theme in the Gospels, highlighting the itinerant nature of Jesus' ministry. Each location He visits serves a purpose in His mission to teach, heal, and ultimately fulfill His redemptive work. This journey motif is significant as it leads to the culmination of His earthly ministry in Jerusalem, where He will face crucifixion and resurrection. The phrase also suggests the urgency and purposefulness of Jesus' mission, as He moves from one opportunity to minister to the next.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who blesses the children.

The words and the act have rightly been regarded, as in the Baptismal Office of the Church of England, as the true warrant for infant baptism. More than doubtful passages in the Acts and Epistles; more than the authority, real or supposed, of primitive antiquity; more than the legal fiction that they fulfil the condition of baptism by their sponsors--they justify the Church of Christ at large in commending infants, as such, to the blessing of their Father. The blessing and the prayer of Christ cannot be regarded as a mere sympathising compliance with the fond wishes of the parents, and if infants were capable of spiritual blessings then, why, it may well be asked, should they be thought incapable now?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He laid his hands on them.</span> He was not influenced by the captious objections of the disciples. St. Mark tells us that "he took them up in his arms, put his bands upon them, and blessed them." Thus far he complied with the wishes of the parents who brought the babes to him. But we do not read that he prayed, as they had asked. Doubtless there was meaning in this omission. In conferring blessing he was acting in his Divine nature, and had no need of prayer. Sometimes, indeed, he prayed for the sake of bystanders (see <a href="/john/11-42.htm">John 11:42</a>; <a href="/john/12-30.htm">John 12:30</a>); here he prays not, that he may teach a lesson of his Divinity. <span class="cmt_word">Departed thence.</span> Set out from Peraea, journeying towards Jerusalem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/19-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">after He had placed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(epitheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2007.htm">Strong's 2007: </a> </span><span class="str2">To put, place upon, lay on; I add, give in addition.
