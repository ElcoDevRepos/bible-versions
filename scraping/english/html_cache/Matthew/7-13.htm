In biblical context, gates were often used as metaphors for entry points to cities or places of significance. The narrow gate suggests a path that requires intentionality and effort, reflecting the call to live a life of righteousness and obedience to God's commandments. This aligns with Jesus' teachings on the cost of discipleship (<a href="/luke/14-25.htm">Luke 14:25-33</a>) and the need for repentance and faith (<a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>). The narrow gate can also be seen as a type of Christ, who declared Himself to be the "door" (<a href="/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9</a>) through which one must enter to find salvation.<p><b>For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction,</b><br>The wide gate and broad way symbolize the easy, popular path that many choose, which ultimately leads to spiritual ruin. This reflects the cultural and historical context of Jesus' time, where many followed religious practices without true devotion or understanding. The broad way is characterized by moral laxity and conformity to worldly values, contrasting with the narrow path of true discipleship. This imagery is consistent with Old Testament warnings against following the crowd in doing evil (<a href="/exodus/23-2.htm">Exodus 23:2</a>) and the call to choose life over death (<a href="/deuteronomy/30-19.htm">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>).<p><b>and many enter through it.</b><br>This phrase highlights the reality that many people choose the path of least resistance, which is spiritually perilous. It serves as a warning about the prevalence of false teachings and the temptation to follow the majority rather than adhering to the truth of the Gospel. This is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3-4</a>, where Paul warns of a time when people will not endure sound doctrine. The emphasis on "many" underscores the importance of discernment and the need to remain steadfast in faith, even when it is countercultural or challenging.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, which is a collection of teachings and sayings of Jesus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_narrow_gate.htm">The Narrow Gate</a></b><br>Symbolizes the path of righteousness and obedience to God's will, which leads to eternal life.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wide_gate.htm">The Wide Gate</a></b><br>Represents the path of sin and disobedience, leading to destruction and separation from God.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_way.htm">The Way</a></b><br>Refers to the journey or lifestyle one chooses, either towards life or destruction.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sermon_on_the_mount.htm">The Sermon on the Mount</a></b><br>The context in which this teaching is given, encompassing Matthew chapters 5-7, where Jesus outlines the principles of the Kingdom of Heaven.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_discernment.htm">The Call to Discernment</a></b><br>Jesus calls us to discern between the two paths.

Scripture leaves no middle option: salvation is exclusive, urgent, and available only through Jesus. Choose the narrow gate while it stands open.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">Enter ye in at the strait gate.</span>--The figure was possibly suggested by some town actually in sight. Safed, the "city set on a hill," or some other, with the narrow pathway leading to the yet narrower gate, the "needle's eye" of the city, through which the traveller entered. Such, at any rate, was the picture which the words presented. A like image had been used before, with a singular coincidence of language, in the allegory known as the <span class= "ital">Tablet</span> of Cebes, the Disciple of Socrates: "Seest thou not a certain small door, and a pathway before the door, in no way crowded, but few, very few, go in thereat? This is the way that leadeth to true discipline" (c. 16). The meaning of the parable here lies on the surface. The way and the gate are alike the way of obedience and holiness, and the gate is to be reached not without pain and effort; but only through it can we enter into the city of God, the heavenly Jerusalem. A deeper significance is, however, suggested even by our Lord's own teaching. He Himself is the "way" (<a href="/john/14-6.htm" title="Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.">John 14:6</a>), or with a slight variation of the imagery, He is the "door," or gate, by which His sheep enter into the fold (<a href="/john/10-7.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them again, Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.">John 10:7</a>). Only we must remember that His being thus the "way" and the "gate" does not mean that we can find, in union with Him, a substitute for holiness, but indicates simply how we are to attain to it.<p><span class= "bld">That leadeth to destruction.</span>--The question, which has been much discussed lately, whether this word "destruction" means the extinction of conscious life--what is popularly called annihilation--or prolonged existence in endless suffering, is one which can hardly be settled by mere reference to lexicons. So far as they go, the word implies, not annihilation, but waste (<a href="/matthew/26-8.htm" title="But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?">Matthew 26:8</a>; <a href="/mark/14-4.htm" title="And there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?">Mark 14:4</a>), perdition, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the loss of all that makes existence precious. I question whether a single passage can be adduced in which it means, in relation to material things, more than the breaking up of their outward form and beauty, or in spiritual things, more than what may be described as the wretchedness of a wasted life. The use of the cognate verb confirms this meaning. Men "perish" when they are put to death (<a href="/matthew/22-7.htm" title="But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.">Matthew 22:7</a>; <a href="/acts/5-37.htm" title="After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.">Acts 5:37</a>; <span class= "ital">et al.</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> Caiaphas gave his counsel that one man should die for the people, that the whole nation <span class= "ital">perish</span> not (<a href="/john/11-50.htm" title="Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.">John 11:50</a>). The demons ask whether the Christ has come to <span class= "ital">destroy</span> them (<a href="/mark/1-24.htm" title="Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, you Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God.">Mark 1:24</a>). The sheep are <span class= "ital">lost</span> when they are wandering in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/15-24.htm" title="But he answered and said, I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.">Matthew 15:24</a>; <a href="/luke/15-6.htm" title="And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.">Luke 15:6</a>). The immediate context leads to the same conclusion. "Life" is more than mere existence. "Destruction," by parity of reasoning, should be more than mere non-existence. On the other hand, the fact of the waste, the loss, the perdition, does not absolutely exclude the possibility of deliverance. The <span class= "ital">lost</span> sheep was found; the exiled son, <span class= "ital">perishing</span> with hunger, was brought back to his father's house. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-27.</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> <span class="accented">Epilogue</span> (cf. <a href="/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>, note).

Observe: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> In Luke, "strive (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>) to enter in"; here, "enter at once." <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> In Luke, "through the narrow door" into, apparently, the final abiding-place; here, "through the narrow gate" into apparently the (perhaps long) road which takes us at last to full salvation. Thus in Luke our Lord speaks of continued striving; here, of immediate decision, in which, however, lies the assurance of ultimate success (cf. ver. 14, end; also <a href="/1_john/2-13.htm">1 John 2:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">At the strait gate</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">by the narrow gate</span> - <span class="accented">the</span> entrance resembling the road (ver. 14, note). Chrysostom (<span class="accented">in lot.</span>), contrasting present trials with future happiness, says, "straitened is the way and narrow is the gate, <span class="accented">but not the city."</span> <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>For wide is the gate, and Broad is the way</span>. So also the Revised Version, but the Revised Version margin has, "some ancient authorities omit <span class="accented">is the gate."</span> (For a full discussion on the difficult question of the genuineness of <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> here, <span class="accented">vide</span> Westcott and Hort, 'App.') Westcott and Hort omit it, with <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, Old Latin, and many Greek and Latin Fathers, and say that, though <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> is probably genuine in ver. 14, "till the latter part of the fourth century the first <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;</span> has no Greek or Latin patristic evidence in its favour, much against it." They think this is "one of those rare readings in which the true text has been preserved by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> without extant uncial support... . It was natural to scribes to set ver. 13 in precisely antithetic contrast to ver. 14; but the sense gains in force if there is no mention of two gates, and if the contrast in ver. 13 is between the narrow gate and the broad and spacious way." There must be a definite entering upon the right way; no entrance upon the wrong way is necessary, men find themselves upon it only too easily, and it is "made level with stones" (Ecclus. 21:10). <span class="cmt_word">Wide... broad</span>. The second epithet (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) lays stress on there being plenty of space to walk in (Latt., <span class="accented">spatiosa</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>That</span> <span class="cmt_word">leadeth to destruction</span> (<span class="greek_word">ei) th\n a)pw/leian</span>); that "perishing" in which "the sons of perishing" perish (<a href="/john/17-12.htm">John 17:12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And many there be which</span>; Revised Version, more exactly, <span class="accented">and many be they that</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). Our Lord says that they that are perishing are many (cf. ver. 14, note). <span class="cmt_word">Go in</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">enter in</span>; keeping up the allusion to "enter ye in." Observe, however, that if <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7b;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;</span> (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>) is false, the thought here is of entrance into the final issue of the way - <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Thereat</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">thereby</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> by the way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/7-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Enter</span><br /><span class="grk">&#917;&#7984;&#963;&#941;&#955;&#952;&#945;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(Eiselthate)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Imperative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1525.htm">Strong's 1525: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go in, come in, enter.
