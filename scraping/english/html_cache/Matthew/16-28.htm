This indicates that the prophecy is immediate and relevant to those present at that moment.

It implies that the event Jesus is referring to will happen soon enough that some of His audience will still be alive to witness it.

Some see it as referring to the Transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-8</a>), which occurs shortly after this statement and reveals Jesus' divine glory to Peter, James, and John. Others interpret it as the resurrection and ascension of Jesus, the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, or the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70, which demonstrated Jesus' prophetic authority and the establishment of His spiritual kingdom.

Six days later the Transfiguration delivered exactly that, validating His words and providing a down payment on the full, visible reign still to come. His promise proved true then, and it secures our confidence that every remaining promise will likewise be fulfilled.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--The immediate sequence of the vision of the Son of Man transfigured from the low estate in which He then lived and moved, into the "excellent glory" which met the gaze of the three disciples, has led not a few interpreters to see in that vision the fulfilment of this prediction. A closer scrutiny of the words must, however, lead us to set aside that interpretation, except so far as the Transfiguration bore witness to what had till then been the latent possibilities of His greatness. To speak of something that was to take place within six days as to occur before <span class= "ital">some</span> of those who heard the words should taste of death (comp. <a href="/john/8-52.htm" title="Then said the Jews to him, Now we know that you have a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and you say, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.">John 8:52</a>, <a href="/hebrews/2-9.htm" title="But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.">Hebrews 2:9</a>, for the form of the expression) would hardly have been natural; nor does the vision, as such, satisfy the meaning of the words "coming in His kingdom." The solution of the problem is to be found in the great prophecy of Matthew 24. In a sense which was real, though partial, the judgment which fell upon the Jewish Church, the destruction of the Holy City and the Temple, the onward march of the Church of Christ, was as the coming of the Son of Man in His kingdom. His people felt that He was not far off from every one of them. He had come to them in "spirit and in power," and that advent was at once the earnest and the foreshadowing of the "great far-off event," the day and hour of which were hidden from the angels of God, and even from the Son of Man Himself (<a href="/mark/13-32.htm" title="But of that day and that hour knows no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.">Mark 13:32</a>). The words find their parallel in those that declared that "This generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled" (<a href="/matthew/24-34.htm" title="Truly I say to you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.">Matthew 24:34</a>). That such words should have been recorded and published by the Evangelists is a proof either that they accepted that interpretation, if <span class= "ital">they</span> wrote after the destruction of Jerusalem, or, if we assume that they were led by them to look for the "end of all things" as near at hand, that they wrote before the generation of those who then stood by had passed away; and so the very difficulty that has perplexed men becomes a proof of the early date of the three Gospels that contain the record.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - This verse has always been a <span class="accented">crux</span> to commentators, who cannot decide what is the event to which it refers. Many, taking it in connection with the preceding announcement, refer it exclusively to the day of judgment; but this idea is not compatible with Christ's assertion that some present shall see it ere they die. Nor can it refer to Christ's resurrection and ascension, and the mission of the Holy Ghost, which took place only half a year after this time, and the prediction of which so short a time before could not have been introduced in the terms here used. Other expositors, and some of great name, agree that the event to which Christ alludes is his transfiguration narrated in the next chapter. But there are insuperable objections to this view. How could Christ assert in the most solemn manner, <span class="cmt_word">Verily, I say unto</span> <span class="cmt_word">you</span>, that some of his hearers would tire to witness an event which was to occur only a week hence? Nor is it likely that he would thus publicly announce a transaction which was strictly private, seen only by three chosen witnesses, who were further charged not to reveal the vision till the Son of man was risen from the dead. The Lord had been telling of the final judgment; he now announces, with the formula used by him to present some revelation of Divine truth, that there was to be a coming of the Son of man at no very distant date. This advent is doubtless the destruction of Jerusalem, which, as it occurred only some forty years after this time, some of his auditors, apostles and the multitude, would live to behold. This great event was a type of the second advent, the two being closely connected by Christ himself (see ch. 24.). There is some truth in all the views that have obtained concerning this passage: "The prophecy unfolded itself by degrees; it has put forth buds and blossoms, but it will not be in its full bloom of accomplishment till the great day" (Wordsworth). There was some display of Christ's kingdom at the Transfiguration; another at his resurrection, and the events consequent thereupon; but the great one was when the overthrow of Jerusalem and its temple made way for the full establishment and development of the gospel, putting an end to the first dispensation. <span class="cmt_word">Some standing</span> (<span class="accented">of them that stand</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>here</span>. Among the apostles St. John certainly survived the destruction of Jerusalem. There seems to be no recondite meaning in the term "standing," as if it signified "remaining steadfastly by me, adhering to my side;" as, <span class="cmt_word">taste of death</span> is merely a periphrasis for "die," and has not the sense of tasting the bitterness of death, experiencing its sting. It appears to have been originally a metaphor derived from a nauseous draught, which every one must drain. <span class="cmt_word">Coming in his kingdom.</span> Not "into his kingdom," but in the power and glory that appertain to his kingdom. Not that he will personally appear, but his mystical presence will be seen by its effects, the judgment on the Jewish nation, the establishment of a spiritual, yet visible kingdom in the place of the old covenant.
