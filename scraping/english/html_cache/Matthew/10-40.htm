In the context of <a href="/matthew/10.htm">Matthew 10</a>, Jesus is sending out the twelve apostles to preach the Gospel. The act of receiving the apostles is equated with receiving Jesus Himself, highlighting the authority and representation the apostles carry. This reflects the Jewish concept of shaliach, where a sent one is as the sender. Theologically, it underscores the unity between Christ and His followers, as seen in <a href="/john/13-20.htm">John 13:20</a>, where Jesus reiterates this principle. The apostles, as Christ's representatives, are to be treated with the same respect and honor as Christ.<p><b>and he who receives Me receives the One who sent Me</b><br>This phrase extends the chain of representation to God the Father, who sent Jesus. It emphasizes the divine mission of Jesus and His unity with the Father, a central theme in the Gospel of John (<a href="/john/5-23.htm">John 5:23</a>, <a href="/john/12-44.htm">John 12:44-45</a>). This reflects the Jewish understanding of agency, where the agent is as the principal. Theologically, it affirms the doctrine of the Trinity, where the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct yet one. This also connects to the prophetic tradition, where prophets were sent by God and to receive them was to receive God's message. The phrase underscores the importance of recognizing and accepting the divine authority and mission of Jesus as the Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing His disciples, emphasizing the connection between them, Himself, and God the Father.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' message, they are being sent out to preach the Gospel and are representatives of Christ.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/god_the_father.htm">God the Father</a></b><br>Referred to as "the One who sent Me," highlighting the divine mission and authority of Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_recipients.htm">The Recipients</a></b><br>Those who receive the disciples, representing the broader audience who accept the message of the Gospel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sending_out_of_the_twelve.htm">The Sending Out of the Twelve</a></b><br>The context of this verse is Jesus sending out the twelve apostles to minister and spread His teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/representation_of_christ.htm">Representation of Christ</a></b><br>As believers, we are called to represent Christ in our daily lives.

See how Lydia &#8220;opened her home&#8221; to Paul and his team (<a href="/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14-15</a>), and how Gaius was commended for receiving traveling teachers (3 <a href="/bsb/john/5.htm">John 5-8</a>).<p>&#8226; By tying blessing to how people treat His messengers, Christ underscores the dignity of faithful witness. Compare <a href="/matthew/25-40.htm">Matthew 25:40</a>: &#8220;Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these My brothers, you did for Me.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>receives Me</b><p>&#8226; Welcoming Christ&#8217;s representatives equals welcoming Christ Himself. <a href="/luke/10-16.htm">Luke 10:16</a> echoes the thought: &#8220;Whoever listens to you listens to Me; whoever rejects you rejects Me.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This is not mere symbolism; Jesus identifies personally with His servants. Saul learned this when the risen Lord asked, &#8220;Why do you persecute Me?&#8221; even though Saul had been chasing Christians (<a href="/acts/9-4.htm">Acts 9:4-5</a>).<p>&#8226; Our response to gospel messengers reveals our response to the Messiah. <a href="/john/13-20.htm">John 13:20</a>: &#8220;Truly, truly, I tell you, whoever receives the one I send receives Me.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and he who receives Me</b><p>&#8226; Receiving Christ involves faith, love, obedience, and surrender (<a href="/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>; 14:23).<p>&#8226; The verse shifts from human messengers to the divine Messenger, showing a chain of relational unity. <a href="/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1-2</a> reminds us that Jesus Himself is &#8220;the Apostle and High Priest&#8221; whom the Father sent.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>receives the One who sent Me</b><p>&#8226; Jesus never stands alone; He is eternally one with the Father (<a href="/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>).

As Christ was sent by the Father (<a href="/john/20-21.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be to you: as my Father has sent me, even so send I you.">John 20:21</a>; comp. <a href="/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a>), so were they His apostles and representatives; and He would count all honour and affection shown to them as shown also to Himself, and through Him to His Father.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 40-42.</span> <span class="accented">- Final encouragement.</span> The evangelist takes the main idea of these verses from our Lord's words to the seventy (<a href="/luke/10-16.htm">Luke 10:16</a>), but moulds it in the form of his later saying, <a href="/matthew/18-5.htm">Matthew 18:5</a> (cf. especially the parallel passage, <a href="/luke/9-48.htm">Luke 9:48</a>, also <a href="/mark/9-37.htm">Mark 9:37</a>). He further adds (ver. 42) other words also spoken later (<a href="/mark/9-41.htm">Mark 9:41</a>; cf. ver. 42 there with our <a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a>). In these verses the discourse returns to the immediate occasion, the mission of the disciples. Christ shows his personal interest in their work; his messengers' cause is his. He says, "I reckon treatment of you as treatment of me; ay, and he that sent me reckons it as treatment of himself" (ver. 40). This principle as to the treatment of representatives holds good throughout. Not every one can be a prophet, but those who help him shall share his reward. Not every one shall acquire the technical name of "righteous," but those who help such a man shall share his reward (ver. 4l); even the smallest kindnesses shall not be unrewarded (ver. 42). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that receiveth you receiveth me</span>. "A man's messenger is as himself" (Mishna, 'Berach.,' 5:5). Yet, as Bengel says, "Non <span class="accented">mode tantundem est</span>, <span class="accented">ac si me reciperet.</span> <span class="accented">sed severn me recipit."</span> Ford quotes from Tertullian ('De Orat.,' &sect; 26), "A brother that hath entered into thine house, dismiss not without prayer. 'Thou hast seen,' saith he, 'thy brother; thou hast seen thy Lord.'" The same <span class="accented">legion</span> is found twice in Clem. Alex. (cf. Resch, 'Agrapha,' p. 296).
