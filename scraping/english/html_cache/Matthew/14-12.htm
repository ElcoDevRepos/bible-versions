This phrase indicates their loyalty and devotion, as they took the initiative to care for his remains. In the cultural context of the time, disciples often took responsibility for their teacher's affairs, especially in death, reflecting a deep bond and respect.<p><b>and took his body</b><br>The act of taking John's body shows the disciples' courage and commitment, as approaching the body of someone executed by Herod could have been dangerous. This reflects the Jewish custom of burying the dead promptly, as seen in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>, which emphasizes the importance of burial on the same day.<p><b>and buried it.</b><br>Burial was a significant act of honor and respect in Jewish culture. The disciples' actions fulfilled the Jewish law and customs regarding the treatment of the dead. This also parallels the later burial of Jesus, where His followers ensured He was buried according to Jewish customs, as seen in <a href="/john/19-38.htm">John 19:38-42</a>.<p><b>And they went and informed Jesus.</b><br>The disciples' decision to inform Jesus highlights their recognition of His authority and their need for guidance in a time of grief. This act of informing Jesus also signifies the transition of focus from John the Baptist to Jesus, as John's role was to prepare the way for Christ, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a> and fulfilled in <a href="/matthew/3-3.htm">Matthew 3:3</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A prophet and forerunner of Jesus, known for his call to repentance and baptizing Jesus.
