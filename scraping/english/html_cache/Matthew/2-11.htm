This suggests that the family had moved from the manger to more permanent lodging in Bethlehem. The term "house" implies a dwelling place, which aligns with the cultural practice of the time for families to stay in Bethlehem for a period after the birth of a child.<p><b>they saw the Child with His mother Mary</b><br>The focus is on the Child, Jesus, with Mary mentioned as His mother, highlighting the fulfillment of the prophecy of the virgin birth (<a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>). Joseph is not mentioned here, possibly indicating his absence at the moment or emphasizing the centrality of Jesus and Mary in this narrative.<p><b>and they fell down and worshiped Him</b><br>The act of falling down and worshiping signifies profound reverence and recognition of Jesus' divine nature. The Magi, likely Gentiles, acknowledge Jesus as King, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/72-10.htm">Psalm 72:10-11</a>, which speaks of kings bringing gifts and bowing before Him. This act of worship indicates their understanding of His messianic role.<p><b>Then they opened their treasures</b><br>The opening of treasures signifies the presentation of valuable and significant gifts. In ancient times, such gifts were customary when visiting a person of high status or royalty. The treasures symbolize honor and recognition of Jesus' kingship and divine mission.<p><b>and presented Him with gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh</b><br>Gold, a symbol of kingship and wealth, acknowledges Jesus as King. Frankincense, used in priestly rituals, signifies His priestly role and divinity. Myrrh, often used for embalming, foreshadows His suffering and death. These gifts fulfill <a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm">Isaiah 60:6</a>, which speaks of nations bringing gold and incense to praise the Lord.

The words highlight God&#8217;s providence: He guided Gentile seekers (<a href="/matthew/2-1.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>&#8210;2) by a star straight to the true King. <a href="/joshua/24-2.htm">Joshua 24:2</a> reminds us that God has always drawn nations to Himself; here He uses a celestial sign to bring foreigners into a private dwelling where revelation will occur.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they saw the Child with His mother Mary</b><p>Notice the order: &#8220;the Child&#8221; first, then Mary. Scripture keeps the spotlight on Jesus, not on His mother. Cross references reinforce His primacy: <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> calls Him &#8220;Mighty God,&#8221; while <a href="/luke/2-11.htm">Luke 2:11</a> names Him &#8220;Savior&#8230;Christ the Lord.&#8221; Mary&#8217;s presence authenticates His true humanity and fulfills <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, but she is never the object of worship. The scene affirms both the incarnation (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>) and the family context in which God chose to send His Son (<a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they fell down and worshiped Him</b><p>The magi respond with prostration, an act reserved for deity (<a href="/psalms/95-6.htm">Psalm 95:6</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a> shows angels refusing such worship). Their worship recognizes Jesus&#8217; divine identity long before His public ministry. This anticipates every knee bowing (<a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a>) and shows that true wisdom results in adoration, not mere curiosity. Even as a small Child, Jesus receives honor that belongs solely to God, underscoring His messianic kingship foretold in <a href="/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Then they opened their treasures</b><p>Worship moves from posture to generosity. Opening treasure boxes symbolizes open hearts. <a href="/2_corinthians/9-7.htm">2 Corinthians 9:7</a> teaches that God loves cheerful givers; the magi model that by giving freely, not out of compulsion. Their costly gifts contrast Herod&#8217;s hoarded power (<a href="/matthew/2-3.htm">Matthew 2:3</a>) and align with <a href="/proverbs/3-9.htm">Proverbs 3:9</a> &#8212; &#8220;Honor the LORD with your wealth.&#8221; The narrative quietly challenges believers to align resources with worship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and presented Him with gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh</b><p>&#8226; Gold: emblem of royalty (<a href="/1_kings/10-2.htm">1 Kings 10:2</a> &#8212; Queen of Sheba&#8217;s gifts to Solomon). It declares Jesus &#8220;King of kings&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Frankincense: used in priestly incense (<a href="/exodus/30-34.htm">Exodus 30:34-38</a>). It points to Christ as our High Priest who intercedes (<a href="/hebrews/4-14.htm">Hebrews 4:14-16</a>).<p>&#8226; Myrrh: a spice for burial (<a href="/john/19-39.htm">John 19:39</a>). It foreshadows His sacrificial death (<a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5-9</a>).<p>Together the gifts proclaim His offices&#8212;King, Priest, Savior&#8212;mirroring the prophetic pattern in <a href="/zechariah/6-13.htm">Zechariah 6:13</a> where the &#8220;Branch&#8221; rules and mediates. The magi likely did not grasp every implication, yet God orchestrated their offerings to preach the gospel in miniature.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a> reveals that Jesus, though a young Child in an ordinary house, is already recognized by the nations as divine King, worthy of worship and sacrificial honor. The magi&#8217;s journey culminates in bowed knees, opened treasure, and prophetic gifts, displaying true faith in action. The verse invites every reader to approach Christ with the same humility, adoration, and generosity, acknowledging Him as King, Priest, and Redeemer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Opened their treasures.</span>--The word points to caskets, or chests, which they had brought with them.<p><span class= "bld">Gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.</span>--These were natural enough as the traditional gifts of homage to a ruler. Compare the gifts sent by Jacob to Joseph (<a href="/genesis/43-11.htm" title="And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:">Genesis 43:11</a>), and <a href="/psalms/45-8.htm" title="All your garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made you glad.">Psalm 45:8</a>, for the myrrh and spices; <a href="/psalms/72-15.htm" title="And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.">Psalm 72:15</a>, for the gold; <a href="/isaiah/60-6.htm" title="The multitude of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the LORD.">Isaiah 60:6</a>, for gold and incense. The patristic interpretation of the gifts as significant--the gold, of kingly power; the incense, of Divinity; the myrrh, of death and embalmment--interesting as it is, cannot be assumed to have been definitely present to the mind of the Evangelist. It is noticeable that there is here no mention of Joseph. Looking to his prominence in St. Matthew's narrative, we must assume that his absence on the night of their arrival was accidental.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they were come into the house</span>. For after the enrolment the caravanserai would not be so crowded (<a href="/luke/2-7.htm">Luke 2:7</a>). But whether it was now the caravanserai or a private house, we have no evidence to show. <span class="cmt_word">They saw</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, with the uncials and most of the versions). The translators in this case followed the text of the Complutensian (1514) and of Colinaeus' edition (1534), rejecting the false <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> of the Vulgate and the Received Text<span class="cmt_word">. The young Child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him</span> (ver. 2, note). In this latter clause Mary is not mentioned. <span class="cmt_word">And when they had opened</span>.

The verb used ( <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span>) seems to lay stress on the persons to whom and by whom the offering is made, the personal relation in which they stand to each other; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span> (cf. Bishop Westcott, on <a href="/hebrews/7-27.htm">Hebrews 7:27</a>) and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span> on the destination and use of the offering (<a href="/james/2-21.htm">James 2:21</a>; <a href="/romans/6-13.htm">Romans 6:13</a>). Observe the three stages in this verse - vision, submission, consecration. <span class="accented">Gifts</span>; without which one does not approach an Eastern monarch (cf. <a href="/1_kings/10-2.htm">1 Kings 10:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Gold, and frankincense, and myrrh</span>.
