It was designed to be a public spectacle, serving as a deterrent to others. Jesus' crucifixion fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/22-16.htm">Psalm 22:16</a>, "They pierced my hands and my feet." This method of execution was not only physically excruciating but also a form of public humiliation. The crucifixion took place at Golgotha, meaning "Place of the Skull," located outside the city walls of Jerusalem, aligning with the requirement in Jewish law that executions occur outside the camp (<a href="/leviticus/24-14.htm">Leviticus 24:14</a>).<p><b>they divided up His garments</b><br>The division of Jesus' garments among the soldiers was a customary practice, as the executioners were entitled to the possessions of the condemned. This act fulfilled the prophecy found in <a href="/psalms/22-18.htm">Psalm 22:18</a>, "They divide my garments among them." The seamless tunic of Jesus, which was not torn, symbolizes His role as the High Priest, as the high priest's robe was also seamless (<a href="/exodus/28-32.htm">Exodus 28:32</a>). This act of dividing His garments highlights the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy and the humiliation Jesus endured.<p><b>by casting lots</b><br>Casting lots was an ancient practice used to make decisions or determine fate, similar to drawing straws or rolling dice. This method was employed by the Roman soldiers to decide who would receive Jesus' clothing, further fulfilling the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/22-18.htm">Psalm 22:18</a>. The use of lots in this context underscores the fulfillment of Scripture and the sovereignty of God, even in the details of Jesus' crucifixion. The act of casting lots for His garments also serves as a stark contrast to the spiritual significance of Jesus' sacrifice, as the soldiers were oblivious to the monumental event unfolding before them.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, whose crucifixion is the pivotal event in Christian theology.

In this instance, the fact that the title or superscription was placed over our Lord's head, implies that the last was the kind of cross employed. In carrying the sentence of crucifixion into effect, the cross was laid on the ground, the condemned man stripped and laid upon it. Sometimes he was simply tied; sometimes, as here, nails driven through the hands and feet; sometimes a projecting ledge was put for the feet to rest on; sometimes the whole weight of the body hung upon the limbs that were thus secured. The clothes of the criminal were the usual perquisites of the executioners, and in this case included (as we find from <a href="/john/19-23.htm" title="Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.">John 19:23</a>) the tunic worn next the body as well as the outer garment. It was as the soldiers were thus nailing Him to the cross that He prayed, "Father, forgive them" (<a href="/luke/23-34.htm" title="Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.">Luke 23:34</a>).<p><span class= "bld">They parted my garments among them.</span>--St. John (<a href="/john/19-24.htm" title="They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which said, They parted my raiment among them, and for my clothing they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.">John 19:24</a>) emphatically records a yet more literal fulfilment of the words than that noted by St. Matthew. The thoughts of both disciples, we may believe, were turned to <a href="/psalms/22-18.htm" title="They part my garments among them, and cast lots on my clothing.">Psalm 22:18</a> by our Lord's utterance of its opening words (<a href="/matthew/27-46.htm" title="And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?">Matthew 27:46</a>), and thus led to dwell on the manifold coincidences of its language with the facts of the Passion. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They crucified him.</span> We should try to realize the utter degradation as well as the anguish of such a death. No modern form of punishment carries with it the abhorred ignominy with which crucifixion was regarded, and we must put ourselves back eighteen centuries, and enter into the feelings of Jews and Romans, if we would view it in its genuine aspect. The narrative of this harrowing scene could not be simpler. The writer leaves it reverently to speak for itself, without any attempt at sensational adjuncts or rhetorical amplification. There is no indignation at the outrage, no compassion for the Sufferer, no commendation of the Divine patience. These are suppressed, because they needed no words; the unvarnished details are more than sufficient to place the reader by the Saviour's side, and make him feel every pang, sympathize with the grief, the shame, the horror, that rent the heart of Jesus. The sacred authors have said little about the mode of crucifixion, and have left untold many particulars which we should have liked to hear. This horrid punishment was too well known at that time to need description, and they saw no necessity for dwelling on its revolting details. (For some of these, see on ver. 32.) Whether in the present case the upright beam of the cross was fixed in its position before the Prisoner was fastened to it, or whether it was laid flat on the ground, set in order, and the Sufferer was nailed thereto before it was raised and settled in its place, we are not informed. The former was the method commonly employed. To carry out the execution a quaternion of soldiers (<a href="/acts/12-4.htm">Acts 12:4</a>) was appointed under the command of a centurion (ver. 54) <span class="cmt_word">Parted his garments, casting lots.</span> The clothes of criminals were the perquisite of the soldiers charged with the execution. They divided these amongst the four, casting lots to determine what each should take. Further details are supplied by St. John (<a href="/john/19-23.htm">John 19:23, 24</a>). <span class="cmt_word">That it might be fulfilled...they cast lots</span>. These words are retained in the Clementine Vulgate and a few cursives, but omitted by the best uncials and most other manuscripts. Modern editors almost universally have rejected them as an interpolation from the parallel passage in St. John. There can be no doubt, however, that, whether genuine or not in this place, they represent the truth. The soldiers' act did fulfil in marvellous fashion the psalmist's enunciation (<a href="/psalms/22-18.htm">Psalm 22:18</a>), where the stripping of the Lord's Anointed and the disposal of his raiment are prophetically stated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-35.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">they had crucified</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#964;&#945;&#965;&#961;&#974;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Staur&#333;santes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4717.htm">Strong's 4717: </a> </span><span class="str2">From stauros; to impale on the cross; figuratively, to extinguish passion or selfishness.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Him,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(auton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
