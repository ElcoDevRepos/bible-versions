It is the birthplace of King David, as noted in <a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1</a>, and is prophesied as the birthplace of the Messiah in <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>. The name "Bethlehem" means "house of bread," which is fitting for Jesus, who later refers to Himself as the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). The phrase "in Judea" distinguishes this Bethlehem from another Bethlehem located in the region of Zebulun (<a href="/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a>).<p><b>during the time of King Herod</b><br>King Herod, known as Herod the Great, was a Roman-appointed king of Judea. His reign is marked by significant architectural achievements, including the expansion of the Second Temple in Jerusalem, but also by his tyrannical rule and paranoia, which led to the infamous massacre of the innocents (<a href="/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16-18</a>). Herod's rule provides a historical anchor for the timing of Jesus' birth, as he died in 4 B.C. This period was characterized by political tension and unrest, as the Jewish people were under Roman occupation and eagerly anticipating a Messiah to deliver them.<p><b>Magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem</b><br>The Magi, often referred to as "wise men," were likely scholars or astrologers from regions such as Persia or Babylon. Their journey from the east suggests a long and arduous travel, indicating the significance of the celestial event they followed, often associated with the prophecy in <a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a> about a star coming out of Jacob. The Magi's arrival in Jerusalem, the political and religious center of Judea, underscores the widespread expectation of a Jewish Messiah. Their presence fulfills the prophecy of nations coming to the light of Israel (<a href="/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>) and foreshadows the inclusion of Gentiles in the salvation brought by

Practical takeaway: whenever Scripture names a place, it&#8217;s anchoring truth in real geography&#8212;our faith is rooted in concrete history, not myth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>during the time of

The verse invites us to trust the reliability of Scripture, marvel at God&#8217;s precise timing, and join the Magi in recognizing and honoring the newborn King.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>II.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">In the days of Herod the king.</span>--The death of Herod took place in the year of Rome A.U.C. 750, just before the Passover. This year coincided with what in our common chronology would be B.C. 4--so that we have to recognise the fact that our common reckoning is erroneous, and to fix B.C. 5 or 4 as the date of the Nativity.<p>No facts recorded either in St. Matthew or St. Luke throw much light on the season of the birth of Christ. The flocks and shepherds in the open field indicate spring rather than winter. The received day, December 25th, was not kept as a festival in the East till the time of Chrysostom, and was then received as resting on the tradition of the Roman Church. It has been conjectured, with some probability, that the time was chosen in order to substitute the purified joy of a Christian festival for the license of the Saturnalia which were kept at that season.<p>The time of the arrival of the wise men was probably (we cannot say more) after the Presentation in the Temple of <a href="/luke/2-22.htm" title="And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;">Luke 2:22</a>. The appearance of the star coincided with the birth. The journey from any part of the region vaguely called the East would occupy at least several weeks.<p><span class= "bld">Wise men from the east.</span>--The Greek word is Magi. That name appears in <a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm" title="And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.">Jeremiah 39:3</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/39-13.htm" title="So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon's princes;">Jeremiah 39:13</a>, in the name Rab-Mag, "The chief of the Magi." Herodotus speaks of them as a priestly caste of the Medes, known as interpreters of dreams (I. 101, 120). Among the Greeks the word was commonly applied with a tone of scorn to the impostors who claimed supernatural knowledge, and <span class= "ital">magic</span> was in fact the art of the Magi, and so the word was commonly used throughout the Roman world when the New Testament was written, Simon Magus is Simon the sorcerer. There was however, as side by side with this, a recognition of the higher ideas of which the word was capable, and we can hardly think that the writer of the Gospel would have used it in its lower sense. With him, as with Plato, the Magi were thought of as observers of the heavens, students of the secrets of Nature. Where they came from we cannot tell. The name was too widely spread at this time to lead us to look with certainty to its original home in Persia, and that country was to the North rather than the East of Palestine. The watching of the heavens implied in the narrative belonged to Chaldea rather than Persia. The popular legends that they were three in number, and that they were kings, that they represented the three great races of the sons of Noah, and were named Gaspar, Melchior, and Balthasar, are simply apocryphal additions, originating probably in dramatic representations, and perpetuated by Christian art.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-12.</span> <span class="accented">- Born at Bethlehem</span>, <span class="accented">according to prophecy</span>, <span class="accented">he receives there the homage of representatives of the</span>, <span class="accented">heathen world.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now when Jesus</span>; who has just been identified with Christ.

The First Gospel, if taken alone would give the impression that Joseph had had no previous connexion with Nazareth. But about the place where Joseph and Mary lived before the birth of Jesus the evangelist did not concern himself (cf ver. 23, note). <span class="cmt_word">Of Judaea</span>. For the evangelist's purpose it was most important so to define it as to exclude Bethlehem of Zebulun (<a href="/joshua/19-15.htm">Joshua 19:15</a>). The inhabitants of Bethlehem of Judaea, a market town of a fruitful (Ephratah) district, live chiefly by agriculture, but also for several centuries have manufactured images of saints, rosaries, and fancy articles. Since 1834: it has been almost exclusively occupied by Christians (Socin's Baedeker,' p. 243, seq.). From "the House of Bread" came forth" the true Bread." <span class="cmt_word">In the days of Herod the king</span>. Herod the Great and Herod Agrippa II. (<a href="/acts/25-13.htm">Acts 25:13</a>) alone held the legal title of "king" for any time (but cf. <a href="/matthew/14-1.htm">Matthew 14:1</a>, note) - the former as King of the Jews (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 1:14.4), or King "of the Idumaeans and Samaritans" (Appian, 'Civ., 5:75; <span class="accented">vide</span> Schurer, 1:1. 340), by a decree of an express meeting of the Roman senate, <span class="date">B.C. 40</span>; the latter by Claudius's appointment, as king first of Chalcis (A.D. 48-53) and afterwards (A.D. 53-100) of the tetrarchies of Philip and Lysanias (Josephus, 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:12. 8; 13. 2), although Herod Antipas was so spoken of by courtesy ( <span class="accented">infra</span>, <a href="/matthew/14-9.htm">Matthew 14:9</a>). <span class="accented">As</span> the date of Agrippa II. is quite out of the question, we are almost compelled by this phrase alone to recognize the date of Christ's birth as falling in the lifetime of Herod the Great. Herod the Great died in the spring of A.U.C. 750, our <span class="date">B.C. 4</span> (Schiirer, 1:1. 466), and as our Lord was born at least forty days earlier, for the purification in the temple must have taken place before Herod's massacre of the innocents, he cannot have been born later than the very beginning of <span class="date">B.C. 4</span>, or the end of <span class="date">B.C. 5</span>. Indeed, upon the most natural deduction from ver. 16, he must have been born some months earlier. The Church, from the days of Justin Martyr ('Ap.,' 1:32), has loved to see in the abolition by Rome of the kingdom of the Jews at the death of Herod, of its native dynasty by Herod's usurnation (Origen, 'Genesis Hom.,' 17:6), the fulfilment of Jacob's prophecy (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Behold, there came Wise Men from the East</span>.

On this word see especially Schrader ('Cuneiform Inscriptions and the Old Testament') on <a href="/jeremiah/39-3.htm">Jeremiah 39:3</a>. He considers it to be in origin not Iranian (Medo-Persian), but Babylonian, and to have primarily meant either "<span class="accented">one</span> who is deep whether in power and reputation or in insight," or one who has fulness of power. It was, perhaps, at first used with special reference to astrologers and interpreters of dreams, and, passing from Babylonia to Media, it became the name of the Median priestly order. In the latter sense it is probably used here. In <a href="/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6-8</a> it, apparently by reversion, is used in its wider meaning. Of the number and rank of those who now came absolutely nothing is known. Of greater importance is Cicero's statement ('De Div.,' 1:41), "Nee quisquam rex Persarum potest esse, qui non ante magorum disciplinam scientiamque perceperit." These Magi <span class="accented">spontaneously</span> submit to the Babe. <span class="accented">From the East.</span> The proper home of the Magi would thus be Media, and, from the length of time employed on their journey (ver. 16), it is probable that by "the East" we must here understand Media or some other part of the kingdom, of Parthia, into which Media had been mostly absorbed, and in which, in fact, the Magi were now greatly honoured. <span class="accented">Many</span>, <span class="accented">however</span> (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Lightfoot, 'Her. Hebr.'; and Edersheim, 'Life,' etc., 1:203, who points out that a Jewish kingdom of Yemen then existed), think that these Magi came from Arabia; and with this the tradition, evidently received by Justin Martyr and frequently referred to by him ( <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f08;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x39c;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, 'Trypho,' &sect;&sect; 77, 78, 88, 102; cf. Reseh, 'Agrapha,' p. 471), perhaps agrees. But Justin's own opinion was that they came from Damascus, which "was and is a part of the land of Arabia" (&sect; 78). It is noticeable that Justin's tradition is confirmed by the Jerusalem Talmud ('Ber.,' 2:4), which makes an "Arabian" tell a Jew that Messiah is born. The whole passage is worth quoting for its illustration of several details in this chapter. "After this the children of Israel shall be converted, and shall inquire after the Lord their God, and David their king (<a href="/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>). Our rabbins say, 'That is King Messias, if he be among the living, his name is David, or if dead, David is his name.' Rabbi Tanchum said, 'Thus I prove it: He sheweth mercy to David his Messiah' (<a href="/psalms/18-50.htm">Psalm 18:50</a>). Rabbi Josua ben Levi saith, 'His name is <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5de;&#x5d7;</span>, a Branch (<a href="/zechariah/3-8.htm">Zechariah 3:8</a>).' Rabbi Judah bar Aibu saith, ' His name is Menahem (that is, <span class="accented">Para>klhtov</span>, the Comforter).' And that which happened to a certain Jew, as he was ploughing, agreeth with this business. A certain Arabian travelling, and hearing the ox bellow, said to the Jew at plough, 'O Jew, loose thy oxen, and loose thy ploughs, for, behold, the temple is laid waste!' The ox bellowed the second time; the Arabian saith to him, 'O Jew, Jew, yoke thy oxen, and fit thy ploughs: for, behold, King Messiah is born!' But saith the Jew, 'What is his name?' 'Menahem,' saith he. 'And what is the name of his father?' 'Hezekiah,' saith the Arabian. To whom the Jew, 'But whence is he?' The other answered, ' From the palace of the King of Bethlehem-Judah.' Away he went, and sold his oxen, and his ploughs, and became a seller of infants' swaddling-clothes, going about from town to town. When he came to that city (Bethlehem) all the women bought of him, but the mother of Menahem bought nothing. He heard the voice of the women saying, 'O thou mother of Menahem, thou mother of Menahem, carry thy son the things that are here sold.' But she replied, 'May the enemies of Israel be strandded, because on the day that he was born the temple was laid waste.' To whom he said, 'But we hoped, that as it was laid waste at his feet, so at his feet it would be built again.' She saith, 'I have no money.' To whom he replied, 'But why should this be prejudicial to him? Carry him what you buy here, and if you have no money to-day, after some days I will come back and receive it.' After some days he returns to that city, and saith to her, 'How does the little infant?' And she said, 'From the time you saw me last, spirits [winds] and tempests came, and snatched him away out of my hands.' Rabbi Bon saith, 'What need have we to learn from an Arabian? Is it not plainly written, "And Lebanon shall fall before the Powerful One?" (Esa. 10:34). And what follows after? "A Branch shall come out of the root of Jesse" (Esa. 11:1)'" ('Hor. Hebr.,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>) . To Jerusalem. The capital, where this King would reign, and where information about his birth would most naturally be obtained. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/2-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">was born</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#949;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(genn&#275;thentos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1080.htm">Strong's 1080: </a> </span><span class="str2">From a variation of genos; to procreate; figuratively, to regenerate.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(en)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
