In biblical context, blindness often symbolizes spiritual ignorance or lack of understanding (<a href="/isaiah/42-7.htm">Isaiah 42:7</a>). The opening of their eyes not only represents physical healing but also spiritual enlightenment, as they now see both physically and spiritually. This miracle fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah bringing sight to the blind (<a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>), affirming Jesus as the promised Savior.<p><b>Jesus warned them sternly,</b><br>The stern warning from Jesus highlights the seriousness of His instruction. The Greek word used here implies a strong admonition, suggesting that Jesus had a specific purpose for this command. This reflects Jesus' awareness of the timing and manner in which His identity and works should be revealed. It also underscores His desire to avoid unnecessary attention that could hinder His ministry or provoke premature opposition from religious leaders.<p><b>&#8220;See that no one finds out about this!&#8221;</b><br>Jesus' instruction for secrecy is consistent with His frequent practice of instructing those He healed to remain silent (<a href="/mark/1-44.htm">Mark 1:44</a>, <a href="/mark/7-36.htm">Mark 7:36</a>). This command can be understood in several ways: it may have been to prevent the spread of a misunderstanding of His mission as merely a miracle worker, to avoid drawing large crowds that could impede His movement and teaching, or to delay the inevitable conflict with religious authorities. This reflects the Messianic Secret, a theme in the Gospels where Jesus seeks to control the revelation of His identity and mission until the appropriate time.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is performing a miracle by healing the blind men.

This tension highlights:<p>&#8211; The magnetic nature of divine works (<a href="/mark/7-36.htm">Mark 7:36&#8211;37</a>).<p>&#8211; The greater plan unfolding: Jesus would ultimately be proclaimed openly after the resurrection (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18-20</a>; <a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/9-30.htm">Matthew 9:30</a> showcases Jesus&#8217; power to give immediate, literal sight, proving His messianic identity and rewarding sincere faith.

It is as if our Lord saw the garrulous joy on the point of uttering itself, and sought by every means in His power to restrain it. The reasons may be sought, as elsewhere, either (1) in its being good for the spiritual life of the men themselves that they should show forth their praise of God, not with their lips, but in their lives; or (2) in the shrinking from mere notoriety, from the gaze of crowds drawn together to gaze on signs and wonders, and ready to make the Wonder-Worker a king because He wrought them, which St. Matthew, at a later stage, notes as characteristic of our Lord's ministry (<a href="/context/matthew/12-16.htm" title="And charged them that they should not make him known:">Matthew 12:16-21</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>).
