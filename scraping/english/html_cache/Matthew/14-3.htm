He ruled during the time of Jesus and John the Baptist. Herod's arrest of John the Baptist was a politically motivated action, as John was a popular prophet who openly criticized Herod's immoral actions. This arrest reflects the tension between political power and prophetic truth, a recurring theme in the Bible.<p><b>and bound him</b><br>Binding John signifies the attempt to suppress his influence and message. In biblical times, binding was a common practice for prisoners, symbolizing the restriction of freedom. This act of binding a prophet highlights the conflict between worldly authority and divine mission, as seen in other biblical narratives where God's messengers face persecution.<p><b>and put him in prison</b><br>John was imprisoned in the fortress of Machaerus, located east of the Dead Sea. This location was a strategic and secure place for detaining political prisoners. The imprisonment of John the Baptist foreshadows the suffering and persecution that Jesus and His followers would endure, emphasizing the cost of discipleship and the opposition faced by those who speak God's truth.<p><b>on account of Herodias</b><br>Herodias was the wife of Herod's half-brother Philip, and her marriage to Herod Antipas was both unlawful and scandalous according to Jewish law (<a href="/leviticus/18-16.htm">Leviticus 18:16, 20</a>:21). Herodias's influence over Herod led to John's imprisonment, illustrating the destructive power of sin and the moral corruption within Herod's court. Herodias's role in John's arrest underscores the theme of personal vendettas and the misuse of power.<p><b>his brother Philip&#8217;s wife</b><br>Philip, also known as Herod Philip I, was Herod Antipas's half-brother. Herodias's marriage to Herod Antipas while still being Philip's wife was considered adulterous and incestuous by Jewish standards. This situation highlights the moral decline of Herod's family and serves as a backdrop for John's bold proclamation of righteousness. The unlawful marriage is a direct challenge to God's commandments, setting the stage for John's prophetic confrontation with Herod.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_antipas.htm">Herod Antipas</a></b><br>The tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, son of Herod the Great.

So of Micaiah by Ahab (<a href="/2_chronicles/18-26.htm">2 Chronicles 18:26</a>, LXX., but not Lucian's text). Probably here in allusion to the distance of Machaerus from Herod's usual residence at Tiberius. Possibly, also, a reference to John being safer there from the designs of Herodias (<a href="/mark/6-19.htm">Mark 6:19, 20</a>). Anyhow, notice the stages in Herod's action - capture, binding, imprisonment in a place where he was quite out of the way. <span class="cmt_word">For Herodias' sake.</span> John was imprisoned, according to the New Testament, <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> as a punishment for his rebuke of Herod; <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> to protect him from Herodias' vengeance. (On the statement by Josephus, that it was for political reasons, see <a href="/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a>, note.) <span class="cmt_word">His brother Philip's wife.</span> According to Josephus ('Ant.,' 18:05. 4), the first husband of Herodias was "Herod," son of Herod the Great by Mariamne the high priest's daughter, and the daughter of Herodias, Salome, married Philip the tetrarch, who was also the son of Herod the Great by Cleopatra of Jerusalem. Hence many critics (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> Ewald; Schurer, I. 2:22) suppose the account in Matthew and Mark to be mistaken, and due to a confusion of Herodias with her daughter. But, although it is curious that two sons of Herod the Great should have been called Philip, yet, in view of their being by different mothers, it cannot be pronounced impossible ("Antipas" and "Antipater" are <span class="accented">not</span> precisely identical). Besides, Herod the son of Mariamne would probably have had some other name than that of his father alone. It is noticeable that, in the same context, Josephus speaks also of Antipas by the name Herod only. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/14-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Now]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
