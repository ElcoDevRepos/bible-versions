The title "Son of God" is significant, affirming Jesus' divine nature and messianic role. This challenge echoes the temptation in the Garden of Eden, where Satan questioned God's word. The phrase also connects to Jesus' baptism in <a href="/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, where God declared Jesus as His beloved Son. The devil's use of "if" seeks to sow doubt, a common tactic in spiritual warfare.<p><b>he said, &#8220;throw Yourself down.&#8221;</b><br>The devil tempts Jesus to test God's protection by performing a miraculous act. This temptation occurs at the pinnacle of the temple in Jerusalem, a significant religious and cultural site. The act of throwing Himself down would be a public spectacle, tempting Jesus to misuse His divine power for self-glorification rather than fulfilling His mission through humility and obedience. This reflects the human temptation to seek validation through dramatic displays rather than trusting in God's plan.<p><b>For it is written: &#8216;He will command His angels concerning You,</b><br>Satan quotes <a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>, a messianic psalm that speaks of God's protection over His faithful. By using Scripture, the devil attempts to manipulate God's word for his purposes, highlighting the importance of understanding Scripture in context. This misuse of Scripture serves as a warning against taking verses out of context to justify actions contrary to God's will. The promise of angelic protection is real, but it is not to be tested presumptuously.<p><b>and they will lift You up in their hands,</b><br>This imagery of angels lifting Jesus up emphasizes divine protection and care. Angels are often depicted as God's messengers and protectors, as seen in <a href="/daniel/6-22.htm">Daniel 6:22</a> and <a href="/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>. The devil's suggestion distorts the purpose of angelic intervention, which is to serve God's will, not to be manipulated for personal gain or spectacle. This phrase underscores the spiritual reality of angelic beings and their role in God's providence.<p><b>so that You will not strike Your foot against a stone.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>The devil concludes his quotation of <a href="/psalms/91-12.htm">Psalm 91:12</a>, emphasizing physical safety. This promise of protection is part of God's covenant with His people, assuring them of His care. However, the devil's challenge is a perversion of this promise, tempting Jesus to act outside of God's timing and purpose. The reference to not striking one's foot against a stone symbolizes God's comprehensive care, yet it is not a license for reckless behavior. Jesus' response in the following verses highlights the importance of trusting God's plan without testing His promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is being tempted by Satan in the wilderness after fasting for forty days and nights.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/satan.htm">Satan</a></b><br>The tempter, also known as the devil, who challenges Jesus' identity and mission by quoting Scripture out of context.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting of Jesus' temptation, symbolizing a place of testing and spiritual struggle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_temple.htm">The Temple</a></b><br>Although not explicitly mentioned in this verse, the pinnacle of the temple is implied as the location where Satan suggests Jesus should throw Himself down.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/angels.htm">Angels</a></b><br>Heavenly beings mentioned in the Scripture Satan quotes, who are tasked with protecting Jesus according to the misused Psalm.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_scripture_in_context.htm">Understanding Scripture in Context</a></b><br>Satan's misuse of Scripture serves as a warning to us about the importance of understanding the Bible in its full context.

The devil&#8217;s demand questions Sonship, distorts Scripture, and invites presumption. Jesus will answer with obedient trust, showing that genuine faith rests in the Father&#8217;s promise without demanding proof. The passage calls believers to know God&#8217;s Word thoroughly, refuse manipulative tests of the Lord, and stand secure in their God-given identity while relying on His promised&#8212;but never presumed&#8212;protection.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">If thou be the Son of God.</span>--In this case, as before, the temptation starts from the attestation of the character of Jesus as the Son of God. With this there is now joined an appeal to familiar and sacred words, and the subtlety of the Tempter lay in his perversion of their true meaning. Here, too, the words throw light on the previous spiritual life of the Son of Man. As in all analogous temptations (and the history would have but little significance or interest for us if it were not analogous to many human experiences) the words which were presented to the soul, with their true meaning obscured and perverted, must have been precisely those that had before been most precious. We can think of Him as having fed on those words, found in them the stay and comfort of His life, without ever dreaming (if one may venture so to speak) of putting them to the test by devices of His own imagining.<p><span class= "bld">In their hands.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">on.</span> The angelic hands are thought of as sustaining and up-bearing.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">If thou be the Son of God</span> (ver. 3, note). <span class="cmt_word">For it is written</span>. <a href="/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11, 12</a>, verbally from the LXX., but omitting the clause, "to keep thee in all thy ways." Luke omits only "in all thy ways." The clause, according to either record, was omitted possibly because the devil shrank from reminding Jesus of "ways" which he need not take; more probably because . ' ways" hardly fitted this case (cf. Weiss). Trench ('Studies,' p. 40), following St. Bernard, says that the omission of the clause alters the whole character of the quotation, considering that "ways" implies ways appointed by God. But this appears to be strained. The devil, appealing to Jesus' consciousness of abiding communion with God (<a href="/psalms/91-1.htm">Psalm 91:1</a>), bids him enjoy to the full the promise of God's protection. There is no thought here of a "miracle of display" to the multitudes who were assembled, "as a matter of course," on the temple area (Meyer; cf. even Trench). Neither the devil's solicitation nor our Lord's reply hint at anything else than Divine protection. If it be urged that for this any one of the many precipices by the Dead Sea, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> those of the Quamntana (ver. 1, note) itself, would have been sufficient, the answer may be found in the fact that at the temple, the seat of God's special manifestation, God's special protection might be looked for. There is a slight doubt whether the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is recitative (Westcott and Hort, and most) or part of the quotation (Rheims, Meyer, Weiss). In favour of the latter view is the fact that the recitative <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is not used elsewhere in this section (vers. 4, 7, 10), but as in <a href="/luke/4-10.htm">Luke 4:10</a> it can hardly be other than recitative (for another <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> is inserted before "on their hands"), the probability is that it was recitative in the oral source, and therefore recitative here. <span class="cmt_word">In their hands</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">on</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>.
