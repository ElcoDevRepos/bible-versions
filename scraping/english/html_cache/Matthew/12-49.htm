This act of pointing signifies recognition and identification, drawing attention to those who follow Him. In the cultural context of the time, gestures were a common way to communicate and emphasize messages. The disciples, who were chosen by Jesus, represent those who are committed to His teachings and mission. This moment underscores the intimate relationship between Jesus and His followers, akin to a family bond.<p><b>He said</b><br>Jesus often used direct speech to convey His teachings, ensuring clarity and authority in His messages. His words carry weight and are intended to instruct and transform. In the Gospels, Jesus frequently uses speech to reveal deeper spiritual truths, often challenging societal norms and expectations. His authority in speaking is rooted in His divine nature and mission.<p><b>Here are My mother and My brothers</b><br>By referring to His disciples as His mother and brothers, Jesus redefines the concept of family. In the Jewish culture of the time, family ties were paramount, often determining one's social and religious identity. However, Jesus introduces a radical idea that spiritual kinship, based on obedience to God's will, transcends biological relationships. This statement aligns with other teachings of Jesus, such as in <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>, where He emphasizes the priority of spiritual commitments over familial ones. It also reflects the prophetic vision of a new covenant community, united not by blood but by faith and obedience to God. This redefinition of family foreshadows the inclusive nature of the Church, where all believers are considered part of God's family.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching and redefining the concept of family in the spiritual sense.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are being identified as His spiritual family.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/physical_family_of_jesus.htm">Physical Family of Jesus</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, the context includes Jesus' biological family, who were seeking to speak with Him.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/crowd.htm">Crowd</a></b><br>The larger group of people present during this teaching moment, witnessing Jesus' redefinition of family.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/house.htm">House</a></b><br>The setting where this teaching takes place, indicating a private or semi-private gathering.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/redefining_family.htm">Redefining Family</a></b><br>Jesus expands the definition of family beyond biological ties to include those who do the will of God.

The Berean Standard Bible words it, &#8220;Stretching out His hand toward His disciples&#8221; (v. 49).<p>&#8226; That outward motion signals that what He is about to say concerns these particular men in front of Him, not an abstract crowd.<p>&#8226; It mirrors earlier moments when Jesus uses physical action to underscore spiritual truth&#8212;touching the leper (<a href="/matthew/8-3.htm">Matthew 8:3</a>) or lifting Peter from the water (<a href="/matthew/14-31.htm">Matthew 14:31</a>).<p>&#8226; By choosing His disciples as the focal point, He affirms the reality that a new covenant family is forming around faith and obedience, foreshadowed in <a href="/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a> where He speaks of &#8220;other sheep&#8221; who will be &#8220;one flock.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The gesture also fulfills <a href="/psalms/22-22.htm">Psalm 22:22</a>, &#8220;I will proclaim Your name to My brothers,&#8221; showing that Messiah publicly identifies believers as family.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He said</b><p>Words follow the gesture, because in Scripture the spoken word carries creative and authoritative power (<a href="/genesis/1-3.htm">Genesis 1:3</a>; <a href="/john/6-63.htm">John 6:63</a>).<p>&#8226; When Jesus &#8220;said,&#8221; He wasn&#8217;t offering a metaphor to be taken lightly; He was revealing divine truth that redefines relationships.<p>&#8226; His declaration carries the same weight as His previous &#8220;I say to you&#8221; statements (<a href="/bsb/matthew/5.htm">Matthew 5</a>), underscoring His authority as the Son of God (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).<p>&#8226; He is not dismissing biological family&#8212;elsewhere He rebukes traditions that neglect parents (<a href="/mark/7-9.htm">Mark 7:9-13</a>)&#8212;but He prioritizes spiritual kinship that lasts into eternity (<a href="/luke/20-34.htm">Luke 20:34-36</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Here are My mother and My brothers.</b><p>The Lord names a family that transcends bloodlines, rooting it in shared obedience (see the clarifying next verse, <a href="/matthew/12-50.htm">Matthew 12:50</a>).<p>&#8226; Parallel accounts (<a href="/mark/3-34.htm">Mark 3:34-35</a>; <a href="/luke/8-21.htm">Luke 8:21</a>) affirm that whoever &#8220;does the will of God&#8221; is counted as kin.<p>&#8226; This inclusion anticipates the gospel&#8217;s reach to Gentiles, breaking every dividing wall (<a href="/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-19</a>).<p>&#8226; It assures believers of intimate belonging: &#8220;Both the One who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are of one family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>).<p>&#8226; Practically, it calls the church to treat one another with genuine family love&#8212;caring for widows (<a href="/1_timothy/5-3.htm">1 Timothy 5:3-8</a>), sharing burdens (<a href="/galatians/6-2.htm">Galatians 6:2</a>), and practicing forgiveness (<a href="/colossians/3-13.htm">Colossians 3:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Because God adopts us as His children through Christ (<a href="/romans/8-14.htm">Romans 8:14-17</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4-7</a>), believers enjoy the same closeness to Jesus that Mary and James experienced physically.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/12-49.htm">Matthew 12:49</a> unveils a literal, God-given family formed around faith in Jesus. By pointing to His disciples, speaking with divine authority, and naming them &#8220;mother&#8221; and &#8220;brothers,&#8221; the Lord invites every obedient believer into intimate kinship with Him&#8212;an eternal bond that calls us to love, loyalty, and shared mission.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(49) <span class= "bld">Behold my mother and my brethren.</span>--The words assert in its strongest form the truth which we all acknowledge, that though natural relationships involve duties which may not be neglected, spiritual relationships, the sense of brotherhood in a great cause, of devotion to the same Master, are above them, and that when the two clash (as in the case supposed in <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm" title="He that loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.">Matthew 10:37</a>), the latter must of right prevail.<p>The words have naturally occupied a prominent position in the controversial writings of Protestants against what has been judged by them to be the idolatrous worship of the Virgin Mother by the Church of Rome; and it is clear that they have a very direct bearing on it. They do exclude the thought that her intercession is mightier to prevail than that of any other pure and saintly soul. Though spoken with no apparent reference to the abuses of later ages, the words are a protest, all the stronger because of the absence of such reference, against the excess of reverence which has passed into a <span class= "ital">cultus,</span> and the idolatry of dressed-up dolls into which that <span class= "ital">cultus</span> has developed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 49.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples</span>.
