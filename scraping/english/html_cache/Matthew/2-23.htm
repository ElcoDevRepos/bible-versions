At the time of Jesus, it was not a place of great significance or renown, which is reflected in Nathanael's question in <a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" This phrase highlights the humility and lowliness of Jesus' upbringing, aligning with the theme of God choosing the humble and lowly to accomplish His purposes. The choice of Nazareth as Jesus' hometown fulfills God's plan for the Messiah to be approachable and relatable to the common people. Archaeological evidence suggests that Nazareth was a small agricultural settlement during the first century, with a population of a few hundred people.<p><b>So was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophets:</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the fulfillment of prophecy, a recurring theme in the Gospel of Matthew, which seeks to demonstrate that Jesus is the promised Messiah of the Old Testament. Although there is no direct Old Testament prophecy that states the Messiah would be called a Nazarene, this phrase suggests a broader understanding of the prophetic tradition. The prophets often spoke of the Messiah in terms that implied humility and rejection, such as <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, which describes the suffering servant as "despised and rejected by men." The fulfillment of prophecy in Jesus' life serves to validate His messianic identity and divine mission.<p><b>&#8220;He will be called a Nazarene.&#8221;</b><br>The term "Nazarene" may carry a dual significance. First, it connects to the Hebrew word "netzer," meaning "branch," found in <a href="/isaiah/11.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, which speaks of a shoot coming from the stump of Jesse, a prophecy about the Davidic lineage of the Messiah. This connection suggests that Jesus, as a Nazarene, is the righteous branch from David's line. Second, being called a Nazarene also implies being despised or scorned, as Nazareth was a town of little repute. This aligns with the prophetic theme of the Messiah being one who would be rejected and suffer for the sake of humanity, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>. The title "Nazarene" thus encapsulates both Jesus' royal lineage and His role as the suffering servant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, whose life and ministry fulfill Old Testament prophecies.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>The earthly father of Jesus, who leads his family to Nazareth in obedience to divine guidance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>The mother of Jesus, who accompanies Joseph and Jesus to Nazareth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/n/nazareth.htm">Nazareth</a></b><br>A small town in Galilee where Jesus grew up, fulfilling the prophecy that He would be called a Nazarene.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophets.htm">Prophets</a></b><br>Refers to the collective voice of Old Testament prophets whose writings and prophecies point to the coming Messiah.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>Jesus' life in Nazareth fulfills the prophetic words, demonstrating God's faithfulness to His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/h/humility_and_obscurity.htm">Humility and Obscurity</a></b><br>Jesus' upbringing in a humble town teaches us about God's value of humility and His ability to use the seemingly insignificant for His purposes.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_guidance.htm">Divine Guidance</a></b><br>Joseph's obedience to divine direction in moving to Nazareth is a model for trusting God's guidance in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/identity_in_christ.htm">Identity in Christ</a></b><br>Just as Jesus was identified as a Nazarene, believers are called to find their identity in Christ, regardless of their earthly origins.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>The fulfillment of prophecy through Jesus' life in Nazareth underscores God's sovereign control over history and His plan for redemption.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_2_23_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 2:23?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_2_23_and_OT_prophecy_link.htm">How does Matthew 2:23 fulfill Old Testament prophecy about Jesus' identity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Nazareth_s_role_in_Jesus_humble_start.htm">Why is Nazareth significant in understanding Jesus' humble beginnings and mission?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Which_OT_prophecies_link_Jesus_to_Nazareth.htm">What Old Testament prophecies connect to Jesus being called a Nazarene?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Nazareth_upbringing_Inspire_daily_humility.htm">How can Jesus' upbringing in Nazareth inspire humility in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Matt_2_23_inspire_trust_in_God.htm">In what ways does Matthew 2:23 encourage us to trust God's sovereign plan?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Matt_2_23_fulfill_OT_prophecy.htm">How does Matthew 2:23 fulfill Old Testament prophecy if "Nazarene" isn't explicitly mentioned there?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Nazareth_s_role_in_Jesus_identity.htm">Why is Nazareth significant in Matthew 2:23 for Jesus' identity and mission?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Is_Matthew_2_23_historically_inaccurate.htm">Does Matthew 2:23 imply a historical inaccuracy regarding Old Testament prophecies?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_2.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/was_nazareth_inhabited_in_jesus'_time.htm">Was Nazareth inhabited during Jesus' lifetime?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/who_are_the_natsarim.htm">Who are the Natsarim?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_cite_a_prophecy_not_in_scripture.htm">Why does Matthew 2:23 cite a prophecy not found anywhere in the Hebrew Scriptures, claiming &#8220;He shall be called a Nazarene&#8221;?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_do_nazarenes_believe.htm">What do Nazarenes believe and represent?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Matthew 2:23 Mean</div><b>And he went</b><p>&#8220;After Herod died, Joseph got up &#8230; and went&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/2-21.htm">Matthew 2:21-22</a>).

Here it will be enough to deal with St. Matthew's reference to the name as in itself the fulfilment of a prophetic thought. He does not, as before, cite the words of any one prophet by name, but says generally that what he quotes had been spoken by or through the prophets. No such words are to be found in the Old Testament. It is not likely that the Evangelist would have quoted from any apocryphal prophecy, nor is there any trace of the existence of such a prophecy. The true explanation is to be found in the impression made on his mind by the verbal coincidence of fact with prediction. He had heard men speak with scorn of "the Nazarene," and yet the very syllables of that word had also fallen on his ears in one of the most glorious of the prophecies admitted to be Messianic--"There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a <span class= "ital">Netzer</span> (Branch) shall grow out of his roots" (<a href="/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1</a>). So he found in the word of scorn the <span class= "ital">nomen et omen</span> of glory. The town of Nazareth probably took its name from this meaning of the word, as pointing, like our <span class= "ital">-hurst</span> and <span class= "ital">-holt,</span> to the trees and shrubs for which it was conspicuous. The general reference to the prophets is explained by the fact that the same thought is expressed in <a href="/jeremiah/23-5.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/33-15.htm" title="In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.">Jeremiah 33:15</a>; <a href="/zechariah/3-8.htm" title="Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you, and your fellows that sit before you: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.">Zechariah 3:8</a>; <a href="/zechariah/6-12.htm" title="And speak to him, saying, Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:">Zechariah 6:12</a>, though there the Hebrew word is <span class= "ital">Zemach,</span> and not <span class= "ital">Netzer.</span> A like train of thought is found in the language of Tertullian and other early Christian writers to their heathen opponents--"You call us Christians," they say," worshippers of Christos, but you pronounce the words <span class= "ital">Chrestiani</span> and <span class= "ital">Chrestos, i.e.,</span> you give us a name which in your own language (Greek) means 'good,' and so you unconsciously bear testimony to the life we really lead." This seems the only tenable explanation of the passage. It is hardly likely that the Evangelist should have referred to the scorn with which Nazareth was regarded. Any reference to the Nazarite vow is out of the question, (1) because the two words are spelt differently, both in Greek and Hebrew, and (2) because our Lord's life represented quite a different aspect of holiness from that of which the Nazarite vow was the expression. That vow, as seen pre-eminently in the Baptist, represented the consecration which consists in separation from the world. The life of Christ manifested the higher form of consecration which is found in being <span class= "ital">in</span> the world but not <span class= "ital">of</span> it, mingling with the men and women who compose it, in order to purify and save. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth</span>. <span class="accented">En-Nasira</span>, now of from five thousand to six thousand souls, in the hills on the northern edge of the Plain of Esdraelon, not mentioned in the Old Testament or by Josephus.
