The law was intended to ensure that a deceased man's name and property remained within his family line.<p><b>his brother is to marry the widow</b><br>The practice of Levirate marriage required the deceased man's brother to marry the widow.

This practice underscores the communal and familial responsibilities emphasized in the Law of Moses.

This was a law not peculiar to the Hebrews, but prevalent from immemorial times among many ancient peoples, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Persians, Egyptians, and found in force among some nations in modern times, as Arabians, Druses, Cireassians, etc. It seems not to have been enforced in any case, but to have been left to the good will of the survivor, who might escape the obligation by submitting to a certain social obloquy (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-7.htm">Deuteronomy 25:7-10</a>). The motive of the regulation was the maintenance of a family and the non-alienation of property. Many authorities assert that the law did not apply in the case of a man who left daughters (<a href="/numbers/27-8.htm">Numbers 27:8</a>), but only in that of a childless widow. Later rabbinism limited the obligation to a betrothed woman, not yet actually married. But whatever may have been the limitations allowed in these days, the question of the Sadducees took its stand on the old legal basis, and endeavoured to draw therefrom a ridiculous inference. <span class="cmt_word">Shall marry;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>.
