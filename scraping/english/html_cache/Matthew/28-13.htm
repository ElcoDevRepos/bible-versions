This instruction was given to the Roman guards who were responsible for watching the tomb. The religious leaders were concerned about maintaining their authority and preventing the spread of Jesus' teachings. This reflects the ongoing conflict between Jesus and the religious authorities, as seen throughout the Gospels.<p><b>&#8220;You are to say,</b><br>The religious leaders were orchestrating a false narrative. This phrase indicates a deliberate attempt to spread misinformation. It highlights the lengths to which the authorities would go to suppress the truth of the resurrection. This act of deception is reminiscent of other instances in the Bible where truth is opposed by falsehood, such as the lies of the serpent in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>.<p><b>&#8216;His disciples came by night</b><br>The claim that the disciples stole Jesus' body was intended to explain the empty tomb without acknowledging the resurrection. The mention of "by night" suggests secrecy and deceit, playing into the narrative that the disciples were acting unlawfully. This accusation is ironic, given that the religious leaders themselves were engaging in deceit.<p><b>and stole Him away</b><br>The idea of the disciples stealing Jesus' body was implausible, considering the Roman guard and the sealed tomb. This phrase underscores the desperation of the religious leaders to provide an alternative explanation for the resurrection. The notion of theft contrasts with the truth of Jesus' victory over death, as prophesied in scriptures like <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>.<p><b>while we were asleep.&#8217;</b><br>This part of the instruction is particularly problematic, as it implies negligence on the part of the guards, which would have been punishable by death under Roman law. The absurdity of the claim is evident, as sleeping guards would not have been able to witness the alleged theft. This highlights the implausibility of the story and serves to further authenticate the resurrection account by demonstrating the lengths to which the authorities would go to deny it.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests_and_elders.htm">Chief Priests and Elders</a></b><br>Religious leaders in Jerusalem who were responsible for maintaining Jewish law and order.

The very existence of this fabricated explanation, preserved in Scripture, highlights the historical certainty of the empty tomb and, by contrast, the truth that Jesus indeed rose from the dead just as He said.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(13) <span class= "bld">His disciples came by night.</span>--The story was on the face of it self-contradictory. How could they tell, if they had been asleep, who had stolen the body? All that they could know was that they had fallen asleep, and that when they awoke the sepulchre was open and empty.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Say ye,</span> etc. They put the lie into the soldiers' mouth, directing them to answer inquiries in this way. The last resource of an infatuated obstinacy! If they were asleep, how could they know that the disciples stole the body? St. Chrysostom comments well on the infamous transaction, "How did they steal him? O most foolish of all men! For because of the clearness and conspicuousness of the truth, they are not even able to make up a falsehood. For indeed, what they said was highly incredible, and the falsehood had not even speciousness. For how, I ask, did the disciples steal him, men poor and unlearned, and not venturing so much as to show themselves? What? was not a seal put upon it? What? were there not many watchmen and soldiers and Jews stationed round it? What? did not those men suspect this very thing, and take thought, and break their rest, and are in anxiety about it? And wherefore, moreover, did they steal it? That they might feign the doctrine of the resurrection? And how should it enter their minds to feign such a thing - men who were well content to be hidden and to live? And how could they remove the stone that was made sure? How could they have escaped the observation of so many? Nay, though they had despised death, they would not have attempted without purpose and fruitlessly to venture in defiance of so many who were on the watch. And that moreover they were timorous, what they had done before showed clearly: at least, when they saw him seized, all rushed away from him. If, then, at that time they did not dare so much as to stand their ground when they saw him alive, how when he was dead could they but have feared such a number of soldiers?"
