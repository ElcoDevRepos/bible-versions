Confronted with raw, divine authority, they did exactly what the shepherds outside Bethlehem did when angels appeared&#8212;hurried to relay the news (<a href="/luke/2-15.htm">Luke 2:15-17</a>).<p>&#8226; Their flight echoes other moments when humans sense God&#8217;s holiness and feel overwhelmed (<a href="/1_samuel/6-20.htm">1 Samuel 6:20</a>; <a href="/luke/5-8.htm">Luke 5:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>into the town</b><p>&#8226; They did not scatter aimlessly; they went straight to the population center where the greatest number could hear.

Their report was comprehensive, not selective. God calls His people to declare His works without trimming the parts that might unsettle hearers (<a href="/psalms/107-2.htm">Psalm 107:2</a>; <a href="/acts/4-20.htm">Acts 4:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The herdsmen become inadvertent evangelists: they simply state what they saw.
