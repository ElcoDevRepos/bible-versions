This behavior is condemned throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>, where God criticizes those who honor Him with their lips while their hearts are far from Him. Jesus frequently rebukes such hypocrisy, emphasizing the importance of sincerity in worship and service (<a href="/matthew/6.htm">Matthew 6:1-6</a>). The cultural context of first-century Judaism placed a high value on public displays of piety, which could lead to a focus on external appearances rather than genuine faith.<p><b>They broaden their phylacteries</b><br>Phylacteries, or tefillin, are small leather boxes containing Scripture passages, traditionally worn by Jewish men during prayer. The practice is based on <a href="/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8 and 11</a>:18, which command the binding of God's words as a sign on the hand and forehead. By broadening their phylacteries, the religious leaders sought to display their piety more conspicuously, turning a symbol of devotion into a means of self-promotion. This act reflects a misunderstanding of the law's intent, which is to internalize God's commandments rather than merely display them outwardly.<p><b>and lengthen their tassels.</b><br>Tassels, or tzitzit, are fringes worn on the corners of garments, as instructed in <a href="/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38-39</a> and <a href="/deuteronomy/22-12.htm">Deuteronomy 22:12</a>, serving as a reminder of God's commandments. Lengthening the tassels was another way the religious leaders sought to appear more devout than others. This practice underscores the danger of valuing external religious symbols over the heart's true devotion. Jesus Himself wore tassels (<a href="/matthew/9-20.htm">Matthew 9:20</a>), but His life exemplified the fulfillment of the law through love and humility, contrasting with the superficial religiosity of the leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, addressing the crowds and His disciples about the behavior of the scribes and Pharisees.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/scribes_and_pharisees.htm">Scribes and Pharisees</a></b><br>Jewish religious leaders criticized by Jesus for their hypocrisy and outward displays of piety.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/phylacteries.htm">Phylacteries</a></b><br>Small boxes containing Scripture passages, worn by Jewish men during prayer as a sign of devotion.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/tassels.htm">Tassels</a></b><br>Fringes on garments, commanded in the Law of Moses, meant to remind the Israelites of God's commandments.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of Jesus' teaching, a central place of religious activity and authority in Jewish life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_hypocrisy.htm">The Danger of Hypocrisy</a></b><br>Jesus warns against performing religious acts for the sake of appearance.

This was the common meaning of the word in later Greek, and it is hardly likely to have risen among the Hellenistic Jews to the higher sense which has sometimes been ascribed to it, of being a means to keep men in mind of the obligations of the Law. Singularly enough, it is not used by the LXX. translators for the "frontlets" of <a href="/exodus/13-16.htm" title="And it shall be for a token on your hand, and for frontlets between your eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.">Exodus 13:16</a>, <a href="/deuteronomy/6-8.htm" title="And you shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-18.htm" title="Therefore shall you lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign on your hand, that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.">Deuteronomy 11:18</a> and the only place in the Old Testament where it is found is for the "cushions" of <a href="/ezekiel/13-18.htm" title="And say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs on the head of every stature to hunt souls!

This is fastened by a loop to thin leather straps, which are twisted in the one case round the arm, with the box on the heart, in the other, round the head, with the box on the brow. They were worn commonly during the act of prayer (hence the Hebrew name), and by those who made a show of perpetual devotion and study of the Law, during the whole day. The Pharisees, in their ostentatious show of piety, made either the box or the straps wider than the common size, and wore them as they walked to and fro in the streets, or prayed standing (<a href="/matthew/6-5.htm" title="And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.

Acts done professedly in the honour of God were animated by self-seeking and ambition. They never penetrated beyond externalism. See this spirit reproved in the sermon on the mount (<a href="/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1, 2</a>, etc.). "They loved the glory of men more than the glory of God" (<a href="/john/12-43.htm">John 12:43</a>). Christ then gives proofs of this spirit of ostentation in religion and in private life. <span class="cmt_word">Phylacteries</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>: literally, <span class="accented">preservatives</span>; equivalent to "amulets;" the translation of the Hebrew word <span class="accented">tephillin</span>, "prayer fillets." These were either strips of parchment or small cubes covered with leather, on or in which were written four sections of the Law, viz. <a href="/exodus/13-1.htm">Exodus 13:1-10, 11-16</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4-9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13-21</a>. They were worn fastened either to the forehead, or inside the left arm, so as to be near the heart. Their use arose from a literal and superstitious interpretation of <a href="/exodus/13-9.htm">Exodus 13:9</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-8.htm">Deuteronomy 6:8</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-18.htm">Deuteronomy 11:18</a>. Their dimensions were defined by rabbinical rules, but the extra pious formalists of the day set these at naught, and increased the breadth of the strips or of the bands by which they were fastened, in order to draw attention to their religiousness and their strict attention to the least observances of the Law. These phylacteries are still in use among the Jews. Thus in a 'Class Book for Jewish Youth' we read, "Every boy, three months before he attains the age of thirteen, commences to make use of the tephillin, which must be worn at least during the time of the morning prayers. The ordinance of the tephillin is one of the signs of the covenant existing between the Almighty and ourselves, that we may continually bear in mind the miracles God wrought for our forefathers." <span class="cmt_word">Enlarge the borders of their garments;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f31;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">the fringes of their outer garments.</span> The best manuscripts have merely <span class="accented">their fringes.</span> So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">magnificant fimbrias.</span> These fringes or tassels (<span class="accented">zizith, zizijoth</span>) were fastened to the corners of the garments, in accordance with <a href="/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38-41</a>, and were composed of white and blue threads. They were intended to remind the wearers of the commandments of the Lord, and were regarded as peculiarly sacred (see <a href="/matthew/9-20.htm">Matthew 9:20</a>). Christ condemns the ostentatious enlargement of these fringes as a badge of extraordinary piety and obedience. We quote again from the Jewish 'Class. Book:' "Every male of the Jewish nation must wear a garment [not usually an undergarment] made with four corners, having fringes fixed at each corner. These fringes are called <span class="accented">tsetsis</span>, or, memorial fringes. In the synagogue, during the morning prayers, a scarf with fringes attached to it is worn, which is called <span class="accented">tollece</span>, 'scarf or veil.' These memorial fringes typically point out the six hundred and thirteen precepts contained in the volume of the sacred Law.
