According to Jewish law, money associated with sin or wrongdoing was considered tainted and could not be used for sacred purposes.

This acknowledgment by the chief priests underscores the gravity of their actions and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies regarding the Messiah's suffering and betrayal, such as <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3-7</a>.
