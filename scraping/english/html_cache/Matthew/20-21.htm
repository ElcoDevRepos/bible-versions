It reflects Jesus' willingness to engage with those who approach Him, demonstrating His openness and readiness to listen. This interaction occurs as Jesus is on His way to Jerusalem, where He will face crucifixion. The question also serves to reveal the intentions and desires of those who follow Him, highlighting the human tendency to seek personal gain even in spiritual matters.<p><b>She answered, &#8220;Declare that in Your kingdom one of these two sons of mine may sit at Your right hand, and the other at Your left.&#8221;</b><br>The request made by the mother of James and John reflects a misunderstanding of the nature of Jesus' kingdom. In Jewish culture, sitting at the right and left hand of a king was a position of honor and authority. This request indicates a desire for prominence and power, which contrasts with Jesus' teachings on servanthood and humility. The request also shows a lack of awareness of the suffering and sacrifice that Jesus' kingdom entails. This moment is paralleled in <a href="/mark/10-35.htm">Mark 10:35-37</a>, where James and John themselves make the request, emphasizing the ambition and misunderstanding among the disciples.

The passage invites believers to trust God&#8217;s perfect placement rather than pursue self-promotion, confident that He rewards faithfulness in His way and His time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">The one on thy right hand.</span>--The favour which had already been bestowed might, in some degree, seem to warrant the petition. John was known emphatically as "the disciple whom Jesus loved" (<a href="/john/13-23.htm" title="Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.">John 13:23</a>; <a href="/john/19-26.htm" title="When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he said to his mother, Woman, behold your son!">John 19:26</a>; <a href="/john/20-2.htm" title="Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.">John 20:2</a>), and if we may infer a general practice from that of the Last Supper (<a href="/john/13-23.htm" title="Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.">John 13:23</a>), he sat near Him at their customary meals. James was one of the chosen three who had been witnesses of the Transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17-1.htm" title="And after six days Jesus takes Peter, James, and John his brother, and brings them up into an high mountain apart,">Matthew 17:1</a>). Both had been marked out for special honour by the new name of the Sons of Thunder (<a href="/mark/3-17.htm" title="And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:">Mark 3:17</a>). The mother might well think that she was but asking for her sons a continuance of what they had hitherto enjoyed. The sternness of our Lord's words to Peter (<a href="/matthew/16-23.htm" title="But he turned, and said to Peter, Get you behind me, Satan: you are an offense to me: for you mind not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.">Matthew 16:23</a>) might almost justify the thought that his position had been forfeited. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">What wilt thou.</span> Jesus will make no unconditional promise; he compels her to formulate her petition. <span class="cmt_word">Grant</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;</span>: <span class="accented">command</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>These my two sons.</span> She points to them, as they stood or knelt behind her. <span class="cmt_word">May sit... in thy kingdom.</span> The right and left hand would be the places occupied by those next to the sovereign in dignity and consideration. There is here no thought of St. Peter's pre-eminence (comp. <a href="/1_kings/2-19.htm">1 Kings 2:19</a>; <a href="/2_chronicles/18-18.htm">2 Chronicles 18:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>). The petition was urged at this moment, because it was felt that a great crisis was at hand. This visit to Jerusalem must have momentous results; here Jesus was about to set up his throne; now was the moment to secure the highest places in his court. He had announced his death; he had also announced his glory; they balanced one declaration against the other, and seized on that which was most consonant to their national prejudices and their own ambitious views. Probably they interpreted the unintelligible resurrection to mean the establishment of the kingdom of Messiah (<a href="/luke/19-11.htm">Luke 19:11</a>). If this was imminent, no time was to be lost in making their claims known. So thought the "sons of thunder," and acted with energy and haste. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/20-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;What</span><br /><span class="grk">&#932;&#943;</span> <span class="translit">(Ti)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative / Indefinite Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5101.htm">Strong's 5101: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, why.
