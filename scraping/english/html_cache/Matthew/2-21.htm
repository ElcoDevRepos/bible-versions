His actions reflect a pattern of responsiveness to divine guidance, as seen earlier when he took Mary as his wife after an angelic visitation. This obedience is reminiscent of the patriarchs, such as Abraham, who also responded promptly to God's commands.<p><b>took the Child and His mother</b><br>The phrase emphasizes the protective role of Joseph as the guardian of Jesus and Mary. It highlights the family unit's journey, underscoring the importance of family in God's plan.
