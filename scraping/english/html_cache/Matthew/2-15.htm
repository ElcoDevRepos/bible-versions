Herod was known for his tyrannical rule and paranoia, which led to the massacre of the infants in Bethlehem. The family's stay in Egypt fulfilled God's protective plan, as Egypt was a traditional place of refuge for those fleeing danger, evidenced by its role as a sanctuary for the Israelites in earlier biblical narratives.<p><b>This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet:</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the fulfillment of prophecy, a common theme in Matthew's Gospel, which seeks to demonstrate that Jesus is the promised Messiah. The use of prophecy here underscores the divine orchestration of events, showing that Jesus' life was in accordance with God's predetermined plan. The reference to prophecy also serves to connect Jesus' story with the larger narrative of Israel's history.<p><b>&#8220;Out of Egypt I called My Son.&#8221;</b><br>This quotation is from <a href="/hosea/11.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>, originally referring to Israel's exodus from Egypt. In the context of Matthew, it is typologically applied to Jesus, drawing a parallel between Israel as God's "son" and Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of this role. This typology highlights Jesus as the true Israel, who embodies and completes the mission that Israel was meant to fulfill.

It is hard to imagine any reader of the prophecy not seeing that this was what we should call <span class= "ital">the</span> meaning. But the train of thought which leads the Evangelist to apply it to the Christ has a distinct method of its own. A coincidence in what seems an accessory, a mere circumstance of the story, carries his mind on to some deeper analogies. In the days of the Exodus, Israel was the one representative instance of the Fatherhood of God manifested in protecting and delivering His people. Now there was a higher representative in the person of the only begotten Son. As the words "Out of Egypt did I call my Son" (he translated from the Hebrew instead of reproducing the Greek version of the LXX.) rose to his memory, what more natural than that mere context and historical meaning should be left unnoticed, and that he should note with wonder what a fulfilment they had found in the circumstances he had just narrated. Here, as before, the very seeming strain put upon the literal meaning of the words is presumptive evidence that the writer had before him the fact to which it had been adapted, rather than that the narrative was constructed, as some have thought, to support the strained interpretation of the prophecy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And was there until the death of Herod</span>.
