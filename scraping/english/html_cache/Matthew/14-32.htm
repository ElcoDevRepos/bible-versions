The act of climbing back into the boat signifies a return to safety and stability after a moment of divine intervention. The boat can be seen as a symbol of the Church, providing refuge and community for believers. The act of climbing back into the boat also highlights the importance of faith and trust in Jesus, as Peter's initial fear and doubt led to his sinking. This moment emphasizes the need for reliance on Christ, who is always ready to extend a hand to those who call upon Him.<p><b>the wind died down</b><br>The calming of the wind is a demonstration of Jesus' authority over nature, reinforcing His divine power. This event is reminiscent of the calming of the storm in <a href="/matthew/8-23.htm">Matthew 8:23-27</a>, where Jesus rebukes the winds and the sea, and there is a great calm. In both instances, the disciples witness Jesus' control over the elements, which serves to strengthen their faith and understanding of His divine nature. The calming of the wind can also be seen as a metaphor for the peace that Jesus brings into the lives of believers, calming the storms of life and providing assurance of His presence and power.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- The central figure in this passage, demonstrating His divine authority over nature.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter.htm">Peter</a></b><br>- One of Jesus' disciples, who had just attempted to walk on water towards Jesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>- The group of Jesus' followers who were in the boat, witnessing the miracle.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_boat.htm">The Boat</a></b><br>- The vessel carrying the disciples, symbolizing safety and the church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wind.htm">The Wind</a></b><br>- Represents the challenges and trials faced by believers, which are calmed by Jesus.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_authority.htm">Divine Authority</a></b><br>Jesus' ability to calm the wind demonstrates His divine authority and power over creation.

For the most part these mountain squalls died away gradually, and left the waves rough. Here the wind ceased in a moment, and ceased as their Lord entered the boat. And he gives a significant reason for their astonishment, "For they reflected not on the loaves, for their heart was hardened." This was the later analysis which the disciples made of their feelings on that night. Had they understood all the divine creative energy which the miracle of the loaves involved, nothing afterwards, not even the walking on the waves, or the lulling of the storm, would have seemed startling to them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when they were come</span> - <span class="accented">gone up</span> (Revised Version) - <span class="cmt_word">into the ship, the wind</span> <span class="cmt_word">ceased.</span> Apparently not before, so that Peter may still have walked a little further on the water in the midst of the storm, but upheld by the Lord's hand. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/14-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">when</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
