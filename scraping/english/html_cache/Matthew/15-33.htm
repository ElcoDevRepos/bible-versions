Their responses provide insight into their understanding and faith development. Here, their reply reflects a moment of doubt or lack of understanding, which is a recurring theme in the Gospels. This moment is reminiscent of their earlier experiences, such as the feeding of the 5,000, where they also questioned the logistics of feeding a large crowd.<p><b>&#8220;Where in this desolate place</b><br>The setting is significant, as it emphasizes the isolation and lack of resources. The term "desolate place" suggests a wilderness or remote area, which is a common setting for divine provision in the Bible, such as the Israelites receiving manna in the desert (Exodus 16). This setting underscores the miraculous nature of what Jesus is about to do, highlighting His ability to provide abundantly in seemingly impossible circumstances.<p><b>could we find enough bread</b><br>Bread is a staple food and symbolizes sustenance and life. In biblical terms, bread often represents God's provision. The disciples' question reflects a human perspective focused on physical limitations and scarcity. This moment foreshadows Jesus' teaching about being the "bread of life" (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), where He explains that He is the ultimate source of spiritual nourishment.<p><b>to feed such a large crowd?&#8221;</b><br>The mention of a "large crowd" emphasizes the magnitude of the miracle that is about to occur. It highlights the contrast between human inability and divine capability. This crowd, likely numbering in the thousands, represents the widespread need for Jesus' message and provision.

The verse reminds believers to shift from human calculation to confident faith, trusting the One who has already proven His power to provide.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">His disciples say unto him.</span>--Here, on the assumption that we are dealing with a true record, a difficulty of another kind meets us. How was it, we ask, that the disciples, with the memory of the former miracle still fresh in their recollection, should answer as before with the same child-like perplexity? Why did they not at once assume that the same divine power could be put forth to meet a like want now? The answers to that question may, perhaps, be grouped as follows:--(1.) It is not easy for us to put ourselves in the position of men who witnessed, as they did, these workings of a supernatural might. We think of the Power as inherent, and therefore permanent. To them it might seem intermittent, a gift that came and went. Their daily necessities had been supplied, before and after the great event, in the common way of gift or purchase. The gathering of the fragments (<a href="/matthew/14-20.htm" title="And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.">Matthew 14:20</a>; <a href="/john/6-12.htm" title="When they were filled, he said to his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.">John 6:12</a>) seemed to imply that they were not to rely on the repetition of the wonder. (2.) The fact that three days had passed, and that hunger had been allowed to pass on to the borders of exhaustion, might well have led to think that the power was not to be exerted now. (3.) Our Lord's implied question--though, as before, He Himself "knew what He would do" (<a href="/john/6-6.htm" title="And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.">John 6:6</a>)--must have appeared to them to exclude the thought that He was about to make use again of that reserve of power which He had displayed before. They would seem to themselves to be simply following in His footsteps when they answered His question as on the level which He Himself thus appeared to choose.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whence should we have so much bread</span>, etc.? Christ had said nothing to his disciples concerning his design of feeding the people, but his remarks pointed to the possibility of such a design, and the apostles at once throw cold water upon the project. They do not indeed, as they did before urge him to send the multitude away, that they may supply their own needs, but they emphasize the impossibility of carrying out the idea of feeding them. Their answer bristles with objections. The place is uninhabited; the multitude is numerous; the quantity of food required is enormous; and how can <span class="accented">we</span>, poor and needy as we are, help them? It seems to us incredible that they could return this answer, after having, net very long before, experienced the miracle of the feeding of the five thousand. They seemed now to have forgotten the earlier marvel, and to be in utter doubt how the necessary food was to be provided on the present occasion. That Christ would display his miraculous powers appears not to have crossed their minds. Such surprising forgetfulness and slowness of faith have seemed to some critics so unlikely and unusual, that they have regarded the apostles' attitude as confirming their assumption of the identity of the two miracles of feeding. But really such conduct is true to human nature. Calvin, while he condemns in vehement terms the disciples' dulness - "nimis brutum produnt stuporem" - is careful to add that men are always liable to a similar insensibility, prone to forget past deliverance in the face of present difficulty. Immediately after the passage of the Red Sea, the people feared that they would perish of thirst in the wilderness; and when God promised to give them flesh to eat, even Moses doubted the possibility of the supply, and asked whence it could be provided (<a href="/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1</a>, etc.; <a href="/numbers/11-21.htm">Numbers 11:21</a>, etc.). How often did Jesus speak of his sufferings, death, and resurrection! And yet these events came upon believers as a surprise for which they were altogether unprepared. Continually the disciples forgot what they ought to have remembered, drew no proper inferences from what they had seen and experienced, and had to be taught the same lessons repeatedly under different circumstances. Since the first miraculous meal many events had happened; often possibly they had been in want of food, as when on the sabbath day they appeased their hunger with ears of corn plucked by the way, and Christ had worked no miracle for their relief. It did not immediately suggest itself to them to have recourse to their Master in the emergency; they were very far from expecting Divine interposition at every turn. If they thought at all of the former miracle, they may have looked upon it as the outcome of an intermittent power, not always at command, or at any rate not likely to be exercised on the present occasion. They were slow to apprehend Christ's Divine mission and character. The acknowledgment of his Messiahship did net necessarily connote the realization of his Godhead. In the writings of this and the immediately preceding period we see that the great Prophet, Prince, Conqueror, who is to appear, is not God, but one commissioned by God, and at most a God-inspired man or angel. So the apostles were only in unison with the best of their contemporaries when at present they hesitated to believe in, and were incapable of apprehending, the Divine nature of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/15-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
