This reflects the confusion and rumors about Jesus' ministry circulating at the time.

Herod&#8217;s guilt over executing John (<a href="/matthew/14-10.htm">Matthew 14:10</a>) pushes him to talk.<p>&#8226; The servants become witnesses to a ruler&#8217;s fear rather than his confidence, much like Pharaoh&#8217;s court watched his terror when Moses performed signs (<a href="/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often depicts rulers conferring with attendants when overwhelmed&#8212;see King Darius consulting officials about Daniel (<a href="/daniel/6-14.htm">Daniel 6:14-18</a>), or Nebuchadnezzar summoning wise men after his dream (<a href="/daniel/2-1.htm">Daniel 2:1-3</a>). Herod&#8217;s reaction fits that pattern of powerful men being unnerved by spiritual matters.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>This is John the Baptist</b><p>Herod immediately identifies reports about Jesus with the very man he murdered.<p>&#8226; John had confronted Herod&#8217;s adultery (<a href="/matthew/14-3.htm">Matthew 14:3-4</a>), so the memory is fresh and condemning.<p>&#8226; Parallel accounts in <a href="/mark/6-14.htm">Mark 6:14-16</a> and <a href="/luke/9-7.htm">Luke 9:7</a> testify that others thought Jesus might be Elijah or another prophet, but Herod&#8217;s first thought is John.<p>&#8226; John&#8217;s ministry had prepared Israel for Messiah (<a href="/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1-3</a>; <a href="/john/1-23.htm">John 1:23</a>). Even after death, his influence lingers so strongly that Herod cannot imagine anyone else fitting the profile of a miracle-working preacher in Galilee.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he has risen from the dead!</b><p>Herod jumps to a supernatural conclusion.<p>&#8226; Though a Sadducee would deny resurrection (<a href="/acts/23-8.htm">Acts 23:8</a>), Herod, an Idumean by background, still fears it could happen.<p>&#8226; Old Testament precedents&#8212;like the son of the widow of Zarephath revived through Elijah (<a href="/1_kings/17-22.htm">1 Kings 17:22</a>) and the dead man who touched Elisha&#8217;s bones and lived (<a href="/2_kings/13-21.htm">2 Kings 13:21</a>)&#8212;make resurrection conceivable within Jewish history.<p>&#8226; Herod&#8217;s words ironically foreshadow Christ&#8217;s own resurrection, recorded later in <a href="/matthew/28-5.htm">Matthew 28:5-7</a>. God is preparing readers to see that rising from the dead is within His power and plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.</b><p>Herod connects the reported miracles of Jesus with the supposed return of John.<p>&#8226; The expression mirrors <a href="/matthew/11-4.htm">Matthew 11:4-5</a>, where Jesus names the blind seeing and the lame walking as proof of divine authority.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a> later describes Jesus as &#8220;a man attested to you by God with miracles, wonders, and signs,&#8221; matching Herod&#8217;s uneasy acknowledgment that only God&#8217;s power could explain such acts.<p>&#8226; Herod&#8217;s superstition highlights a central biblical truth: miraculous power authenticates God&#8217;s messenger (<a href="/hebrews/2-3.htm">Hebrews 2:3-4</a>). Yet instead of repenting, Herod simply trembles, reminiscent of Felix who &#8220;became afraid&#8221; when Paul spoke of judgment (<a href="/acts/24-25.htm">Acts 24:25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/14-2.htm">Matthew 14:2</a> reveals Herod&#8217;s guilty conscience, his recognition that God&#8217;s power is real, and his fear that judgment is catching up with him. By breaking the verse apart, we see a ruler who confesses more truth than he realizes: God does raise the dead, and miraculous power confirms His servants. Herod&#8217;s dread points us to the certainty and seriousness of divine authority&#8212;and ultimately to the greater resurrection of Jesus Christ, the true source of every miracle.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/14.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">This is John the Baptist.</span>--In <a href="/matthew/16-14.htm" title="And they said, Some say that you are John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.">Matthew 16:14</a>, <a href="/context/luke/9-7.htm" title="Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the dead;">Luke 9:7-9</a>, this is given as one of the three opinions that were floating among the people as to our Lord's character, the other two being, (1) that He was Elijah, and (2) that He was one of the old prophets who had risen again. The policy of the tetrarch connected him with the Sadducean priestly party rather than with the more popular and rigid Pharisees, and a comparison of <a href="/matthew/16-6.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.">Matthew 16:6</a> with <a href="/mark/8-15.htm" title="And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.">Mark 8:15</a> at least suggests the identity of the "leaven of Herod" with that of the Sadducees. On this supposition, his acceptance of the first of the three rumours is every way remarkable. The superstitious terror of a conscience stained with guilt is stronger than his scepticism as a Sadducee, even though there mingled with it, as was probable enough, the wider unbelief of Roman epicureanism. To him the new Prophet, working signs and wonders which John had never worked, was but the re-appearance of the man whom he had murdered. It was more than a spectre from the unseen world, more than the metempsychosis of the soul of John into another body. It was nothing less than John himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And said unto his servants.</span> According to Luke, the following assertion was brought forward by some, but was, it would seem, summarily rejected by Herod (<a href="/luke/9-7.htm">Luke 9:7, 9</a>); according to Mark (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Westcott and Hort, <span class="accented">text</span>) it was common talk, and agreed to by Herod (<a href="/mark/6-14.htm">Mark 6:14, 16</a>). If a reconciliation of so unimportant a verbal disagreement be sought for, it may perhaps lie in Luke representing Herod's first exclamation, and Matthew, with Mark, his settled belief.

Plumptre, on Mark, adduces a curious passage from Persius, 5:180-188, which he thinks is based on a story that when Herod celebrated another of his birthdays (cf. ver. 6) in Rome, in A.D. , he was terrified by a Banquo-like appearance of the murdered prophet. The superstition that already suggested to Herod the resurrection of John might well act more strongly on the anniversary of the murder, and after he had connived at the death of the One who, by his miracles, showed that he possessed greater power than John. <span class="cmt_word">And therefore</span>; "because he is no ordinary man, but one risen from the dead" (Meyer). <span class="cmt_word">Mighty works do show forth themselves in him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>) <span class="accented">do these powers work in him</span> (Revised Version).
