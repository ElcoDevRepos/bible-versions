This area was known for its pagan worship, including a temple dedicated to the Greek god Pan. The region was named after Caesar Augustus and Herod Philip, reflecting Roman influence. The setting is significant as it contrasts the revelation of Jesus' identity with the backdrop of paganism and political power. This location underscores the theme of Jesus' kingdom being distinct from earthly powers.<p><b>He questioned His disciples</b><br>Jesus often used questions to teach and provoke thought among His disciples. This method encouraged them to reflect deeply on their understanding and beliefs. The questioning here is a prelude to a pivotal moment in the Gospel, where Jesus' identity is clarified. It also serves to prepare the disciples for the revelation of His mission and the nature of His kingdom.<p><b>&#8220;Who do people say the Son of Man is?&#8221;</b><br>The title "Son of Man" is significant, appearing frequently in the Gospels. It is a messianic title rooted in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the "Son of Man" is given authority and an everlasting kingdom. By using this title, Jesus connects His mission to Old Testament prophecy, emphasizing His divine authority and role as the Messiah.

There is in all these movements an obvious withdrawal from the populous cities which had been the scene of His earlier labours, and which had practically rejected Him and cast in their lot with His enemies. This last journey took them to a district which He had apparently never before visited, and to which He now came, it would seem, not as a Preacher of the kingdom, but simply for retirement and perhaps for safety. Caesarea Philippi (so called to distinguish it from the town of the same name on the sea-coast) does not appear (unless we identify it with Laish or Dan, and for this there is no sufficient evidence) in the history of the Old Testament. Its position at the foot of Hermon led Robinson (<span class= "ital">Researches,</span> iii. 404, 519) to identify it with the Baal-gad of <a href="/joshua/11-17.htm" title="Even from the mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.">Joshua 11:17</a>; <a href="/joshua/12-7.htm" title="And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even to the mount Halak, that goes up to Seir; which Joshua gave to the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions;">Joshua 12:7</a>; <a href="/joshua/13-5.htm" title="And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the sun rise, from Baalgad under mount Hermon to the entering into Hamath.">Joshua 13:5</a>, or the Baal-hermon of <a href="/judges/3-3.htm" title="Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelled in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon to the entering in of Hamath.">Judges 3:3</a>; but this also hardly extends beyond the region of conjecture. The site of the city was near the chief source of the Jordan, which flowed from a cave which, under the influence of the Greek <span class= "ital">cultus</span> that came in with the rule of the Syrian kings, was dedicated to Pan, and the old name of the city, Paneas, bore witness to this consecration. Herod the Great built a temple there in honour of Augustus (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xv. 10, ? 3), and his son Philip the tetrarch (to whose province it belonged) enlarged and embellished the city, and re-named it in honour of the emperor and to perpetuate his own memory. From Agrippa II. it received the name of Neroneas, as a like compliment to the emperor to whom he owed his title; but the old local name survived these passing changes, and still exists in the modern Baias. With the one exception of the journey through Sidon (<a href="/mark/7-31.htm" title="And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, through the middle of the coasts of Decapolis.">Mark 7:31</a>), it was the northern limit of our Lord's wanderings; and belonging as it does to the same period of His ministry, His visit to it may be regarded, though not as an extension of His work beyond its self-imposed limits, as indicating something like a sympathy with the out-lying heathen who made up the bulk of its population--a sense of rest, it may be, in turning to them from the ceaseless strife and bitterness which He encountered at Capernaum and Jerusalem. How the days passed which were spent on the journey, what gracious words or acts of mercy marked His track, what communings with His Father were held in the solitude of the mountain heights--are questions which we may dwell upon in reverential silence, but must be content to leave unanswered. The incident which follows is the one event of which we have any record. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-20.</span> - <span class="accented">The climax of recognition of Christ's true nature declared in the great confession of Peter.</span> (<a href="/mark/8-27.htm">Mark 8:27-30</a>; <a href="/luke/9-18.htm">Luke 9:18-21</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Coasts</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;</span>); <span class="accented">parts</span>, as <a href="/matthew/15-21.htm">Matthew 15:21</a>, etc. <span class="cmt_word">Caesarea Philippi.</span> The addition to the name <span class="accented">Caesarea is</span> intended to commemorate its restorer and beautifier, the tetrarch Philip, and to distinguish it from the city of the same name on the coast between Joppa and Carmel (<a href="/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>, etc.). Our Lord had landed at Bethsaida, where the Jordan enters the Lake of Gennesaret, turned northwards, and, following the course of the river, had now arrived in the vicinity of one of its chief sources at Caesarea Philippi, the most northerly city of the Holy Land. It was, if not identical with, in close proximity to, the Dan of the Old Testament, whence arose the saying, "From Dan to Beersheba," to denote the whole extent of country from north to south. Later it was called <span class="accented">Paneas</span>, and now <span class="accented">Banias.</span> Philip altered the name to Caesarea in honour of Tiberius Caesar, his patron. Christ seems not to have visited the city itself, but only the outlying villages in the district. We may conjecture why at this Lime he moved to this remote region. It was probably, partly, a measure of precaution. He had excited the fiercest animosity of the dominant party, and even of the sceptical Sadducees; he was pertinaciously followed by their emissaries, always on the watch to lay hold of his words and actions, and to found upon them dangerous charges; and now, knowing it was time to announce to his followers in plain terms his claim to be Messiah, he would not do this in Judaea, where it might cause commotion, and embroil him with the authorities, but preferred to teach this great truth where he might speak freely without fear of immediate consequences, out of the reach of his persevering opponents. Virtually, also, his public work in Judaea and Galilee had reached its end. He had no chance of a hearing if he had made further attempts at teaching. The calumnies of the rabbis had affected the fickle populace, who would willingly have followed a military pretender, but had no heart to set at nought their national teachers in favour of One whom they were persuaded to regard as a dangerous innovator, not improbably upheld by Satanic agency. <span class="cmt_word">He asked his disciples.</span> It was after a time of solitary prayer (<a href="/luke/9-18.htm">Luke 9:18</a>) that he put this question to his followers. Determined now to reveal himself, he desired to make them express the mistaken views which were rife concerning his Person and office, and to lead them to the more important inquiry - what opinion they themselves held touching this momentous mystery (ver. 15). <span class="cmt_word">Whom</span> (<span class="accented">who</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>do men say that I the Son of man am?</span> <span class="accented">Quem dicunt homines esse filium hominis</span> (Vulgate); <span class="accented">Who do men say that the Son of man is?</span> (Revised Version). The versions represent the variation of manuscripts between <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., and <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, omitting <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>. The pronoun is probably genuine and emphatic. In the other case, "the Son of man" is equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span> in ver. 15. I call myself the Son of man: what do the multitudes say of me? Who do they consider the Son of man to be? This was the term he used to show the truth of the Incarnation - "perfect God and perfect man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting." To Jewish ears it connoted Divinity (see <a href="/luke/22-69.htm">Luke 22:69, 70</a>; <a href="/john/3-13.htm">John 3:13</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/16-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">came</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#955;&#952;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Elth&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2064.htm">Strong's 2064: </a> </span><span class="str2">To come, go. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(eis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1519.htm">Strong's 1519: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition; to or into, of place, time, or purpose; also in adverbial phrases.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(ta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
