In biblical times, a talent was a significant sum, often equated to about 20 years of a laborer's wages. This servant represents those given substantial gifts or responsibilities by God. The number five can symbolize grace and responsibility in biblical numerology.<p><b>went at once</b><br>The immediacy of the servant's actions highlights his diligence and eagerness to fulfill his master's expectations. This reflects the biblical principle of prompt obedience, as seen in Abraham's immediate response to God's commands (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>). It underscores the importance of not delaying in using one's God-given gifts.<p><b>and put them to work</b><br>This phrase indicates the servant's proactive approach to stewardship. In the cultural context of the time, investing money was a common practice, often involving trade or lending. The servant's actions align with the biblical call to be fruitful and multiply (<a href="/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>), extending beyond physical offspring to include the multiplication of resources and talents.<p><b>and gained five more</b><br>The doubling of the talents signifies successful stewardship and the blessing of God on diligent efforts. This outcome reflects the biblical principle that faithful service leads to increase, as seen in the parable of the sower (<a href="/matthew/13-23.htm">Matthew 13:23</a>).
