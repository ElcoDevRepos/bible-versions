In ancient cities, gates were often narrow to control access and protect from invaders. This metaphor indicates that entering the kingdom of heaven requires intentionality and effort. The small gate contrasts with the wide gate mentioned earlier in the passage, symbolizing the ease of following worldly desires. This aligns with Jesus' teachings on the need for repentance and transformation (<a href="/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>).<p><b>and narrow the way</b><br>The narrow way implies a path that is restrictive and challenging. In biblical times, roads were often treacherous and required careful navigation. This metaphor suggests that following Christ involves discipline, sacrifice, and adherence to His teachings. The narrow way is reminiscent of the call to take up one's cross and follow Jesus (<a href="/matthew/16-24.htm">Matthew 16:24</a>), emphasizing the cost of discipleship and the need for perseverance.<p><b>that leads to life</b><br>Life here refers to eternal life, a central theme in Jesus' teachings. This life is not just an extension of existence but a quality of life characterized by a relationship with God. The narrow way leading to life contrasts with the broad way leading to destruction, highlighting the ultimate reward for those who choose to follow Christ. This echoes the promise of abundant life found in <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a> and the assurance of eternal life in <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>.<p><b>and only a few find it</b><br>This phrase underscores the reality that not everyone will choose the path of righteousness. The use of "few" indicates that true discipleship is rare and requires a conscious decision to follow Christ. This reflects the biblical theme of the remnant, a faithful minority who remain true to God amidst widespread unbelief (<a href="/romans/11-5.htm">Romans 11:5</a>). It also serves as a warning and a call to evangelism, urging believers to guide others toward the narrow way.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, which is a collection of teachings and sayings of Jesus.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of the Sermon on the Mount, representing followers of Jesus who are learning about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_narrow_gate.htm">The Narrow Gate</a></b><br>A metaphorical representation of the path to eternal life, characterized by its difficulty and exclusivity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_broad_road.htm">The Broad Road</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, it is implied as the alternative path that leads to destruction, as described in the preceding verse.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_heaven.htm">The Kingdom of Heaven</a></b><br>The ultimate destination for those who find and follow the narrow way, representing eternal life with God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_challenge_of_the_narrow_way.htm">The Challenge of the Narrow Way</a></b><br>The path to eternal life is not easy; it requires commitment, sacrifice, and perseverance.

His exclusive claim echoes <a href="/psalms/118-20.htm">Psalm 118:20</a>, where the righteous enter &#8220;the gate of the LORD.&#8221;<p>- A small gate requires intention&#8212;no casual crowd strolls through. Each person must approach personally, confessing Christ as Lord (<a href="/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and narrow the way</b><p>- After the gate comes a &#8220;narrow&#8221; path.

Jesus calls it &#8220;life in all its fullness&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a>).<p>- Eternal life is a present possession that culminates in seeing God face-to-face (<a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>; <a href="/revelation/22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a>).<p>- The contrast is stark: the wide road ends in destruction (<a href="/matthew/7-13.htm">Matthew 7:13</a>), but the narrow way ends in everlasting joy (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>b).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and only a few find it</b><p>- Jesus soberly notes the minority response. While God &#8220;desires all people to be saved&#8221; (<a href="/1_timothy/2-4.htm">1 Timothy 2:4</a>), many reject His provision.<p>- The remnant theme runs through Scripture&#8212;Noah&#8217;s family (<a href="/bsb/genesis/7.htm">Genesis 7</a>), Joshua and Caleb (<a href="/bsb/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14</a>), Elijah&#8217;s 7,000 (<a href="/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>).

The idea is developed as we advance; the life becomes "eternal," and finally we are taught that the eternal life consists in the true and perfect knowledge of God and Christ (<a href="/context/john/17-2.htm" title="As you have given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as you have given him.">John 17:2-3</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Few there be that find it.</span>--The sad contrast between the many and the few runs through all our Lord's teaching. He comes to "save the world," and yet those whom He chooses out of the world are but as a "little flock." They are to preach the gospel, and yet the result will be but discord and division. The picture is a dark one, and yet it represents but too faithfully the impression made, I do not say on Calvinist or even Christian, but on any ethical teacher, by the actual state of mankind around us. They are, for the most part, unconscious of the greatness of their lives, and of the interests at stake in them. If there is any wider hope, it is found in hints and suggestions of the possibilities of the future (<a href="/1_peter/3-19.htm" title="By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;">1Peter 3:19</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-6.htm" title="For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.">1Peter 4:6</a>); in the fact that the words used are emphatically present; in the belief that the short span of this life is not necessarily the whole of the discipline of a soul made for eternity; and that the new life, nascent, and feeble, and stunted here, may be quickened by some new process of education into higher energies.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Because (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>); <span class="accented">for</span> (Revised Version); "many ancient authorities read, <span class="accented">How narrow is the gate</span>, etc." (Revised Version margin).

Observe, Christ does not say, "life eternal." He only cares to emphasize the thought of life in the fullest nature of life - life as "the fulfilment of the highest idea of being: perfect truth in perfect action" (Bishop Westcott, on <a href="/1_john/3-14.htm">1 John 3:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And few there be that</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">and few be they that</span> (ver. 13, note).
