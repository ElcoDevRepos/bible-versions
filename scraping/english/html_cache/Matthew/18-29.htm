This act of prostration indicates the fellow servant's recognition of his subordinate position and his desperation. The imagery of falling down is reminiscent of other biblical instances where individuals fall before a figure of authority or divinity, such as in <a href="/genesis/44-14.htm">Genesis 44:14</a> when Joseph's brothers fall before him. This act of humility is a common theme in Scripture, emphasizing the importance of recognizing one's own limitations and the need for mercy.<p><b>&#8216;Have patience with me</b><br>The plea for patience reflects a common human experience of seeking mercy and time to rectify a wrong. Patience, or longsuffering, is a virtue extolled throughout the Bible, notably in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a> as a fruit of the Spirit. The request for patience highlights the servant's hope for grace and the opportunity to make amends. This mirrors the patience God shows towards humanity, as seen in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, where God is described as patient, not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance.<p><b>and I will pay you back.&#8217;</b><br>The promise to repay the debt underscores the servant's intention to fulfill his obligations, despite his current inability. This reflects the biblical principle of restitution, as seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/22.htm">Exodus 22:1-14</a>, where the law outlines the importance of making amends for wrongs. The servant's commitment to repay also parallels the broader biblical narrative of redemption and restoration, where humanity is called to reconcile with God and others. This phrase can be seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where He pays the debt of sin on behalf of humanity, offering a way for reconciliation and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fellow_servant.htm">The Fellow Servant</a></b><br>This character represents someone who is in debt to another servant.

Compare the plea of the ten lepers: &#8220;Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!&#8221; (<a href="/luke/17-13.htm">Luke 17:13</a>) and the tax collector who &#8220;would not even lift up his eyes to heaven&#8221; (<a href="/luke/18-13.htm">Luke 18:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture repeatedly ties mercy to our response to humble pleas (<a href="/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27&#8211;28</a>; <a href="/james/2-13.htm">James 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Have patience with me</b><p>&#8226; The request is simple: time and longsuffering.
