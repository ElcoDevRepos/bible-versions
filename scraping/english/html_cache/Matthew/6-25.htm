Jesus is speaking with authority, emphasizing His role as a teacher and leader. The use of "therefore" connects this teaching to the preceding verses, where Jesus discusses storing treasures in heaven and serving God rather than wealth. It highlights the importance of trust in God's provision.<p><b>Do not worry about your life</b><br>Jesus addresses the common human concern of anxiety, particularly about basic needs. The Greek word for "worry" implies being divided or distracted, suggesting that worry can pull one away from faith. This command reflects a call to trust in God's sovereignty and care, echoing themes found in the Psalms and Proverbs about God's provision and protection.<p><b>What you will eat or drink</b><br>Food and drink are fundamental human needs, and in the historical context, they were often uncertain due to economic instability and agricultural dependence. Jesus reassures His followers that God, who provides for the birds of the air, will also provide for them. This teaching aligns with the Old Testament accounts of God's provision, such as manna in the wilderness.<p><b>Or about your body, what you will wear</b><br>Clothing, like food and drink, is a basic necessity. In the cultural context of Jesus' audience, clothing was a significant concern due to its cost and the labor involved in making it. Jesus' teaching here challenges His followers to prioritize spiritual over material concerns, trusting that God will meet their physical needs.<p><b>Is not life more than food</b><br>This rhetorical question invites reflection on the deeper meaning and purpose of life. It suggests that life, as a gift from God, encompasses more than mere physical sustenance. This perspective is consistent with biblical teachings that emphasize spiritual well-being and eternal life over temporal concerns.<p><b>And the body more than clothes?</b><br>The body, created in the image of God, holds intrinsic value beyond its physical covering. This statement encourages believers to focus on their spiritual identity and relationship with God. It also points to the resurrection hope, where the body will be transformed and clothed in immortality, as discussed in <a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, a foundational teaching moment in His ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings, representing all believers who seek to follow Christ's teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sermon_on_the_mount.htm">The Sermon on the Mount</a></b><br>A significant event where Jesus taught about the Kingdom of God and righteous living, covering chapters 5-7 of Matthew.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_god.htm">The Kingdom of God</a></b><br>The central theme of Jesus' teachings, emphasizing spiritual priorities over material concerns.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The larger group of listeners who gathered to hear Jesus' teachings, representing the broader audience of His message.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_god's_provision.htm">Trust in God's Provision</a></b><br>Jesus calls us to trust that God, who created life, will also provide for our needs.

Because He has authority, His words carry the weight of command, not mere advice. The connecting &#8220;therefore&#8221; signals that confidence in God&#8217;s rule frees us from anxiety. Trusting Him, as <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a> urges, naturally leads to casting our cares on Him (<a href="/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>) and committing our way to Him (<a href="/psalms/37-5.htm">Psalm 37:5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not worry about your life</b><p>Worry is forbidden because it questions God&#8217;s goodness and sovereignty. Life itself is God-given (<a href="/acts/17-25.htm">Acts 17:25</a>), so the One who created it surely sustains it. <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6-7</a> echoes this, calling believers to trade anxiety for peace through prayer. <a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a> reminds us that God&#8217;s presence removes fear, and <a href="/psalms/55-22.htm">Psalm 55:22</a> promises He will never let the righteous be shaken.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What you will eat or drink</b><p>Daily provision is God&#8217;s responsibility. Jesus just taught us to ask, &#8220;Give us this day our daily bread&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/6-11.htm">Matthew 6:11</a>), affirming our dependence on Him. God supplied manna in the wilderness (<a href="/bsb/exodus/16.htm">Exodus 16</a>) and fed Elijah by the ravens (<a href="/1_kings/17-2.htm">1 Kings 17:2-6</a>). <a href="/psalms/34-10.htm">Psalm 34:10</a> assures that those who seek the LORD lack no good thing. He knows how to meet physical needs one day at a time.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Or about your body, what you will wear</b><p>Clothing, like food, is a legitimate need, yet God covers it. From the first garments for Adam and Eve (<a href="/genesis/3-21.htm">Genesis 3:21</a>) to His care for the lilies that &#8220;neither labor nor spin&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-27.htm">Luke 12:27-28</a>), Scripture shows a Father who dresses His creation with beauty and adequacy. <a href="/2_corinthians/9-8.htm">2 Corinthians 9:8</a> affirms that God makes all grace abound so we have all we need for every good work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?</b><p>Jesus shifts our focus to what ultimately matters. Life&#8217;s purpose transcends physical maintenance; we are made for fellowship with God. <a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a> teaches that we live by every word from His mouth. Christ Himself is the bread of life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>). Setting our hearts on things above (<a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1-4</a>) guards us from reducing existence to consumption.

Because He created and redeemed us, He will faithfully supply daily needs, inviting us to focus on eternal priorities rather than temporary provisions.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(25) <span class= "bld">Take no thought.</span>--The Greek word some times thus translated, and sometimes by "care" or "be careful" (<a href="/context/1_corinthians/7-32.htm" title="But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:">1Corinthians 7:32-34</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-20.htm" title="For I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your state.">Philippians 2:20</a>; <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm" title="Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.">Philippians 4:6</a>), expresses anxiety, literally, the care which <span class= "ital">distracts</span> us. And this was, in the sixteenth century, the meaning of the English phrase "take thought." Of this we have one example in <a href="/1_samuel/9-5.htm" title="And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.">1Samuel 9:5</a>; other examples of it are found in Shakespeare, "<span class= "ital">take thought,</span> and die for Caesar" (<span class= "ital">Julius Caesar,</span> ii. 1), or Bacon (<span class= "ital">Henry the Eighth,</span> p. 220), who speaks of a man "dying with <span class= "ital">thought</span> and anguish" before his case was heard. The usage of the time, therefore, probably led the translators of 1611 to choose the phrase, as stronger than the "be not careful" which in this passage stood in all previous versions. The changing fortune of words has now made it weaker, and it would be better to substitute "over-careful" or "over-anxious." The temper against which our Lord warns His disciples is not that of foresight, which merely provides for the future, but the allowing ourselves to be harassed and vexed with its uncertainties. To "take thought" in the modern sense is often the most effectual safeguard (next to the higher defence of trust in God) against "taking thought" in the older.<p><span class= "bld">For your life.</span>--The Greek word is the same as that commonly rendered "soul," and the passage is interesting as an example of its use in the wider sense which includes the lower as well as the higher life.

But they held their peace.">Mark 3:4</a>, <span class= "ital">et at.</span>) We note in the form of the precept the homeliness of the cases selected as illustration. We hear the language of One who speaks to peasants with their simple yet pressing wants, not to the wider cares of the covetous or ambitious of a higher grade. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-34.</span> - These verses, with the exception of the last, which should perhaps hardly be included, are very similar to the parallel passage, <a href="/luke/12-22.htm">Luke 12:22-32</a>. It seems probable that in the differences Luke preserves the more original form (cf. the notes on the separate verses, <span class="accented">infra</span>). What their original position was is another question. Their immediate sequence in Luke to the parable of the rich fool is no doubt perfectly natural, and is accepted by most commentators as original; but the connexion with the context here is so close that, especially with the probabilities of the case in vers. 22, 23, and ver. 24, St. Matthew <span class="cmt_word"></span> may, after all, have recorded them in their original place. Our Lord says in these verses, "Dare to follow out this warning that I have given you about double service into your daily life. Do not give way to anxiety about the things of life, but look up to God in steady gaze of faith; he will provide." 'Or, more in detail - If God has given you life, shall he not add the food and the clothing (ver. 25)? Anxiety about the support of your life is needless (witness the birds, ver. 26) and powerless (witness the limit of a man's life, ver. 27); while as for clothing, it is equally needless (witness the flowers, ver. 28) and comparatively powerless (witness Solomon's own case, ver. 29). Remember your relation to God (ver. 30). Therefore do not give way to the least anxiety about these things (ver. 31), because this is to fall to the level of the Gentiles, and also because God, whose children you are, knows your needs (ver. 32). But make his cause, without and within, your great object, and all your needs shall be supplied (ver. 33). Therefore be not at all anxious, bear the burden of each day only as each day comes round (ver. 34). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). Because of this fact last mentioned, the impossibility of dividing your service. Cease to be anxious about things of this life, for anxiety about these is a mark of your attempting this impossibility. <span class="cmt_word">I say unto you</span>. Though the absence of the personal pronoun (unlike <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>, etc.) shows that he is not here contrasting himself with them or with others, yet he still emphasizes his authority. <span class="cmt_word">Take no thought</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">be not anxious</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). The translation of the Authorized Version, which was quite correct in its day (cf. also <a href="/1_samuel/9-5.htm">1 Samuel 9:5</a>), is now archaic, and therefore often misunderstood. For the popular derivation of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> ("division," "distraction"), cf. <a href="/1_corinthians/7-33.htm">1 Corinthians 7:33</a>, "But he that is married is anxious for (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1fb7;</span>) the things of the world, how he may please his wife, and is divided (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)." Observe that forethought in earthly matters was practised by our Lord himself (<a href="/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For your life</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). In the Gospels <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> is the immaterial part of man, his personality as we should say, which survives death (<a href="/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>), and is the chief object of a man's care (<a href="/matthew/10-39.htm">Matthew 10:39</a>, where see note). <span class="cmt_word">What ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink</span>. Although the second clause is omitted by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> and a few chiefly "Western" authorities, it is probably genuine, especially as there is no trace of it in Luke (but cf. Westcott and Heft, 'Introd.,' p. 176). <span class="cmt_word">Is not the life more than meat?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> you possess the greater, shall there not be given to you the less?
