This imagery is consistent with the cultural setting of the time, where a master had authority over his servants. The servant symbolizes believers or those who profess to follow Christ. This relationship underscores the accountability of believers to Christ, who is sovereign and will return to judge.<p><b>will come on a day he does not expect</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unexpected nature of Christ's return. It reflects the eschatological theme present throughout the New Testament, where the timing of the Second Coming is unknown (see <a href="/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a>). The unpredictability serves as a warning for constant readiness and vigilance among believers. This aligns with the parable of the ten virgins (<a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25:1-13</a>), which also stresses preparedness for the bridegroom's arrival.<p><b>and at an hour he does not anticipate.</b><br>The repetition of the unexpected timing highlights the urgency and importance of being prepared at all times. This mirrors the cultural practice of first-century Jewish weddings, where the exact time of the bridegroom's arrival was often unknown, requiring the bridal party to be ready at any moment. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of the suddenness of divine intervention, as seen in other biblical events like the flood in the days of Noah (<a href="/matthew/24-37.htm">Matthew 24:37-39</a>). This phrase calls believers to live in a state of spiritual readiness, reflecting the teachings of Jesus about the end times.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_master.htm">The Master</a></b><br>Represents Jesus Christ, who will return at an unexpected time.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Symbolizes believers or those who profess to follow Christ, tasked with responsibilities in His absence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day_and_hour.htm">The Day and Hour</a></b><br>Refers to the unknown time of Christ's second coming, emphasizing the need for constant readiness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/b/be_watchful_and_ready.htm">Be Watchful and Ready</a></b><br>Believers are called to live in a state of readiness, maintaining their faith and commitment to Christ's teachings.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_stewardship.htm">Faithful Stewardship</a></b><br>Like the servant, Christians are entrusted with responsibilities and must be diligent in fulfilling them, knowing they will give an account.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_uncertainty_of_timing.htm">The Uncertainty of Timing</a></b><br>The unpredictability of Christ's return should motivate believers to live each day as if it could be the day of His coming.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoid_complacency.htm">Avoid Complacency</a></b><br>The warning against being caught off guard serves as a reminder to avoid spiritual laziness and to remain active in faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/live_with_eternal_perspective.htm">Live with Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Understanding that Christ's return is imminent should influence daily decisions and priorities, focusing on eternal rather than temporal matters.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_24_50_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 24:50?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Prepare_for_master_s_sudden_return.htm">How can we prepare for the master's unexpected return in Matthew 24:50?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_24_50_Vigilance_readiness.htm">What does Matthew 24:50 teach about the importance of vigilance and readiness?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Matt_24_50_to_10_Virgins_parable.htm">How does Matthew 24:50 connect with the parable of the ten virgins?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_being_unprepared_Matthew_24_50.htm">In what ways can we avoid being "caught unaware" as in Matthew 24:50?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_24_50_s_call_to_daily_faithfulness.htm">How does Matthew 24:50 encourage us to live faithfully in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_24_50_on_Christ_s_return_unpredictability.htm">What does Matthew 24:50 reveal about the unpredictability of Christ's return?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_24_50_s_call_for_readiness.htm">How does Matthew 24:50 challenge believers to live in constant readiness?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_master_s_return_timing_key.htm">Why is the timing of the master's return significant in Matthew 24:50?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_24.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'grace_upon_grace'_mean.htm">What does 'You Cannot Serve Two Masters' mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_is_genesis_24_14_approved.htm">Why is a sign-based approach (Genesis 24:14) seemingly approved here, when similar methods are discouraged in other biblical passages?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/when_did_disciples_see_jesus_in_galilee.htm">When did the disciples return to Galilee?

The &#8220;master&#8221; points unmistakably to Christ Himself (<a href="/luke/12-36.htm">Luke 12:36-40</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11-16</a>). Scripture repeatedly identifies Him as Lord over His people, the One with absolute authority to reward faithfulness or judge negligence (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>). Just as a literal householder possesses every right to hold servants accountable, so the risen Christ will exercise real, visible judgment over every believer and unbeliever alike (<a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>of that servant</b><p>The phrase personalizes the relationship: the servant belongs to the master. It reminds us that we are &#8220;not our own, for [we] were bought at a price&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-19.htm">1 Corinthians 6:19-20</a>). Servanthood in Scripture is never optional; every person serves either righteousness or sin (<a href="/romans/6-16.htm">Romans 6:16-18</a>). The context of <a href="/bsb/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a> distinguishes the faithful servant from the wicked one (vv. 45-49). Those who confess Christ yet live in hypocrisy will discover their accountability is unavoidable (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-17.htm">1 Peter 4:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>will come</b><p>Christ&#8217;s coming is certain, not hypothetical. He Himself promised, &#8220;I will come again&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-3.htm">John 14:3</a>), and the angels echoed, &#8220;This same Jesus&#8230; will come back&#8221; (<a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>). The verb points to a literal, personal return, reinforcing the promise of <a href="/revelation/22-12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>&#8212;&#8220;Behold, I am coming soon.&#8221; For believers, this assurance motivates watchfulness and holy living (<a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2-3</a>). For the careless, it stands as a sober warning (<a href="/hebrews/10-37.htm">Hebrews 10:37</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on a day he does not expect</b><p>Jesus emphasizes surprise. The servant presumes he can predict the master&#8217;s schedule, but the Bible insists the timing remains hidden (<a href="/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a>). Noah&#8217;s generation &#8220;knew nothing&#8221; until the Flood came (vv. 37-39). Cross references echo the theme: &#8220;The day of the Lord will come like a thief&#8221; (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>) and &#8220;in the twinkling of an eye&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>). The faithful therefore cultivate continual readiness rather than occasional spurts of zeal.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and at an hour he does not anticipate</b><p>The warning drills down to the very hour, highlighting how human calculations fail. Jesus repeats the thief imagery in <a href="/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3</a>&#8212;&#8220;If you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know the hour I will come upon you.&#8221; The undisclosed hour keeps believers vigilant in the ordinary rhythms of life (<a href="/luke/21-34.htm">Luke 21:34-36</a>). It also strips away excuses; no one will be able to plead surprise when the Judge appears (<a href="/romans/2-16.htm">Romans 2:16</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/24-50.htm">Matthew 24:50</a> underscores Christ&#8217;s certain, sudden, personal return to evaluate every servant. Because the Master owns us, because He will indeed come, and because His timing is unknowable, continual faithfulness is the only safe and obedient response.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall come,</span> either actually by his appearance, or virtually by calling the guilty soul to judgment. <span class="cmt_word">When he looketh not for</span> <span class="cmt_word">him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1fb7;</span>, <span class="accented">expecteth not</span>).
