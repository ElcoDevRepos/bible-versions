The Magi, wise men from the East, had visited Herod seeking the newborn "King of the Jews." Herod's fear of losing his throne led him to deceitfully ask the Magi to report back to him. However, warned in a dream, the Magi returned home by another route, thus outwitting Herod. This event highlights the divine protection over Jesus and the failure of human schemes against God's plans.<p><b>he was filled with rage</b><br>Herod's reaction is consistent with his historical character. Known for his violent and ruthless nature, Herod had previously executed several family members whom he suspected of treason. His rage here is a manifestation of his fear and insecurity about losing power. This emotional response sets the stage for the tragic events that follow, illustrating the lengths to which Herod would go to eliminate perceived threats.<p><b>Sending orders, he put to death all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity</b><br>Bethlehem, a small town in Judea, is significant as the prophesied birthplace of the Messiah (<a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>). Herod's orders to kill all male children in Bethlehem and surrounding areas reflect his desperation to eliminate Jesus. This massacre, known as the "Massacre of the Innocents," is not recorded in secular history but aligns with Herod's known brutality. The event fulfills the prophecy of Rachel weeping for her children (<a href="/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>), symbolizing the sorrow of Israel.<p><b>who were two years old and under</b><br>Herod's decision to target boys two years old and under was based on the timeline provided by the Magi regarding the star's appearance. This suggests that Jesus could have been up to two years old at the time of the Magi's visit. The age range indicates Herod's attempt to ensure the elimination of the child he perceived as a threat, showing his thoroughness in trying to secure his reign.<p><b>according to the time he had learned from the Magi</b><br>The Magi's visit and their report about the star's timing were crucial in Herod's calculation. This detail underscores the Magi's role in the narrative and the divine orchestration of events. The star, a celestial sign, guided the Magi to Jesus and played a part in fulfilling God's plan, despite Herod's intentions. This phrase highlights the intersection of divine revelation and human action in the unfolding of biblical prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/h/herod_the_great.htm">Herod the Great</a></b><br>The ruling king of Judea at the time of Jesus' birth, known for his tyrannical rule and paranoia about losing his throne.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_magi.htm">The Magi</a></b><br>Wise men from the East who visited Jesus after His birth, seeking the "King of the Jews" and inadvertently alerting Herod to Jesus' existence.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethlehem.htm">Bethlehem</a></b><br>A small town in Judea, prophesied as the birthplace of the Messiah, and the location of the tragic massacre ordered by Herod.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_massacre_of_the_innocents.htm">The Massacre of the Innocents</a></b><br>The event where Herod ordered the killing of all male children two years old and under in Bethlehem, attempting to eliminate the threat to his throne.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, whose birth and early life were marked by divine intervention and fulfillment of prophecy.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sovereignty_of_god.htm">The Sovereignty of God</a></b><br>Despite Herod's evil intentions, God's plan for Jesus' life was not thwarted.

The verse stands as a sober reminder that while evil rages, God&#8217;s purposes stand firm and His Word proves true.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) The fact of the slaughter of the infants of Bethlehem is not mentioned by Josephus, or by any other writer, and has on that ground been called in question. It is admitted, however, on all hands, that it was an act every way in harmony with Herod's character. Tormented with incurable disease, and yet more incurable suspicion; so fiendish in his cruelty, that he gave orders for the execution of many of the leading men of Judaea immediately upon his own death, that there might at least be some genuine mourning at his funeral; making fresh wills, according to the passing passion of the moment; adding, as his last act, the death of yet another son, Antipater, to those of the two sons of Mariamne (so that Augustus was reported to have said that it was better to be "Herod's swine than son"),--it might well be that he gave such a command as this among the cruel and reckless acts of the last months of his life. Nor need we wonder that the act was not recorded elsewhere. The population of Bethlehem could hardly have been more than 2,000, and the number of children under two years of age in that number would be between twenty and thirty. The cruelty of such an act would naturally impress itself on the local memory, from which, directly or indirectly, the Gospel record was derived, and yet escape the notice of an historian writing eighty or ninety years afterwards of the wars and court history of the period. The secrecy which marked the earlier part of Herod's scheme (<a href="/matthew/2-7.htm" title="Then Herod, when he had privately called the wise men, inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.">Matthew 2:7</a>) would extend naturally, as far as Jerusalem was concerned, to its execution.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-18.</span> <span class="accented">- The slaughter of the innocents.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>).

Had he made further inquiries, he might have aroused suspicion, so he made sure of his prey by allowing a wide margin both in time and space. "'On Augustus being informed,' says Macrobius ['Saturn.,' 2:4], 'that among the boys under two years of age whom Herod ordered to be slain in Syria, his own son also lind been slain, "It is better," said he, "to be Herod's pig (<span class="greek">&#x3cb;&#x3bd;</span>) than his son (<span class="greek">&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;</span>)." Although Macrobius is a late writer [circ. 400]. and made the mistake of supposing that Herod's son Antipater, who was put to death about the same time as the massacre of the innocents, had actually perished in that massacre, it is clear that the form in which he narrates the <span class="accented">bon</span> <span class="accented">mot</span> of Augustus points to some dim reminiscence of this cruel slaughter" (Farrar, 'Life,' etc., p. 34, illust. edit.; cf. also Ellicott, 'Lectures,' p. 78). Farrar (and Edersheim accepts his calculation) reckons that not more than twenty children were killed.
