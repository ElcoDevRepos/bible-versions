The context is important as it follows Jesus' discourse on fasting and the new covenant (<a href="/matthew/9-14.htm">Matthew 9:14-17</a>). This setting underscores the immediacy and urgency of the synagogue leader's request, interrupting Jesus' teaching.<p><b>a synagogue leader came and knelt before Him</b><br>The synagogue leader, identified in other Gospels as Jairus, was a person of significant religious and social standing. His act of kneeling demonstrates humility and desperation, acknowledging Jesus' authority and power. This gesture is significant in Jewish culture, where leaders typically held positions of respect and authority.<p><b>&#8220;My daughter has just died,&#8221; he said</b><br>The statement reveals the gravity of the situation. In Jewish culture, death was a profound event, often accompanied by rituals and mourning. The leader's acknowledgment of his daughter's death highlights his faith in Jesus' ability to transcend natural limitations, as resurrection was a divine act.<p><b>&#8220;But come and place Your hand on her, and she will live.&#8221;</b><br>This request reflects a belief in the power of touch, common in Jewish healing practices, where laying on of hands was associated with blessing and healing. The leader's faith is evident, as he believes Jesus' physical presence and touch can restore life, echoing the faith of others who sought Jesus' healing (e.g., the woman with the issue of blood in <a href="/matthew/9-20.htm">Matthew 9:20-22</a>).

Death, humanity&#8217;s ultimate enemy since <a href="/bsb/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3</a>, has struck his home.

Faith expresses itself in specific request: &#8220;place Your hand&#8230; she will live.&#8221;<p>&#8226; His statement reveals a resurrection faith before the cross, affirming <a href="/hebrews/11-1.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>&#8212;&#8220;faith is the assurance of what we do not see.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/9-18.htm">Matthew 9:18</a> presents a grieving father who pushes through crowd, tradition, and despair to lay his impossible need at Jesus&#8217; feet. His kneeling underscores that true authority belongs to Christ; his request shows that death itself must yield to Jesus&#8217; touch. The verse calls believers to the same posture&#8212;confident humility&#8212;trusting that the One who conquered the grave still answers the desperate cry, &#8220;Come&#8230; and she will live.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">While he spake these things.</span>--The sequence seems so clear as, at first, hardly to admit of doubt; and yet it is no less clear that St. Mark and St. Luke represent what is told as following close upon our Lord's return to the western side of the lake after the healing of the Gadarene, and place many events between it and the call of Levi. Assuming St. Matthew's own connection with the Gospel, we may justly, in this case, give greater weight to his order than to the arrangement of the other two, who derived the account from others.<p><span class= "bld">A certain ruler.</span>--St. Mark and St. Luke give the name Jairus, and state that he was "a ruler of the synagogue," probably an elder, or one of the <span class= "ital">Parnasim</span> or "pastors." The fact is interesting as suggesting a coincidence between this narrative and that of the centurion's servant. As a ruler of the synagogue, Jairus would probably have been among the elders of the Jews who came as a deputation to our Lord, and would thus have been impressed with His power to heal in cases which seemed hopeless.<p><span class= "bld">My daughter is even now dead.</span>--St. Luke adds, as one who had inquired into details, that she was the ruler's only child, was twelve years old, and that she "lay a dying," agreeing with St. Mark's "is at the point of death," literally, <span class= "ital">in extremis,</span> "at the last gasp;" and both add that the crowd that followed "thronged" and "pressed" our Lord as He went.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-34.</span> ? 4.
