It emphasizes the divine orchestration of these events, indicating that they were not random but part of a predetermined plan. This aligns with the biblical theme of God's sovereignty and His ability to bring His purposes to fruition, as seen throughout Scripture.<p><b>to fulfill</b><br>The concept of fulfillment is central to the Gospel of Matthew, which frequently highlights how Jesus' life and ministry fulfill Old Testament prophecies. This fulfillment underscores the continuity between the Old and New Testaments, showing that Jesus is the anticipated Messiah who completes the promises made to Israel. The idea of fulfillment also points to the reliability and faithfulness of God in keeping His word.<p><b>what the Lord had said</b><br>This phrase underscores the divine origin of the prophecy, affirming that it is God Himself who speaks through the prophets. It highlights the authority and inspiration of Scripture, as the words of the prophets are not merely human opinions but divine revelations. This is consistent with the biblical view that all Scripture is God-breathed and authoritative for teaching and instruction.<p><b>through the prophet:</b><br>The prophet referred to here is Isaiah, specifically pointing to <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>, which prophesies the virgin birth of the Messiah. This connection to Isaiah is significant because it situates Jesus within the larger narrative of Israel's history and God's redemptive plan. Isaiah's prophecies often contain messianic themes, and this particular prophecy is seen as a type of Christ, prefiguring His miraculous birth and divine nature. The use of prophecy also serves to validate Jesus' identity as the Messiah, as He fulfills the specific criteria laid out in the Hebrew Scriptures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/matthew.htm">Matthew</a></b><br>The author of the Gospel, traditionally identified as one of Jesus' twelve apostles.

Nothing here is legend or embellishment; it truly &#8220;took place.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Scripture often anchors salvation history in concrete happenings (<a href="/luke/2-1.htm">Luke 2:1-7</a>; <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>), reminding us that God&#8217;s redemptive work unfolds in time and space.<p>&#8226; By recording it as completed fact, Matthew underscores God&#8217;s sovereignty: the birth of Jesus was never an afterthought but part of a deliberate plan &#8220;determined by God&#8217;s set purpose and foreknowledge&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to fulfill</b><p>&#8226; God acts with purpose: every detail of Jesus&#8217; birth was aimed at &#8220;fulfill[ing]&#8221; promises made centuries earlier. Fulfillment threads run throughout Matthew (2:15; 2:17; 4:14; 5:17), showing Jesus as the long-anticipated Messiah.<p>&#8226; This word signals continuity between Old and New Testaments; what God promises, He completes (<a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Fulfillment also confirms the reliability of prophecy&#8212;just as Jesus later affirmed, &#8220;Everything written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms must be fulfilled&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>what the Lord had said</b><p>&#8226; Prophecy originates with God Himself, not human speculation (<a href="/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>).

That word, spoken by the Lord Himself &#8220;through the prophet,&#8221; proves Scripture&#8217;s dependability and God&#8217;s faithfulness.
