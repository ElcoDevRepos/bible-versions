His role was to prepare the way for the Messiah, calling people to repentance. In this context, John was addressing Herod Antipas, the tetrarch of Galilee and Perea. Herod was known for his immoral lifestyle and political ambition. John's repeated confrontation with Herod highlights his commitment to righteousness and his fearless proclamation of God's law, even to those in power. This reflects the prophetic tradition of holding leaders accountable to God's standards, as seen with prophets like Nathan confronting King David.<p><b>&#8220;It is not lawful for you to have her.&#8221;</b><br>John was referring to Herod's marriage to Herodias, his brother Philip's wife. According to Levitical law (<a href="/leviticus/18-16.htm">Leviticus 18:16</a>; 20:21), such a union was considered unlawful and incestuous. Herodias had divorced Philip to marry Herod, which was a violation of Jewish law and customs. This situation exemplifies the moral decay and disregard for God's commandments prevalent among the ruling class of the time. John's rebuke is consistent with the biblical theme of upholding God's law against cultural and personal compromise. This confrontation ultimately led to John's imprisonment and execution, illustrating the cost of prophetic truth-telling. John's stance also prefigures the call for believers to stand firm in truth, regardless of the consequences, echoing the teachings of Jesus on the cost of discipleship.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>A prophet and forerunner of Jesus Christ, known for his boldness in speaking God's truth.
