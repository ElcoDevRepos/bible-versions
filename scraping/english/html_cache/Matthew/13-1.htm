The context involves Jesus' growing ministry and the increasing opposition from religious leaders. The same day refers to a period of intense teaching and confrontation, highlighting the urgency and importance of Jesus' message.<p><b>Jesus went out of the house</b><br>The house may symbolize a place of private teaching or rest, possibly Peter's house in Capernaum, which served as a base for Jesus' ministry in Galilee. Leaving the house signifies a transition from private instruction to public teaching, emphasizing Jesus' mission to reach the broader population.<p><b>and sat by the sea</b><br>The sea refers to the Sea of Galilee, a central location in Jesus' ministry. Sitting was the traditional posture of a teacher in Jewish culture, indicating that Jesus was preparing to teach. The Sea of Galilee's natural amphitheater-like setting provided an ideal location for addressing large crowds, and its mention underscores the geographical and cultural context of Jesus' ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, Jesus is the Son of God and the Messiah.

By saying &#8220;That same day,&#8221; the Spirit highlights continuity:<p>&#8226;&#8194;No gap separates Jesus&#8217; words on spiritual kinship from the teaching He is about to give in parables.<p>&#8226;&#8194;The crowds who witnessed those earlier miracles and heard His strong warnings (<a href="/matthew/12-41.htm">Matthew 12:41-42</a>) are likely the very ones now gathering again.<p>&#8226;&#8194;As <a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a> reminds us, God often presses for response &#8220;now,&#8221; not later; Matthew shows that Jesus does the same, pushing listeners to choose while the moment is hot.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus went out of the house</b><p>Jesus physically moves from a house&#8212;probably the one in Capernaum that served as His home base (cf. <a href="/mark/2-1.htm">Mark 2:1</a>)&#8212;to an outdoor setting. This shift carries layers of meaning:<p>&#8226;&#8194;From private to public: Much as He had stepped outside to speak to the crowds about His true family (<a href="/matthew/12-46.htm">Matthew 12:46-50</a>), He now steps outside to reach even more ears.<p>&#8226;&#8194;From confined walls to open accessibility: <a href="/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a> foresaw Messiah&#8217;s light extending &#8220;to the ends of the earth&#8221;; leaving the house pictures that widening reach.<p>&#8226;&#8194;From tension indoors to invitation outdoors: Inside, religious leaders had accused Him; outside, He meets common people eager for hope (cf. <a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>).<p>Practical takeaway: When opposition stiffens, Jesus doesn&#8217;t retreat&#8212;He simply finds another venue. <a href="/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4</a> shows the early church doing the same, scattering yet still speaking.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and sat by the sea</b><p>Rabbinic teachers often sat to teach (<a href="/matthew/5-1.htm">Matthew 5:1-2</a>), signaling authority and deliberateness.

The verse models urgency in witness, flexibility in method, and gracious accessibility to all who will hear.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XIII.</span><p>(1, 2) <span class= "bld">The same day . . . out of the house.</span>--In St. Mark the parable of the Sower follows the appearance of the mother and the brethren, as in St. Matthew, but in St. Luke (<a href="/context/luke/8-4.htm" title="And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spoke by a parable:">Luke 8:4-15</a>; <a href="/context/luke/8-19.htm" title="Then came to him his mother and his brothers, and could not come at him for the press.">Luke 8:19-21</a>) the order is inverted. In this case the order of the first Gospel seems preferable, as giving a more intelligible sequence of events. The malignant accusation of the Pharisees, the plots against His life, the absence of real support where He might most have looked for it, the opposition roused by the directness of His teaching--this led to His presenting that teaching in a form which was at once more attractive, less open to attack, better as an intellectual and spiritual training for His disciples, better also as a test of character, and therefore an education for the multitude.<p>That our Lord had been speaking in a house up to this point is implied in the "standing without" of <a href="/matthew/12-46.htm" title="While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood without, desiring to speak with him.">Matthew 12:46</a>. He now turns to the crowd that followed, and lest the pressure should interrupt or might occasion--as the feeling roused by the teaching that immediately preceded made probable enough--some hostile attack, He enters a boat, probably with a few of His disciples, puts a few yards of water between Himself and the crowd, and then begins to speak.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-9.</span> - <span class="accented">The parable of the sower.</span> Parallel passages: <a href="/mark/4-1.htm">Mark 4:1-9</a>; <a href="/luke/8-4.htm">Luke 8:4-8</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The same day</span>; <span class="accented">on that day</span> (Revised Version). Although <span class="accented">day</span> is sometimes used in a metaphorical sense, so as to include what is, in fact, a long period of time (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/luke/6-23.htm">Luke 6:23</a>; <a href="/mark/2-20.htm">Mark 2:20</a>; cf. also <a href="/john/14-20.htm">John 14:20</a>; <a href="/john/16-23.htm">John 16:23, 26</a>; and possibly even <a href="/acts/8-1.htm">Acts 8:1</a>), yet we are not justified in assigning this sense to it unless the context clearly requires us to do so. This is not the case here, so that we must assume that a literal day is intended. But which day? Naturally, the day that has just before been mentioned, either in the original source from which our narrative is taken or in the narrative as it now stands. Since, however, <a href="/matthew/12-46.htm">Matthew 12:46-50</a> and our vers. 1-23 appear to have been already connected in the framework (as is seen from their being in the same relative position in Mark), these supposed alternatives really represent the same thing, the phrase probably referring to the day on which our Lord's mother and brethren sought to speak to him (<a href="/matthew/12-46.htm">Matthew 12:46</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Went Jesus out of the house.</span> Where he had been when his mother came (<a href="/matthew/12-46.htm">Matthew 12:46</a>, note), and presumably the one to which he returned in ver. 36.
