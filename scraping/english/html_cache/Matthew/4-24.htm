The spread of news about Jesus indicates the rapid dissemination of His fame beyond Jewish territories, highlighting the early reach of His ministry. This foreshadows the later mission to the Gentiles and fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, which speaks of a great light shining in Galilee of the Gentiles. The mention of Syria underscores the geographical and cultural diversity of those who were drawn to Jesus.<p><b>and people brought to Him all who were ill with various diseases</b><br>The act of bringing the sick to Jesus demonstrates the faith and desperation of the people seeking healing. In the cultural context, illness was often seen as a result of sin or spiritual affliction, and the ability to heal was a sign of divine authority. This phrase emphasizes Jesus' role as the Great Physician, fulfilling the messianic expectations of one who would bear our infirmities, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a>.<p><b>those suffering acute pain</b><br>Acute pain could refer to both physical and emotional suffering. In a time without modern medicine, chronic pain was a significant burden. Jesus' healing of such conditions illustrates His compassion and power over human suffering, aligning with His mission to bring relief and restoration to a broken world.<p><b>the demon-possessed</b><br>Demon possession was a recognized condition in the ancient world, often associated with mental and physical afflictions. Jesus' authority over demons is a testament to His divine power and the inbreaking of God's kingdom, as He liberates individuals from spiritual bondage. This act fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a>, where the seed of the woman would crush the serpent's head, symbolizing victory over evil.<p><b>those having seizures</b><br>Seizures, often misunderstood in ancient times, were sometimes attributed to demonic influence. Jesus' healing of those with seizures demonstrates His authority over both natural and supernatural realms. This act of healing reflects His compassion and the holistic nature of His ministry, addressing both physical and spiritual needs.<p><b>and the paralyzed</b><br>Paralysis was a debilitating condition that left individuals dependent on others. Jesus' healing of the paralyzed not only restored physical mobility but also symbolized spiritual liberation and forgiveness of sins, as seen in the healing of the paralytic in <a href="/matthew/9.htm">Matthew 9:1-8</a>. This act points to Jesus' authority to forgive sins and His role as the one who makes all things new.<p><b>and He healed them</b><br>The comprehensive nature of Jesus' healing ministry is highlighted here. His ability to heal all manner of diseases and afflictions confirms His identity as the Messiah and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the coming of a healer and redeemer. This phrase encapsulates the hope and restoration that Jesus brings, serving as a foretaste of the ultimate healing and restoration in the kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, performing miraculous healings and exorcisms.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/syria.htm">Syria</a></b><br>A region north of Israel, indicating the widespread fame of Jesus' ministry beyond Jewish territories.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sick_and_afflicted.htm">The Sick and Afflicted</a></b><br>Individuals suffering from various physical and spiritual ailments, brought to Jesus for healing.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/demon-possessed.htm">Demon-Possessed</a></b><br>People under the influence of evil spirits, whom Jesus delivered.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_paralyzed.htm">The Paralyzed</a></b><br>Individuals unable to move, whom Jesus restored to health.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_compassion_of_christ.htm">The Compassion of Christ</a></b><br>Jesus' willingness to heal all who came to Him demonstrates His deep compassion for human suffering.
