The use of "once again" indicates a continuation of teaching about the kingdom, which is a central theme in Jesus' ministry. The "net" symbolizes the method of gathering people into the kingdom, reflecting the inclusive nature of the gospel message. In the context of first-century Palestine, fishing was a common occupation, making this imagery relatable to Jesus' audience, many of whom were familiar with fishing practices.<p><b>that was cast into the sea</b><br>The "sea" often represents the world in biblical symbolism. Casting the net into the sea suggests the outreach of the gospel to all nations and peoples, fulfilling the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>). The act of casting implies intentionality and effort in spreading the message of the kingdom. Historically, the Sea of Galilee was a significant location for fishing, and Jesus' disciples, some of whom were fishermen, would have understood the practical aspects of this metaphor.<p><b>and caught all kinds of fish.</b><br>The phrase "all kinds of fish" highlights the diversity of people who are drawn into the kingdom. This reflects the universal call of the gospel, transcending ethnic, social, and cultural boundaries. It aligns with the prophetic vision of a kingdom comprising people from every nation (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). The variety of fish also suggests a future sorting or judgment, as not all who are gathered will be part of the final kingdom, a theme further developed in the subsequent verses of the parable.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of the parable, teaching His disciples and the crowds about the kingdom of heaven through parables.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_heaven.htm">The Kingdom of Heaven</a></b><br>A central theme in Jesus' teachings, representing God's sovereign rule and the spiritual realm where His will is fulfilled.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_net.htm">The Net</a></b><br>Symbolizes the gospel message and the outreach of God's kingdom, gathering people from all walks of life.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>Represents the world, filled with diverse people and nations.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fish.htm">The Fish</a></b><br>Symbolize the people who are drawn into the kingdom through the gospel, representing a variety of responses to God's call.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inclusivity_of_the_gospel.htm">The Inclusivity of the Gospel</a></b><br>The net gathers all kinds of fish, illustrating that the gospel is for everyone, regardless of background or status.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_reality_of_judgment.htm">The Reality of Judgment</a></b><br>Just as fish are sorted, there will be a time of judgment where true believers are distinguished from those who are not.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_evangelism.htm">The Urgency of Evangelism</a></b><br>The casting of the net signifies the active role believers must take in sharing the gospel with the world.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/diversity_in_the_kingdom.htm">Diversity in the Kingdom</a></b><br>The variety of fish represents the diversity within the body of Christ, highlighting the beauty of unity amidst diversity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_the_end_times.htm">Preparation for the End Times</a></b><br>Believers are called to live with an awareness of the coming judgment, ensuring their lives reflect their faith in Christ.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_13_47_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 13:47?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matt_13_47_Heaven_s_inclusivity_judgment.htm">How does Matthew 13:47 illustrate the Kingdom of Heaven's inclusivity and final judgment?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_the_net_teach_about_God_s_patience.htm">What can we learn about God's patience from the net gathering all kinds?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Matthew_13_47_to_wheat_tares.htm">How does Matthew 13:47 connect with the parable of the wheat and tares?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_engage_in_God_s_kingdom_work.htm">In what ways can we actively participate in God's kingdom work today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Matt_13_47_on_evangelism.htm">How should Matthew 13:47 influence our approach to evangelism and discipleship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_net_parable_in_God_s_kingdom.htm">What does the parable of the net in Matthew 13:47 symbolize about God's kingdom?

As in <a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24, 31, and 33</a>, He stacks parables one after another, each shedding new light on the same reality. Repetition invites us to lean in, knowing this is another facet of the same diamond. Just as Paul &#8220;reminds&#8221; the church for their safety (<a href="/philippians/3-1.htm">Philippians 3:1</a>), Jesus repeats Himself for ours.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>the kingdom of heaven is like</b><p>The comparison isn&#8217;t about heaven&#8217;s location but heaven&#8217;s reign breaking into earth (cf. <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-10.htm">Matthew 6:10</a>). Every parable in this chapter lays out how that reign moves, grows, and judges. Here, the kingdom is not compared to a castle but to something active&#8212;something that goes out and gathers.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a net</b><p>The picture is a large dragnet&#8212;broad, unavoidable, impartial. Earlier Jesus promised His disciples, &#8220;Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19</a>). That call now comes into focus: the gospel is the net; His followers help throw it wide. God used similar imagery when He spoke of catching rebellious nations (<a href="/ezekiel/32-3.htm">Ezekiel 32:3</a>). The net&#8217;s reach shows the kingdom&#8217;s agenda is expansive, never provincial (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that was cast into the sea</b><p>The sea in Scripture often pictures the restless mass of humanity (<a href="/isaiah/57-20.htm">Isaiah 57:20</a>; <a href="/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a>). The casting is deliberate; the kingdom message does not wait for people to come to it, it goes after them (<a href="/romans/10-14.htm">Romans 10:14&#8211;15</a>). Just as Noah&#8217;s flood covered the earth, this net sweeps through the same arena&#8212;human history&#8212;yet this time offering rescue before judgment (<a href="/2_peter/3-5.htm">2 Peter 3:5&#8211;9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and caught all kinds of fish</b><p>The gospel invitation is radically inclusive (<a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>). Good and bad, big and small, every ethnicity and background end up in the net. But inclusion is not the end of the story&#8212;verses 48&#8211;50 reveal the sorting. Just as in the parable of the wheat and weeds (<a href="/matthew/13-30.htm">Matthew 13:30</a>) and the sheep and goats (<a href="/matthew/25-32.htm">Matthew 25:32</a>), final separation belongs to God. For now, our task mirrors the net: proclaim widely, without prejudice, trusting that &#8220;everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved&#8221; (<a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/13-47.htm">Matthew 13:47</a> paints the kingdom as an active, sweeping dragnet. Christ&#8217;s message goes out repeatedly, reaches everywhere, and gathers everyone. While the net is gathering today, mercy is available; a sorting day will come. Our part is to keep casting, confident that Scripture&#8217;s promise stands sure and literal: the kingdom of heaven truly is at work, embracing the whole sea of humanity right now.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(47) <span class= "bld">The kingdom of heaven is like unto a net.</span>--The net in this case is not the hand-net of <a href="/matthew/4-18.htm" title="And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.">Matthew 4:18</a>, but the <span class= "ital">sagene,</span> or great drag-net, which drew in a larger haul of fishes. The day's teaching in the method of parables ends, as it were, in an easy lesson, which the former experience of the disciples would enable them to understand. Still, as in the parable of the Tares, the main thoughts are, (1) the mingling of the evil with the good in the visible kingdom of Christ on earth, and (2) the ultimate separation of the two, that each may receive according to the divine law of retribution. Here, as there, the parable perforce passes over the fact that in the actual work of the kingdom the very casting of the net may change, and is meant to change, the nature of the fish that are taken in its meshes, and, therefore, that those that remain "bad" are so in the end by the result of their own will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 47-50.</span> - <span class="accented">The parable of the dragnet.</span> This parable at once recalls that of the tares, but it will be noticed that there our Lord's aim is to inculcate patience and hopefulness on the part of his servants when they realize the close proximity of the ungodly even in districts won over to the faith, while here his aim is rather to warn. To be in the kingdom is not enough; some of those now within it may nevertheless be cast out. It thus greatly resembles the parable of the ten virgins; save that in that parable greater stress is laid on personal preparation and continued watchfulness; in this, on personal worth. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x1fc3;</span>: <a href="/matthew/4-18.htm">Matthew 4:18</a>, note), <span class="cmt_word">that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind.</span> (For the thought, cf. <a href="/matthew/22-10.htm">Matthew 22:10</a>; and for the word, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, ver. 30, note.) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/13-47.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Once again,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#940;&#955;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Palin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3825.htm">Strong's 3825: </a> </span><span class="str2">Probably from the same as pale; anew, i.e. back, once more, or furthermore or on the other hand.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7969;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
