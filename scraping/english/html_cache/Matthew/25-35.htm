In biblical times, hunger was a common issue due to frequent famines and economic instability. The act of feeding the hungry is a tangible expression of love and obedience to God's commandments, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/58-7.htm">Isaiah 58:7</a>, which calls for sharing food with the hungry. This act of kindness is also a reflection of the provision God made for the Israelites in the wilderness with manna (Exodus 16). It serves as a reminder of Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/4-4.htm">Matthew 4:4</a>, where He emphasizes that man does not live by bread alone but by every word from God, pointing to the spiritual nourishment that complements physical sustenance.<p><b>I was thirsty and you gave Me something to drink</b><br>Providing water to the thirsty is another basic act of kindness that Jesus commends. In the arid climate of the Middle East, access to water was crucial and often difficult, making this act of charity significant. This phrase can be connected to the story of Jesus and the Samaritan woman at the well in <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4</a>, where Jesus offers "living water" that quenches spiritual thirst. The act of giving water symbolizes the refreshment and life that Jesus offers to all who believe in Him. It also reflects the prophetic imagery in <a href="/isaiah/55.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>, inviting those who are thirsty to come to the waters, symbolizing God's provision and salvation.<p><b>I was a stranger and you took Me in</b><br>Hospitality was a highly valued virtue in ancient cultures, including Jewish society. Taking in a stranger was not only a social expectation but also a reflection of God's command to love the foreigner, as seen in <a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a>. This phrase underscores the importance of welcoming and caring for those who are outsiders or marginalized. It echoes the story of Abraham, who showed hospitality to three strangers, unaware that they were divine messengers (Genesis 18). In the New Testament, this principle is reinforced in <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a>, which encourages believers to show hospitality to strangers, as some have entertained angels without knowing it. This act of kindness is a reflection of God's inclusive love and the welcoming nature of the Kingdom of Heaven.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is teaching about the final judgment and the importance of serving others as a reflection of serving Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing all believers who are called to live out these principles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hungry,_thirsty,_and_strangers.htm">The Hungry, Thirsty, and Strangers</a></b><br>Symbolic of those in need, representing the broader category of people who require compassion and assistance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sheep_and_the_goats.htm">The Sheep and the Goats</a></b><br>In the broader context of <a href="/bsb/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25</a>, these represent the righteous and the unrighteous, respectively, at the final judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom_of_heaven.htm">The Kingdom of Heaven</a></b><br>The ultimate place of reward for those who have lived according to Jesus' teachings, including acts of mercy and compassion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_as_a_reflection_of_faith.htm">Compassion as a Reflection of Faith</a></b><br>True Christian faith is evidenced by acts of compassion and mercy.

Meeting others&#8217; thirst honors the One who thirsted for us.<p>Practical steps:<p>&#8211; Keep bottled water in your car for those who may be in need.<p>&#8211; Partner with ministries drilling wells in water-scarce regions; see the principle of blessing in <a href="/genesis/26-25.htm">Genesis 26:25</a>.<p>&#8211; Offer conversation alongside refreshment; physical care opens doors for sharing &#8220;living water.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I was a stranger and you took Me in</b><p>Finally, Jesus says, &#8220;I was a stranger and you took Me in,&#8221; addressing the need for belonging and safety.<p>&#8226; Throughout Scripture, God instructs His people to welcome outsiders. <a href="/leviticus/19-34.htm">Leviticus 19:34</a>: &#8220;The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born.

Feeding the hungry, giving drink to the thirsty, and welcoming the stranger are not optional extras but essential evidences of a faith that recognizes Jesus in the least of these. When we meet physical and relational needs, we reflect the heart of our Savior, affirm His lordship, and lay up treasure in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm">Matthew 6:19-21</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">I was an hungred.</span>--The passage furnishes six out of the list of the seven corporal works of mercy in Christian ethics, the seventh being found in the care and nurture of the fatherless.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For</span>. Jesus here gives the reason which influences him in conferring this great boon on "the sheep" of his flock. He instances certain works of mercy which they performed during their earthly pilgrimage, as examples of the kind of acts which he deems worthy of eternal reward. It is not that he regards no other with favour, but these six works, as they show the temper and virtue of the door, are taken as the type of those which are approved. They are proofs of self-denial, pity, sympathy, charity; they demonstrate that the doer has something of God in him, that according to his lights he possesses and has exercised the supreme grace of love. The Lord confined himself to one detail; he does not disparage other requirements necessary for salvation, as faith, prayer, sacraments, chastity, truth, honesty; but he looks on one particular class of works as the great result of all the aids and provocatives offered by his Spirit, and herein sets forth the principle by which judgment is guided, and which can be applied universally. The Judge asks not what we have felt or thought, but what we have done or left undone in our dealings with others. "It is plain," says Bishop Bull ('Harm. Ap.,' diss. 1:5. 4), "that our works are considered as the very things on account of which (by the merciful covenant of God through Christ) eternal lifo is given us." He quotes Vossius ('De Bon. Op.,' 10): "It is asked whether a reward is promised to works as signs of faith? Now, we conceive they say too much who suppose it promised to works as deserving it, and that they say too little who think it promised to them only as signs of faith. For there are many passages of Scripture where it is shown that our works, in the business of salvation, are regarded as indispensably requisite, or as a primary condition, to which the reward of eternal life is inseparably connected." <span class="cmt_word">I was an hungred,</span> equivalent to "very hungry" (<a href="/matthew/12-1.htm">Matthew 12:1</a>). Christ enumerates the chief of what are called the corporal works of mercy, omitting burial of the dead (see on ver. 36). We may note here an argument <span class="accented">a fortiori</span>: if such simple acts (comp. <a href="/matthew/10-42.htm">Matthew 10:42</a>) meet with so great a reward, what shall he the portion of those who are enabled to rise to more perfect obedience and higher degrees of devotion and self-sacrifice? <span class="cmt_word">Ye took me in</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>) <span class="accented">i.e.</span> into your houses, received me with hospitality, or as one of your own family.
