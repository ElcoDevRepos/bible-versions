It underscores the certainty and authority of His words. In the Gospels, Jesus frequently uses this expression to introduce significant teachings or prophecies, highlighting His role as a divine teacher and prophet.<p><b>he will put him in charge</b><br>This part of the verse speaks to the reward of faithful service. In the context of <a href="/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a>, Jesus is discussing the end times and the importance of being vigilant and faithful. The imagery of being put in charge suggests a position of authority and responsibility, reflecting the biblical principle that those who are faithful with little will be entrusted with much (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>). This also connects to the parable of the talents in <a href="/matthew/25.htm">Matthew 25</a>, where faithful servants are rewarded with greater responsibilities.<p><b>of all his possessions</b><br>This phrase indicates the extent of the reward for the faithful servant. In biblical times, being entrusted with all of a master's possessions was a sign of great trust and honor. It reflects the ultimate reward for believers who remain faithful to Christ, pointing to the eschatological promise of sharing in Christ's kingdom and glory. This can be seen as a type of the believer's inheritance in Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a>, where believers are described as co-heirs with Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Olivet Discourse, a prophetic teaching about the end times and the coming of the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/f/faithful_and_wise_servant.htm">Faithful and Wise Servant</a></b><br>The subject of the parable preceding this verse, representing those who are faithful in their duties and responsibilities.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/master.htm">Master</a></b><br>Represents God or Christ, who entrusts His servants with responsibilities and rewards them for their faithfulness.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/possessions.htm">Possessions</a></b><br>Symbolic of the blessings and responsibilities in God's Kingdom, entrusted to the faithful servant.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/olivet_discourse.htm">Olivet Discourse</a></b><br>The setting of this teaching, where Jesus speaks to His disciples on the Mount of Olives about future events.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_stewardship.htm">Faithfulness in Stewardship</a></b><br>God values faithfulness in the responsibilities He entrusts to us.

Whenever He says, &#8220;Truly I tell you,&#8221; He is underlining absolute certainty (<a href="/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>; <a href="/john/3-3.htm">John 3:3</a>). The Lord wants His disciples to feel the weight of what follows&#8212;this is not a suggestion but a promise. As in <a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>, God never lies, and here the incarnate Son speaks with the same divine authority.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He will put him</b><p>The &#8220;he&#8221; is the master in the parable (<a href="/matthew/24-45.htm">Matthew 24:45-46</a>), foreshadowing Christ Himself at His return. The faithful servant (v. 45) is rewarded by the master&#8217;s personal action&#8212;&#8220;he will put him.&#8221; Scripture echoes this pattern of divine appointment: <a href="/luke/12-42.htm">Luke 12:42-44</a> records the same promise, while <a href="/1_timothy/1-12.htm">1 Timothy 1:12</a> reminds us that Christ &#8220;appointed&#8221; Paul to service. God Himself is the One who promotes the faithful, just as <a href="/psalms/75-6.htm">Psalm 75:6-7</a> says exaltation comes from the Lord.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In charge</b><p>To be &#8220;in charge&#8221; means entrusted with authority and responsibility. Joseph&#8217;s life in <a href="/genesis/39-4.htm">Genesis 39:4</a> illustrates this: Potiphar &#8220;put him in charge&#8221; of his house. Jesus applies the same dynamic to believers&#8212;faithful stewardship now leads to greater oversight later (<a href="/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1-2</a>). The reward is not passive ease but expanded service, aligning with <a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm">2 Timothy 2:12</a>: &#8220;If we endure, we will also reign with Him.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Of all his possessions</b><p>The scope is breathtaking: &#8220;all.&#8221; The master holds vast resources, and the servant gains access to everything. Spiritually, this pictures the inheritance awaiting Christ&#8217;s followers. <a href="/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a> proclaims the earth is the Lord&#8217;s; <a href="/romans/8-17.htm">Romans 8:17</a> calls believers &#8220;heirs of God and co-heirs with Christ.&#8221; <a href="/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a> promises a seat with Jesus on His throne, and <a href="/revelation/21-7.htm">Revelation 21:7</a> says, &#8220;The one who overcomes will inherit all things.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/24-47.htm">Matthew 24:47</a> assures that the Master&#8212;Jesus&#8212;will personally promote the faithful servant, placing him in authoritative stewardship over all that belongs to Him. The promise is certain, secured by Christ&#8217;s own truthful word; it rewards steadfast obedience with expanded responsibility; and it offers participation in the vast possessions of the King, an inheritance shared with all who remain faithful until He returns.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(47) <span class= "bld">He shall make him ruler.</span>--The words are noteworthy as among the indications that the work of the faithful servant does not cease, either after his own removal from his earthly labour, or even after the final consummation of the kingdom. Over and above the joy of the beatific vision, or what is figured to us as the peace of Paradise, there will still be a work to be done, analogous to that which has been the man's training here, and in it there will be scope for all the faculties and energies that have been thus disciplined and developed. (Comp. Notes on <a href="/matthew/25-21.htm" title="His lord said to him, Well done, you good and faithful servant: you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.">Matthew 25:21</a>; <a href="/luke/19-17.htm" title="And he said to him, Well, you good servant: because you have been faithful in a very little, have you authority over ten cities.">Luke 19:17</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 47.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He shall make him ruler over</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>, with dative, denoting permanency of occupation; in ver. 45 it is with genitive, as of temporary superintendence) <span class="cmt_word">all his goods;</span> <span class="accented">all that he hath.</span> This is the reward. He who before was set over only a small part of his lord's possessions is now made superintendent of all his property; for "he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much" (<a href="/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>). How we are to take this promise as applied to the rewards of the kingdom of heaven, we know not yet. "Eve hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive, what God hath prepared for them that love him" (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-9.htm">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>).
