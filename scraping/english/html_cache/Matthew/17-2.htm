The Greek word for "transfigured" is "metamorphoo," indicating a transformation that reveals His true glory. This event occurs on a high mountain, traditionally identified as Mount Tabor, though some suggest Mount Hermon due to its proximity to Caesarea Philippi. The transfiguration serves as a fulfillment of Jesus' promise in <a href="/matthew/16-28.htm">Matthew 16:28</a> that some would not taste death before seeing the Son of Man coming in His kingdom. It also echoes the transformation of Moses' face after encountering God on Mount Sinai (<a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-35</a>), highlighting Jesus as the greater Moses and the ultimate mediator between God and humanity.<p><b>His face shone like the sun,</b><br>The shining face of Jesus symbolizes His divine glory and purity. This imagery is reminiscent of the Old Testament descriptions of God's glory, such as in <a href="/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2</a>, where God is described as covering Himself with light as with a garment. The brightness of Jesus' face also parallels the vision of the glorified Christ in <a href="/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>, where His face is described as shining like the sun in its full strength. This radiance signifies the presence of God and serves as a foretaste of the eschatological glory that believers will witness in the kingdom of heaven.<p><b>and His clothes became as white as the light.</b><br>The transformation of Jesus' clothes to a dazzling white signifies purity, holiness, and the righteousness of God. White garments are often associated with heavenly beings and the redeemed in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9</a>, where the great multitude stands before the throne in white robes. This imagery underscores Jesus' sinlessness and His role as the spotless Lamb of God. The whiteness of His garments also connects to <a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>, where the Ancient of Days is described with clothing as white as snow, further affirming Jesus' divine identity and authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the transfiguration, revealing His divine glory to His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/peter,_james,_and_john.htm">Peter, James, and John</a></b><br>The three disciples chosen by Jesus to witness the transfiguration, representing the inner circle of His followers.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mount_of_transfiguration.htm">Mount of Transfiguration</a></b><br>The specific location is not named in the text, but it is traditionally identified as Mount Tabor or Mount Hermon, a place of divine revelation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses_and_elijah.htm">Moses and Elijah</a></b><br>Appearing alongside Jesus, representing the Law and the Prophets, respectively, and affirming Jesus' fulfillment of both.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_transfiguration_event.htm">The Transfiguration Event</a></b><br>A pivotal moment where Jesus' divine nature is revealed, providing a foretaste of His resurrection glory.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/r/revelation_of_divine_glory.htm">Revelation of Divine Glory</a></b><br>The transfiguration reveals Jesus' divine nature, affirming His identity as the Son of God.

On the mountain, His nature shines forth: unmistakably God, yet standing bodily before His disciples. The brilliance of His face and the dazzling whiteness of His clothes together affirm His purity, authority, and the certainty of His coming kingdom. The transfiguration reassures believers that the Savior who will suffer is also the radiant Lord who reigns eternally.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">And was transfigured before them.</span>--Elsewhere in the New Testament (with the exception of the parallel, <a href="/mark/9-2.htm" title="And after six days Jesus takes with him Peter, and James, and John, and leads them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.">Mark 9:2</a>) the word is used only in its spiritual sense, and is there rendered "transformed." St. Luke does not use the word, but describes the change which it implies, "the fashion of His countenance became other than it had been" (<a href="/luke/9-29.htm" title="And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.">Luke 9:29</a>). He adds the profoundly significant fact that this was while He was in the act of prayer. It was in that act of communion with His Father that the divine glory flowed out into visible brightness. Transcendent as the manifestation was, it has its lower analogies in the radiance which made the face of Stephen "as the face of an angel" (<a href="/acts/6-15.htm" title="And all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.">Acts 6:15</a>); yet more in the glory which shone on the face of Moses when he came down from the mount (<a href="/exodus/34-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him.">Exodus 34:29</a>); in some faint measure, in what may be called the metamorphic power of prayer which invests features that have no form or comeliness with the rapture of devout ecstacy. And it is no over-bold speculation to see in the fact thus noted that which gives its meaning to the Transfiguration as a stage in the training of the disciples. Prayers like those which were offered for Peter that his "faith might not fail" (<a href="/context/luke/22-31.htm" title="And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:">Luke 22:31-32</a>) at least suggest something as to the intercession of the Master for His disciples, and this, we must remember, was a crisis in their spiritual history. They had risen to the highest faith; they had been offended by the announcement of His rejection, His sufferings, His death. Something was needed which might sustain their faith, on which they might look back in after years as the earnest of a future glory. It was well for them that they should, at least once in His life of lowliness, gaze on the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father (<a href="/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>), and feel that they were not "following cunningly-devised fables," but had been "eye-witnesses of His majesty" (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm" title="For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.">2Peter 1:16</a>). To those who believe that our Lord's human nature was in very deed, sin only excepted, like unto ours, it will not seem over-bold to suggest that for Him too this might have been a time of conflict and of trial, a renewal of the Temptation in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/16-23.htm" title="But he turned, and said to Peter, Get you behind me, Satan: you are an offense to me: for you mind not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.">Matthew 16:23</a>), an anticipation of that of the agony of Gethsemane, and that even for Him, in his humanity, there might be in the excellent glory and in the voice from heaven the help and comfort which strengthened Him for the cross and passion. Following the narrative in its details, we may trace its several stages in some such sequence as follows:--After six days, spent apparently with their Lord in the mountain district near Caesarea Philippi, but not in the work of preaching or working miracles, the rest of the disciples are left at the foot of the mountain, and the three follow Him, as the evening closes, to its summit. There, as afterwards in Gethsemane, He withdraws from them "about a stone's throw" (<a href="/luke/22-41.htm" title="And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed,">Luke 22:41</a>), and they "watch with Him." and gaze on Him, as He, standing or kneeling (the first was, we must remember, the more common attitude of prayer, <a href="/luke/18-11.htm" title="The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you, that I am not as other men are, extortionists, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.">Luke 18:11</a>), intercedes for them and for Israel, and, we may add, for mankind. And then, as they gaze, form and features shine with a new glory, bright as the sun, as though the Shechinah cloud had wrapt Him round. Even His garments are "white as the light," "white as snow" (the reading in St. Mark is doubtful, but if genuine the snows of Hermon may have suggested the comparison), as St. Mark adds with his usual descriptive vividness, "so as no fuller on earth can whiten them." Nothing, however, it may be added, suggests the vision of three forms floating in the air with which Raffaelle's glorious picture has made us familiar. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Was transfigured</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">transfiguratus est</span>. The verb is used in classical Greek of transformation, as of a man into an animal. Here it refers to a change of countenance, which is the chief index of any change exterior or interior. St. Luke explains the matter with the words, "The fashion of his countenance was altered." The Word of God allows for a brief space his essential glory to irradiate and shine through the form of a servant which he wore. Not that he showed his Divine nature, or laid aside his human body; his bodily nature remained in its entirety, but permeating it was an effulgence which indicated the Godhead. Perhaps it might be said, as an old writer puts it, that the Transfiguration was less a new miracle than the temporary cessation of an habitual miracle; for the veiling of his glory was the real marvel, the Divine restraint which prohibited the illumination of his sacred humanity. <span class="cmt_word">Before them.</span> In their presence. Jesus probably had withdrawn in order to pray in secret, but returned to the waiting three, that they might behold his glory - be "eyewitnesses of his majesty," as St. Peter says (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16</a>). These, indeed, had been heavy with sleep (Luke), but had awoke at his appearance, and beheld the vision in full possession of their senses. St. Matthew mentions specially two points in this transfiguration. <span class="cmt_word">His face did shine as the sun.</span> This recalls the appearance of the Son of man in <a href="/revelation/1-16.htm">Revelation 1:16</a>, "His countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength." <span class="cmt_word">And his raiment was white as the light.</span> The light which emanated from his body shone through and glorified his very garments. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">sicut nix</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span> is read in some few manuscripts in place of <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>: but the word is doubtless introduced here from St. Mark (where, however, it is of doubtful genuineness). If this second evangelist received his account from St. Peter, we recognize the simile in the apostle's remembrance of the snow clad peak of Hermon, in whose vicinity the event transpired. No candid reader can fail to acknowledge that it is no subjective vision that is here narrated, no merely inward impression on brain or nerve with nothing external to correspond, but a real, objective occurrence, which was beheld by mortal eyes endued with no supernatural or abnormal powers, except in so far as they were enabled to look on this partial emanation of the Divine effulgence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/17-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[There]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He was transfigured</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#949;&#956;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#974;&#952;&#951;</span> <span class="translit">(metemorph&#333;th&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3339.htm">Strong's 3339: </a> </span><span class="str2">To transform, transfigure.
