It is a common introductory phrase in Jesus' teachings, underscoring the authority and certainty of His words. In the context of the Gospels, it often precedes a profound spiritual truth or principle.<p><b>Jesus replied,</b><br>This indicates that Jesus is responding to a situation or question. In the context of <a href="/matthew/21.htm">Matthew 21</a>, Jesus had just performed the miracle of withering the fig tree, which astonished His disciples. His reply serves as a teaching moment to convey deeper spiritual lessons about faith and the power of belief.<p><b>if you have faith and do not doubt,</b><br>Faith is a central theme in Jesus' teachings, often linked to trust in God and His promises. The absence of doubt is crucial, as doubt can undermine faith. This phrase highlights the importance of unwavering belief in God's power and willingness to act. It echoes the teachings found in <a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6</a>, where believers are encouraged to ask in faith without doubting.<p><b>not only will you do what was done to the fig tree,</b><br>The withering of the fig tree is symbolic of judgment and the consequences of fruitlessness. In a broader sense, it represents the power of faith to effect change and bring about God's will. This phrase suggests that believers, through faith, can participate in God's miraculous works.<p><b>but even if you say to this mountain,</b><br>Mountains in biblical literature often symbolize obstacles or significant challenges. Jesus uses hyperbolic language to illustrate the potential of faith to overcome seemingly insurmountable difficulties. This imagery is consistent with Jewish idiomatic expressions of the time, where moving mountains was a metaphor for accomplishing great feats.<p><b>&#8216;Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,&#8217;</b><br>The sea, often representing chaos or the unknown, contrasts with the stability of a mountain. This phrase emphasizes the transformative power of faith to alter reality and confront chaos. It also reflects the authority given to believers to command and influence the natural world through divine power.<p><b>it will happen.</b><br>This assurance underscores the certainty and effectiveness of faith when aligned with God's will. It reflects the biblical principle that nothing is impossible with God (<a href="/luke/1-37.htm">Luke 1:37</a>) and encourages believers to trust in God's ability to fulfill His promises. This statement is a call to active faith, inviting believers to participate in God's miraculous work through confident prayer and belief.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is teaching His disciples about the power of faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, they are being instructed on the nature and potential of faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fig_tree.htm">The Fig Tree</a></b><br>Earlier in the chapter, Jesus curses a barren fig tree, which withers, serving as a visual lesson on faith and judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mountain.htm">The Mountain</a></b><br>Symbolic of seemingly insurmountable obstacles, representing challenges that can be overcome through faith.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city where these events take place, significant as the center of Jewish religious life and the location of Jesus' final teachings before His crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_faith.htm">The Power of Faith</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes that faith, when genuine and devoid of doubt, can accomplish the impossible.

This requires a deep, personal relationship with God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_mountain.htm">Symbolism of the Mountain</a></b><br>Mountains represent the challenges and obstacles in our lives. Jesus teaches that faith can overcome these, encouraging believers to face difficulties with confidence in God's provision.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_and_faith.htm">Prayer and Faith</a></b><br>The passage underscores the importance of prayer as an expression of faith. Believers are encouraged to pray boldly, trusting in God's ability to act.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>True faith is not passive but active, prompting believers to take steps in accordance with their trust in God.

Whenever He uses &#8220;Truly I tell you,&#8221; He underlines that what follows is absolutely dependable (cf. <a href="/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>).<p>&#8226; By prefacing His statement this way, He is inviting His disciples to stake their confidence on His word alone&#8212;just as Scripture elsewhere urges us to &#8220;walk by faith, not by sight&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p>&#8226; The reliability of His promise echoes the unchanging nature of God: &#8220;It is impossible for God to lie&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/6-18.htm">Hebrews 6:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>if you have faith and do not doubt</b><p>&#8226; Faith is active trust in God&#8217;s character and promises, as defined in <a href="/hebrews/11-1.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>.<p>&#8226; Doubt, by contrast, fractures that trust. <a href="/james/1-6.htm">James 1:6</a> warns that the doubter is &#8220;like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus is not commending faith in faith, but faith in God Himself&#8212;&#8220;Have faith in God&#8221; (<a href="/mark/11-22.htm">Mark 11:22</a>).<p>&#8226; The call is to wholehearted confidence, an undivided heart that expects God to be faithful to His own word (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>not only will you do what was done to the fig tree</b><p>&#8226; Earlier that morning, Jesus had cursed a fruitless fig tree, and it withered instantly (<a href="/matthew/21-18.htm">Matthew 21:18-20</a>). The act was both literal and symbolic&#8212;judgment on hollow religiosity.<p>&#8226; He now assures His followers that they can exercise comparable authority when standing in genuine faith.<p>&#8226; This echoes <a href="/john/14-12.htm">John 14:12</a>: &#8220;Whoever believes in Me will do the works I have been doing, and he will do even greater things than these.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The statement underlines that Jesus delegates real, effectual power to those who trust Him and align with His purposes.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but even if you say to this mountain</b><p>&#8226; The mountain in view is likely the Mount of Olives, right before them. Jesus uses a concrete, visible object to teach an audacious principle.<p>&#8226; Scripture often pictures insurmountable obstacles as &#8220;mountains&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/40-4.htm">Isaiah 40:4</a>; <a href="/zechariah/4-7.htm">Zechariah 4:7</a>). Here Jesus affirms that literal mountains&#8212;and by extension every obstacle&#8212;are subject to believing prayer.<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a> reinforces the point: faith the size of a mustard seed moves mountains.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Be lifted up and thrown into the sea</b><p>&#8226; The image is drastic: a mountain uprooted and hurled into the Mediterranean. Nothing is too big for God when His people pray in faith.<p>&#8226; Parallel imagery appears in <a href="/luke/17-6.htm">Luke 17:6</a> where a mulberry tree is uprooted by a mere word of faith.<p>&#8226; The phrase encourages believers to pray bold, impossible-sized requests that advance God&#8217;s kingdom purposes (<a href="/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it will happen</b><p>&#8226; Jesus affirms the certainty of answered prayer when conditions are met: faith, absence of doubt, and alignment with God&#8217;s will (<a href="/1_john/5-14.htm">1 John 5:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/mark/11-24.htm">Mark 11:24</a> clarifies the linkage to prayer: &#8220;Whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The promise is not a blank check for selfish desires; it presupposes abiding in Christ (<a href="/john/15-7.htm">John 15:7</a>) and seeking His glory (<a href="/john/14-13.htm">John 14:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/21-21.htm">Matthew 21:21</a> teaches that unwavering faith in God unlocks His miraculous power.

When God&#8217;s people trust His word, pray boldly, and remain in His purposes, &#8220;it will happen.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">If ye have faith, and doubt not.</span>--The promise, in its very form, excludes a literal fulfilment. The phrase to "remove mountains" (as in <a href="/1_corinthians/13-2.htm" title="And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.">1Corinthians 13:2</a>) was a natural hyperbole for overcoming difficulties, and our Lord in pointing to "this mountain"--as He had done before to Hermon (<a href="/matthew/17-20.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief: for truly I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.">Matthew 17:20</a>)--did but give greater vividness to an illustration which the disciples would readily understand. A mere physical miracle, such as the removal of the mountain, could never be in itself the object of the prayer of a faith such as our Lord described. The hyperbole is used here, as elsewhere, to impress on men's mind the truth which lies beneath it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered.</span> To the apostles' question the Lord makes reply, drawing a lesson, not such as we should have expected, but one of quite a different nature, yet one which was naturally deduced from the transaction which had excited such astonishment. They marvelled at this incident; let them have and exercise faith. and they should do greater things than this. Christ had already made a similar answer after the cure of the demoniac boy (<a href="/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>, where see note). <span class="cmt_word">If ye have faith, and doubt not</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). The whole phrase expresses the perfection of the grace. The latter verb means "to discriminate," to see a difference in things, hence to debate in one's mind. The Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">Si habueritis fidem, et non haesitaveritis</span>. What is here enjoined is that temper of mind which does not stop hesitatingly to consider whether a thing can be done or not, but believes that all is possible - that one can do all things through Christ who strengthens him. So the apostles are assured by Christ that they should not only be able to wither a tree with a word, but should accomplish far more difficult undertakings. <span class="cmt_word">This</span> which is done to <span class="cmt_word">the fig tree</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>); as, "what was befallen to them that were possessed with devils (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)" (<a href="/matthew/8-33.htm">Matthew 8:33</a>). The promise may intimate that it was to be through the preaching of the apostles, and the Jews' rejection of the salvation offered by them, that the judgment should fall on the chosen people. Thus they would do what was done to the fig tree. And in the following words we may see a prophecy of the destruction of the mountain of paganism. Or it may mean that theocratic Judaism must be cast into the sea of nations before the Church of Christ should reach its full development (Lange). <span class="cmt_word">This mountain.</span> As he speaks, he points to the Mount of Olivet, on which they were standing, or to Moriah crowned by the glorious temple. <span class="cmt_word">Be thou removed;</span> <span class="accented">be thou taken up</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>, not the same word as in <a href="/matthew/17-20.htm">Matthew 17:20</a>. <span class="cmt_word">The sea.</span> The Mediterranean (see a similar promise, <a href="/luke/17-6.htm">Luke 17:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">It shall be done.</span> It was not likely that any such material miracle would literally be needed, and no one would ever pray for such a sign; but the expression is hyperbolically used to denote the performance of things most difficult and apparently impossible (see <a href="/zechariah/4-7.htm">Zechariah 4:7</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;Truly</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#956;&#8052;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Am&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Hebrew Word <br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_281.htm">Strong's 281: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; properly, firm, i.e. trustworthy; adverbially, surely.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">I tell</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#941;&#947;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(leg&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3004.htm">Strong's 3004: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I say, speak; I mean, mention, tell, (b) I call, name, especially in the pass., (c) I tell, command. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">you,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8017;&#956;&#8150;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hymin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
