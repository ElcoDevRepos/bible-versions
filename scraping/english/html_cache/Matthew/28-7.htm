This reflects the immediacy of the Gospel's spread after the resurrection. The disciples, who were in hiding due to fear of persecution, needed reassurance and confirmation of Jesus' victory over death. This command also highlights the role of women as the first messengers of the resurrection, which was counter-cultural in a society where women's testimonies were often undervalued.<p><b>&#8216;He has risen from the dead</b><br>This declaration is the cornerstone of Christian faith, affirming Jesus' victory over death and fulfilling His prophecy of resurrection (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>). It confirms Jesus as the Son of God, as Paul later emphasizes in <a href="/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>. The resurrection is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>, which speak of the Messiah's triumph over death.<p><b>and is going ahead of you into Galilee</b><br>Galilee is significant as the region where Jesus began His ministry and performed many miracles. It symbolizes a return to the roots of His earthly mission. This instruction also fulfills Jesus' own prediction in <a href="/matthew/26-32.htm">Matthew 26:32</a>, where He tells the disciples He will go before them to Galilee after His resurrection. Galilee, being a place of mixed populations, also foreshadows the universal nature of the Gospel.<p><b>There you will see Him</b><br>The promise of seeing Jesus in Galilee provides hope and assurance to the disciples. It signifies a personal encounter with the risen Christ, which is foundational for their future mission. This appearance in Galilee is one of several post-resurrection appearances, each serving to strengthen the disciples' faith and prepare them for the Great Commission.<p><b>See, I have told you.&#8221;</b><br>The angel's statement underscores the reliability and authority of the message. It serves as a divine confirmation that what has been spoken will indeed come to pass. This assurance is crucial for the disciples, who are about to embark on spreading the Gospel to the ends of the earth, as seen in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>.

No adequate explanation can be given of the omission of what the other Gospels report, if we assume the whole Gospel to have been written by the Apostle Matthew. On the hypothesis that it is a "Gospel <span class= "ital">according</span> to Matthew," representing the substance of his oral teaching, the absence of this or that fact which we should have expected him to record may have been due to some idiosyncrasy in the scribe, or, so to speak, editor of the Gospel. It is possible that if the disciples had believed the report brought by the women the mountain in Galilee would have been the scene of the first meeting between them and their Master; but they did not believe, and required the evidence which He in His compassion gave them, in order to quicken their faith and lead them to obey the command thus given.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go quickly, and tell his disciples.</span> St. Mark significantly adds, "and Peter." The disciples were to believe without seeing. They had deserted Christ in his hour of need, had not stood by the cross, nor aided in his burial; so they were not to be honoured with the vision of angels or the first sight of the risen Lord. This was reserved for the faithful women, who thus received their mission to carry a message to the messengers - a foretaste of the ministry which they should perform in the Church of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">He goeth before you</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">into Galilee.</span> The verb is noticeable. It is that used by our Lord himself on his way to the garden of Gethsemane (<a href="/matthew/26-32.htm">Matthew 26:32</a>), and it implies the act of a shepherd at the head of his flock, leading them to new pastures (comp. <a href="/john/10-4.htm">John 10:4</a>). The good Shepherd had been smitten, and the sheep scattered; now under his guidance they were to be reunited. The apostolic band had been temporarily dissolved and disintegrated; the college was again to be reformed, and was to receive its renewed commission in seclusion and peace, that it might return to Jerusalem with unimpaired strength to commence its arduous labours. The place of meeting is in Galilee, where most of his mighty works were done, and where it was safer for the disciples to assemble than at Jerusalem. The majority of them came from this region, and thither they returned some ten days (<a href="/john/20-26.htm">John 20:26</a>; <a href="/john/21-1.htm">John 21:1-4</a>) after the Resurrection, to resume their ordinary occupations (ver. 16). Thus they would realize that it was the same Jesus who met them there with whom, these three past years, they had held familiar intercourse. It was ordained, for some reason not expressly stated, that from Galilee should proceed Christ's spiritual kingdom which he came to establish - that "word which," as Peter said (<a href="/acts/10-37.htm">Acts 10:37</a>), "was published throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee." We read of only two appearances of Christ in Galilee - once at the lake, mentioned in the last chapter of St. John, and again in ver. 17 of this chapter of St. Matthew. It is, however, possible that the appearance named by St. Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>), when he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at one time, may have occurred in Galilee. If this is the case, it would be remarkable as the only public revelation of Christ after his resurrection, and the comparative seclusion of the northern district may have been one reason for its selection as the scene for this great demonstration. There was doubtless some moral fitness in the humble and despised Galilee being made the starting point of his Church who was despised and rejected of men whom it was contemptuously said, "Doth the Christ come out of Galilee?" (<a href="/john/7-41.htm">John 7:41</a>). "As in all things God sets at naught the pride of mankind, and chooses persons, instruments, and places mean in the eves of the world, teaching us that in humbler and more retired abodes, secret from the world, we are to seek for the strength of God, who hideth himself" (I. Williams). <span class="cmt_word">Lo, I have told you.</span> The angel thus solemnly confirms what he had just said.
