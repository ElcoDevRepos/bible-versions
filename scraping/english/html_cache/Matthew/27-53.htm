The resurrection of Jesus is central to Christian faith, signifying victory over sin and death. This event fulfills Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a>, which speak of the Messiah's triumph over death. The resurrection is also a cornerstone of apostolic preaching, as seen in <a href="/acts/2-24.htm">Acts 2:24</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/15-4.htm">1 Corinthians 15:4</a>.<p><b>when they had come out of the tombs</b><br>This refers to the saints who were raised to life at the moment of Jesus' death, as described earlier in <a href="/matthew/27-52.htm">Matthew 27:52</a>. The opening of the tombs signifies the power of Jesus' death and resurrection, which breaks the bonds of death. This event prefigures the general resurrection of the dead, as promised in <a href="/daniel/12-2.htm">Daniel 12:2</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>. The tombs opening also symbolizes the new covenant, where death no longer holds dominion over believers.<p><b>they entered the holy city</b><br>The "holy city" refers to Jerusalem, a central location in biblical history and prophecy. Jerusalem is significant as the site of the temple, the center of Jewish worship, and the city where Jesus was crucified and resurrected. The entry of the resurrected saints into Jerusalem symbolizes the fulfillment of God's promises and the inauguration of a new era. It also foreshadows the New Jerusalem described in <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2</a>, where God's presence will dwell with His people eternally.<p><b>and appeared to many people</b><br>The appearance of the resurrected saints to many people serves as a powerful testimony to the reality of Jesus' resurrection and the truth of His claims. This public manifestation provides additional evidence to the early Christian community and beyond, affirming the transformative power of Christ's resurrection. It echoes the post-resurrection appearances of Jesus Himself, as recorded in <a href="/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5-8</a>, where He appeared to many witnesses, providing undeniable proof of His victory over death.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure of the New Testament, whose death and resurrection are pivotal events in Christian theology.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrected_saints.htm">The Resurrected Saints</a></b><br>Individuals who were raised from the dead after Jesus' resurrection, symbolizing the power of His victory over death.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_holy_city.htm">The Holy City (Jerusalem)</a></b><br>The city where these resurrected saints appeared, significant as the center of Jewish worship and the location of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tombs.htm">The Tombs</a></b><br>Burial places from which the saints were raised, representing the breaking of death's hold.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_people_of_jerusalem.htm">The People of Jerusalem</a></b><br>Witnesses to the miraculous event, providing testimony to the reality of Jesus' resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_resurrection.htm">The Power of Resurrection</a></b><br>Jesus' resurrection is not just a historical event but a demonstration of God's power over death, offering hope for eternal life.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witness_to_the_truth.htm">Witness to the Truth</a></b><br>The appearance of the resurrected saints in Jerusalem serves as a powerful testimony to the reality of Jesus' resurrection.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/symbol_of_new_life.htm">Symbol of New Life</a></b><br>The resurrection of the saints symbolizes the new life believers have in Christ, encouraging us to live in the light of this truth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br>This event fulfills Old Testament prophecies about resurrection and renewal, affirming the reliability of God's Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/call_to_faith.htm">Call to Faith</a></b><br>The miraculous events surrounding Jesus' resurrection call us to a deeper faith and trust in God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_27_53_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 27:53?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_27_53_God_s_power_over_death.htm">How does Matthew 27:53 demonstrate God's power over life and death?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Resurrected_saints_role_in_Matt_27_53.htm">What significance do the resurrected saints hold in Matthew 27:53?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_27_53_and_OT_resurrection_links.htm">How does Matthew 27:53 connect to Old Testament prophecies about resurrection?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_27_53_s_role_in_faith_in_resurrection.htm">How can Matthew 27:53 strengthen our faith in Christ's resurrection promise?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Matt_27_53_on_eternal_life.htm">How should Matthew 27:53 influence our understanding of eternal life in Christ?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/How_did_saints_rise_in_Matthew_27_53.htm">How did the saints rise and appear to many in Matthew 27:53?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Evidence_for_saints_resurrection_2.htm">Is there historical evidence for the resurrection of the saints in Matthew 27:53?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_only_Matthew_27_53_mentions_it.htm">Why is the resurrection of the saints only mentioned in Matthew 27:53?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_27.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 27?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_does_the_passion_of_christ_entail.htm">What does the Passion of Christ entail?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_do_gospels_differ_on_tomb_visitors.htm">Why do different Gospel accounts have conflicting reports on who was at Jesus' tomb?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_no_record_of_saints'_resurrection.htm">Matthew 27:51-53 claims that many dead saints were raised;

Their resurrection, timed to Christ&#8217;s own, previews the coming bodily resurrection of all believers, underscores the reliability of the gospel, and announces that through Jesus, life has triumphed over death once and for all.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 53.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Came out of</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the graves</span> <span class="cmt_word">after his resurrection</span>. The masculine participle, not agreeing with "bodies" (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>), denotes the personality of the bodies of the saints, that these arose perfect in soul and body. They could not rise before Christ rose. "Christ the firstfruits, afterwards they that are Christ's." Ewald and others have understood "after his resurrection" to mean "after he raised them from the dead." But the language is against such an interpretation, and there can be no reasonable doubt that the words refer to Christ's own resurrection. If it be contended that the word used, <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, is active in sense, we may reply that, granting this, it merely emphasizes Christ's voluntary action in raising himself. As was said above, St. Matthew anticipates the regular sequence of events in order to complete at one view his accounts of the portents that attended the death and resurrection of Christ. <span class="cmt_word">The holy city</span>. Jerusalem, as in ch. 4:5. The guilty Jerusalem is still the holy city, as retaining the temple, with its services, the ministry, the Scriptures.

If they had already gone to heaven, they could not have thus appeared. It may he right to add that many of the Fathers and modern commentators hold that these resuscitated saints were those to whom Christ preached (<a href="/1_peter/3-19.htm">1 Peter 3:19</a>) when he descended into hell, and that they accompanied him into glory when he ascended into heaven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-53.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">After</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(meta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3326.htm">Strong's 3326: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) gen: with, in company with, (b) acc: (1) behind, beyond, after, of place, (2) after, of time, with nouns, neut. of adjectives. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus&#8217;]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
