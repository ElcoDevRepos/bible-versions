This awareness is consistent with His ability to perceive the hearts and intentions of people, as seen in other passages such as <a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>. His question is not for His own understanding but to address the disciples' misunderstanding and to teach an important lesson.<p><b>&#8220;Why are you bothering this woman?</b><br>The disciples, particularly Judas Iscariot (as noted in <a href="/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4-6</a>), criticized the woman for what they perceived as wastefulness. Jesus defends her, highlighting the importance of her act. This defense underscores the value Jesus places on sincere devotion over material concerns. The cultural context of the time often saw women in subordinate roles, yet Jesus consistently elevates their actions and faith, as seen in other interactions with women throughout the Gospels.<p><b>She has done a beautiful deed to Me.</b><br>The woman's act of anointing Jesus with expensive perfume is described as "beautiful," indicating its spiritual significance. This deed is an act of worship and preparation for Jesus' impending death and burial, as He later explains in verse 12. The beauty of the act lies in its selflessness and prophetic nature, foreshadowing Jesus' sacrifice. This aligns with the Old Testament practice of anointing kings and priests, symbolizing Jesus' roles as both King and High Priest. The act also parallels the sacrificial love Jesus demonstrates, as seen in <a href="/john/15-13.htm">John 15:13</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who defends the woman's actions and provides a deeper understanding of her deed.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>Although not named in this verse, she is identified in the surrounding context as Mary of Bethany, who anoints Jesus with expensive perfume.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Present during this event, they express indignation over what they perceive as wastefulness, prompting Jesus' response.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethany.htm">Bethany</a></b><br>The location where this event takes place, a village near Jerusalem, often associated with Jesus' friends Mary, Martha, and Lazarus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_anointing.htm">The Anointing</a></b><br>The act of the woman pouring expensive perfume on Jesus, symbolizing honor and preparation for His burial.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_value_of_worship.htm">The Value of Worship</a></b><br>True worship is not measured by cost but by the heart's intention.

St. Mark uses a word to describe their conduct which explains the verse. "They murmured against her," or better, <span class= "ital">They were bitterly reproaching her.</span> One after another of the murmurers uttered his bitter remonstrances.<p><span class= "bld">She hath wrought a good work upon me.</span>--The Greek adjective implies something more than "good"--a <span class= "ital">noble,</span> an <span class= "ital">honourable</span> work. The Lord Jesus, in His sympathy with all human affections, recognises the love that is lavish in its personal devotion as noble and excellent in itself. After His departure, as the teaching of <a href="/matthew/25-40.htm" title="And the King shall answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you have done it to one of the least of these my brothers, you have done it to me.">Matthew 25:40</a> reminds us, the poor are His chosen representatives, and our offerings to Him are best made through them. How far the words sanction, as they are often urged as sanctioning, a lavish expenditure on the aesthetic element of worship, church architecture, ornamentation, and the like, is a question to which it may be well to find an answer. And the leading lines of thought are, (1) that if the motive be love, and not ostentation, He will recognise it, even if it is misdirected; (2) that so far as ostentation, or the wish to gratify our own taste and sense of beauty, enters into it, it is vitiated from the beginning; (3) that the wants of the poor have a prior claim before that gratification. On the other hand, we must remember (1) that the poor have spiritual wants as well as physical; (2) that all well-directed church-building and decoration minister to those wants, and, even in its accessories of form and colour, give to the poor a joy which is in itself an element of culture, and may minister to their religious life by making worship a delight. It is a work of charity thus to lighten up lives that are otherwise dull and dreary, and the true law to guide our conscience in such matters is to place our noblest churches in the districts where the people are the poorest.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Understood it.</span> Either their murmurs reached Christ's ears, or he divined their thoughts, and proceeded to defend Mary's action and to give a new lesson. <span class="cmt_word">Why trouble ye the woman?</span> The disciples, observed Bengel, were really acting offensively to Jesus in thus censuring Mary; but he passes over this, and blames them only in respect of their conduct towards her.

A work that proved her zeal, reverence, and faith. Mary had always been devout, contemplative, loving. She had learned much at the grave of Lazarus; she was full of gratitude at the wonderful restoration of her brother's life; she had often heard Christ speak of his decease, and knew that it was close at ham], realizing that which the chosen apostles were still slow to believe; so she was minded to make this costly offering.
