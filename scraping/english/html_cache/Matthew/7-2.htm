In the cultural context of first-century Judaism, the concept of "measure for measure" was a common ethical teaching. This principle is rooted in the Old Testament, where similar ideas are found, such as in <a href="/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>, which calls for fair judgment. The phrase also reflects the broader biblical theme of sowing and reaping, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>. Jesus' teaching here warns against hypocrisy and encourages self-reflection before judging others, aligning with the broader Sermon on the Mount's call to righteousness.<p><b>you will be judged</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the inevitability of divine judgment. It reflects the biblical understanding that God is the ultimate judge, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/14-10.htm">Romans 14:10-12</a>. The historical context of this teaching would resonate with Jesus' audience, who were familiar with the concept of God's judgment from the Hebrew Scriptures. It serves as a reminder that human judgment is limited and fallible, whereas God's judgment is perfect and just. This phrase also connects to the eschatological themes in the New Testament, where believers are reminded of the final judgment.<p><b>and with the measure you use</b><br>The imagery of "measure" is significant in biblical literature, often used in agricultural and commercial contexts. In ancient times, measures were used in trade, and fairness in measurement was a key aspect of justice, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/11.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a>. This phrase suggests that the standards we apply to others will be the standards applied to us. It calls for integrity and fairness, echoing the teachings of the prophets who condemned dishonest scales and measures (<a href="/micah/6-11.htm">Micah 6:11</a>). The use of this metaphor would have been easily understood by Jesus' audience, who were familiar with the importance of just measures in daily life.<p><b>it will be measured to you</b><br>This concluding phrase reinforces the principle of reciprocity and divine justice. It serves as a warning and a promise that one's actions and attitudes towards others will have consequences. This idea is consistent with the teachings of Jesus throughout the Gospels, where He often highlights the importance of mercy, forgiveness, and love. Theologically, it points to the character of God as just and fair, ensuring that each person receives according to their deeds. This principle is also reflected in the parables of Jesus, such as the Parable of the Unforgiving Servant (<a href="/matthew/18-23.htm">Matthew 18:23-35</a>), where the lack of mercy shown by the servant results in a harsh judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, a foundational teaching moment in His ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of the Sermon on the Mount, representing followers of Christ who are learning about the principles of the Kingdom of Heaven.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mount.htm">The Mount</a></b><br>The location where Jesus delivered this sermon, traditionally identified as a hill in Galilee, symbolizing a place of divine teaching and revelation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_principle_of_reciprocity.htm">The Principle of Reciprocity</a></b><br>Jesus teaches that the standards we apply to others will be applied to us.

In ancient markets, merchants weighed grain with standardized measures. A dishonest measure cheated buyers; an honest one safeguarded fairness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/mark/4-24.htm">Mark 4:24&#8211;25</a> applies the same metaphor: &#8220;With the measure you use, it will be measured to you&#8212;and even more.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/proverbs/11-1.htm">Proverbs 11:1</a> declares, &#8220;Dishonest scales are an abomination to the LORD, but an accurate weight is His delight,&#8221; while <a href="/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a> commands, &#8220;You must maintain honest scales and honest weights.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Application: Every evaluation we make&#8212;whether spoken, posted online, or harbored silently&#8212;must be &#8220;honest weight,&#8221; reflecting integrity and charity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>it will be measured to you</b><p>&#8226; God promises reciprocity: He will use our own yardstick when assessing us. Whatever grace or severity we extend, He multiplies it back.<p>&#8226; <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a> frames this as a universal law: &#8220;Whatever a man sows, he will reap in return.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/18-25.htm">Psalm 18:25&#8211;26</a> illustrates the principle in God&#8217;s dealings: &#8220;To the merciful You show Yourself merciful&#8230; to the crooked You show Yourself shrewd.&#8221;<p>&#8226; This is not karma but covenant justice; the Lord honors His revealed standards and calls His people to reflect His character.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/7-2.htm">Matthew 7:2</a> teaches that our judgments and measurements toward others set the pattern for how God will judge us. Practicing mercy invites mercy; dispensing harshness invites scrutiny.

Choose, therefore, the measure of grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">With what judgment ye judge. . . .</span>--Here again truth takes the form of a seeming paradox. The unjust judgment of man does not bring upon us a divine judgment which is also unjust; but the severity which we have unjustly meted out to others, becomes, by a retributive law, the measure of that which is justly dealt out to us.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - Parallels to the second clause in <a href="/luke/6-38.htm">Luke 6:38</a> and <a href="/mark/4-24.htm">Mark 4:24</a>, <span class="cmt_word">For</span>.
