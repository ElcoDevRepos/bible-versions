In the cultural context of first-century Judea, family and land were central to one's identity and security. Leaving these behind would have been a significant sacrifice, highlighting the cost of discipleship. The mention of "houses" and "fields" indicates material possessions, while "brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children" underscores relational ties. This echoes the call of Abraham, who left his homeland for God's promise (<a href="/genesis/12.htm">Genesis 12:1</a>). It also parallels the disciples' own experiences, as they left their livelihoods and families to follow Christ (<a href="/matthew/4-18.htm">Matthew 4:18-22</a>).<p><b>for the sake of My name</b><br>This phrase signifies that the sacrifices made are not for personal gain or ambition but for the cause of Christ. "My name" refers to the authority and mission of Jesus, underscoring the personal relationship and allegiance to Him. In biblical terms, a name represents character and authority, as seen in the commandment to not take the Lord's name in vain (<a href="/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>). The early church faced persecution for the name of Jesus, as seen in <a href="/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>, where the apostles rejoiced for being counted worthy to suffer for His name.<p><b>will receive a hundredfold</b><br>This promise of receiving "a hundredfold" suggests abundant spiritual and communal blessings, both in this life and the life to come. It reflects the principle of divine recompense, where God rewards those who sacrifice for His kingdom. This echoes the Old Testament theme of restoration and blessing, as seen in <a href="/job/42-10.htm">Job 42:10</a>, where Job receives twice as much as he had before. The concept of "hundredfold" also points to the parable of the sower, where the seed that falls on good soil yields a hundredfold (<a href="/matthew/13-8.htm">Matthew 13:8</a>), symbolizing the fruitful outcome of faithful discipleship.<p><b>and will inherit eternal life</b><br>The promise of "eternal life" is the ultimate reward for believers, signifying a restored relationship with God and participation in His kingdom. Inheritance language is significant in Scripture, often associated with the Promised Land (<a href="/deuteronomy/4-21.htm">Deuteronomy 4:21</a>) and the blessings of God's covenant. Eternal life is not just a future hope but a present reality, as seen in <a href="/john/17-3.htm">John 17:3</a>, where knowing God and Jesus Christ is described as eternal life. This inheritance is secured through Christ's redemptive work, fulfilling the prophecies of a Messiah who brings salvation (Isaiah 53).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, offering a promise to His followers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus, who are being taught about the cost and rewards of discipleship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/f/family_members.htm">Family Members</a></b><br>Mentioned as those whom one might leave for the sake of following Christ, including brothers, sisters, father, mother, wife, and children.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/fields.htm">Fields</a></b><br>Symbolic of material possessions or livelihood that one might forsake for Christ.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_life.htm">Eternal Life</a></b><br>The ultimate reward promised to those who sacrifice for Jesus' name.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/sacrificial_discipleship.htm">Sacrificial Discipleship</a></b><br>True discipleship may require significant personal sacrifices, including relationships and material possessions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to maintain an eternal perspective, valuing eternal life over temporary earthly gains.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/promise_of_reward.htm">Promise of Reward</a></b><br>Jesus assures that sacrifices made for His sake will be rewarded abundantly, both in this life and in eternity.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prioritizing_christ.htm">Prioritizing Christ</a></b><br>The call to follow Jesus demands that He be the highest priority in a believer's life, above all other relationships and possessions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_and_trust.htm">Faith and Trust</a></b><br>Trusting in Jesus' promise requires faith that He will fulfill His word and provide for those who sacrifice for His name.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_19_29_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 19:29?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_19_29_Faith_over_possessions.htm">How does Matthew 19:29 encourage prioritizing faith over earthly relationships and possessions?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_eternal_life_today.htm">What does "inherit eternal life" in Matthew 19:29 mean for believers today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Matthew_19_29_Luke_14_33_teachings.htm">How does Matthew 19:29 connect with Jesus' teachings on sacrifice in Luke 14:33?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_live_by_Matthew_19_29_daily.htm">In what ways can you apply Matthew 19:29 to your daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Impact_of_Matthew_19_29_on_your_life.htm">How does Matthew 19:29 challenge your current commitments and priorities?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_19_29_Cost_of_discipleship.htm">What does Matthew 19:29 imply about the cost of discipleship?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_19_29_vs_materialism.htm">How does Matthew 19:29 challenge materialistic values?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Is_leaving_family_for_faith_in_Matt_19_29.htm">Does Matthew 19:29 suggest abandoning family for faith is necessary?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_19.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 19?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_many_levels_of_heaven_are_there.htm">How many levels of heaven are there?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_did_a_tax_collector_follow_jesus.htm">In Luke 5:27&#8211;28, why would a tax collector immediately abandon a lucrative profession at Jesus&#8217; brief invitation with no apparent hesitation?

Not for them only, but for all who had done or should hereafter do as they did, should there be a manifold reward, even within the limits of their earthly life, culminating hereafter in the full fruition of the "eternal life" of which they had heard so recently in the question of the young ruler.<p><span class= "bld">For my name's sake.</span>--The variations in the other Gospels, "for my sake and the gospel's" (<a href="/mark/10-29.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said, Truly I say to you, There is no man that has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,">Mark 10:29</a>), "for the kingdom of God's sake" (<a href="/luke/18-29.htm" title="And he said to them, Truly I say to you, There is no man that has left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,">Luke 18:29</a>), are significant, (1) as explanatory, (2) as showing that the substantial meaning of all three is the same. The act of forsaking home and wealth must not originate in a far-sighted calculation of reward; it must proceed from devotion to a Person and a cause, must tend to the furtherance of the gospel and the establishment of the divine Kingdom.<p><span class= "bld">Shall receive an hundredfold.</span>--The better MSS. have "manifold more," as in St. Luke. The received reading agrees with St. Mark. Here it is manifestly impossible to take the words literally, and this may well make us hesitate in expecting a literal fulfilment of the promise that precedes. We cannot look for the hundredfold of houses, or wives, or children. What is meant is, that the spirit of insight and self-sacrifice for the sake of God's kingdom multiplies and intensifies even the common joys of life. Relationships multiply on the ground of spiritual sympathies. New homes are opened to us. We find new friends. The common things of life--sky, and sea, and earth--are clothed with a new beauty to the cleansed eyes of those who have conquered self. St. Mark (<a href="/mark/10-30.htm" title="But he shall receive an hundred times now in this time, houses, and brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.">Mark 10:30</a>) adds words which, if one may so speak, are so strange that they must have been actually spoken,--"with persecutions." We seem to hear the words spoken as a parenthesis, and in a tone of tender sadness, not, perhaps, altogether unmingled with a touch of the method which teaches new truths, by first meeting men's expectations, and then suddenly presenting that which is at variance with them. The thoughts of the disciples were travelling on to that "hundredfold," as though it meant that all things should be smooth and prosperous with them. They are reminded that persecution in some shape, the trials that test and strengthen, is inseparable from the higher life of the kingdom. (Comp. <a href="/acts/14-22.htm" title="Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.">Acts 14:22</a>.) Men need that discipline in order that they may feel that the new things are better than the old.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every one that hath forsaken.</span> The Lord extends the promise. Even those who have not risen to the utter self-sacrifice of apostles, who have not surrendered so much as they, shall have their reward, though nothing to be compared to the unspeakable recompense of the twelve. <span class="cmt_word">Houses... lands.</span> Some manuscripts, followed by some modern editors, omit <span class="cmt_word">or wife,</span> the omission being probably first made by some critical scribe, who deemed that a wife should never be left. The Lord enumerates the persons and objects upon which men's hearts are most commonly and firmly fixed. He begins and ends the list with material possessions - houses and lands, and between them introduces in gradation the most cherished members of the family circle. "Forsaking wife and children" may be understood as abstaining from marriage in order the better to serve God. <span class="cmt_word">For my Name's sake.</span> In consequence of belief in Christ, rather than do despite to his grace, or in order to confess and follow him more completely. In times of persecution, under many different cases of pressure, or where his friends were heathens or infidels, a Christian might feel himself constrained to relinquish the dearest ties, to east off all old associations, to put himself wholly in God's hands, freed from all worldly things; such a one should receive ample reward in the present life. <span class="cmt_word">An hundredfold</span>. Some read "manifold," as in <a href="/luke/18-30.htm">Luke 18:30</a>. The spiritual relationship into which religion would introduce him largely compensates for the loss of earthly connections. He shall have brothers and sisters in the faith - hundreds who will show him the affection of father and mother, hundreds who will love him as well a s wife and children. And if he suffer temporal loss, this shall be made up by the charity of the Christian society, all whose resources are at his command, and he shall enjoy that peace and comfort of heart which no worldly possessions can give, and which are superior to all changes of fortune. And it may well be that the relief from the cares and distractions caused by wealth brings a hundredfold more real happiness than its possession ever supplied. "Godliness is profitable for all things, having the promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come" (<a href="/1_timothy/4-8.htm">1 Timothy 4:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Everlasting life.</span> The hope of future happiness is in itself sufficient to lighten and dissipate all earthly troubles, and to stimulate severest sacrifices. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/19-29.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">everyone</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#8118;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(pas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
