Jesus turning to Peter signifies a direct and personal rebuke, emphasizing the seriousness of Peter's error. In the cultural context, a teacher correcting a disciple was a common practice, but the intensity of this correction is notable.<p><b>&#8220;Get behind Me, Satan!</b><br>Jesus' use of "Satan" here is not a literal identification of Peter with the devil but a recognition of the influence of satanic thinking. The term "Satan" means adversary, and Peter's words, though well-intentioned, oppose God's redemptive plan. This echoes the temptation of Jesus in the wilderness (<a href="/matthew/4.htm">Matthew 4:1-11</a>), where Satan attempted to divert Jesus from His mission. The command "Get behind Me" suggests a call for Peter to resume his role as a follower, not a leader or obstacle.<p><b>You are a stumbling block to Me.</b><br>The term "stumbling block" refers to anything that causes one to fall or sin. In the original Greek, the word is "skandalon," which can mean a trap or snare. Peter's misunderstanding of Jesus' mission as the suffering Messiah (Isaiah 53) becomes a potential hindrance to the fulfillment of God's plan. This highlights the danger of human reasoning when it conflicts with divine purposes.<p><b>For you do not have in mind the things of God,</b><br>This phrase underscores the contrast between divine and human perspectives. Peter's focus is on earthly power and glory, not on the sacrificial path Jesus must take. This reflects a common theme in Scripture where God's ways and thoughts are higher than human ways (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>). It serves as a reminder of the need for spiritual discernment and alignment with God's will.<p><b>but the things of men.&#8221;</b><br>The "things of men" refers to human desires, ambitions, and understanding, which are often at odds with God's purposes. This phrase highlights the natural human inclination to prioritize worldly success and comfort over spiritual truth and sacrifice. It serves as a warning against allowing cultural and personal biases to cloud one's understanding of God's plan, as seen throughout biblical history when human plans conflicted with divine intentions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the Son of God and the Messiah.

Jesus immediately pivots&#8212;literally turning toward Peter&#8212;to deal with the issue head-on, much like He confronted Peter&#8217;s questions after the resurrection in <a href="/john/21-20.htm">John 21:20-22</a>.<p>- This turn underscores Christ&#8217;s readiness to correct error in those He loves (<a href="/proverbs/27-6.htm">Proverbs 27:6</a>).<p>- <a href="/mark/8-33.htm">Mark 8:33</a> notes the same moment, highlighting its importance in the Synoptic record.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Get behind Me, Satan!</b><p>- Jesus is not calling Peter personally &#8220;Satan&#8221; but identifying the source of the idea Peter voiced.

Jesus&#8217; sharp rebuke guards the path to the cross, models decisive confrontation of error, and calls every follower to align thinking with heaven rather than human preference.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(23) <span class= "bld">He turned, and said to Peter.</span>--St. Mark adds, significantly, "when He had turned about and looked on His disciples." They, we may believe, stood behind, watching the effect of the remonstrance which Peter had uttered as their spokesman, and therefore, the Lord reading their thoughts, the rebuke, though addressed to him, was spoken so that they too might hear.<p><span class= "bld">Get thee behind me, Satan.</span>--The sharpness of the words indicates a strong and intense emotion. The chief of the Apostles was addressed in the self-same terms as those which had been spoken to the Tempter (see Note on <a href="/matthew/4-10.htm" title="Then said Jesus to him, Get you hence, Satan: for it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and him only shall you serve.">Matthew 4:10</a>). It was, indeed, nothing less than a renewal of the same temptation. In this suggestion, that He might gain the crown without the cross, and attain a kingdom of this world as the princes of the world obtain their kingdoms, the Christ saw the recurrence of the temptation which had offered Him the glory of those kingdoms on condition of His drawing back from the path which the Father had appointed for Him, with the associations that had gathered round its original.<p><span class= "bld">Thou art an offence unto me.</span>--The Greek word is, of course, to be taken as meaning a stumbling block, an impediment. So taken, it presents a suggestive contrast to the previous promise. Peter is still a <span class= "ital">stone,</span> but it is as "a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence" (<a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm" title="And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.">Isaiah 8:14</a>; <a href="/1_peter/2-8.htm" title="And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.">1Peter 2:8</a>). He is hindering, not forwarding his Master's work. For one who loved his Lord as Peter did--his very love in this instance prompting the rash words--this was at once the sharpest and yet the tenderest, and therefore the most effective, rebuke that could have been uttered.<p><span class= "bld">Thou savourest not the things that be of God.</span>--The verb, though found in all English versions from Wiclif downwards, and suggested by the <span class= "ital">sapis</span> of the Vulgate, was never a very happy one, and is now so archaic as to be misleading. It may help us to understand it, to remember that our <span class= "ital">savour</span> and the French <span class= "ital">savoir</span> are both forms derived from the Latin <span class= "ital">sapere,</span> and that the translators were so far justified in using it to describe a mental state, or rather act. Elsewhere the word is rendered "mind," or "set affection on," as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> "<span class= "ital">mind</span> the things of the flesh," or "of the spirit" (<a href="/romans/8-5.htm" title="For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.">Romans 8:5</a>), and "<span class= "ital">set your affection</span> on things above" (<a href="/colossians/3-2.htm" title=" Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.">Colossians 3:2</a>); and this is obviously a more satisfactory rendering. Peter's sin lay in the fact that his mind was set on the things of earth, its outward pomp and pageantry, measuring the future by a human not a divine standard. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He turned</span>. Peter and the rest were following Christ, as he walked onward. Now Jesus stops, turns, and faces them. <span class="cmt_word">Get thee behind me, Satan.</span> Jesus uses nearly the same words in rebuking Peter that he had used to the devil in his temptation (<a href="/matthew/4-10.htm">Matthew 4:10</a>); and justly, because the apostle was acting the adversary's part, by opposing the Divine economy, and endeavouring to persuade Jesus that the way he proposed was wholly unnecessary. The lively stone has became a very Satan in opposing the Divine will; hence the sharpness of the rebuke administered to him. <span class="cmt_word">An offence unto me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">my stumbling block.</span> Petros, the stone, to maintain the metaphor, is now "a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence" (<a href="/1_peter/2-8.htm">1 Peter 2:8</a>). He stood in the Saviour's way, and impeded his onward progress in the course ordained. He who would turn him aside from Calvary is the enemy of man's salvation, which was to be won there. <span class="cmt_word">Thou</span> <span class="cmt_word">savourest</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">not;</span> <span class="accented">mindest not</span> (as <a href="/romans/8-5.htm">Romans 8:5</a>); thy taste is not for the Divine plans, but for human considerations; thou art not promoting the great purpose of God, but worldliness and self-pleasing. "Peter," says St. Chrysostom, "examining the matter by human and earthly reasoning, accounted it disgraceful to him [Christ] and an unmeet thing. Touching him therefore sharply, he saith, 'My Passion is not an unmeet thing, but thou givest this sentence with a carnal mind; whereas if thou hadst hearkened to my sayings in a godly manner, disengaging thyself from thy carnal understanding, thou wouldst know that this of all things most becometh me. For thou indeed supposest that to suffer is unworthy of me; but I say unto thee, that for me not to suffer is of the devil's mind;' by the contrary statements repressing his alarm" (Oxford transl.). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/16-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] turned</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(strapheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4762.htm">Strong's 4762: </a> </span><span class="str2">Strengthened from the base of trope; to twist, i.e. Turn quite around or reverse.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[and] said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
