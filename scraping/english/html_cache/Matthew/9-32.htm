Jesus had just performed miracles, including raising a girl from the dead and healing a woman with a bleeding issue. The setting is likely Capernaum, a central location for Jesus' ministry. The phrase suggests the continuous nature of Jesus' ministry, moving from one act of compassion to another.<p><b>a demon-possessed man</b><br>Demon possession in the New Testament is often associated with physical and mental afflictions. The Jewish understanding of demons was influenced by intertestamental literature, which expanded on the concept of evil spirits. This man's condition highlights the spiritual warfare present during Jesus' ministry, emphasizing His authority over the spiritual realm.<p><b>who was mute</b><br>The muteness of the man is a physical manifestation of his spiritual oppression. In the cultural context, physical ailments were often seen as a result of sin or demonic influence. This condition would have isolated the man socially and religiously, as he would be unable to participate fully in community life or worship.<p><b>was brought to Jesus</b><br>The act of bringing the man to Jesus demonstrates faith and recognition of Jesus' authority and power to heal. It reflects the communal aspect of faith in the Gospels, where individuals often rely on the faith and actions of others to encounter Jesus. This mirrors other instances where people bring the sick to Jesus, showing the importance of intercession and community support.<p><b>to Jesus</b><br>Jesus is the central figure in this narrative, embodying the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah who would heal and deliver. His role as the divine healer and exorcist is a testament to His identity as the Son of God. This encounter foreshadows the ultimate victory over evil through His death and resurrection.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who performs miracles and teaches about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/demon-possessed_man.htm">Demon-Possessed Man</a></b><br>An individual afflicted by a demon, resulting in his inability to speak.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The people who witnessed the miracle, often representing the general public's reaction to Jesus' works.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who were present during His ministry and witnessed His miracles.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders who often opposed Jesus and questioned His authority and actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/authority_of_jesus_over_demons.htm">Authority of Jesus Over Demons</a></b><br>Jesus demonstrates His divine authority by casting out demons, showing His power over spiritual forces.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_for_the_afflicted.htm">Compassion for the Afflicted</a></b><br>Jesus' willingness to heal the demon-possessed man reflects His compassion for those suffering, encouraging believers to show empathy and care for others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>The act of bringing the mute man to Jesus illustrates the importance of faith and action in seeking divine intervention.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>The presence of demons in the account reminds believers of the reality of spiritual warfare and the need for spiritual vigilance and prayer.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/w/witnessing_miracles.htm">Witnessing Miracles</a></b><br>The crowd's reaction to the miracle serves as a reminder of the importance of witnessing and testifying to God's work in our lives.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_9_32_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 9:32?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_9_32_Jesus_dual_authority.htm">How does Matthew 9:32 demonstrate Jesus' authority over spiritual and physical realms?

The flow of the narrative shows an unbroken stream of compassion&#8212;one healing leading straight into another.<p>&#8226; This timing underscores how available the Lord is: He never &#8220;clocks out&#8221; (cf. <a href="/mark/1-32.htm">Mark 1:32-34</a>, where crowds press in after sunset).<p>&#8226; It also highlights the contrast between religious leaders who often held people at arm&#8217;s length and Jesus, who walks among the hurting (<a href="/matthew/11-28.htm">Matthew 11:28-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a demon-possessed man</b><p>&#8226; Scripture presents demonic oppression as a literal reality, not a metaphor (<a href="/mark/5-2.htm">Mark 5:2-13</a>; <a href="/luke/8-27.htm">Luke 8:27-35</a>).<p>&#8226; The man is under spiritual bondage he cannot break himself. This reminds us that the battle &#8220;is not against flesh and blood&#8221; (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>).<p>&#8226; Each exorcism in the Gospels showcases Christ&#8217;s absolute authority over the unseen realm (<a href="/matthew/12-28.htm">Matthew 12:28</a>; <a href="/luke/11-20.htm">Luke 11:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who was mute</b><p>&#8226; The demon&#8217;s presence has produced physical silence; spiritual bondage often manifests in bodily affliction (<a href="/mark/9-17.htm">Mark 9:17, 25</a>).<p>&#8226; For Israel, speech was linked to praise and testimony (<a href="/psalms/51-15.htm">Psalm 51:15</a>).

As Jesus departs one scene of mercy, another desperate case is placed before Him: a man silenced by demonic power. The verse highlights (1) the relentless compassion of the Savior, (2) the reality of spiritual warfare, (3) the enemy&#8217;s intent to steal worship, and (4) the role of believing friends who usher the needy to Jesus. Above all, it sets the stage for the next verse, where the mute man speaks and the crowd marvels&#8212;testimony that when Jesus confronts darkness, freedom and praise inevitably follow.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">A dumb man possessed with a devil.</span>--This narrative also is given by St. Matthew only. Referring to the Note in the <span class= "ital">Excursus</span> on <a href="/matthew/8-28.htm" title="And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.">Matthew 8:28</a> for the general question as to "possession," it may be noted here that the phenomena presented in this case were those of catalepsy, or of insanity showing itself in obstinate and sullen silence. The dumbness was a spiritual disease, not the result of congenital malformation. The work of healing restored the man to sanity rather than removed a bodily imperfection. Comp. the analogous phenomena in <a href="/matthew/12-22.htm" title="Then was brought to him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw.">Matthew 12:22</a>, <a href="/luke/11-14.htm" title="And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spoke; and the people wondered.">Luke 11:14</a>. The latter agrees so closely with this that but for the fact of St. Matthew's connecting our Lord's answer to the accusation of the Pharisees with the second of these miracles, we might have supposed the two identical.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 32-34.</span> <span class="accented">- The demon cast out of the dumb man. The astonishment of the multitudes and their confession.</span> [<span class="accented">The accusation by the Pharisees.</span>] The whole narrative greatly resembles the cure of the blind and dumb man possessed with a devil (<a href="/matthew/12-22.htm">Matthew 12:22-24</a>; <a href="/luke/11-14.htm">Luke 11:14, 15</a>), as may be seen from the fact that the following words are common to both passages, the brackets indicating a want of exact correspondence in the original. "They brought to him one possessed with a devil, dumb, and the [dumb spake]. And the multitudes [said.]... But the Pharisees, He casteth out the devils by... the prince of the devils." One explanation is that the two narratives are taken kern different sources, but represent the same incident; another, that as in vers. 27-31, so also here, the narratives of two similar incidents have become assimilated. At any rate, in the case of ver. 34 there has probably been assimilation, and that since the writing of the Gospel. For: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Ver. 34 is wanting in D, the Old Latin manuscripts <span class="accented">a</span> and <span class="accented">k</span>, Hilary and Juvencns, and is therefore rightly bracketed by Westcott and Hort as perhaps "<span class="accented">a</span> Western non-interpolation" (2. &sect; 240). <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The verse seems to be hardly in complete accordance with the aim of the whole section, which ends much more suitably with the effect on the multitudes. In <a href="/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a> the verse forms a climax (cf. <a href="/matthew/12-2.htm">Matthew 12:2, 10, 14</a>). But here there has been no opposition mentioned since the very beginning of the chapter (for the disobedience of the blind men cannot be so called), so that the monstrous accusation comes in quite unexpectedly. Observe that this is not a case in which subjective difficulties are in themselves a <span class="accented">prima facie</span> argument for the genuineness of a phrase, for the early copyists troubled themselves very little about questions of the internal arrangement and the general aim of the sections. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> <span class="accented">-</span> (<span class="accented">And</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">as they went out</span> (<span class="accented">forth</span>, Revised Version; ver. 31).
