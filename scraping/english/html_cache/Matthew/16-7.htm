This phrase highlights their human tendency to reason among themselves rather than seeking divine insight. In the broader biblical context, it underscores the importance of seeking God's wisdom rather than relying solely on human understanding, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>.<p><b>and concluded,</b><br>The disciples' conclusion reveals their limited understanding and tendency to interpret Jesus' teachings through a literal lens. This moment illustrates a recurring theme in the Gospels where the disciples misunderstand Jesus' spiritual teachings, as seen in <a href="/john/4-31.htm">John 4:31-34</a> when they misinterpret His reference to "food" as physical sustenance.<p><b>&#8220;It is because we did not bring any bread.&#8221;</b><br>This reflects the disciples' concern with physical needs, a common human preoccupation. In the context of <a href="/matthew/16.htm">Matthew 16</a>, Jesus had just warned them about the "yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees," using a metaphor for their teachings. The disciples' focus on bread shows their struggle to grasp spiritual truths.

The train of thought which connected the warning and the fact was probably hardly formulated even in their own minds. It may be that they imagined that as the Pharisee would not eat of bread that had been defiled by the touch of heathen or publican, so their Master forbade them, however great their need, to receive food at the hands of either of the sects that had combined against Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They reasoned among themselves.</span> With a crass literalness, the apostles utterly misunderstood the drift of their Master's warning, and thought that he alluded to their forgetfulness in coming without bread. They were always slow to apprehend the metaphorical and spiritual signification of their Master's language. Thus at the synagogue in Capernaum they failed to grasp his meaning when he spoke of himself as the Bread of life (<a href="/john/6.htm">John 6</a>.), and at Jacob's well they interpreted of material food his Divine words concerning the nourishment of the soul (<a href="/john/4.htm">John 4</a>.). It is well remarked by Sadler (<span class="accented">in loc.</span>) that "it is no small proof of the good faith and consequent truth of the gospel, that the apostles should have recorded things so against themselves as this account. If they had written for any purpose except the simple exhibition of the truth, they could easily have suppressed facts such as this, so very discreditable to their spiritual, indeed to their mental, perception. But if we had lost accounts such as these, we should have lost the proof of one of the greatest, if not the greatest, miracle of its kind; for no miraculous change in the spirit of man which God has wrought can be accounted greater than this - that men who, before the resurrection and the Day of Pentecost, should have exhibited such utter want of the lowest spiritual discernment, should, after the descent of the Spirit, have written such searching spiritual documents as the catholic Epistles of Peter and John." In the present case some commentators take it that the apostles fancied Christ was warning them against procuring any leavened bread from Pharisees and Sadducees, whom Jesus so sternly denounced; but it is more probable that their anxiety arose simply from the want of provisions, not from the consideration that they were debarred from obtaining them at the hands of certain parties. These doubts they seem to have whispered one to another. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/16-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">They discussed this</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#953;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#943;&#950;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(dielogizonto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1260.htm">Strong's 1260: </a> </span><span class="str2">To reason (with), debate (with), consider.
