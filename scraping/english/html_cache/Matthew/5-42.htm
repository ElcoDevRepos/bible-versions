In the cultural context of first-century Judea, giving to those in need was a common expectation within Jewish society, rooted in the teachings of the Torah. <a href="/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a> instructs the Israelites to be openhanded toward their fellow countrymen who are poor and needy. Jesus' teaching here aligns with this tradition but extends it further, encouraging a spirit of giving that transcends legal obligation. This reflects the character of God, who is generous and provides for all creation (<a href="/psalms/145-16.htm">Psalm 145:16</a>). The call to give is not limited to material possessions but includes time, attention, and compassion, embodying the love of Christ.<p><b>and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you</b><br>This part of the verse challenges believers to be open-hearted and willing to help others, even at personal cost. In the historical context, lending was often a necessity for survival, and the Law of Moses included regulations to protect borrowers (<a href="/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25-27</a>). Jesus' instruction goes beyond legal requirements, urging a readiness to assist without expecting repayment, reflecting the grace and mercy of God. This teaching is echoed in <a href="/luke/6-34.htm">Luke 6:34-35</a>, where Jesus encourages lending without expecting anything back, highlighting the reward from God for such selfless acts. The principle here is one of trust in God's provision and a call to reflect His generosity, as seen in the ultimate sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who gave Himself for humanity without expecting anything in return.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, which is a foundational teaching of Christian ethics and behavior.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of the Sermon on the Mount, representing all followers of Christ who are called to live according to His teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sermon_on_the_mount.htm">The Sermon on the Mount</a></b><br>A significant event in the New Testament where Jesus outlines the principles of the Kingdom of Heaven, including radical teachings on love, generosity, and righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/generosity_as_a_reflection_of_god's_character.htm">Generosity as a Reflection of God's Character</a></b><br>As followers of Christ, we are called to reflect God's generous nature.

Such generosity mirrors our Father, fulfills the law of love, and demonstrates the kingdom ethic Jesus came to establish.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(42) <span class= "bld">Give to him that asketh.</span>--Here again our Lord teaches us by the method of a seeming paradox, and enforces a principle binding upon every one in the form of a rule which in its letter is binding upon no man. Were we to give to all men what they ask, we should in many cases be cursing, not blessing, them with our gifts. Not so does our Father give us what we ask in prayer; not so did Christ grant the prayers of His disciples. That which the words really teach as the ideal of the perfect life which we ought to aim at, is the loving and the giving temper that sees in every request made to us the expression of a want of some kind, which we are to consider as a call to thoughtful inquiry how best to meet the want, giving what is asked for if we honestly believe that it is really for the good of him who asks, giving something else if that would seem to be really better for him. Rightly understood, the words do not bid us idly give alms to the idle or the impostor; and St. Paul's rule, "If a man will not work, neither let him eat" (<a href="/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.">2Thessalonians 3:10</a>), is not a departure from the law of Christ, but its truest application and fulfilment.<p><span class= "bld">From him that would borrow.</span>--The force of the precept depends on its connection with the Jewish Law, which forbade not only what we call usury, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> excessive interest, but all interest on loans where debtor and creditor alike were Israelites (<a href="/exodus/22-25.htm" title="If you lend money to any of my people that is poor by you, you shall not be to him as an usurer, neither shall you lay on him usury.">Exodus 22:25</a>; <a href="/leviticus/25-37.htm" title="You shall not give him your money on usury, nor lend him your victuals for increase.">Leviticus 25:37</a>; <a href="/context/deuteronomy/23-19.htm" title="You shall not lend on usury to your brother; usury of money, usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent on usury:">Deuteronomy 23:19-20</a>). From our modern point of view that law cannot be regarded as in harmony with the present order of society, nor consistent with our modern views of financial justice. It is not the less true, however, that in the education of a family or nation, such a prohibition may be a necessary and useful discipline. We should look with scorn on boys who lent on interest to their brothers or their schoolfellows, and the ideal of the Law of Moses was that of treating all Israelites as brothers brought under the discipline of the schoolmaster. As if with a prescient insight into the besetting temptation of the race, the lawgiver forbade a practice which would have destroyed, and eventually did destroy, the sense of brotherhood (<a href="/context/nehemiah/5-1.htm" title="And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews.">Nehemiah 5:1-13</a>), leaving it open to receive interest from strangers who were outside the limits of the family (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-20.htm" title="To a stranger you may lend on usury; but to your brother you shall not lend on usury: that the LORD your God may bless you in all that you set your hand to in the land where you go to possess it.">Deuteronomy 23:20</a>). The higher law of Christ treats all men as brothers, and bids us, if it is right to lend as an act of charity, to do so for love, and not for profit. Cases where the business of the world calls for loans not for the relief of want, but as a matter of commercial convenience, lie obviously outside the range of the precept. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - (Cf. <a href="/luke/6-30.htm">Luke 6:30, 34</a><span class="accented">a</span>, 35.) The connexion is as follows: Our Lord spoke first (ver. 39) of entire submission to injuries; then (ver. 40) of acceptance of loss of property; then (ver. 41) of acceptance of a burden imposed; here of acceptance of a demand for pecuniary assistance. This, in its turn, forms an easy transition to the subject of ver. 43, <span class="accented">sqq. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Give to him that asketh thee</span>, etc. This verse has been often adduced by unbelievers to prove the incompatibility of our Lord's utterances with the conditions of modern society. Wrongly. Because our Lord is inculcating the proper spirit of Christian life, not giving rules to be literally carried out irrespective of circumstances.
