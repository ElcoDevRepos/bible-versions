The guard likely consisted of Roman soldiers, known for their discipline and effectiveness. This action underscores the tension between the Jewish authorities and the followers of Jesus, as the leaders were concerned about the possibility of Jesus' disciples stealing His body to claim resurrection. The presence of Roman guards also highlights the political and religious stakes involved in Jesus' death and burial.<p><b>Pilate said</b><br>Pilate's involvement in the burial process reflects his role in the crucifixion and the political dynamics of the time. As the Roman governor, Pilate had the authority to grant or deny requests from the Jewish leaders. His decision to provide a guard shows his attempt to maintain order and prevent any potential uprising. Pilate's actions throughout the trial and crucifixion of Jesus are marked by a struggle between his own judgment and the pressure from the Jewish authorities, as seen in earlier passages.<p><b>Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how</b><br>This directive from Pilate gives the Jewish leaders the responsibility to ensure the security of the tomb. The phrase implies a sense of urgency and thoroughness, as the leaders are instructed to use their best efforts to prevent any tampering with Jesus' body. The emphasis on security highlights the significance of the resurrection claim and the lengths to which the authorities went to prevent it. This also sets the stage for the miraculous nature of the resurrection, as the measures taken to secure the tomb were humanly insurmountable. The phrase connects to the fulfillment of prophecy and the divine power of God, as no human effort could thwart His plan.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who presided over the trial of Jesus.
