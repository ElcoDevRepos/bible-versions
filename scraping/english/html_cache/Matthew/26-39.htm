The garden, located on the Mount of Olives, was a place Jesus often visited for prayer and reflection. This act of moving away signifies His desire for solitude in prayer, highlighting the gravity of the moment. It also reflects the separation He would soon experience from His disciples and ultimately from God the Father on the cross.<p><b>He fell facedown and prayed</b><br>Falling facedown is a posture of deep humility and submission, often seen in biblical accounts when individuals encounter the divine or are in intense supplication. This act underscores the weight of the moment and Jesus' earnestness in prayer. It reflects the cultural practice of showing utmost reverence and desperation in prayer, as seen in other biblical figures like Moses and Daniel.<p><b>My Father</b><br>Jesus' use of "My Father" emphasizes His intimate relationship with God. This address is personal and reflects the unique Sonship of Jesus, distinguishing His relationship with God from that of others. It also fulfills the prophetic understanding of the Messiah as the Son of God, as seen in <a href="/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a> and <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>.<p><b>if it is possible</b><br>This phrase indicates Jesus' acknowledgment of God's sovereignty and the possibility of an alternative to the impending suffering. It reflects His human nature, expressing a desire to avoid the agony of the cross if there is another way. This aligns with the biblical theme of seeking God's will above personal desires, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5-6</a>.<p><b>let this cup pass from Me</b><br>The "cup" is a metaphor for the suffering and wrath Jesus is about to endure. In the Old Testament, the cup often symbolizes God's judgment (e.g., <a href="/psalms/75-8.htm">Psalm 75:8</a>, <a href="/isaiah/51-17.htm">Isaiah 51:17</a>). Jesus' request to let the cup pass signifies His awareness of the impending physical and spiritual suffering, including bearing the sins of humanity.<p><b>Yet not as I will, but as You will</b><br>This statement is the ultimate expression of submission to God's will, highlighting Jesus' obedience and surrender. It reflects the core of His mission, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10</a>, where the suffering servant submits to God's plan. This phrase also serves as a model for believers in seeking God's will above their own desires, as echoed in the Lord's Prayer (<a href="/matthew/6-10.htm">Matthew 6:10</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, demonstrating His humanity and submission to the Father's will.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gethsemane.htm">Gethsemane</a></b><br>The garden where Jesus prayed, located on the Mount of Olives, a place of deep spiritual significance and struggle.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_cup.htm">The Cup</a></b><br>Symbolic of the suffering and wrath that Jesus was about to endure on behalf of humanity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>God the Father, to whom Jesus prays, showing the intimate relationship and submission between the Son and the Father.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Although not directly mentioned in this verse, they were nearby, highlighting the contrast between Jesus' vigilance and their sleepiness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/submission_to_god's_will.htm">Submission to God's Will</a></b><br>Jesus models perfect submission, teaching us to prioritize God's will over our own desires.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prayer_in_times_of_distress.htm">Prayer in Times of Distress</a></b><br>Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane encourages believers to seek God earnestly in times of trial and uncertainty.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_obedience.htm">The Cost of Obedience</a></b><br>Understanding the "cup" helps us appreciate the depth of Jesus' sacrifice and the cost of true obedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/intimacy_with_the_father.htm">Intimacy with the Father</a></b><br>Jesus' use of "My Father" highlights the personal relationship we are invited to have with God through Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/strength_in_weakness.htm">Strength in Weakness</a></b><br>Jesus' humanity is evident in His plea, reminding us that acknowledging our weakness can lead to divine strength.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_26_39_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 26:39?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_26_39_Jesus_submits_to_God.htm">How does Matthew 26:39 demonstrate Jesus' submission to God's will?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Jesus_prayer_in_trials.htm">What can we learn from Jesus' prayer about facing personal trials?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Jesus_prayer_Philippians_2_8_link.htm">How does Jesus' prayer connect to Philippians 2:8 on obedience?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_live_by_not_my_will_but_Yours.htm">How can we apply "not as I will, but as You will" daily?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_does_Jesus_teach_trust_in_trials.htm">What does Jesus' example teach about trusting God in difficult circumstances?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_let_this_cup_pass_from_Me.htm">What does "let this cup pass from Me" signify in Matthew 26:39?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_26_39_Jesus_dual_nature.htm">How does Matthew 26:39 illustrate Jesus' human and divine nature?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_does_Jesus_prioritize_God_s_will.htm">Why does Jesus pray for the Father's will over His own in Matthew 26:39?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_26.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 26?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/why_was_jesus_never_married.htm">Why was Jesus never married?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/can_this_cup_pass_from_me.htm">Can this cup pass from me?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'not_my_will'_mean.htm">What does "Not my will, but yours be done" mean?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/what_is_modalistic_monarchianism.htm">What is Modalistic Monarchianism?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Matthew 26:39 Mean</div><b>Going a little farther</b><p>Jesus steps away from Peter, James, and John (see <a href="/mark/14-35.htm">Mark 14:35</a>; <a href="/luke/22-41.htm">Luke 22:41</a>).

The eight were left, we may believe, near the entrance of the garden; the three, "apart by themselves," further on; the Master, still further, by Himself. The three heard the words that came from His lips as with a half-consciousness which revived afterwards in memory, but they were then numbed and stupefied with weariness and sorrow.

Thus it was, we are told, that "He learned obedience by the things that He suffered" (<a href="/hebrews/5-8.htm" title="Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;">Hebrews 5:8</a>). He had spoken before to the very disciples who were now near Him of the "cup" which His Father had given Him to drink (<a href="/matthew/20-23.htm" title="And he said to them, You shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not my to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.">Matthew 20:23</a>). Now the "cup" is brought to His lips, and His human will at once shrinks from it and accepts it. The prayer which He had taught His disciples to use, "Lead us not into temptation," is now His prayer, but it is subordinated to that other prayer, which is higher even than it, "Thy will be done." In the prayer "If it be possible" we recognise, as in <a href="/mark/13-32.htm" title="But of that day and that hour knows no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.">Mark 13:32</a>, the natural, necessary limits of our Lord's humanity In one sense "with God all things are possible," but even the Divine Omnipotence works through self-imposed laws, in the spiritual as in the natural world, and there also ends cannot be obtained except through their appointed and therefore necessary means. God might have redeemed mankind, men have rashly said, without the sufferings and death of the Son of Man, but the higher laws of the Divine Government made such a course, if we may venture so to speak, morally impossible.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 39.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He went a little further.</span> Deeper into the wood, beneath the gloomy shadow of the olive trees, yet so as not to feel absolutely alone. St. Luke names the distance, "He was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast." By some clerical error the genuine reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, "having gone forward," has been altered in most of the best manuscripts into <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3bd;</span>, "having approached." There can be no doubt that this latter reading is erroneous; and it is well, as occasion bids, to call attention to possible mistakes in the most important uncials. <span class="cmt_word">Fell on his face, and prayed.</span> He prostrated himself on the ground in utter abasement and desolation, yet in submission withal. In this terrible crisis there is no resource but prayer. The shadow of death enveloped him, wave and storm rolled over his soul; yet out of the deep he called unto the Lord. In the Epistle to the Hebrews (<a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7, 8</a>) some affecting details are added, "Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and having been heard for his godly fear, though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered." <span class="cmt_word">O my Father</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>). The personal pronoun is omitted in some manuscripts, but it has high authority. Only on this occasion and in his great prayer (<a href="/john/17.htm">John 17</a>.) does Christ so address the Father, his human nature in the depth of suffering retaining still the sense of this paternity. St. Mark has, "Abba, Father," as if he spake for the Hebrew race and the Gentile world. <span class="cmt_word">If it be possible;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> if there is any other way in which man may be saved and thou be glorified; if there is any other mode of redemption. It is the cry of humanity, yet conditioned by perfect submission. <span class="cmt_word">Let this cup pass from me.</span> The "cup" is the bitter agony of his Passion and death, with all their grievous accompaniments (see <a href="/matthew/20-22.htm">Matthew 20:22</a>, and note there). All heroism and manly endurance in the face of pain and death Christ exhibited to the full; but the elements of suffering in his case were different, and fraught with exquisite torture (see above, on ver. 28). Such was the anguish that it would have then separated soul and body - of such rigour that "his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground" - had not an angel appeared from heaven to strengthen and support the fainting human life (<a href="/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43, 44</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</span> In this prayer are shown the two wills of Christ, the human and Divine. The natural shrinking of the human soul from ignominy and torture is overborne by entire submission to and compliance with the Divine purpose. So it is said that the Captain of our salvation was made perfect through sufferings, learned obedience by the things which he suffered (<a href="/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>; <a href="/hebrews/5-8.htm">Hebrews 5:8</a>) By this passage the Monophysite and Monothelite heresies are clearly refuted, the two natures and two wills of Christ being plainly displayed. The three apostles saw only some part of their Master's intense agony, and heard only some broken utterances of his supplication; hence there are some slight variations in the synoptical accounts. St. Mark doubtless derived his account immediately from St Peter; the other synoptists from some other source. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/26-39.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Going</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#949;&#955;&#952;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(proelth&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4281.htm">Strong's 4281: </a> </span><span class="str2">To go forward, go on, advance; I go before, precede.
