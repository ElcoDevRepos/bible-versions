It suggests a continuation of His ministry and teaching, emphasizing His itinerant nature. The context of Jesus moving from place to place highlights His active engagement in spreading His message and encountering various groups, including those who opposed Him.<p><b>Jesus entered their synagogue</b><br>The synagogue was a central place of worship and community gathering for the Jewish people, especially during the time of Jesus. It served as a place for teaching, prayer, and reading of the Scriptures. By entering the synagogue, Jesus positioned Himself in a setting where He could engage with the religious leaders and the Jewish community. This act also demonstrates His commitment to teaching and correcting misunderstandings about the Law. The use of "their synagogue" may imply a distinction between Jesus and the religious authorities, highlighting the tension between His teachings and the established religious practices. This setting provides a backdrop for the subsequent healing miracle, which challenges the prevailing interpretations of the Sabbath law.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching and performing miracles throughout His ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/synagogue.htm">Synagogue</a></b><br>A Jewish place of worship and community gathering, where Jesus often taught and engaged with the religious leaders.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees (implied context)</a></b><br>Although not mentioned directly in this verse, they are often present in the synagogues and are key figures in the surrounding passages, challenging Jesus' teachings and actions.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/j/jesus'_commitment_to_teaching.htm">Jesus' Commitment to Teaching</a></b><br>Jesus consistently sought opportunities to teach, even in places where He faced opposition.

The narratives in St. Matthew and St. Mark convey the impression that it was on the same Sabbath. St. Luke, however, as if he had made more careful inquiry, states definitely that it was on another, and this the others do not directly contradict.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 9-14.</span> - The <span class="accented">healing of the man with the withered hand.</span> Parallel passages: <a href="/mark/3-1.htm">Mark 3:1-6</a>; <a href="/luke/6-6.htm">Luke 6:6-11</a>. In vers. 10, 11 there are reminiscences of a narrative, presumably belonging to the Framework, which is essentially preserved in <a href="/luke/14-2.htm">Luke 14:2-5</a> (cf. Weiss). In this section the opposition of the Pharisees is turned directly against our Lord himself for breaking the sabbath. Observe, however, that he did not do this for his own benefit.

Hardly the Pharisees mentioned in ver. 2, as this was a different occasion. Possibly the Galilaeans, among whom he then was (cf. <a href="/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>; <a href="/matthew/9-35.htm">Matthew 9:35</a>), or probably the Jews generally (cf. <a href="/matthew/11-1.htm">Matthew 11:1</a>, note).
