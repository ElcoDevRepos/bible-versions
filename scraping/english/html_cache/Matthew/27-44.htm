Crucifixion was a Roman practice designed to be a public spectacle and deterrent, often carried out in prominent locations like Golgotha, just outside Jerusalem. The shared experience of crucifixion with Jesus highlights the depth of His humiliation and suffering.<p><b>berated Him</b><br>The act of berating Jesus by the robbers adds to the mockery and rejection He faced. This reflects the cultural and historical context where those suffering the same fate might seek to deflect their own shame by joining in the ridicule of another.

The continuity reminds us that hostility toward the Savior was universal at the scene&#8212;religious authorities (<a href="/luke/23-35.htm">Luke 23:35</a>), soldiers (<a href="/luke/23-36.htm">Luke 23:36&#8211;37</a>), and now fellow condemned men. Isaiah had foretold this collective contempt when he prophesied the Suffering Servant would be &#8220;despised and rejected by men&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). Even while immobile on the cross, Jesus continues to fulfill Scripture.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>even the robbers</b><p>Matthew tells us that &#8220;even the robbers&#8221; hurled insults. The word &#8220;even&#8221; underscores how astonishing it is that criminals sharing His fate joined in the taunts. Their own guilt did not soften their hearts; sin blinds so thoroughly that the condemned scoff at the Innocent. Luke records that both criminals began with mockery (<a href="/luke/23-39.htm">Luke 23:39</a>), though one would later repent (<a href="/luke/23-40.htm">Luke 23:40&#8211;43</a>). <a href="/john/10-10.htm">John 10:10</a> reminds us that &#8220;the thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy,&#8221; and here the thieves&#8217; words reflect the destructive nature of unbelief.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who were crucified with Him</b><p>These men are not distant critics but literal neighbors on a cross. <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a> had prophesied that the Messiah would be &#8220;numbered with the transgressors,&#8221; and <a href="/mark/15-27.htm">Mark 15:27&#8211;28</a> confirms this fulfillment. Their proximity gave them a front-row seat to Jesus&#8217; suffering and His gracious words (&#8220;Father, forgive them,&#8221; <a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>), yet proximity without faith produced only bitterness. Being near holy things does not automatically produce holiness&#8212;<a href="/hebrews/6-4.htm">Hebrews 6:4&#8211;6</a> warns of the danger of tasting heavenly realities and still turning away.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>berated Him</b><p>The insults weren&#8217;t whispers; Matthew says they &#8220;berated Him,&#8221; voicing scorn and unbelief. <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7&#8211;8</a> anticipated this: &#8220;All who see Me mock Me; they shake their heads and say, &#8216;He trusts in the LORD; let the LORD deliver Him.&#8217;&#8221; Their mockery centered on Jesus&#8217; claim to be Savior&#8212;ironically, He was at that very moment achieving salvation for any who would believe, including one of the robbers who soon would cry, &#8220;Jesus, remember me&#8221; (<a href="/luke/23-42.htm">Luke 23:42</a>). <a href="/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a> later celebrates this paradox: &#8220;While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/27-44.htm">Matthew 27:44</a> shows that the wave of derision washing over Jesus included even those suffering beside Him. Their mocking fulfills prophecy, displays the depth of human sin, and magnifies grace&#8212;because one scoffer becomes a believer moments later, and Jesus&#8217; atoning work covers even such antagonism. The verse reminds us that no heart is too hard for Christ to soften, and no sin too vile for His cross to forgive.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(44) <span class= "bld">The thieves also . . . cast the same in his teeth.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">reviled Him.</span> On the change which afterwards came over one of them, see Note on <a href="/luke/23-40.htm" title="But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Do not you fear God, seeing you are in the same condemnation?">Luke 23:40</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 44.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The thieves also... cast the same in his teeth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, <span class="accented">were reviling him</span>). The mention of the penitent robber is found only in Luke (<a href="/luke/23-39.htm">Luke 23:39-42</a>). It does not seem to have occurred in the traditional account followed by Matthew and Mark. Augustine thought that these synoptists used the plural for the singular, referring, in fact, to the impenitent malefactor. It is more likely that both the thieves at first joined the mob in their abuse and ribaldry, but that one, after a time, persuaded by the Divine patience and meekness of the Saviour, and awed by the gathering darkness, repented, confessed, and was forgiven. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-44.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">In the same way,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;</span> <span class="translit">(auto)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Neuter 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
