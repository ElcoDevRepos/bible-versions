Lightning is often associated with God's power and presence in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a> during the giving of the Law at Mount Sinai. This imagery conveys a sense of awe and fear, highlighting the angel's role as a messenger of God. The brightness and suddenness of lightning also symbolize the revelation of God's truth and the breaking in of the divine into the earthly realm. This description aligns with other biblical accounts of angelic appearances, such as in <a href="/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>, where an angel is described with a face like lightning.<p><b>and his clothes were white as snow</b><br>The whiteness of the angel's clothes signifies purity, holiness, and righteousness. In biblical symbolism, white garments often represent the righteousness of God and those who are in His presence. This imagery is consistent with other scriptural references, such as in <a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>, where the faithful are promised to be clothed in white garments. The comparison to snow, which is pure and unstained, further emphasizes the angel's divine origin and the message of resurrection and new life. This description also connects to the transfiguration of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/17-2.htm">Matthew 17:2</a>, where His clothes became as white as light, indicating His divine glory. The use of snow, a natural element, underscores the purity and perfection of the heavenly realm.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the Lord</a></b><br>The angel is a divine messenger who appears at the tomb of Jesus.

The description is straightforward: the angel literally blazed with sudden, overwhelming brilliance.<p>&#8226; Lightning is a visible sign of God&#8217;s power and presence. When the Lord descended on Sinai, &#8220;there were thunder and lightning flashes&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>). The same dazzling quality now surrounds the heavenly messenger who announces the risen Christ.<p>&#8226; Daniel saw a similar figure: &#8220;his face like the brilliance of lightning&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/10-6.htm">Daniel 10:6</a>), underscoring continuity between Old Testament visions and this New Testament event.<p>&#8226; Lightning is fast, uncontrollable, and awe-inspiring; its very nature provokes reverent fear. The guards respond exactly that way in the next verse, trembling and becoming &#8220;like dead men.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The image also anticipates the glorified Christ, whose return will be &#8220;like lightning that flashes and lights up the sky&#8221; (<a href="/luke/17-24.htm">Luke 17:24</a>). The resurrection morning therefore foreshadows the final victory still to come.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and his clothes were white as snow</b><p>The sentence continues, &#8220;and his clothes were white as snow.&#8221; Again, the language is literal: pure whiteness that no earthly laundering could achieve.<p>&#8226; White garments signal holiness and absolute purity. Daniel saw the Ancient of Days: &#8220;His clothing was white as snow&#8221; (<a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9</a>). The angel shares the spotless character of the God he serves.<p>&#8226; At Jesus&#8217; transfiguration &#8220;His clothes became radiant, exceedingly white&#8221; (<a href="/mark/9-3.htm">Mark 9:3</a>). The same dazzling purity that once surrounded the Son now surrounds the messenger who proclaims the Son&#8217;s victory over death.<p>&#8226; Revelation pictures the redeemed &#8220;clothed in white&#8221; (<a href="/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5</a>), linking spotless garments with victory and righteousness. The angel&#8217;s attire announces that Christ&#8217;s triumph has secured true purity for His people.<p>&#8226; Snow suggests freshness and cleansing; Isaiah declares, &#8220;Though your sins are scarlet, they shall be as white as snow&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>). The resurrection signals that such cleansing is now accomplished in Christ.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/28-3.htm">Matthew 28:3</a> presents a literal, eye-witness glimpse of a heavenly messenger whose blazing face and snow-white robe testify to God&#8217;s power, purity, and victory. The lightning-like appearance mirrors the awesome presence of God at Sinai and prefigures Christ&#8217;s glorious return, while the spotless clothing proclaims the holiness and cleansing made certain by the resurrection. Together these details assure us that God has decisively acted, the tomb is empty, and the risen Savior reigns in unmatched splendor.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/28.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(3) <span class= "bld">Like lightning.</span>--The word employed by St. Luke to describe the "raiment has the same force.
