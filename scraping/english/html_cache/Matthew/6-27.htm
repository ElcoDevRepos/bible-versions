In the biblical context, worry is seen as a lack of trust in God's provision and sovereignty. The Greek word used here for "worry" can also mean "anxious care," which is often associated with a divided mind. This phrase challenges the listener to consider the futility of anxiety, as it distracts from faith and reliance on God. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus addresses the crowd, many of whom were likely concerned about daily needs, emphasizing that worry does not align with a life of faith.<p><b>can add a single hour</b><br>The phrase "add a single hour" can also be translated as "add a cubit to his stature," indicating the impossibility of altering one's life span or physical attributes through worry. This reflects the limitations of human control over life and time, which are ultimately in God's hands. The imagery of adding a cubit, a measure of length, underscores the futility of trying to extend life through human effort. This echoes the wisdom literature of the Old Testament, such as Ecclesiastes, which speaks to the vanity of human striving apart from God.<p><b>to his life?</b><br>Life, in biblical terms, is a gift from God, and its duration is determined by Him. The rhetorical question posed by Jesus highlights the ineffectiveness of worry in changing the course of one's life. This teaching aligns with other scriptural passages that emphasize God's care and provision, such as <a href="/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>, which speaks of God's knowledge of our days before they come to be. The focus is on trusting God for the present and future, as seen in the broader context of <a href="/matthew/6.htm">Matthew 6</a>, where Jesus encourages seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, a foundational teaching moment in His ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples_and_followers.htm">Disciples and Followers</a></b><br>The primary audience of the Sermon on the Mount, representing all believers who seek to live according to Jesus' teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/s/sermon_on_the_mount.htm">Sermon on the Mount</a></b><br>A significant event in the New Testament where Jesus provides moral and spiritual guidance, covering various aspects of life and faith.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_futility_of_worry.htm">The Futility of Worry</a></b><br>Worrying does not change circumstances or extend life.

Rather than adding hours through fretting, we gain peace by resting in His perfect care and surrendered sovereignty.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">One cubit unto his stature.</span>--The Greek for the last word admits either this meaning (as in <a href="/luke/19-3.htm" title="And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature.">Luke 19:3</a>, and perhaps <a href="/luke/2-52.htm" title="And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.">Luke 2:52</a>) or that of age (as in <a href="/john/9-21.htm" title="But by what means he now sees, we know not; or who has opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.">John 9:21</a>; <a href="/john/9-23.htm" title="Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.">John 9:23</a>, and <a href="/hebrews/11-24.htm" title="By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;">Hebrews 11:24</a>). Either gives an adequate sense to the passage. No anxiety will alter our bodily height, and the other conditions of our life are as fixed by God's laws as that is, as little therefore dependent upon our volition; neither will that anxiety add to the length of life which God has appointed for us. Of the two meanings, however, the last best satisfies the teaching of the context. Men are not anxious about adding to their stature. They are often anxious about prolonging their life. Admit the thought that our days are but "as a span long" (<a href="/psalms/39-5.htm" title="Behold, you have made my days as an handbreadth; and my age is as nothing before you: truly every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.">Psalm 39:5</a>), and then the addition of a cubit becomes a natural metaphor. It is to be noted that in the parallel passage in St. Luke (<a href="/luke/12-26.htm" title="If you then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take you thought for the rest?">Luke 12:26</a>) this appears as "that which is least," and which yet lies beyond our power. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <a href="/luke/12-25.htm">Luke 12:25</a> almost verbally.
