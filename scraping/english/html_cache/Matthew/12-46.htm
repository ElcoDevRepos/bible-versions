The setting is likely a public place, possibly a house or open area, where large groups could gather. Jesus often taught in parables and used these opportunities to reveal the truths of the Kingdom of God. The crowds were a mix of followers, skeptics, and those curious about His teachings and miracles. This scene reflects the growing popularity and influence of Jesus' ministry, as well as the increasing tension with religious leaders who were often present in these gatherings.<p><b>His mother and brothers stood outside</b><br>The mention of Jesus' family highlights His human relationships and the reality of His earthly life. Mary, His mother, and His brothers, likely including James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas (<a href="/matthew/13-55.htm">Matthew 13:55</a>), are present. This indicates that Jesus had a typical family structure, which is significant in understanding His full humanity. The fact that they stood outside suggests a physical separation from the crowd, possibly due to the size of the gathering or their desire to speak with Him privately. This moment also foreshadows the tension between Jesus' spiritual mission and His earthly family ties, as seen in other parts of the Gospels.<p><b>wanting to speak to Him</b><br>The desire of His family to speak with Him may imply concern or urgency. In the cultural context of the time, family obligations were paramount, and it was unusual for someone to prioritize public ministry over family duties. This request could reflect their concern for His well-being, given the growing opposition from religious authorities, or a misunderstanding of His mission. This moment sets the stage for Jesus to teach about the nature of spiritual kinship, emphasizing that His true family consists of those who do the will of His Father in heaven, as He explains in the following verses. This teaching aligns with the broader biblical theme of spiritual adoption and the redefinition of family in the Kingdom of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching the crowds in this passage.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_mother.htm">His Mother (Mary)</a></b><br>The earthly mother of Jesus, known for her faith and obedience to God's will.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/his_brothers.htm">His Brothers</a></b><br>Likely referring to Jesus' half-brothers, the sons of Mary and Joseph, who at this point may not fully understand His mission.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowds.htm">The Crowds</a></b><br>The people gathered around Jesus, listening to His teachings, representing a diverse group with varying levels of belief and understanding.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/o/outside.htm">Outside</a></b><br>Indicates a physical separation between Jesus and His family, symbolizing a deeper spiritual teaching about the nature of His true family.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_kinship_over_biological_ties.htm">Spiritual Kinship Over Biological Ties</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes that spiritual relationships, based on faith and obedience to God's will, are more significant than biological connections.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_discipleship.htm">The Call to Discipleship</a></b><br>Following Jesus may require prioritizing His mission and teachings over familial expectations or traditions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_jesus'_mission.htm">Understanding Jesus' Mission</a></b><br>Jesus' family, like many others, struggled to understand His divine mission.

The question is one which we cannot answer with any approximation to certainty. The facts in the Gospel records are scanty. In what we gather from the Fathers we find not so much traditions as conjectures based upon assumptions. The facts, such as they are, are these: (1.) The Greek word translated "brother" is a word which has just the same latitude as the term in English. Like that, it might be applied (as in the case of Joseph and his brethren) to half-brothers, or brothers by adoption, or used in the wider sense of national or religious brotherhood. There is no adequate evidence that the term was applied to cousins as such. (2.) The names of four brethren are given in <a href="/mark/6-3.htm" title="Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.">Mark 6:3</a>, as James (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Jacob) and Joses and Juda and Simon. Three of these names (James, Juda, Simon) are found in the third group of four in the lists of the twelve Apostles. This has suggested to some the thought that they had been chosen by our Lord to that office, and the fact that a disciple bearing the name of Joses was nearly chosen to fill the place of Judas Iscariot (<a href="/acts/1-23.htm" title="And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.">Acts 1:23</a>, in many MSS.) presents another curious coincidence. This inference is, however, set aside by the fact distinctly stated by St. John (<a href="/john/7-3.htm" title="His brothers therefore said to him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that your disciples also may see the works that you do.">John 7:3</a>), and implied in this narrative and in our Lord's reference to a prophet being without honour in his father's house (<a href="/matthew/13-57.htm" title="And they were offended in him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.">Matthew 13:57</a>; <a href="/mark/6-4.htm" title="But Jesus, said to them, A prophet is not without honor, but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house.">Mark 6:4</a>), that up to the time of the Feast of Tabernacles that preceded the Crucifixion, within six months of the close of our Lord's ministry, His brethren did not believe in His claims to be the Christ. The names, it must be remembered, were so common that they might be found in any family. (3.) Sisters are mentioned in <a href="/mark/6-3.htm" title="Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.">Mark 6:3</a>, but we know nothing of their number, or names, or after-history, or belief or unbelief. It is clear that these facts do not enable us to decide whether the brothers and sisters were children of Mary and Joseph, or children of Joseph by a former marriage--either an actual marriage on his own account, or what was known as a Levirate marriage (<a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm" title="If brothers dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without to a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in to her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother to her.">Deuteronomy 25:5</a>), for the sake of raising up seed to a deceased brother--or the children of Mary's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas (<a href="/john/19-25.htm" title="Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.">John 19:25</a>). The fact of the same name being borne by two sisters, as the last theory implies, though strange, is not incredible, as by names might come into play to distinguish between them. Each of these views has been maintained with much elaborate ingenuity, and by some writers these brethren, assumed to be sons of Clopas, have been identified (in spite of the above objection, which is absolutely fatal to the theory) with the sons of Alphaeus in the list of Apostles. When the course of Christian thought led to an ever-increasing reverence for the mother of the Lord, and for virginity as the condition of all higher forms of holiness, the belief in her perpetual maidenhood passed into a dogma, and drove men to fall back upon one of the other hypotheses as to the brethren. It is a slight argument in their favour, (1) that it would have been natural had there been other children borne by the mother of the Lord, that the fact should have been recorded by the Evangelists, as in the family narratives of the Old Testament (<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> Genesis 5, 11; 1 Chronicles 1, 2), and that there is no record of any such birth in either of the two Gospels that give "the book of the generations" of Jesus; (2) that the tone of the brethren, their unbelief, their attempts to restrain Him, suggest the thought of their being <span class= "ital">elder</span> brothers in some sense, rather than such as had been trained in reverential love for the first-born of the house; (3) that it is scarcely probable that our Lord should have committed His mother to the care of the disciple whom He loved (<a href="/john/19-26.htm" title="When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he said to his mother, Woman, behold your son!">John 19:26</a>) had she had children of her own, whose duty it was to protect and cherish her; (4) the absence of any later mention of the sisters at or after the time of the Crucifixion suggests the same conclusion, as falling in with the idea of the sisters and brethren being in some sense a distinct family, with divided interests; (5) lastly, though we enter here on the uncertain region of feeling, if we accept the narratives of the birth and infancy given by St. Matthew and St. Luke, it is at least conceivable that the mysterious awfulness of the work so committed to him may have led Joseph to rest in the task of loving guardianship which thus became at once the duty and the blessedness of the remainder of his life. On the whole, then, I incline to rest in the belief that the so-called "brethren" were cousins who, through some unrecorded circumstances, had been so far adopted into the household at Nazareth as to be known by the term of nearer relationship. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 46-50</span> - <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> <span class="accented">The opposition that our Lord met with from his relations.</span> He shows that not natural but spiritual relationship is all-important.
