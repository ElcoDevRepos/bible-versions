In the New Testament, the twelve apostles were chosen by Jesus to be His closest followers and to spread His teachings. The number twelve is significant, symbolizing the twelve tribes of Israel, indicating a new spiritual Israel. This selection marks a pivotal moment in Jesus' ministry, as He prepares to extend His mission through these chosen individuals.<p><b>first Simon, called Peter,</b><br>Simon, later named Peter by Jesus, is often listed first among the apostles, signifying his leadership role. The name Peter means "rock," and Jesus later declares that Peter will be the rock upon which He will build His church (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>). Peter's leadership is evident throughout the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, where he often acts as a spokesperson for the group.<p><b>and his brother Andrew;</b><br>Andrew, Peter's brother, was originally a disciple of John the Baptist before following Jesus. He is known for bringing others to Christ, including his brother Peter (<a href="/john/1-40.htm">John 1:40-42</a>). Andrew's role highlights the importance of personal evangelism and the impact of bringing others to Jesus.<p><b>James son of Zebedee,</b><br>James, the son of Zebedee, is often referred to as James the Greater to distinguish him from the other apostle named James. He, along with his brother John, was part of Jesus' inner circle, witnessing key events such as the Transfiguration (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-2</a>). James was the first apostle to be martyred, as recorded in <a href="/acts/12-2.htm">Acts 12:2</a>, which underscores the cost of discipleship.<p><b>and his brother John;</b><br>John, the brother of James, is traditionally believed to be the author of the Gospel of John, the three Epistles of John, and the Book of Revelation. Known as the "beloved disciple," John had a close relationship with Jesus and was entrusted with the care of Jesus' mother, Mary, at the crucifixion (<a href="/john/19-26.htm">John 19:26-27</a>). His writings emphasize love and truth, central themes in the Christian faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/simon_peter.htm">Simon Peter</a></b><br>Originally named Simon, he was a fisherman by trade and became one of Jesus' closest disciples.

By listing them, the Spirit emphasizes that the gospel is anchored in real people, real history, and a real commission (<a href="/acts/1-2.htm">Acts 1:2</a>).

(1.) The name of Peter is always first, that of Judas always last. In the former case we recognise acknowledged preeminence. The position of the latter may have been the consequence of the infamy which attached to the name of the traitor; but it is possible (and this may have been one of the elements that entered into his guilt) that his place had always been one of inferiority.<p>(2.) All the lists divide themselves into three groups of four, the persons in each group being always the same (assuming that the three names, Judas the <span class= "ital">brother</span> (?) of James, Thaddaeus, and Lebbaeus, belong to the same person), though the order in each group varies.<p>(3.) The first group includes the two sons of Jona and the two sons of Zebedee, whose twofold call is related in <a href="/context/matthew/4-18.htm" title="And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.">Matthew 4:18-21</a>, <a href="/john/1-40.htm" title="One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.">John 1:40</a>. In two lists (Mark and Acts) the name of Andrew stands last; in two (Matt. and Luke) that of John. In none of them are the names of Peter and John coupled together, as might have been expected from their close companionship (<a href="/john/20-2.htm" title="Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.">John 20:2</a>; <a href="/acts/3-1.htm" title="Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.">Acts 3:1</a>). The four obviously occupied the innermost place in the company of the Twelve, and were chosen out of the chosen.

Something seems to have excluded Andrew, though he had been the first called of all (<a href="/john/1-40.htm" title="One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.">John 1:40</a>), from this intimate companionship; but we find him joined with the other three as called to listen to the great prophetic discourse on the Mount of Olives (<a href="/mark/13-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,">Mark 13:3</a>). All the four appear to have come from Bethsaida, on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - THE NAMES OF THE AGENTS. Parallel passages: <a href="/mark/3-14.htm">Mark 3:14-19</a>; <a href="/luke/6-13.htm">Luke 6:13-16</a> (cf. <a href="/acts/1-13.htm">Acts 1:13</a>). This Commentary upon St. Luke deals so fully both with the list as a whole and with the separate names that it will not be necessary to say much here. Observe that the general agreement in arrangement points to some common basis underlying all four accounts; also that of these the one found in the Acts is the briefest, giving little more than the bare names; and that that found in our Gospel, on the contrary, is the fullest, containing, with two exceptions (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>), the details mentioned in one or other of the parallels, and adding two of its own. It mentions, in one instance or more, the parentage (Zebedee, Alphaeus), the relationship ("his brother... his brother"), the birthplace (Kerioth), the earlier occupation and religious standpoint ("publican... Zealot"), and, with a bare hint at the beginning (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>), but a clear statement at the end, the after-history ("first... who also betrayed him") of the apostles. The two omissions are the fact that our Lord added the names of Peter (parallels, but really given earlier, <a href="/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>) and Boanerges (Mark). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now</span> <span class="cmt_word">the names,</span> In the parallels part of the word "names" is found as a verb, "whom also he named apostles;" <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the naming there refers, not to the individuals, but to their office. Is the form found in our Gospel an "accidental" rearrangement due to a reminiscence that the word "name" occurred in the earliest source, or is it possible that the two facts are connected, and that the individuals received a new name when they definitely entered on a new office? That they should have received a new name seems <span class="accented">a</span> <span class="accented">priori</span> not improbable, but the evidence is very slight. "Peter" is a clear case, for though the name <span class="accented">was</span> given earlier, it would receive a new application now, and perhaps was now again expressly given (cf. parallel passages); and other cases may be St. Matthew (<span class="accented">vide</span> Introduction, p. 21.) and possibly St. Bartholomew and St. Thaddaeus. Mark expressly says that the term "<span class="accented">Boanerges"</span> was given to the sons of Zebedee; but as there is no evidence that either St. James or St. John was afterwards known by this name, it need not have been a name in the same sense in which the others were. Observe the formal order of the first words of this verse (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>). Did the author of the Gospel take them from the heading of a section that already contained the names in order? If so the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;</span> would probably not have existed there, and it is worth noting that the original hand of D, the manuscript that is of special value for Palestinian tradition, omits it. <span class="cmt_word">Of the twelve</span> (ver. 1, note) <span class="cmt_word">apostles</span> (ver. 5, note) <span class="cmt_word">are these: The first</span>. This, perhaps, refers to the order of call, <a href="/luke/5-1.htm">Luke 5:1</a> (Nosgen), but more probably to the leading position that St. Peter held among the twelve. On this leadership, cf. the fragmentary excursus by Bishop Lightfoot, printed in 'Clement of Rome,' 2. 487 (1890). <span class="cmt_word">Simon</span>. His Hebrew name was Simeon (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5de;&#x5e2;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>, <a href="/acts/15-14.htm">Acts 15:14</a>, and <a href="/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>, in the Received Text and Westcott and Herr margin), but his Gentile name (<a href="/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a>, note) was Simon, this good Greek name being chosen as almost identical in sound.
