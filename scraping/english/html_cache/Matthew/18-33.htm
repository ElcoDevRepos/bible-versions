The context is forgiveness and mercy, central themes in Jesus' teachings. The servant in question had been forgiven a massive debt by the king, symbolizing God's forgiveness of our sins. The expectation of showing mercy to others is a reflection of the mercy we receive from God. This aligns with the teachings in the Lord's Prayer, where we ask God to forgive our debts as we forgive our debtors (<a href="/matthew/6-12.htm">Matthew 6:12</a>). The cultural context of the time emphasized honor and reciprocity, making the servant's lack of mercy even more egregious.<p><b>just as I had on you?</b><br>This phrase highlights the expectation of reciprocal mercy. The king's forgiveness of the servant's debt is a type of Christ's atoning work, where He pays the debt of sin for humanity. The servant's failure to extend the same mercy to his fellow servant is a direct violation of the principle of grace. This mirrors the biblical principle found in <a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>, which calls believers to be kind and compassionate, forgiving each other just as in Christ God forgave them. The historical context of debt and servitude in ancient times underscores the gravity of the servant's actions, as debt could lead to imprisonment or slavery, making the king's initial act of mercy even more profound.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Represents God, who is merciful and forgiving.

The Master&#8217;s question uncovers hypocrisy&#8212;receiving lavish grace while demanding strict payment from others. By contrasting God&#8217;s immeasurable mercy with our neighbor&#8217;s small debts, Jesus calls us to extend the same compassionate release we have enjoyed. Anything less denies the gospel&#8217;s power and invites the very judgment we once escaped.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(33) <span class= "bld">Even as I had pity on thee.</span>--The comparison of the two acts, the implied assumption that the pity of the one act would be after the pattern of the other, was, we may believe, designed to lead the disciples to the true meaning of the prayer they had been taught to use, "Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 33.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Compassion...pity.</span> The same verb is used in both places. <span class="accented">Shouldest not thou also have had mercy on thy fellow servant, even as I had mercy on thee?</span> (Revised Version). The man's guilt lies in his unmercifulness in the face of mercy received. The fact is patent; it stands for itself; it needs no amplification or enforcement. The king says no more, and the delinquent is equally silent; he has no excuse to offer. Convicted by his own conscience, he knows it is useless to sue for pardon or to expect further leniency. So in the day of judgment no excuse can be admitted; it is too late to plead or argue when the sentence is past. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/18-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Should</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#948;&#949;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(edei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Imperfect Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1163.htm">Strong's 1163: </a> </span><span class="str2">Third person singular active present of deo; also deon deh-on'; neuter active participle of the same; both used impersonally; it is Necessary.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">you</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(se)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
