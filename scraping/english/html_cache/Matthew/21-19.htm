The location "by the road" suggests accessibility and visibility, indicating that the tree was in a place where it should have been fruitful. Fig trees typically bear fruit before or with their leaves, so seeing a leafy tree would imply the presence of fruit.<p><b>He went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves</b><br>This phrase highlights the expectation of fruitfulness. In the Old Testament, Israel is often symbolized by a fig tree (<a href="/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>, <a href="/jeremiah/8-13.htm">Jeremiah 8:13</a>). The absence of fruit despite the presence of leaves can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual barrenness, where outward appearances do not match inner reality. This reflects Jesus' critique of religious leaders who appeared righteous but lacked true spiritual fruit.<p><b>&#8220;May you never bear fruit again!&#8221; He said</b><br>Jesus' pronouncement is a prophetic act symbolizing judgment. The fig tree represents those who fail to produce spiritual fruit despite having the appearance of godliness. This act foreshadows the judgment on Israel for not recognizing the Messiah and serves as a warning to all believers about the importance of genuine faith and fruitfulness (<a href="/john/15-2.htm">John 15:2</a>, <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>).<p><b>And immediately the tree withered</b><br>The immediate withering of the tree demonstrates Jesus' authority over creation and serves as a visible sign of divine judgment. This act is unique in the Gospels and underscores the seriousness of spiritual unfruitfulness. It also connects to the broader biblical theme of God's judgment on those who do not live according to His will (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>). The withering serves as a powerful reminder of the consequences of failing to bear fruit in keeping with repentance (<a href="/matthew/3-8.htm">Matthew 3:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, who performs the miracle of cursing the fig tree.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fig_tree.htm">The Fig Tree</a></b><br>A symbol of fruitlessness and judgment, representing Israel's spiritual barrenness.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>Witnesses to the event, who later question Jesus about the significance of the withered fig tree.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The city near which this event takes place, symbolizing the religious center of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_road.htm">The Road</a></b><br>The setting of the event, indicating Jesus' journey and His mission.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/s/symbolism_of_the_fig_tree.htm">Symbolism of the Fig Tree</a></b><br>The fig tree represents Israel, and its fruitlessness symbolizes spiritual barrenness and the failure to live up to God's expectations.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/j/judgment_and_accountability.htm">Judgment and Accountability</a></b><br>Just as the fig tree was judged for its lack of fruit, believers are called to bear spiritual fruit and will be held accountable for their faithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_genuine_faith.htm">The Importance of Genuine Faith</a></b><br>True faith is evidenced by action and fruitfulness.

Outward show without inward reality invites swift judgment, while abiding in Christ yields the only fruit that endures.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">In the way.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">on the road.</span> Fig-trees were often planted by the road-side under the notion that dust suited them.<p><span class= "bld">He came to it.</span>--St. Mark adds, what St. Matthew indeed implies, that He came, if "haply He might find anything thereon." The fig-tree in Palestine bears two or three crops a year. Josephus, indeed, says that fruit might be found on the trees in Judaea for ten months out of the twelve. Commonly at the beginning of April the trees that still grow out of the rocks between Bethany and Jerusalem are bare both of leaves and fruit, and so probably it was now with all but the single tree which attracted our Lord's notice. It was in full foliage, and being so far in advance of its fellows it might not unnaturally have been expected to have had, in the first week of April, the "first ripe fruit" (<a href="/hosea/9-10.htm" title="I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at her first time: but they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves to that shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.">Hosea 9:10</a>), which usually was gathered in May. So, in Song <a href="/songs/2-13.htm" title="The fig tree puts forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.">Song of Solomon 2:13</a>, the appearance of the "green figs" coincides with that of the flowers of spring, and the time of the singing of birds. The illustrations from the branches and leaves of the fig-tree in <a href="/context/luke/21-29.htm" title="And he spoke to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all the trees;">Luke 21:29-30</a>, suggest that the season was a somewhat forward one. On the special difficulty connected with St. Mark's statement, "the time of figs was not yet," see Note on <a href="/mark/11-13.htm" title="And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.">Mark 11:13</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever.</span>--From the lips of one of like passions with ourselves, the words might seem the utterance of impatient disappointment. Here they assume the character of a solemn judgment passed not so much on the tree as on that of which it became the representative. The Jews, in their show of the "leaves" of outward devotion, in the absence of the "fruits" of righteousness, were as that barren tree. But a few weeks before (<a href="/luke/13-6.htm" title="He spoke also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.">Luke 13:6</a>) He had taken the fig-tree to which "a man came seeking fruit and finding none," as a parable of the state of Israel. Then the sentence, "Cut it down," had been delayed, as in the hope of a possible amendment. Now, what He saw flashed upon Him in a moment (if we may so speak) as the parable embodied. The disappointment of the expectations which He had formed in His human craving for food was like the disappointment of the owner of the fig-tree in the parable. The sentence which He now passed on the tree, and its immediate fulfilment, were symbols of the sentence and the doom which were about to fall on the unrepentant and unbelieving people. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he saw a</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">a single</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>fig tree in the way.</span> The tree stood all alone in a conspicuous situation by the roadside, as if courting observation. It was allowable to pluck and eat fruit in an orchard (<a href="/deuteronomy/23-24.htm">Deuteronomy 23:24, 25</a>); but this tree, placed where it was, seemed to be common property, belonging to no private owner. The sight of the leaves thereon, as St. Mark tells us, attracted the notice of Christ, who beheld with pleasure the prospect of relieving his long abstinence with the refreshment of cool and juicy fruit. <span class="cmt_word">He came to it.</span> Knowing the nature of the tree, and that under some circumstances the fruit ripens before the leaves are fully out, Jesus naturally expected to find on it some figs fit to eat. Further, besides the fruit which comes to maturity in the usual way during the summer, there are often late figs produced in autumn which hang on the tree during winter, and ripen at the reawakening of vegetation in the spring. The vigour of this particular tree was apparently proved by the luxuriance of its foliage, and it might reasonably be expected to retain some of its winter produce. <span class="cmt_word">Found nothing thereon, but leaves only</span>. It was all outward show, promise without performance, seeming precocity with no adequate results. There is no question here of Christ's omniscience being at fault. He acted as a man would act; he was not deceived himself nor did he deceive the apostles, though they at first misapprehended his purpose. The whole action was symbolical, and was meant so to appear. In strict propriety of conduct, as a man led by the appearance of the tree might act, he carried out the figure, at the same time showing, by his treatment of this inanimate object, that he had something higher in view, and that he does not mean that which his outward conduct seemed to imply. He is enacting a parable where all the parts are in due keeping, and all have their twofold signification in the world of nature and the world of grace. The hunger is real, the tree is real, the expectation of fruit legitimate, the barrenness disappointing and criminal; the spiritual side, however, is left to be inferred, and, as we shall see, only one of many possible lessons is drawn from the result of the incident. <span class="cmt_word">Let no fruit grow on thee</span> (<span class="accented">let there be no fruit from thee</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>henceforward forever</span>. Such is the sentence passed on this ostentations tree. Christ addresses it as if replying to the profession made by its show of leaves. It had the sap of life, it had power to produce luxuriant leaves; therefore it might and ought to have borne fruit. It vaunted itself as being superior to its neighbours, and the boast was utterly empty. <span class="cmt_word">Presently</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the fig tree withered away.</span> The process was doubtless gradual, commencing at Christ's word, and continuing till the tree died; but St. Matthew completes the account at once, giving in one picture the event, with its surroundings and results. It was a moral necessity that what had incurred Christ's censure should perish; the spiritual controlled the material; the higher overbore the lower. Thus the designed teaching was placed in visible shape before the eyes, and silently uttered its important lesson. It has been remarked (by Neander) that we are not to suppose that the tree thus handled was previously altogether sound and healthy. Its show of leaves at an unusual period without fruit may point to some abnormal development of activity which was consequent upon some radical defect. Had it been in vigorous health, it would not have been a fitting symbol of the Jewish Church; nor would it have corresponded with the idea which Christ designed to bring to the notice of his apostles. There was already some process at work which would have issued in decay, and Christ's curse merely accelerated this natural result. This is considered to be the only instance in which our Lord exerted his miraculous power in destruction; all his other actions were beneficent, saving, gracious. The drowning of the swine at Gadara was only permitted for a wise purpose; it was not commanded or inflicted by him. The whole transaction in our text is mysterious. That the Son of man should show wrath against a senseless tree, as tree, is, of course, not conceivable. Them was an apparent unfitness, if not injustice, in the proceeding, which at once demonstrated that the tree was not the real object of the action - that something more important was in view. Christ does not treat trees as moral agents, responsible for life and action. He uses inanimate objects to convey lessons to men, dealing with them according to his good pleasure, even his supreme will, which is the law by which they are controlled. In themselves they have no fault and incur no punishment, but they are treated in such a way as to profit the nobler creatures of God's hand. There may have been two reasons for Christ's conduct which were not set prominently forward at the time. First, he desired to show his power, his absolute control, over material forces, so that, in what was about to happen to him, his apostles might be sure that he suffered not through weakness or compulsion, but because he willed to have it so. This would prepare his followers for his own and their coming trials. Then there was another great lesson taught by the sign. The fig tree is a symbol of the Jewish Church. The prophets had used both it. and the vine in this connection (comp. <a href="/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>), and our Lord himself makes an unmistakable allusion in his parable of the fig tree planted in the vineyard, from which the owner for three years sought fruit in vain (<a href="/luke/13-6.htm">Luke 13:6</a>, etc.). Many of his subsequent discourses are, as it were, commentaries upon this incident (see vers. 28-44; <a href="/matthew/22-1.htm">Matthew 22:1-14</a>; <a href="/matthew/23.htm">Matthew 23-25</a>.). Here was a parable enacted. The Saviour had seen this tree, the Jewish Church, afar off, looking down upon it from heaven; it was one, single, standing conspicuous among all nations as that whereon the Lord had lavished most care, that which ought to have shown the effect of this culture in abundant produce of holiness and righteousness. But what was the result? Boasting to be children of Abraham, the special heritage of Jehovah, gifted with highest privileges, the sole possessors of the knowledge of God, the Israelites professed to have what no other people had, and were in reality empty and bare. There was plenty of outward show - rites, ceremonies, scrupulous observances, much speaking - but no real devotion, no righteousness, no heart worship, no good works. Other nations, indeed, were equally fruitless, but they did not profess to be holy; they were sinners, and offered no cloak for their sinfulness. The Jews were no less unrighteous; but they were hypocrites, and boasted of the good which they had not. Other nations were unproductive, for their time had not come; but for Israel the season had arrived; she ought to have been the first to accept the Messiah, to unite the new with the old fruit, to pass from the Law to the gospel, and to learn and practise the lesson of faith. Perfect fruit was not yet to be expected; but Israel's sin was that she vaunted her perfection, counted herself sound and whole, while rotten at the very core, and barren of all good results. Her falsehood, hypocrisy, and arrogant complacency were fearfully punished. The terms of the curse pronounced by the Judge are very emphatic. It denounces perpetual barrenness on the Jewish Church and people. From Judaea was to have gone forth the healing of the nations; from it all peoples of the earth were to be blessed. The complete fulfilment of this promise is no longer in the literal Israel; she is nothing in the world; no one resorts to her for food and refreshment; she has none to offer the wayfarer. For eighteen centuries has that fruitlessness continued; the withered tree still stands, a monument of unbelief and its punishment. The Lord's sentence, "forever," must be understood with some limitation. In his parable of the fig tree, which adumbrates the last days, he intimates that it shall some day bud and blossom, and be clothed once more with leaf and fruit; and St. Paul looks forward to the conversion of Israel, when the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled (<a href="/romans/11-23.htm">Romans 11:23-26</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-19.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Seeing</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7984;&#948;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(id&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3708.htm">Strong's 3708: </a> </span><span class="str2">Properly, to stare at, i.e. to discern clearly; by extension, to attend to; by Hebraism, to experience; passively, to appear.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">a</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#943;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(mian)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1520.htm">Strong's 1520: </a> </span><span class="str2">One.
