The act of summoning indicates a call to account, reflecting the biblical principle that all will stand before God to give an account of their actions (<a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>). This summoning is a reminder of divine authority and the accountability each person has before God.<p><b>and said, &#8216;You wicked servant!</b><br>The term "wicked" highlights the moral failing of the servant, who, despite receiving mercy, failed to extend it to others. This reflects the biblical teaching that wickedness is not just about actions but also the condition of the heart (<a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>). The servant's behavior contrasts with the righteousness expected of those who have received God's grace.<p><b>I forgave all your debt</b><br>The forgiveness of debt symbolizes the immense grace and mercy God extends to humanity. In biblical times, debt was a serious matter, often leading to slavery or imprisonment. The complete forgiveness of debt signifies the totality of God's forgiveness of sin, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>, where God removes transgressions as far as the east is from the west.<p><b>because you begged me.</b><br>This phrase underscores the importance of humility and repentance in receiving God's mercy. The servant's initial plea for mercy mirrors the sinner's cry for salvation. It reflects the biblical principle that God is compassionate and responsive to those who earnestly seek His forgiveness (<a href="/2_chronicles/7-14.htm">2 Chronicles 7:14</a>, <a href="/luke/18-13.htm">Luke 18:13-14</a>).
