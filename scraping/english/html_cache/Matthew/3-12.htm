The winnowing fork was a tool used in agriculture to separate grain from chaff. In biblical times, this process involved tossing the harvested grain into the air so that the wind could blow away the lighter chaff, leaving the heavier grain to fall back to the ground. This imagery is used to depict the Messiah's role in discerning and separating the righteous from the wicked. The presence of the winnowing fork "in His hand" indicates readiness and authority to execute judgment.<p><b>to clear His threshing floor</b><br>The threshing floor is a place of separation and purification. In ancient Israel, it was a flat surface where the harvested grain was threshed and winnowed. Spiritually, it represents the world or the community of believers where God will purify and refine His people. This clearing signifies a thorough and decisive action, emphasizing the completeness of the judgment process.<p><b>and to gather His wheat into the barn</b><br>The wheat represents the righteous, those who are faithful and obedient to God. Gathering into the barn signifies protection, preservation, and reward. This imagery aligns with the parable of the wheat and the tares (<a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30</a>), where the wheat is gathered into the barn at harvest time, symbolizing the gathering of believers into God's eternal kingdom.<p><b>but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire</b><br>The chaff symbolizes the wicked or unrepentant individuals. Burning with "unquenchable fire" indicates a final and irreversible judgment. This fire is often associated with divine wrath and eternal punishment, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/isaiah/66-24.htm">Isaiah 66:24</a> and <a href="/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43</a>. The use of "unquenchable" underscores the severity and permanence of this judgment, reflecting the ultimate fate of those who reject God's salvation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, John the Baptist, is a prophet who prepares the way for Jesus Christ by calling people to repentance and baptizing them in the Jordan River.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Implicitly referred to as the one with the winnowing fork, Jesus is the Messiah who will execute judgment and separate the righteous from the wicked.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/threshing_floor.htm">Threshing Floor</a></b><br>A symbolic place where separation occurs, representing the world or the church where God distinguishes between true believers (wheat) and non-believers (chaff).<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/w/wheat_and_chaff.htm">Wheat and Chaff</a></b><br>Metaphors for the righteous (wheat) who will be gathered into God's kingdom and the wicked (chaff) who will face judgment.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/u/unquenchable_fire.htm">Unquenchable Fire</a></b><br>Symbolizes the eternal judgment and punishment awaiting those who reject God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_judgment.htm">The Certainty of Judgment</a></b><br>God's judgment is certain and will be executed by Jesus Christ.

The metaphor was a sufficiently familiar one. (Comp. <a href="/job/21-18.htm" title="They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carries away.">Job 21:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/1-4.htm" title="The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.">Psalm 1:4</a>; <a href="/psalms/35-5.htm" title="Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase them.">Psalm 35:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/17-13.htm" title="The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.">Isaiah 17:13</a>; <a href="/isaiah/29-5.htm" title="Moreover the multitude of your strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passes away: yes, it shall be at an instant suddenly.">Isaiah 29:5</a>; <a href="/hosea/13-3.htm" title="Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew that passes away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.">Hosea 13:3</a>.) The new features here are (1) that the "coming One," the expected Christ, is to be the agent in the process; (2) that the Old Testament imagery rests in the "scattering" of the chaff, and this passes on to the "burning"; (3) that the fire is said to be "unquenched," or perhaps "unquenchable." The interpretation of the parable lies on the surface. The chaff are the ungodly and evildoers. The unquenched fire is the wrath of God against evil, which is, in its very nature, eternal, and can only cease with the cessation or transformation of the evil. The word translated "chaff" includes, it may be noted, straw as well, all but the actual grain. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Whose fan</span>. The pronged winnowing-fork (see Pal. Expl. Fund Statem; Ap. 1891) which throws up the grain against the wind. The Coming One is to put an end to the present mixture of chaff and corn. He will thoroughly purge the threshing-floor of this world, gathering the good into one safe place, and destroying the evil. The figure of winnowing comes not unseldom in the Old Testament (e.g. <a href="/jeremiah/15-7.htm">Jeremiah 15:7</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/51-2.htm">Jeremiah 51:2</a>), but generally with the sole idea of destruction of the ungodly, <span class="accented">not</span> with that of separating so as to also preserve the godly (yet cf. <a href="/psalms/139-3.htm">Psalm 139:3</a>, margin; <a href="/amos/9-9.htm">Amos 9:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Is in his hand</span>. The figure is stronger than that in ver. 10, where the instrument was only lying ready to be taken up. But that was an instrument of destruction alone. <span class="cmt_word">And he will throughly purge</span>; <span class="accented">cleanse</span> (Revised Version); <span class="accented">permundo</span> (Vulgate); <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, the preposition is intensive, not local. <span class="cmt_word">His</span>. Observe the threefold <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, referring to hand, flour, corn - personal agency, sphere, ownership. In the Vatican and some other manuscripts it is found also after "garner;" but this is, perhaps, introduced from the parallel in Luke. <span class="cmt_word">Floor</span>; <span class="accented">threshing-floor</span> (Revised Version). Not the barn that English-men think of, but an open and level space (for the figure, cf. especially <a href="/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12</a>). Here the threshing-floor is equivalent to the scene of the Lord's operations, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the world, or rather the universe (cf. Epbraem (? Tartan) in Resch, 'Agrapha,' p. 295). The present mixture of good and evil shall be brought to an end. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> gather together, from different parts of the threshing-floor, or from intimate association with the chaff, into one heap. All true believers shall finally be brought to perfect unity (cf. <a href="/matthew/13-30.htm">Matthew 13:30</a>). <span class="cmt_word">His wheat</span>. The term is adopted by Ignatius ('Ram.,' &sect;4): "I am the wheat of God, and I am ground by the teeth of wild beasts, that I may be found pure bread [of Christ]." <span class="cmt_word">Into the</span> <span class="cmt_word">garner</span>. The final home of the saints, hidden away and safe from all marauders. Garners in the East are generally subterranean vaults or eaves (but cf. <a href="/luke/12-18.htm">Luke 12:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But will burn up</span>. Utterly consuming it (contrast <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>), as the tares (<a href="/matthew/13-30.htm">Matthew 13:30, 40</a>) and the books of magic (<a href="/acts/19-19.htm">Acts 19:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The chaff</span>. For, as Jeremiah says (<a href="/jeremiah/23-28.htm">Jeremiah 23:28</a>) when comparing a mere dream with a message from the Lord," What is the chaff to the wheat?" The Targum even interprets Jeremiah's words of the wicked and the righteous. The <span class="accented">chaff</span> in Jeremiah includes the straw, for in the East everything except the actual grain is generally burnt, and is sometimes used for heating fireplaces (Mishna, 'Sabb.,' 3:1; 'Parah,' 4:3). <span class="cmt_word">With</span> <span class="cmt_word">unquenchable fire</span>. "Unquenchable" shows that John is here thinking not of the figure of <span class="accented">chaff</span> but of the persons figured by it. But what does the word mean? In itself it might mean that the fire cannot be overcome by the greatness or the nature of the mass that it has to consume; <span class="accented">i.e.</span>, to drop the figure, by either the number or the character at' the wicked. But from its usage it seems rather to be equivalent to not being overcome by the lapse of time. It is used, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, of the perpetual fire of Vesta, of the fire of the Magi, of the fire upon the Jewish altar (<span class="accented">vide</span> references in Thayer). The whole expression in itself says nothing about the everlasting duration of the punishment; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> it does not decide for "everlasting punishment" or for "annihilation," but seems rather to exclude the possibility of amelioration under it (cf. <a href="/isaiah/1-31.htm">Isaiah 1:31</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/3-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8023;</span> <span class="translit">(hou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Genitive Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">winnowing fork [is]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#964;&#973;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ptyon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4425.htm">Strong's 4425: </a> </span><span class="str2">A simple wooden pitchfork; a winnowing-shovel or fan.
