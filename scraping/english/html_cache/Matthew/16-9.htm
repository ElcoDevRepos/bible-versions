Despite witnessing numerous miracles, they often failed to comprehend the deeper meanings. This reflects a common theme in the Gospels where Jesus' followers, and even the religious leaders, misunderstand His mission and teachings. The question challenges the reader to seek spiritual insight beyond the physical evidence.<p><b>Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand,</b><br>This refers to the miraculous feeding of the five thousand, an event recorded in all four Gospels (<a href="/matthew/14-13.htm">Matthew 14:13-21</a>, <a href="/mark/6-30.htm">Mark 6:30-44</a>, <a href="/luke/9-10.htm">Luke 9:10-17</a>, <a href="/john/6.htm">John 6:1-14</a>). It underscores Jesus' divine provision and power over nature. The miracle took place near Bethsaida, a region known for its fertile land, which adds a layer of irony as the disciples worried about food in a place of abundance. The five loaves symbolize God's ability to multiply limited resources to meet the needs of many, pointing to Jesus as the Bread of Life.<p><b>and how many basketfuls you gathered?</b><br>After the feeding, the disciples collected twelve basketfuls of leftovers, symbolizing abundance and completeness. The number twelve often represents the twelve tribes of Israel, suggesting that Jesus' provision is sufficient for all of God's people. This detail emphasizes the importance of remembering God's past faithfulness as a foundation for trusting Him in present and future challenges. It also serves as a reminder of the disciples' role in distributing Jesus' provision to others.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus
