Nazareth was a small, insignificant village in Galilee, often looked down upon by others in Israel (<a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>). This return highlights the fulfillment of prophecy that the Messiah would be called a Nazarene (<a href="/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>). It also sets the stage for the rejection Jesus would face from those who knew Him from His youth, illustrating the biblical principle that a prophet is often without honor in his own country (<a href="/luke/4-24.htm">Luke 4:24</a>).<p><b>He taught the people in their synagogue</b><br>The synagogue was the center of Jewish religious life, serving as a place for teaching, prayer, and community gatherings. Jesus teaching in the synagogue demonstrates His role as a rabbi and teacher, a common practice for Jewish men of learning. This setting also emphasizes the authority with which Jesus spoke, as He often taught with insights that surpassed those of the scribes and Pharisees (<a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28-29</a>).<p><b>and they were astonished</b><br>The people's astonishment reflects their surprise at Jesus' wisdom and authority. Despite knowing Him as the carpenter's son, they were confronted with His profound understanding of the Scriptures and His ability to perform miracles. This reaction is consistent with other instances in the Gospels where Jesus' teachings and actions left audiences amazed (<a href="/mark/1-22.htm">Mark 1:22</a>, <a href="/luke/4-32.htm">Luke 4:32</a>).<p><b>&#8220;Where did this man get such wisdom and miraculous powers?&#8221; they asked</b><br>This question reveals the skepticism and disbelief of the townspeople. They struggled to reconcile Jesus' humble origins with His extraordinary abilities. The reference to "wisdom" and "miraculous powers" underscores the dual nature of Jesus' ministry: His profound teaching and His divine acts. This echoes the Old Testament prophecies of the Messiah who would be filled with the Spirit of wisdom and understanding (<a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>).

The townspeople think they know Him&#8212;carpenter, neighbor&#8217;s boy, Mary&#8217;s son&#8212;yet the Lord arrives carrying the full authority of heaven (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>).<p>&#8226; This return anticipates His later observation: &#8220;A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/13-57.htm">Matthew 13:57</a>; cf. <a href="/luke/4-24.htm">Luke 4:24</a>). What should have been the most receptive audience will prove hardest of heart.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He taught the people in their synagogue</b><p>Nazareth&#8217;s modest synagogue becomes a pulpit for God in the flesh. As was His custom (<a href="/luke/4-15.htm">Luke 4:15</a>), Jesus reads, explains, and applies Scripture.<p>&#8226; Setting: a familiar room with stone benches, scroll cupboard, ordinary worshipers&#8212;no grand stage, yet eternal truth is proclaimed.<p>&#8226; Method: teaching, not mere commentary, with the same authoritative clarity that earlier left crowds &#8220;astonished at His teaching&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28-29</a>).<p>&#8226; Content: though Matthew doesn&#8217;t list the passage here, Luke records His <a href="/bsb/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61</a> reading on another Nazareth visit (<a href="/luke/4-17.htm">Luke 4:17-21</a>). Either way, the message centers on fulfilled prophecy and the nearness of God&#8217;s kingdom (<a href="/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>).<p>&#8226; Openness: He speaks publicly; &#8220;I have spoken openly to the world&#8221; (<a href="/john/18-20.htm">John 18:20</a>). Nothing is hidden, yet many still refuse to see.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And they were astonished</b><p>The congregation&#8217;s first reaction is wonder, not faith.

Acknowledging the signs should lead to the conclusion Nicodemus reached: &#8220;No one could perform the signs You are doing if God were not with him&#8221; (<a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Instead, they reduce Him to &#8220;this man,&#8221; distancing themselves from His true identity. Familiarity breeds contempt; proximity to grace can harden rather than soften (<a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/13-54.htm">Matthew 13:54</a> captures the tension of Jesus&#8217; earthly ministry: divine authority wrapped in hometown familiarity. He literally walks the dusty streets of Nazareth, steps into the local synagogue, and teaches with heavenly wisdom confirmed by undeniable miracles. The crowd&#8217;s astonishment exposes the heart&#8217;s fork in the road&#8212;worship the Messiah or dismiss the carpenter. The verse calls every reader to move beyond mere amazement to wholehearted faith in the One whose wisdom and power are perfectly, undeniably from God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(54) <span class= "bld">When he was come into his own country.</span>--The visit to Nazareth, here recorded in almost-identical terms with <a href="/context/mark/6-1.htm" title="And he went out from there, and came into his own country; and his disciples follow him.">Mark 6:1-6</a>, has so many points of resemblance with the narrative of <a href="/context/luke/4-16.htm" title="And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.">Luke 4:16-31</a> that many critics have supposed it to be a less complete account of the same fact. On this assumption, the narrative must be misplaced in its relation to other facts in one or other of the Gospels. A dislocation of some kind must indeed be admitted in any case, as St. Mark places it after the resurrection of Jairus's daughter, and makes that event follow the cure of the Gadarene demoniac, and places that on the next day after the first use of parables. We are compelled to admit, as before in the Notes on <a href="/matthew/8-1.htm" title="When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.">Matthew 8:1</a>, the almost entire absence of any trustworthy notes of chronological sequence, beyond the grouping, in some cases, of a few conspicuous facts. In comparing, however, St. Matthew and St. Mark with St. Luke, there seems no sufficient ground for hastily assuming identity. The third Gospel places the visit which it narrates, at the very beginning of our Lord's work, and as giving the reason of His removal to Capernaum. Here, there is no outburst of violent enmity such as we find there, but simple amazement. It seems, therefore, more probable that we have here a short account (short and imperfect, it may be, because our Lord went without His disciples) of another effort to bring the men of Nazareth to acknowledge Him, if not as the Christ, at least as a Prophet. The circumstances of the case in St. Matthew's record suggest another motive as, at least, possible. He had recently, as in <a href="/matthew/12-48.htm" title="But he answered and said to him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brothers?">Matthew 12:48</a>, when His mother and His brethren had come in their eager anxiety to interrupt His work, spoken in words that seemed to repel them to a distance from Him. What if this visit were meant to show that, though as a Prophet He could not brook that interruption, home affections were not dead in Him, that His heart still yearned over His brethren and His townsmen, and that He sought to raise them to a higher life? On comparing the account here with that in St. Luke, it would seem almost certain that there was now a less direct assertion of His claims as the Christ than there had been before--a proclamation of the laws of the kingdom rather than of His own position in it. And so the impression is one of wonder at His wisdom, not of anger or scorn at what He claims to be.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 54-58.</span> - Unbelief manifested in Jesus' own country, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Nazareth. Parallel passage: <a href="/mark/6-1.htm">Mark 6:1-6</a>. In <a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-30</a> we have also an account of a scene at Nazareth; but the occasion was almost certainly a different one from that described here. His account, however, seems to have been modified in form from the better known narrative found in the Framework, and used in Matthew and Mark. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 54.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when</span> <span class="cmt_word">he was come into his own country</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Nazareth (<a href="/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>). In <a href="/luke/4-23.htm">Luke 4:23</a> the phrase is used with express contrast to Capernaum. In <a href="/john/4-44.htm">John 4:44</a> it is, as it seems, used in a special sense of Judaea, even though it comes in a saying that is almost identical with our ver. 57 (see Bishop Westcott). <span class="cmt_word">He taught them in their synagogue.</span> His teaching appears to have spread over at least a few days (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Insomuch</span> <span class="cmt_word">that they were astonished</span> (<a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28, 29</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and said, Whence</span> (<span class="greek_word">po/qen</span>).

But the fact that they were "offended in him" (ver. 57) shows that their language was due. not so much to inquiry as to astonishment, which may in some cases be the first stage of inquiry (<a href="/matthew/9-33.htm">Matthew 9:33</a>; <a href="/matthew/12-23.htm">Matthew 12:23</a>), or may, as here, be checked from further development.
