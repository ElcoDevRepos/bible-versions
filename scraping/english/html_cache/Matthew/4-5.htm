Jerusalem is significant as the site of the temple, the center of Jewish worship, and the city where many key events in Jesus' life and ministry occur.

The temple itself is a type of Christ, representing God's presence among His people, and Jesus later refers to His body as the temple (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-21</a>).

Either St. Luke's informant was less accurate than St. Matthew's, or the impressions left on the minds of those to whom the mystery had been communicated were slightly different. Especially was this likely to be the case, if the trial had been (as the narratives of St. Mark and St. Luke show) protracted, and the temptations therefore recurring. St. Matthew's order seems, on the whole, the truest, and the "Get thee behind me, Satan," fits in better with the close of the conflict.<p><span class= "bld">Taketh him up into the holy city.</span>--The use of this term to describe Jerusalem (<a href="/luke/4-9.htm" title="And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, If you be the Son of God, cast yourself down from hence:">Luke 4:9</a>) is peculiar to St. Matthew among the Evangelists, and is used again by him in <a href="/matthew/27-53.htm" title="And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared to many.">Matthew 27:53</a>.

From <a href="/isaiah/52-1.htm">Isaiah 52:1</a>, the end of which verse, "There shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean," heightens the implied contrast of the devil's presence there. (For the expression, cf. also <a href="/matthew/27-53.htm">Matthew 27:53</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-2.htm">Revelation 11:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-2.htm">Revelation 21:2, 10</a>; also <a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11, 12</a>.)

Possibly, however, it may here be a merely accidental similarity with Luke (who employs the aorist throughout the section), caused by Matthew's desire to emphasize the momentariness of the devil's act. Some think that, as at the end of the temptation Christ is in the wilderness, this removal to Jerusalem is solely mental, without any motion of his body.

Of this last Josephus ('Ant.,' 15:11. 5) makes special mention, saying, in his exaggerated style, that human sight could not reach from the top of it to the bottom of the ravine on whose edge it stood. Edersheim ('Life,' etc., 1:303) thinks that possibly the term means "the extreme corner of the 'wing-like' porch, or <span class="accented">ulam</span>, which led into the Sanctuary." This last would suit a possible interpretation of <a href="/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>, as referring to a part of the temple under the name of "the pinnacle," which had been used for heathen sacrifices, probably in the worship of the sun.
