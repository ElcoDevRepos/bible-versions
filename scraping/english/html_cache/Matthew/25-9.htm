In the context of the parable, the wise virgins represent those who are spiritually vigilant and ready for the return of Christ. This refusal underscores the necessity of individual readiness, as salvation and spiritual preparedness cannot be transferred or borrowed from others. The wise virgins' response is a call to personal accountability, echoing the biblical principle that each person must work out their own salvation (<a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12</a>).<p><b>&#8216;or there may not be enough for both us and you.</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the finite nature of spiritual resources and the urgency of being prepared. The oil in the parable symbolizes the Holy Spirit or faith, which cannot be shared or divided among individuals. The wise virgins' concern about the insufficiency of oil reflects the reality that spiritual readiness is a personal journey. This echoes the teaching of Jesus in <a href="/matthew/7-21.htm">Matthew 7:21-23</a>, where He warns that not everyone who calls Him 'Lord' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of the Father.<p><b>Instead, go to those who sell oil</b><br>The suggestion to go to those who sell oil indicates the necessity of seeking spiritual resources while there is still time. In the cultural context of the parable, oil merchants would have been available in the marketplace, symbolizing the availability of spiritual nourishment and growth through the means of grace, such as Scripture, prayer, and fellowship. This aligns with the biblical exhortation to seek the Lord while He may be found (<a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a>).<p><b>and buy some for yourselves.&#8217;</b><br>The instruction to buy oil for themselves underscores the personal effort required in spiritual preparation. The act of buying suggests a cost or sacrifice, reflecting the biblical truth that following Christ requires self-denial and commitment (<a href="/luke/9-23.htm">Luke 9:23</a>). This phrase also serves as a warning that there will come a time when it is too late to prepare, as seen in the closing of the door in the parable (<a href="/matthew/25-10.htm">Matthew 25:10-12</a>). The urgency of the wise virgins' advice is a reminder of the imminent return of Christ and the need to be ready at all times.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wise_virgins.htm">The Wise Virgins</a></b><br>These are the prudent bridesmaids who prepared adequately for the bridegroom's arrival by bringing extra oil for their lamps.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_foolish_virgins.htm">The Foolish Virgins</a></b><br>These bridesmaids did not bring extra oil, representing a lack of preparedness and foresight.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bridegroom.htm">The Bridegroom</a></b><br>Symbolic of Christ, whose return is anticipated by the virgins.

The wise virgins recognize a boundary that cannot be crossed. Just as Jesus tells His followers to &#8220;let your &#8216;Yes&#8217; be &#8216;Yes,&#8217; and your &#8216;No,&#8217; &#8216;No&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>), the wise answer leaves no wiggle room. Their refusal is not selfishness but stewardship; it mirrors how God&#8217;s yes and no are clear in passages like <a href="/2_corinthians/1-18.htm">2 Corinthians 1:18-20</a>. Some things&#8212;especially readiness for Christ&#8217;s coming&#8212;cannot be negotiated.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;said the wise ones,&#8221;</b><p>Scripture calls them &#8220;wise&#8221; because they planned ahead (<a href="/proverbs/14-8.htm">Proverbs 14:8</a>). Wisdom in the Bible is always tied to fearing the Lord and obeying Him (<a href="/proverbs/9-10.htm">Proverbs 9:10</a>; <a href="/james/3-13.htm">James 3:13</a>). These bridesmaids had acted on the Lord&#8217;s earlier instruction: &#8220;Be dressed for service and keep your lamps burning&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-35.htm">Luke 12:35-36</a>). Their wisdom contrasts sharply with the foolish virgins, underscoring the two paths Jesus often sets before His listeners (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;or there may not be enough for both us and you.&#8221;</b><p>The reason for refusal is simple math: a limited supply.<p>&#8226; Readiness cannot be transferred; each person must possess it (<a href="/ezekiel/14-14.htm">Ezekiel 14:14</a>; <a href="/galatians/6-5.htm">Galatians 6:5</a>).<p>&#8226; Salvation is personal; no one can believe on another&#8217;s behalf (<a href="/john/3-18.htm">John 3:18</a>; <a href="/romans/14-12.htm">Romans 14:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The wise recognize that if they try to divide what is essential, all will end up in darkness&#8212;echoing Jesus&#8217; warning about &#8220;the blind leading the blind&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/15-14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>). The lamp oil symbolizes what keeps the believer&#8217;s light burning: genuine faith evidenced by obedience (<a href="/philippians/2-12.htm">Philippians 2:12-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Instead,&#8221;</b><p>The word pivots from refusal to instruction. Grace still extends an invitation while time remains (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>). It is reminiscent of Jesus&#8217; &#8220;Instead, seek His kingdom&#8221; (<a href="/luke/12-31.htm">Luke 12:31</a>) and Paul&#8217;s &#8220;But now&#8221; urgings (<a href="/2_corinthians/6-2.htm">2 Corinthians 6:2</a>). The wise point the foolish in the only viable direction left.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;go to those who sell oil&#8221;</b><p>Practical steps are given. In everyday life, oil vendors are open only for a season; spiritually, the gospel is available now but not indefinitely (<a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a>). The idea of &#8220;buying&#8221; evokes <a href="/revelation/3-18.htm">Revelation 3:18</a>, where Jesus counsels the church to &#8220;buy from Me gold refined by fire,&#8221; stressing personal transaction with Him. No one else can make that purchase for us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and buy some for yourselves.&#8221;</b><p>Ownership is the takeaway word. Like the Israelites gathering manna daily (<a href="/exodus/16-16.htm">Exodus 16:16-18</a>), every disciple must secure what sustains faith. The price here is repentance and surrender (<a href="/luke/14-33.htm">Luke 14:33</a>), not money. Yet the command reminds us there will be a moment when the door shuts (<a href="/matthew/25-10.htm">Matthew 25:10-12</a>). Prepare now, because last-minute borrowing will not work.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/25-9.htm">Matthew 25:9</a> teaches that preparedness for Christ&#8217;s return is personal, cannot be loaned, and must be secured before the final moment arrives. The wise virgins&#8217; firm &#8220;No&#8221; highlights the non-transferable nature of saving faith and obedience, while their guidance&#8212;&#8220;go and buy for yourselves&#8221;&#8212;underscores that today is the day to make sure our lamps are full and our hearts ready.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Not so.</span>--The words, as the italics show, are not in the Greek. They are, perhaps, necessary to complete the sense in English; but there is a tone of regretful tenderness in the way in which, in the original, the wise virgins give the reason that makes compliance with the request impossible, without directly uttering a refusal.<p><span class= "bld">Go ye rather to them that sell.</span>--This feature in the parable is too remarkable to be passed over lightly, especially as the "exchangers" in the parable that follows are clearly more or less analogous. We have to ask, then, who they are that, in the interpretation of the parable, according to the <span class= "ital">data</span> already ascertained, answer to "them that sell." And the answer is, that they are the pastors and teachers of the Church--the stewards of the mysteries of God. Through them, whether as preachers of the divine Word of Wisdom, or as administering the sacraments which are signs and means of grace, men may, by God's appointment, obtain the gift and grace they need. The "buying" and "selling" belong, of course, in their literal sense, to the parable only. No gift of God can be purchased with money (<a href="/acts/8-20.htm" title="But Peter said to him, Your money perish with you, because you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.">Acts 8:20</a>). But the words are not, therefore, any more than in <a href="/context/matthew/13-44.htm" title="Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to treasure hid in a field; the which when a man has found, he hides, and for joy thereof goes and sells all that he has, and buys that field.">Matthew 13:44-46</a> (where see Notes), destitute of meaning. Men may "buy" the truth which they are not to sell (<a href="/proverbs/23-23.htm" title="Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.">Proverbs 23:23</a>). They are invited to buy the "wine and milk," which symbolise God's spiritual gifts, "without money and without price" (<a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm" title="Ho, every one that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he that has no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.">Isaiah 55:1</a>). The price that God requires is the consecration of their heart (<a href="/proverbs/23-26.htm" title="My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways.">Proverbs 23:26</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - Not so; <span class="cmt_word">lest there be not enough</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>, <span class="accented">haply it will not suffice</span>). Edersheim renders, "Not at all - it will never suffice for us and you," in order to give the force of the double negation. In Aristotle, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> is often equivalent to "perhaps," <span class="accented">e.g.</span> 'Eth. Nic.,' 10:1. 3. "Even so they failed," says St. Chrysostom, "and neither the humanity of those of whom they begged, nor the easiness of their request, nor their necessity and want, made them obtain their petition. And what do we learn from hence? That no man can protect us there if we are betrayed by our works; not because he will not, but because he cannot. For these, too, take refuge in the impossibility. This the blessed Abraham also indicated, saying, 'Between us and you there is a great gulf,' so that not even when willing is it permitted them to pass it." <span class="cmt_word">But</span> (probably spurious) <span class="cmt_word">go ye rather to them that sell</span>. The answer is not harsh, and the advice is not ironical or unkind. The wise cannot of themselves supply the lack. They have no superabundant store of grace to communicate to others; at best even they are unprofitable servants; the righteous shall scarcely be saved; so they direct their companions to the only source where effectual grace may be obtained. They that sell are the ministers and stewards of Christ's mysteries, who dispense the means of grace. These are said to be bought, as the treasure hid in the field or the pearl of great price is bought (<a href="/matthew/13-44.htm">Matthew 13:44-46</a>). Divine grace can always be procured by those who will pay the price thereof; and the price is faith and prayer and earnestness, - nothing more, nothing less (<a href="/isaiah/55-1.htm">Isaiah 55:1</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-18.htm">Revelation 3:18</a>). But the time is short; delay is fatal; hence the counsel so urgently given, "Go ye," etc. <span class="cmt_word">Buy for yourselves</span>. This is important. Every one must bear his own burden. The grace must be their own; what is required of those who would meet the Bridegroom without shame and fear is personal preparation, personal faith and holiness. We shall be judged individually; our Christian virtues must be entirely our own, wrought in us by the grace of God, with which we have humbly and thankfully cooperated. It is curious that some ancient and modern commentators see in this part of the parable, only an ornamental detail without special signification. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/25-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8216;No,&#8217;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8016;</span> <span class="translit">(ou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3756.htm">Strong's 3756: </a> </span><span class="str2">No, not.
