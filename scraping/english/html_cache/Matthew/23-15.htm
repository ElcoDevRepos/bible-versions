The term "woe" is a strong expression of judgment and lament. The scribes and Pharisees were influential Jewish leaders known for their strict adherence to the Law and traditions. However, Jesus calls them "hypocrites," indicating that their outward appearance of piety masked inner corruption and insincerity. This critique aligns with Old Testament prophets like Isaiah, who condemned similar hypocrisy (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>).<p><b>You traverse land and sea to win a single convert,</b><br>The phrase highlights the zeal and effort the Pharisees put into proselytizing. In the first-century Jewish context, proselytizing involved converting Gentiles to Judaism, which required adherence to Jewish laws and customs. The geographical reference to "land and sea" underscores the lengths to which they would go, reflecting a missionary zeal that was commendable in effort but flawed in execution.<p><b>and when he becomes one,</b><br>This indicates the success of their efforts in making converts. However, the focus is not on the conversion itself but on the outcome of such conversions. The process of becoming a proselyte involved significant changes, including circumcision and adherence to Jewish law, which were burdensome and often missed the heart of true faith.<p><b>you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are.</b><br>This severe indictment suggests that the converts were led into a form of legalism and self-righteousness that was even more damaging than that of their teachers. The term "son of hell" (Gehenna) refers to a state of spiritual ruin and separation from God. This reflects the danger of religious hypocrisy, where external conformity to religious practices leads to spiritual blindness and condemnation. The phrase echoes Jesus' broader teaching on the dangers of leading others astray (<a href="/matthew/18-6.htm">Matthew 18:6</a>) and the importance of genuine faith over mere ritual (<a href="/matthew/15-8.htm">Matthew 15:8-9</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/scribes_and_pharisees.htm">Scribes and Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders in Jewish society known for their strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

John Hyrcanus, the last of the Maccabean priest-rulers, had offered the Idumeans the alternative of death, exile, or circumcision (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xiii.</span> 9, ? 3). When the government of Rome rendered such measures impossible, they resorted to all the arts of persuasion, and exulted when they succeeded in enrolling a heathen convert as a member of their party. But the proselytes thus made were too often a scandal and proverb of reproach. There was no real conversion, and those who were most active in the work of proselytising were, for the most part, blind leaders of the blind. The vices of the Jew were engrafted on the vices of the heathen. The ties of duty and natural affection were ruthlessly snapped asunder. The popular Jewish feeling about them was like that of the popular Christian feeling about a converted Jew. Proselytes were regarded as the leprosy of Israel, hindering the coming of the Messiah. It became a proverb that no one should trust a proselyte, even to the twenty-fourth generation. Our Lord was, in part at least, expressing the judgment of the better Jews when He taught that the proselyte thus made was "two-fold more the child of hell"--<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of Gehenna--than his masters.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="accented">Third woe</span> - against evil proselytizing. <span class="cmt_word">Ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte</span>. The word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used in the Septuagint to signify "a stranger" or "sojourner" (<a href="/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48, 49</a>, etc.), and at this time was applied to a convert to Judaism (<a href="/acts/2-10.htm">Acts 2:10</a>; <a href="/acts/6-5.htm">Acts 6:5</a>), whether circumcised, "a proselyte of righteousness;" or uncircumcised, "a proselyte of the gate." To <span class="accented">compass sea and land</span> is a proverbial expression, denoting the employment of every means, the exercise of the utmost effort. One might have thought that, in its proud isolation and exclusiveness, Judaism would not have exposed itself to this reproach. But what says Josephus? In more than one passage of his histories he testifies to the zealous propagation of the Jewish religion, and in some cases the enforcement of circumcision on vanquished enemies (see 'Ant.,' 18:03. 5; 20:2. 4; 'Bell. Jud.,' 2:17. 10; 'Vita,' &sect; 23). Tacitus ('Hist.,' 5:5) gives a most unfavourable account of the numerous converts which Hebrews made throughout the Roman provinces; and St. Augustine ('De Civit.,' 6:11) quotes Seneca saying, "Cum interim usque eo sceleratissimae gentis consuetudo convaluit, ut per omnes jam terras recepta sit, victi victoribus leges dederunt" (Edersheim). For similar testimony, we may refer to Horace, 'Sat.,' 1:4. 142, 143; and Juvenal, 'Sat.,' 6:541, etc. But it was not proselytizing in itself that the Lord censured. As possessing revelation and the only true religion in the world, the Jews might well have deemed it their business to enlighten the gross darkness of heathenism, and to endeavour to shed abroad the pure light which was confided to their care to tend and cherish. That they were not expressly commanded to do this, and that little blessing attended their efforts in this direction, was dependent upon the transitory and imperfect character of the old covenant, and the many evils which would be consequent upon association with alien peoples. In making converts, the Pharisees sought rather to secure outward conformity than inward piety, change of external religion than change of heart. There was no love of souls, no burning zeal for the honour of God, in their proselytism. They were prompted only by selfish and base motives - vain glory, party spirit, covetousness; and if they converted men to their own opinions, with their false tenets, gross externalism, and practical immorality, they had far better have left them in their irresponsible ignorance. <span class="cmt_word">When he is made;</span> <span class="accented">when he is become</span> a proselyte. <span class="cmt_word">Twofold more the child of hell;</span> <span class="accented">a son of Gehenna</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> worthy of hell fire.

The converts became doubly the children of hell because, seeing the iniquities of their teachers, they learned an evil lesson from them, "engrafted the vices of the Jews on the vices of the heathen," distrusted all goodness, discarded their old religion and disbelieved the new, making utter shipwreck of their moral life.
