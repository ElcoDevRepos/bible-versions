The crossing follows the miraculous feeding of the five thousand and Jesus walking on water. The Sea of Galilee, also known as Lake Tiberias or Lake Kinneret, is a significant location in Jesus' ministry, serving as a backdrop for many of His miracles and teachings. The crossing signifies a transition in Jesus' ministry, moving from one area of teaching and miracles to another, emphasizing His itinerant ministry.<p><b>they landed at Gennesaret</b><br>Gennesaret is a fertile plain located on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee. Known for its rich soil and abundant agriculture, it was a prosperous area during Jesus' time. The landing at Gennesaret marks a continuation of Jesus' healing ministry, as the following verses describe the people of the region bringing their sick to Him. This location is significant as it demonstrates Jesus' widespread influence and the eagerness of the people to seek Him out for healing. The mention of Gennesaret also highlights the geographical reality of Jesus' ministry, grounding the Gospel accounts in real, identifiable locations.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the Gospel, performing miracles and teaching about the Kingdom of God.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who were with Him during His ministry and witnessed His miracles.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gennesaret.htm">Gennesaret</a></b><br>A fertile plain on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee, known for its rich soil and agricultural productivity.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/crossing_over.htm">Crossing Over</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus and His disciples traveling by boat across the Sea of Galilee.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/s/sea_of_galilee.htm">Sea of Galilee</a></b><br>A freshwater lake in Israel, significant in Jesus' ministry for many miracles and teachings.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_transition.htm">Faith in Transition</a></b><br>Just as Jesus and His disciples crossed over to Gennesaret, we are often called to transition in our spiritual journeys.

The disciples move from fear on the waves to firm ground&#8212;an echo of <a href="/psalms/40-2.htm">Psalm 40:2</a>: &#8220;He set my feet upon a rock, and gave me a firm place to stand.&#8221;<p>- The landing also marks a transition in ministry: moments after worshiping Jesus in the boat (<a href="/matthew/14-33.htm">Matthew 14:33</a>), they will witness another wave of healings (<a href="/matthew/14-35.htm">Matthew 14:35-36</a>).<p>- It illustrates a rhythm common in the Gospels: testing, revelation of Christ, then fresh opportunities to serve (see <a href="/luke/8-22.htm">Luke 8:22-39</a> for a similar progression).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at Gennesaret</b><p>- Gennesaret was a fertile plain on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee, renowned for rich soil and abundant produce. Scripture treats it as a specific, historic locale, not a symbolic idea (<a href="/joshua/19-35.htm">Joshua 19:35</a> lists related towns in Naphtali).<p>- Upon arrival, &#8220;the men of that place recognized Him&#8221; and streamed to Him for healing (<a href="/matthew/14-35.htm">Matthew 14:35</a>), fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a> where the coming of God brings restoration.<p>- Mark&#8217;s parallel record highlights how people ran through &#8220;that whole region&#8221; (<a href="/mark/6-55.htm">Mark 6:55</a>), emphasizing the broad reach of Jesus&#8217; compassion and the readiness of ordinary folk to receive Him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/14-34.htm">Matthew 14:34</a> marks more than a geographical note; it testifies that Jesus faithfully guides His disciples through real dangers to real destinations, setting the stage for fresh displays of His mercy.
