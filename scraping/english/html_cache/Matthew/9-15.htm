His reply indicates His authority and understanding of spiritual matters, setting the stage for a deeper teaching moment. This response is part of a larger dialogue where Jesus often uses parables and metaphors to convey spiritual truths.<p><b>How can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while He is with them?</b><br>Here, Jesus uses the imagery of a wedding feast, a common cultural event in Jewish society, to illustrate His point. Weddings were times of joy and celebration, not mourning. The "bridegroom" is a metaphor for Jesus Himself, and the "guests" are His disciples. This imagery is consistent with Old Testament references to God as the bridegroom (<a href="/isaiah/62-5.htm">Isaiah 62:5</a>) and is later echoed in the New Testament (<a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7-9</a>).<p><b>But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them;</b><br>This phrase foreshadows Jesus' crucifixion and ascension. The "time" refers to the period after Jesus' earthly ministry when He will no longer be physically present with His disciples. This prediction aligns with prophecies about the Messiah's suffering and departure (Isaiah 53). It also sets the stage for the coming of the Holy Spirit, who will be with the disciples after Jesus' ascension (<a href="/john/16-7.htm">John 16:7</a>).<p><b>then they will fast.</b><br>Fasting, in Jewish tradition, is associated with mourning, repentance, and seeking God's guidance. Jesus indicates that after His departure, His followers will fast as a sign of longing for His return and as a spiritual discipline. This practice is seen in the early church (<a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2-3</a>) and is a way for believers to draw closer to God, reflecting a heart of devotion and dependence on Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to a question about fasting.

They appear to be those, invited by either party, who come to take part in the wedding festivities. They are, therefore, in full sympathy with bridegroom and bride, and, like them, cannot but rejoice. <span class="cmt_word">Mourn</span>; parallel passages, "fast," but Matthew's word, as less closely connected with the cause of the objection raised, seems the more original. <span class="cmt_word">As long as the bridegroom is with them?</span> Nosgen sees in this a claim to be the expected Bridegroom of Israel (<a href="/hosea/2-19.htm">Hosea 2:19, 20</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/3-1.htm">Jeremiah 3:1-14</a>; <a href="/ezekiel/16-8.htm">Ezekiel 16:8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But the days will come</span>. Christ speaks with prophetic assurance of the coming of such a time (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). Observe his consciousness alike of his position and of what is coming upon him. <span class="cmt_word">When the bridegroom shall be taken</span> (<span class="accented">away</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">from them</span>. His removal shall be effected, not by his own action, but by external agents (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>). In these unsettled times, with their frequent though mostly unimportant popular risings, it cannot have been a very unusual thing for the bridegroom to be carried off, not indeed before the consummation of the marriage, but before the end of the week of festivities. <span class="cmt_word">And then shall</span> (<span class="accented">will</span>, Revised Version; there is no trace of a command, Christ is but stating a fact) <span class="cmt_word">they fast</span>. Christ here endorses the principle of Christian fasts (cf. <a href="/matthew/6-16.htm">Matthew 6:16</a>), but regards them as springing; not from any legal obligation, but flora personal grief, in this case at his absence (cf. <a href="/john/16-20.htm">John 16:20</a>). The only later passages in the New Testament where Christian fasting is mentioned, are <a href="/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2, 3</a>; <a href="/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/6-5.htm">2 Corinthians 6:5</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/11-27.htm">2 Corinthians 11:27</a>. In the 'Didache,' &sect; 8, we have the earliest formal recognition or' it as a practice. It is there forbidden to fast on the same days as the Pharisees. Observe that this verse was understood in Tertullian's time as expressly commanding a fast during the forty hours in which our Lord was in the grave ('De Jejun.,' &sect; 2), and that, from Irenseus's expression in Eusebius ('Ch. Hist.,' 5:24), this fast had been kept almost from apostolic times. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/9-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
