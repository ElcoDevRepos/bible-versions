In biblical context, roots symbolize depth and stability. Without roots, a plant cannot sustain itself, just as a believer without a deep foundation in faith cannot endure trials. This imagery is consistent with Old Testament references, such as in <a href="/jeremiah/17-8.htm">Jeremiah 17:8</a>, where a tree with deep roots is likened to a person who trusts in the Lord. The lack of root suggests a shallow acceptance of the gospel, without true understanding or commitment.<p><b>he remains for only a season</b><br>The temporary nature of this faith is emphasized here. In the agricultural context of ancient Israel, seasons were crucial for growth and harvest. A plant that lasts only for a season is one that fails to mature and bear fruit. This reflects the transient commitment of some believers who may initially receive the word with joy but do not persevere. This concept is echoed in <a href="/john/15-6.htm">John 15:6</a>, where branches that do not remain in the vine are thrown away and wither.<p><b>When trouble or persecution comes because of the word</b><br>This phrase indicates that the trials faced are specifically due to adherence to the Christian faith. In the early church, persecution was a common experience, as seen in <a href="/acts/8.htm">Acts 8:1</a>, where believers were scattered due to persecution. The historical context of the Roman Empire, with its pagan practices and emperor worship, often led to Christians being marginalized or persecuted. This serves as a test of genuine faith, distinguishing those who are truly committed from those who are not.<p><b>he quickly falls away</b><br>The rapidity of falling away underscores the lack of genuine faith. This is a warning against a superficial belief that cannot withstand external pressures. The Greek word used here for "falls away" can also mean to stumble or be offended, suggesting that such individuals are easily swayed or disillusioned. This is reminiscent of the parable of the wise and foolish builders in <a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>, where only the house built on the rock withstands the storm. The falling away is a failure to endure, contrasting with the perseverance encouraged in <a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>, where those who stand firm under trial are blessed.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of the parable, teaching about the Kingdom of Heaven through parables to the crowds and His disciples.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sower.htm">The Sower</a></b><br>Represents anyone who spreads the Word of God, though in the broader context, it can be seen as Jesus Himself.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seed.htm">The Seed</a></b><br>Symbolizes the Word of God, which is sown into the hearts of people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_rocky_ground.htm">The Rocky Ground</a></b><br>Represents individuals who receive the Word with joy but lack depth and endurance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/trouble_or_persecution.htm">Trouble or Persecution</a></b><br>Challenges that arise specifically because of one's faith in the Word of God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_deep_roots.htm">The Importance of Deep Roots</a></b><br>Spiritual depth is crucial for enduring faith.

"Persecution" implies, perhaps, a more organised attack, and therefore greater suffering; "tribulation," the thousand petty annoyances to which every convert to the faith of Christ was exposed in the first age of the Church, and to which, it may be added, even now most men and women who seek to be Christians in deed as well as in name are at some time or other in their lives exposed. The words explain the "time of temptation" in St. Luke's report (<a href="/luke/8-13.htm" title="They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.">Luke 8:13</a>).<p><span class= "bld">By and by</span> <span class= "bld">he is offended.</span>--The adverb is the same as the "anon" of <a href="/matthew/13-20.htm" title="But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that hears the word, and immediately with joy receives it;">Matthew 13:20</a>, and means "immediately."
