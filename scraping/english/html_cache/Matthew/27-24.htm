This reflects the political tension between Roman authority and Jewish leadership. Pilate's role was to maintain order, yet he found himself unable to control the situation. This moment highlights the fulfillment of Jesus' prophecy about His suffering and rejection (<a href="/matthew/20-18.htm">Matthew 20:18-19</a>).<p><b>but that instead a riot was breaking out</b><br>The potential for a riot underscores the volatile atmosphere in Jerusalem during Passover, a time when the city was filled with pilgrims. The Jewish leaders had incited the crowd, demonstrating their influence and the deep-seated animosity towards Jesus. This situation reflects the fulfillment of <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-2</a>, where the nations rage against the Lord's Anointed.<p><b>he took water and washed his hands before the crowd</b><br>This act of washing hands was a symbolic gesture of innocence, rooted in Jewish tradition (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-6.htm">Deuteronomy 21:6-7</a>). Pilate's action was an attempt to absolve himself of responsibility for Jesus' death, yet it also highlights his moral weakness and inability to stand for justice. This moment contrasts with Jesus' own washing of the disciples' feet, symbolizing service and sacrifice (<a href="/john/13-5.htm">John 13:5</a>).<p><b>&#8220;I am innocent of this man&#8217;s blood,&#8221; he said</b><br>Pilate's declaration of innocence is ironic, as he held the authority to release Jesus but chose political expediency over justice. This statement echoes the theme of innocence found in <a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>, where the suffering servant is described as having done no violence. Pilate's words also foreshadow the later acknowledgment of Jesus' innocence by the centurion at the crucifixion (<a href="/matthew/27-54.htm">Matthew 27:54</a>).<p><b>&#8220;You bear the responsibility.&#8221;</b><br>By placing the responsibility on the crowd, Pilate attempts to shift the moral burden. This reflects the Jewish leaders' earlier statement in <a href="/matthew/27-25.htm">Matthew 27:25</a>, where they accept the responsibility for Jesus' death. This moment fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is despised and rejected by men. It also highlights the collective responsibility of humanity in the rejection of Christ, a theme echoed throughout the New Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pontius_pilate.htm">Pontius Pilate</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea who presided over the trial of Jesus.

He knows Jesus is innocent, yet yields to the crowd to preserve peace. His symbolic cleansing cannot absolve him; only Christ&#8217;s own blood truly cleanses. The crowd&#8217;s acceptance of responsibility showcases both human culpability and God&#8217;s redemptive plan: the sacrifice they demand becomes the very means of salvation. <a href="/matthew/27-24.htm">Matthew 27:24</a> therefore warns against shirking moral duty while pointing us to the only remedy for guilt&#8212;the spotless Lamb whose blood speaks a better word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">He took water, and washed his hands.</span>--The act belonged to an obvious and almost universal symbolism. So in <a href="/deuteronomy/21-6.htm" title="And all the elders of that city, that are next to the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley:">Deuteronomy 21:6</a> the elders of a city in which an undiscovered murder had been committed were to wash their hands over the sin-offering, and to say, "Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it." (Comp. also <a href="/psalms/26-6.htm" title="I will wash my hands in innocence: so will I compass your altar, O LORD:">Psalm 26:6</a>.) Pilate probably chose it, partly as a relief to his own conscience, partly to appease his wife's scruples, partly as a last appeal of the most vivid and dramatic kind to the feelings of the priests and people. One of the popular poets of his own time and country might have taught him the nullity of such a formal ablution--<p>"Ah nimium faciles, qui tristia crimina caedis<p>Fluminea tolli posse putetis aqua."<p>"Too easy souls who dream the crystal flood<p>Can wash away the fearful guilt of blood."<p>Ovid, <span class= "ital">Fast. ii.</span> 45.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He could prevail nothing</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>, <span class="accented">he prevailed nothing</span>). Naught that he did altered the determination of the multitude. <span class="cmt_word">But that rather a tumult was</span> <span class="cmt_word">made</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, is <span class="accented">arising</span>). The present tense gives a graphic touch to the narrative. The delay and hesitation of the governor exasperated the people, and there were ominous signs of a riot, which must be suppressed at any sacrifice of principle or equity. He feared that a report might reach Rome of his having occasioned dangerous excitement at the Passover by refusing to punish a pretender to the Jewish throne, he submits to the popular will, but endeavours to save himself from the guilt of an accomplice in a most atrocious murder. <span class="cmt_word">Took water,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and washed his hands before the multitude.</span> This symbolical action would appeal to the Jewish sentiment, as it was a mode of asserting innocence prescribed in the Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-6.htm">Deuteronomy 21:6</a>; <a href="/psalms/26-6.htm">Psalm 26:6</a>). Pilate thus publicly, in the sight of all the multitude who might not have been able to hear his words, attested his opinion of the innocence of Christ, and weakly cast the guilt upon the people, as if the administration of justice lay with them and not with him. Such lustrations were not exclusively Jewish, but were practised both among Greeks and Romans in expiation of guilt (see Wetstein, <span class="accented">ad loc.</span>; and Kuinoel, <span class="accented">ad</span> cap. 3:6). <span class="cmt_word">I am innocent of the blood of this just Person.</span> Some manuscripts, followed by Alford, Tischendorf, and Westcott and Hort, omit "just Person (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>)." If the word is genuine, it must be regarded as an echo of the wife's message to Pilate (ver. 19). The cowardly governor thus shakes off the responsibility of the perversion of justice which he allows. <span class="cmt_word">See ye to it</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;</span>, <span class="accented">vos videritis</span>, as ver. 4). You will take all the responsibility of the act; the blame will not be mine. Vain hope! Pilate may wash his hands, he cannot purify heart or conscience from the stain of this foul murder. As long as the Church lasts so long will the Creed announce that Jesus "suffered under Pontius Pilate." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Pilate</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#953;&#955;&#8118;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Pilatos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4091.htm">Strong's 4091: </a> </span><span class="str2">Pilate.
