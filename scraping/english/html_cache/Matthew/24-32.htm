Jesus uses the fig tree to illustrate a spiritual lesson, emphasizing the importance of discernment and understanding the signs of the times. In the context of <a href="/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a>, Jesus is speaking about the end times and His second coming. The fig tree's seasonal changes serve as a metaphor for recognizing the prophetic signs that indicate the nearness of these events.<p><b>As soon as its branches become tender and sprout leaves:</b><br>This phrase highlights the natural process of growth and renewal in the fig tree, which is a common sight in the region of Israel. The tender branches and new leaves signify the transition from winter to spring, a time of anticipation and preparation. In a prophetic sense, this imagery suggests that certain events or conditions will signal the approach of significant eschatological events. The tender branches can also symbolize the initial stages of fulfillment of prophecy, indicating that believers should be watchful and ready.<p><b>you know that summer is near:</b><br>Summer represents a time of harvest and fulfillment. In the biblical context, it can symbolize the culmination of God's plan and the coming of His kingdom. Just as the natural signs in the fig tree indicate the change of seasons, the signs mentioned earlier in <a href="/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a> (such as wars, famines, and earthquakes) point to the nearing of the end times. This phrase encourages believers to be vigilant and prepared, understanding that the fulfillment of God's promises is approaching.

In <a href="/mark/13-28.htm">Mark 13:28</a> and <a href="/luke/21-29.htm">Luke 21:29</a> the same instruction appears, underlining its importance. Just as He earlier used the fig tree to illustrate fruitlessness and judgment (<a href="/matthew/21-18.htm">Matthew 21:18-19</a>), He now uses it positively: creation itself becomes a clock that can be read. Scripture elsewhere urges believers to be observant about God&#8217;s signals in nature (<a href="/luke/12-54.htm">Luke 12:54-56</a>), so Christ is consistently teaching that everyday realities confirm prophetic truth.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>As soon as its branches become tender</b><p>The first unmistakable sign of change is when the branch softens after winter&#8217;s dormancy. In Song of Songs 2:11-13 the tender fig signals a new season, reinforcing that God built easy-to-read indicators into the natural world. Literally, the disciples understood how a pliable branch meant sap was flowing and life was returning. Prophetically, this speaks of the earliest events that precede the Lord&#8217;s visible return&#8212;initial stirrings in world affairs, Israel, and the church reminding us that God&#8217;s timetable is advancing (<a href="/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25-27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and sprout leaves</b><p>Leaves follow tenderness; the shift becomes visible to anyone who looks. <a href="/luke/21-29.htm">Luke 21:29</a> adds, &#8220;and all the trees,&#8221; confirming that multiple, concurrent signs will unfold. Yet the fig tree often symbolizes Israel (<a href="/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1-8</a>); many see the modern regathering of the Jewish people and the establishment of the nation in 1948 as a dramatic &#8220;leafing out.&#8221; Whether one focuses on Israel or on a wider array of end-time markers&#8212;global evangelism (<a href="/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>), moral decline (<a href="/2_timothy/3-1.htm">2 Timothy 3:1-5</a>), or geopolitical upheaval (<a href="/bsb/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38-39</a>)&#8212;the leaves are now observable to the generation that will witness the culmination.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>you know that summer is near</b><p>No guesswork is needed; the signs lead to a sure conclusion. In the same way, Jesus continues in <a href="/matthew/24-33.htm">Matthew 24:33</a>, &#8220;So also, when you see all these things, know that He is near, right at the door.&#8221; The nearness of summer parallels the nearness of His second coming. <a href="/james/5-8.htm">James 5:8</a> encourages, &#8220;Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is near.&#8221; While the exact day and hour remain hidden (<a href="/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a>), the nearness can be recognized with confidence, urging believers to readiness (<a href="/1_thessalonians/5-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:4-6</a>), holiness (<a href="/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2-3</a>), and gospel urgency (<a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/24-32.htm">Matthew 24:32</a> teaches that just as tender branches and fresh leaves guarantee the arrival of summer, clear prophetic signs guarantee the nearness of Christ&#8217;s return. The fig tree reminds us that God&#8217;s word is reliable, His timing purposeful, and His people called to watchfulness, faithfulness, and hope.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/24.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">Now learn a parable of the fig tree.</span>--As in so many other instances (comp.
