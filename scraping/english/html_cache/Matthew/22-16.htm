The Herodians, a political group supporting Herod Antipas, were unusual allies for the Pharisees, highlighting the gravity of their opposition to Jesus. This alliance underscores the threat Jesus posed to both religious and political establishments. The Herodians' involvement suggests a concern over Jesus' influence on the people, potentially destabilizing the political status quo.<p><b>&#8220;Teacher,&#8221; they said,</b><br>Addressing Jesus as "Teacher" acknowledges His role as a rabbi and authority in spiritual matters. This title, while respectful, is used here with a degree of insincerity, as their intent is to trap Him. The use of "Teacher" reflects the common practice of addressing respected figures in Jewish society, yet it also sets the stage for their duplicitous questioning.<p><b>&#8220;we know that You are honest</b><br>The statement about Jesus' honesty is an acknowledgment of His reputation for integrity and truthfulness. This characteristic of Jesus is consistent with His teachings and actions throughout the Gospels, where He consistently upholds truth and righteousness. Their acknowledgment, though insincere, inadvertently affirms Jesus' divine nature and His embodiment of truth.<p><b>and that You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.</b><br>This phrase recognizes Jesus' teaching as aligned with God's will, a significant admission from His adversaries. It reflects the broader biblical theme of Jesus as the ultimate revelation of God's truth, fulfilling the Law and the Prophets. This acknowledgment, though intended to flatter, highlights the divine authority and wisdom inherent in Jesus' teachings.<p><b>You seek favor from no one,</b><br>Jesus' impartiality and independence from human influence are emphasized here. This quality is crucial in His role as the Messiah, who is not swayed by public opinion or political pressure. It reflects the biblical principle that God's truth is not subject to human manipulation or favoritism, as seen in passages like <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>.<p><b>because You pay no attention to external appearance.</b><br>This statement underscores Jesus' focus on the heart rather than outward appearances, aligning with His teachings in passages like <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27-28</a>, where He criticizes the Pharisees for their hypocrisy. It reflects the biblical theme that God looks at the heart, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, and highlights Jesus' role in revealing the true nature of God's kingdom, which values inner righteousness over external conformity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Judaism known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions.

Even while scheming, Jesus&#8217; foes testify to His honesty, truthful teaching, and impartiality. Their empty praise contrasts with His genuine character, proving that the Son of God stands unshaken whether approached by disciples, Herodians, or any who would test Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/22.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">With the Herodians.</span>--The party thus described are known to us only through the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Mark; and their precise relation to the other sects or schools among the Jews are consequently matters of conjecture. The form of the name (like <span class= "ital">Mariani, Pompeiani,</span> and, we may add, <span class= "ital">Christiani</span>) is Latin, and may be noted as an example of the influence of that language in the public life of Palestine. The Herodians were known, first to the Romans and then to the people, as adherents of the house of the Herods. In what sense they were adherents, and why they now joined with the Pharisees, is less clear; and two distinct theories have been maintained: (1) That, as it was the general policy of all the princes of the Herodian family to court the favour of Rome, their partisans were those who held that it was lawful to "give tribute to Caesar." On this supposition the narrative brings before us the coalition of two parties usually opposed to each other, but united against a common foe. (2) That they were partisans of the Herods, in the sense of looking to them to restore the independence of the nation, and were therefore of one mind with the Pharisees on the tribute question, though they differed from them on most other points. A fact recorded by Jewish writers probably gives us the origin of the party. In the early days of Herod the Great, when Hillel, the great scribe, was at the height of his fame, he had as his colleague, Menahem, possibly the Essene of that name of whom Josephus tells us that he prophesied Herod's future greatness (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xv. 10, ? 5). The latter was tempted by the king's growing power, and, with eighty followers, entered into his service, forsook the ranks of the Pharisees, and appeared in forgeous apparel, glittering with gold (Jost, <span class= "ital">Gesch. judenthums,</span> i. 259; see Note on <a href="/matthew/11-8.htm" title="But what went you out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings' houses.">Matthew 11:8</a>). In <a href="/mark/3-6.htm" title="And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.">Mark 3:6</a> we find them at Capernaum conspiring with the Pharisees who had come from Jerusalem, and are thus led to see in their present action a renewal of the previous alliance. A comparison of <a href="/matthew/16-6.htm" title="Then Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.">Matthew 16:6</a> and <a href="/mark/8-15.htm" title="And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.">Mark 8:15</a> suggests a general affinity with the policy and tenets of the Sadducees. From St. Luke (<a href="/luke/23-7.htm" title="And as soon as he knew that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.">Luke 23:7</a>) we learn the fact that the Tetrarch himself (and therefore probably his followers) was at this time at Jerusalem, so that the renewed combination was natural enough. On the whole, the drift of the facts seems towards the conclusion that they were advocates of national submission to the emperor rather than assertors of independence.<p><span class= "bld">Master, we know that thou art true.</span>--Insidious as the praise was, intended, as it were, to goad Him who was thus addressed into showing, by some rash utterance, that He deserved it, it may be noted as an admission from the lips of adversaries of the supreme truthfulness and fearlessness of our Lord's teaching. The record of our Lord's Jerusalem ministry in St. John's Gospel (<span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> John 3, 5, 7, 8, 9) presents us with many of the occasions to which the Pharisees tacitly referred. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their disciples.</span> Men of their own party, or students in the rabbinical schools, like Paul, "brought up at the feet of Gamaliel" and such like teachers. They sent these unknown and apparently simpleminded persons, that they themselves, who were open and bitter enemies of Christ, might not appear in the matter. <span class="cmt_word">With the Herodians.</span> The two bodies hated one another, but made now an unholy alliance for the purpose of attacking Jesus. Hatred, like poverty, makes men acquainted with strange companions. The Herodians were a political sect which supported the dynasty of Herod, and were more or less favourable to the dominion of Rome, as that which preserved their authority in the country. In religious opinions they were mostly Sadducees. The Pharisees, on the other hand, in their nominal zeal for God, were violently opposed to the claims of Rome, and ready to rebel at the first favourable opportunity. They regarded the Herodians as little better than the heathen whom they favoured, but sunk their differences in the face of a general peril. Between these antagonistic elements an impious league had been formed earlier in Christ's ministry (see <a href="/mark/3-6.htm">Mark 3:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Master</span>; <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;</span>: <span class="accented">Teacher</span>, equivalent to "Rabbi;" owning him for the nonce as one possessed of teaching authority, though they willed not to be his disciples. <span class="cmt_word">True</span>; truthful. Thoroughly misapprehending the character of Jesus, they began by flattery. Nicodemus had spoken in sincerity when he said (<a href="/john/3-2.htm">John 3:2</a>), "Rabbi, we know that thou art a Teacher come from God;" but these make the admission in hypocrisy; it was a <span class="accented">captatio benevolentiae</span>, prompted by the spirit of evil. <span class="cmt_word">The way of God.</span> The precepts and rules which men must follow if they would please God.
