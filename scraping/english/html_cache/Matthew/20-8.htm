Evening signifies the completion of a day's work and often symbolizes the end of an era or the final judgment in biblical literature. This phrase sets the stage for the resolution of the parable, emphasizing the conclusion of the laborers' efforts.<p><b>the owner of the vineyard</b><br>The owner represents God, who is sovereign over His kingdom. Vineyards were common in Israel and often used in Scripture to symbolize God's people or His kingdom (<a href="/isaiah/5.htm">Isaiah 5:1-7</a>). The owner&#8217;s authority and decision-making reflect God's ultimate control and justice.<p><b>said to his foreman</b><br>The foreman acts as an intermediary, similar to prophets or apostles who convey God's messages. This role highlights the structured order within the parable, where the foreman executes the owner's will, akin to how God's servants carry out His commands.<p><b>&#8216;Call the workers and pay them their wages</b><br>This action reflects the principle of divine justice and reward. In the cultural context, paying wages at the end of the day was customary (<a href="/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>). The payment symbolizes the rewards of faithfulness and service in God's kingdom, aligning with the biblical theme of recompense for labor (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-8.htm">1 Corinthians 3:8</a>).<p><b>starting with the last ones hired and moving on to the first.&#8217;</b><br>This reversal of order challenges human notions of fairness and merit, illustrating the kingdom of God's values, where the last shall be first (<a href="/matthew/19-30.htm">Matthew 19:30</a>). It underscores the theme of grace, where God's generosity transcends human expectations and calculations, reflecting the parable's message that God's grace is not earned by works but given freely.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/landowner.htm">Landowner</a></b><br>Represents God, who is just and generous, overseeing the vineyard and hiring laborers.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/laborers.htm">Laborers</a></b><br>Symbolize believers or followers of Christ, called to work in God's kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/vineyard.htm">Vineyard</a></b><br>Represents the kingdom of heaven, where God's work is to be done.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/foreman.htm">Foreman</a></b><br>Acts as an intermediary, distributing the wages, symbolizing Christ or God's messengers.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/evening.htm">Evening</a></b><br>The time of reckoning or judgment, when rewards are given.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_generosity_and_justice.htm">God's Generosity and Justice</a></b><br>God is both generous and just, rewarding each believer according to His divine wisdom and grace.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/equality_in_the_kingdom_of_heaven.htm">Equality in the Kingdom of Heaven</a></b><br>The parable teaches that in God's kingdom, all are equal recipients of His grace, regardless of when they come to faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_serve.htm">The Call to Serve</a></b><br>Believers are called to serve diligently in God's vineyard, trusting in His provision and timing for rewards.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/contentment_with_god's_provision.htm">Contentment with God's Provision</a></b><br>We should cultivate contentment and gratitude for what God provides, rather than comparing our blessings with others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_faithfulness.htm">The Importance of Faithfulness</a></b><br>Faithfulness in our calling is crucial, as God values our commitment and service over the duration or visibility of our work.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_20_8_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 20:8?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_20_8_God_s_fairness_in_rewards.htm">How does Matthew 20:8 illustrate God's fairness in rewarding His servants?

Why the last are rewarded first is one of the difficulties of the parable. To say that this is done because in their one hour's work they did more than all the rest, is a solution which is supported by nothing in the story itself.
