Jesus often used direct speech to convey significant teachings to His followers, ensuring clarity and authority in His words.<p><b>Truly I tell you</b><br>The use of "truly" (or "amen" in Greek) underscores the certainty and importance of what follows. It is a solemn affirmation, often used by Jesus to introduce profound truths or promises.<p><b>in the renewal of all things</b><br>This refers to the eschatological hope of a new creation, a theme found throughout Scripture. It echoes the prophetic visions of a restored world found in <a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a> and <a href="/revelation/21.htm">Revelation 21:1</a>, where God promises a new heaven and a new earth.<p><b>when the Son of Man sits on His glorious throne</b><br>The title "Son of Man" is a messianic term Jesus frequently used for Himself, drawing from <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the Son of Man is given dominion and glory. The "glorious throne" signifies His authority and kingship, fulfilled in the eschatological future when Christ reigns supreme.<p><b>you who have followed Me</b><br>This phrase highlights the disciples' commitment and the cost of discipleship.

Here, however, it clearly has a wider range. There is to be a "new birth" for mankind as well as for the individual. The sorrows through which the world was to pass were to be as the travail-pangs of that passage into a higher life. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/24-8.htm" title="All these are the beginning of sorrows.">Matthew 24:8</a>.) Beyond them there lay, in the thoughts of the disciples, and, though after another pattern, in the mind of Christ, the times of the "restitution of all things" (<a href="/acts/3-21.htm" title="Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.">Acts 3:21</a>), the coming of the victorious Christ in the glory of His kingdom. In that triumph the Twelve were to be sharers. Interpreted as they in their then stage of progress would necessarily interpret them, the words suggested the idea of a kingdom restored to Israel, in which they should be assessors of the divine King, not only or chiefly in the great work of judging every man according to his works, but as "judging," in the old sense of the word, the "twelve tribes of Israel," redressing wrongs, guiding, governing. As the words that the Son of Man should "sit on the throne of His glory" recalled the vision of <a href="/daniel/7-14.htm" title="And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.">Daniel 7:14</a>, so these assured them that they should be foremost among those of "the saints of the Most High," to whom, as in the same vision, had been given glory and dominion (<a href="/daniel/7-27.htm" title="And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.">Daniel 7:27</a>). The apocalyptic imagery in which the promise was clothed reappears in the vision of the four-and-twenty elders seated on their thrones in <a href="/revelation/4-4.htm" title="And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and on the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.">Revelation 4:4</a>, in the sealing of the hundred and forty-four thousand of all the tribes of Israel in <a href="/revelation/7-4.htm" title="And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.">Revelation 7:4</a>, and the interpretation of the words here is subject to the same conditions as that of those later visions. What approximations to a literal fulfilment there may be in the far-off future lies behind the veil. They receive at least an adequate fulfilment if we see in them the promise that, in the last triumphant stage of the redeeming work, the Apostles should still be recognised and had in honour, as guiding the faith and conduct of their countrymen; their names should be on the twelve foundations of the heavenly Jerusalem (<a href="/revelation/21-14.htm" title="And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.">Revelation 21:14</a>); they should be sharers in the throne and glory of its King. The thought on which St. Paul dwells, that the "saints shall judge the world" (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-2.htm" title="Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?">1Corinthians 6:2</a>), in like manner refers not only or chiefly to any share which the disciples of Christ shall have in the actual work of the final judgment, but to the assured triumph of the faith, the laws, the principles of action of which they were then the persecuted witnesses. We must not ignore the fact that, in at least one instance, the words, absolute as they were in their form, failed of their fulfilment. The guilt of Judas left one of the thrones vacant. The promise was given subject to the implied conditions of faithfulness and endurance lasting even to the end. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Verily I say unto you.</span> Christ does not reprove the apostle for his seemingly bold self-assertion, but, replying to Peter's question, he gives a grand promise to him and his fellow disciples. <span class="cmt_word">Ye which have followed me</span>, excluding all the half-hearted, the self-seeking, the Judaizers. <span class="cmt_word">In the regeneration</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>). The word means "new birth," or "renovation, renewal." It occurs in <a href="/titus/3-15.htm">Titus 3:15</a> in reference to baptism," through the washing [laver] of regeneration." It has been variously interpreted in the present passage. Some have connected it with the participle preceding, "ye who have followed me in the regeneration," and explained it to mean the reformation and spiritual renovation commencing with the preaching of John the Baptist, and carried on by the ministry of Christ. But more generally and correctly it is taken with what follows, Ye shall sit, etc. The meaning, however, is still disputed. Some say that the Christian dispensation is intended, and an intimation is given of the work of the apostles in the unseen world in directing and guarding the Church. But this seems hardly to satisfy the language of the promise. Others regard the term as signifying the resurrection, when the mortal shall put on immortality, and we shall be changed, remade, reconstituted. This is true; but it seems more suitable to refer the term to the new creation, the new heaven and the new earth spoken of by Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/65-17.htm">Isaiah 65:17</a>) and by St. John (<a href="/revelation/21-12.htm">Revelation 21:12</a>; cf. <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10, 13</a>); This is the reparation of the whole creation described by St. Paul (<a href="/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>, etc.), which is to take place at the great consummation, and which, remedying all the evils which sin has impressed on the material and spiritual world, on man and his habitation, may well be called new birth. This is the mysterious period when Christ's promise shall be accomplished. <span class="cmt_word">Shall sit.</span> It is not "when he shall come," but when he shall have taken his seat (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>, with genitive) as Judge upon his glorious throne. <span class="cmt_word">Ye also</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>). The pronoun is repeated to give greater emphasis to the amazing assertion. <span class="cmt_word">Shall sit upon</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span>, with accusative); <span class="accented">shall be promoted to</span>, taken and placed upon. <span class="cmt_word">Twelve thrones.</span> Judas forfeited his position; Matthias and Paul and Barnabas were afterwards added to the apostolic band; so that the number <span class="accented">twelve</span> must not be pressed as defining and limiting. Rather it expresses the completeness of the judicial body, regarding not so much the persons as the position of its members. With reference to papal claims, it may be observed that Peter has no pre-eminence here, no throne to himself; he merely shares with his colleagues in the session. The apostles and those who have been proved to be of like mind with them (for the number is not limited) shall be assessors with Christ, as in an earthly court, where the judge or the prince sits in the centre, and on either side of him are posted his councillors and ministers. <span class="cmt_word">Judging</span>. So in Daniel we hear of thrones being placed, and judgment given to the saints (<a href="/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9, 22</a>); "Know ye not," says St. Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/6-2.htm">1 Corinthians 6:2, 3</a>), "that the saints shall judge the world... that we shall judge angels?" (comp. <a href="/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>). Of course, the great Judge is Christ himself. What part his assessors shall take is not revealed. The verb "judge" sometimes signifies "govern or direct," and perhaps may be here used to denote that the saints shall, in the new Messianic kingdom, be Christ's vicegerents and exercise his authority. <span class="cmt_word">The twelve tribes of Israel.</span> There is considerable difficulty in interpreting this portion of the promise. If it means that the beatified apostles shall judge the actual descendants of Abraham, then we must believe that the distinction between Jew and Gentile will be maintained in this <span class="accented">regeneration</span> - an opinion which seems to be opposed to other texts of Scripture (see <a href="/1_corinthians/12-13.htm">1 Corinthians 12:13</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, etc.). The judging in this case would be condemnation of them for not receiving the gospel. One does not see how this can be held forth as a great and happy reward, however high a position it may imply. More probably <span class="accented">Israel</span> means the spiritual Israel, or the whole body of the Church; and the number twelve (as above) imports the complete number of those who are to be judged. They who have followed Christ devotedly and sincerely, as his disciples, shall be placed next to him in his glory, shall have pre-eminence over all others, and be associated with him in assigning their due portion to all believers, or in governing the Church. Nothing is here said about the final judgment of unbelievers and heathen. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/19-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(eipen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2036.htm">Strong's 2036: </a> </span><span class="str2">Answer, bid, bring word, command.
