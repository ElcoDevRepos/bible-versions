It echoes the earlier feeding of the five thousand (<a href="/matthew/14-17.htm">Matthew 14:17</a>), where Jesus also asked about available resources. This approach teaches reliance on God&#8217;s provision, even when resources seem insufficient. It also reflects the biblical principle of stewardship, where God often uses what we already have to accomplish His purposes.<p><b>Jesus asked.</b><br>Jesus' inquiry demonstrates His intentionality and awareness of the situation. It shows His role as a teacher, guiding His disciples to recognize their dependence on divine provision. This moment is a precursor to the miracle, emphasizing Jesus' authority and His ability to provide abundantly. It also reflects His compassion for the crowd, as He seeks to meet their physical needs.<p><b>Seven,</b><br>The number seven is significant in biblical numerology, often symbolizing completeness or perfection. In this context, it may suggest the sufficiency of God's provision through Jesus. The use of seven loaves, despite being a small amount, foreshadows the miraculous abundance that will follow. This number also connects to the seven days of creation, indicating a divine act of provision and care.<p><b>they replied,</b><br>The disciples' response indicates their awareness of the limited resources, yet they present what they have to Jesus. This act of obedience and trust is crucial, as it sets the stage for the miracle. It reflects a recurring biblical theme where God uses what is available, no matter how small, to accomplish His purposes (e.g., the widow's oil in <a href="/2_kings/4.htm">2 Kings 4:1-7</a>).<p><b>and a few small fish.</b><br>The mention of fish, along with the loaves, is reminiscent of the earlier feeding miracle. Fish were a common food source in Galilee, reflecting the local culture and economy. The smallness of the fish underscores the insufficiency of the resources, highlighting the magnitude of the miracle. This detail also points to Jesus' ability to transform the ordinary into the extraordinary, providing abundantly for the needs of the people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one performing the miracle.

(1 Kings 19:8)</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Matthew 15:34 Mean</div><b>How many loaves do you have?</b><p>Jesus begins with a simple inventory. He is not ignorant of the count (see <a href="/john/6-6.htm">John 6:6</a>), yet He invites His followers to look at what is already in their hands. The pattern stretches back to the LORD asking Moses, &#8220;What is that in your hand?&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2</a>) and Elisha asking the widow, &#8220;What do you have in the house?&#8221; (<a href="/2_kings/4-2.htm">2 Kings 4:2</a>). By drawing attention to present resources:<p>&#8226; He teaches stewardship&#8212;recognizing that everything we possess is already God&#8217;s provision.<p>&#8226; He stirs faith&#8212;reminding us that divine multiplication starts with surrendering the ordinary.<p>&#8226; He exposes any tendency toward despair; they must acknowledge what they do have before He transforms it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus asked</b><p>That gentle inquiry reveals the Shepherd&#8217;s relational approach. He engages, instructs, and stretches His disciples rather than acting unilaterally. As <a href="/mark/8-5.htm">Mark 8:5&#8211;6</a> shows in the parallel account, Jesus&#8217; questions are faith-building moments. Even after witnessing the earlier feeding of the five thousand (<a href="/matthew/14-17.htm">Matthew 14:17&#8211;21</a>), the disciples still need prompting to recall His sufficiency. His question becomes:<p>&#8226; A test, similar to <a href="/john/6-5.htm">John 6:5&#8211;7</a>, highlighting human limitation versus divine power.<p>&#8226; A bridge between compassion (<a href="/matthew/15-32.htm">Matthew 15:32</a>) and miracle&#8212;He cares first, then acts.<p>&#8226; A call to partnership, inviting the disciples into the process of blessing the crowd.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Seven,&#8221;</b><p>Their answer is exact and literal. Seven loaves&#8212;not symbolic bread&#8212;lie in their baskets. Yet the number does echo themes of fullness (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2&#8211;3</a>) and covenant completeness. The disciples&#8217; frank response models honesty before God: no embellishment, no excuse. In later reflection Jesus will ask, &#8220;When I broke the seven loaves for the four thousand, how many baskets of pieces did you pick up?&#8221; (<a href="/mark/8-20.htm">Mark 8:20</a>). He anchors their memory in specifics so they will never doubt His faithfulness. Points to notice:<p>&#8226; Seven is more than five&#8212;yet still far short of feeding &#8220;about four thousand men, besides women and children&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/15-38.htm">Matthew 15:38</a>).<p>&#8226; The disciples place all seven at Jesus&#8217; disposal; holding back even one would limit the lesson.<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; deliberate use of different quantities (five loaves earlier, seven here) underscores that the size of the initial supply is irrelevant to His power.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and a few small fish.</b><p>The phrase underscores insignificance in human eyes. Matthew purposely notes &#8220;small&#8221; to contrast with the great need. When added to the loaves, these fish become part of the blessing, reminding us that nothing is too trivial for Christ to use (cf. <a href="/zechariah/4-10.htm">Zechariah 4:10</a>; <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27&#8211;29</a>). Practical takeaways:<p>&#8226; God values the overlooked gift&#8212;no voice, talent, or resource is wasted in His kingdom.<p>&#8226; Multiplication applies to every surrendered item, not merely the primary one.<p>&#8226; The detail of fish mirrors the earlier miracle (<a href="/luke/9-13.htm">Luke 9:13</a>), affirming that Jesus consistently meets both physical and spiritual hunger.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/15-34.htm">Matthew 15:34</a> invites believers to take stock of real, tangible resources and place them unreservedly in Jesus&#8217; hands. His question draws us into partnership; His knowledge assures us He already has the plan. Seven ordinary loaves and a few small fish, fully surrendered, become vehicles for God&#8217;s abundant provision. The verse therefore teaches stewardship, honesty, faith, and the certainty that Christ can meet any need when we yield everything&#8212;great or small&#8212;to Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(34) <span class= "bld">Seven, and a few little fishes.</span>--The resemblance of the answer to that which had been given before is, at least, interesting as showing what was the provision habitually made by the travelling company of preachers for the supply of their daily wants. The few barley loaves and dried fishes, this was all their store, as they went from village to village, or passed days and nights on the hills of Galilee.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How many loaves have ye?</span> Jesus gives no formal answer to the apostles' hesitating question, but by a new interrogation leads them to expect his interposition. This was the prelude to the miracle. <span class="cmt_word">Seven, and a few little fishes.</span> They de not add, as on the former occasion, "But what are they among so many?" They have learned something from what had previously occurred. Whether this little store was what remained of their own supplies, or whether it was all they could find among the multitude, does not appear. From the indeterminate mention of the fish, we should suppose the latter to have been the case, as they would probably have mentioned the number of the fishes had they been their own. There may have been some contempt implied in the diminutive <span class="greek">&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, "little fishes," as though these were scarcely worthy of notice.
