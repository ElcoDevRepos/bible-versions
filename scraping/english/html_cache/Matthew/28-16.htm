This group is significant as they were chosen by Jesus to be His closest followers and witnesses to His ministry. The number eleven highlights the absence of Judas and sets the stage for the later addition of Matthias in <a href="/acts/1-26.htm">Acts 1:26</a>. The disciples are central figures in the early church and are tasked with spreading the Gospel.<p><b>went to Galilee</b><br>Galilee is a region in northern Israel, significant in Jesus' ministry as many of His teachings and miracles occurred there. It is also where Jesus first called some of His disciples. The return to Galilee fulfills Jesus' post-resurrection instruction (<a href="/matthew/28-7.htm">Matthew 28:7, 10</a>) and symbolizes a return to the beginning of His ministry, emphasizing continuity and fulfillment of His mission. Galilee, being a diverse and less politically charged area than Jerusalem, serves as a strategic location for the disciples to regroup and receive the Great Commission.<p><b>to the mountain</b><br>Mountains in biblical narratives often serve as places of revelation and divine encounter. Examples include Mount Sinai, where Moses received the Law, and the Mount of Transfiguration, where Jesus was revealed in glory. The specific mountain is not named, but its mention suggests a setting for a significant revelation or instruction. Mountains symbolize stability, permanence, and a closer proximity to God, setting the stage for the momentous commissioning of the disciples.<p><b>Jesus had designated</b><br>This phrase indicates Jesus' foreknowledge and authority. He had previously instructed the disciples to meet Him in Galilee (<a href="/matthew/26-32.htm">Matthew 26:32, 28</a>:7, 10), demonstrating His control over events even after His resurrection. The designation of a specific meeting place underscores the intentionality of Jesus' post-resurrection appearances and His continued guidance of the disciples.

We may think of the mountain as being one that had been the scene of former meetings between the Master and His disciples. They had seen Him there before, in the body of His humiliation. They were now to see Him in the body of His glory. (Comp. <a href="/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Philippians 3:21</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 16-20.</span> - <span class="accented">Our Lord appears to the disciples in Galilee, and gives them a commission to teach and baptize.</span> (Peculiar to St. Matthew; but comp. <a href="/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15-18</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then the eleven disciples.</span> There is no note of time in the original, which gives merely, <span class="accented">But the eleven</span>, etc. The meeting here narrated took place on some day after the first Easter week. The number "eleven" shows the loss of one of the sacred college, whose complement was not filled up till just before Pentecost (<a href="/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15-26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Went away into Galilee.</span> St. Matthew takes pains to show the exact fulfilment of Christ's very special injunction and promise concerning Galilee (see vers. 7, 10, and notes there, and <a href="/matthew/26-32.htm">Matthew 26:32</a>). The evangelist's object being to set forth Christ in his character as King and Lawgiver, he puts aside all other incidents in order to give prominence to this appearance, where Jesus announces his supreme authority (ver. 18), gives the commission to his apostles, and promises his perpetual presence (vers. 19, 20). <span class="cmt_word">Into a mountain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">the mountain</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>where</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Jesus had appointed them</span>. We do not know the locality intended, though it must have been some spot familiar to the disciples, and was probably plainly designated at the time when Christ appointed the meeting. Some have fixed on Tabor as the scene of this revelation, others on the Mount of Beatitudes; but where nothing is stated it is best to lay aside conjecture and accept the designed indefiniteness. Many commentators have determined that this appearance on the Galilaean mountain was that mentioned by St. Paul (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>), as manifested to five hundred brethren at once. This is a mere conjecture, probable, but not certain. If it was the case, we must consider that St. Matthew singles out the eleven apostles as the most eminent among the company, and those to whom the Lord specially addressed the commission which he mentions. Of the five hundred brethren, St. Paul, writing some twenty years or more after this time, testifies that the greater number were still alive, only some having "fallen asleep." There never was, indeed, any historical fact the authenticity of which was more remarkably and irrefragably certified than the resurrection of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/28-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Meanwhile,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#927;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(Hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
