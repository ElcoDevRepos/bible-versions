In the Jewish tradition, prayer was a daily ritual, with set times for prayer. Jesus assumes that His followers will pray, indicating its importance in spiritual life. This phrase sets the stage for a teaching on the proper attitude and approach to prayer.<p><b>do not be like the hypocrites</b><br>The term "hypocrites" refers to those who perform religious acts for show rather than from genuine devotion. In the cultural context of first-century Judaism, a hypocrite was someone who wore a mask, akin to an actor. Jesus warns against insincerity in religious practices, emphasizing the need for authenticity in one's relationship with God.<p><b>For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners</b><br>Standing was a common posture for prayer in Jewish culture, and synagogues were central places of worship and community gathering. Praying on street corners suggests a desire for public attention. This behavior reflects a misuse of religious practices for personal glory rather than for honoring God. The emphasis is on the location and posture that draw public attention, contrasting with the private, humble approach Jesus advocates.<p><b>to be seen by men</b><br>The motivation of the hypocrites is to gain human approval and admiration. This phrase highlights the danger of seeking validation from people rather than from God. It connects to the broader biblical theme of God knowing the heart, as seen in <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances.<p><b>Truly I tell you, they already have their full reward</b><br>The phrase "Truly I tell you" underscores the authority of Jesus' teaching. The "full reward" refers to the temporary and superficial praise from people, which is the only reward the hypocrites will receive. This contrasts with the eternal rewards promised to those who seek God's approval. The concept of reward is further explored in passages like <a href="/matthew/6-6.htm">Matthew 6:6</a>, where private prayer is rewarded by the Father.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, providing instruction on the proper attitude and approach to prayer.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/h/hypocrites.htm">Hypocrites</a></b><br>Individuals who perform religious acts for outward show rather than genuine devotion.

God prizes a heart that seeks His face rather than human applause, and He alone grants lasting reward to those who pray for His glory.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/6.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">Standing in the synagogues.</span>--The Jewish custom, more or less prevalent throughout the East, and for a time retained at certain seasons in the Christian Church, was to pray standing, with outstretched, uplifted hands, and there was nothing in the attitude as such that made it an act of ostentatious devotion; nor would there have been any ostentation in thus joining in the common prayer of the congregation assembled in the synagogue. What our Lord's words point to, was the custom of going into the synagogue, as men go now into the churches of Latin Christendom, to offer private devotion (as, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> in the parable of the Pharisee and the publican), and of doing this so as to attract notice, the worshipper standing apart as if absorbed in prayer, while secretly glancing round to watch the impression which he might be making on others who were looking on.<p><span class= "bld">In the corners of the streets.</span>--Not the same word as in <a href="/matthew/6-3.htm" title="But when you do alms, let not your left hand know what your right hand does:">Matthew 6:3</a>, but the broad, open places of the city. There, too, the Pharisees might be seen, reciting their appointed prayers--probably the well-known eighteen acts of devotion which were appointed for the use of devout Israelites--and with the <span class= "ital">tallith</span> or veil of prayer over their head.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-15.</span> - <span class="accented">Prayer.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5-8.</span> - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be</span>, etc.; Revised Version, plural. Ver. 5 is addressed to the disciples generally, ver. 6 to them individually. (For the future, cf. <a href="/matthew/5-48.htm">Matthew 5:48</a>, note.) <span class="cmt_word">As the hypocrites are</span> (ver. 2, note). The 'Didache,' &sect; 8, following this passage, says, "Neither pray ye as the hypocrites," referring, like our Lord, to practices affected chiefly by the Pharisees. <span class="cmt_word">For they love</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>). Not to be translated "they are wont." Our Lord points out the cause of this their custom. It was not that the synagogue was more convenient (he is, of course, thinking of their private prayers), or that they were accidentally overtaken by the prayer-hour when in the street, but their innate love of display made them choose these places "that they may be seen of men" (cf. ver. 16, and contrast ver. 2). <span class="cmt_word">To pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets</span>; <span class="accented">to stand and pray</span>, etc. (Revised Version), giving, however, slightly more emphasis on "stand" than its position warrants. The emphasis is really on the place, not on the posture, which was only what was usual among Jews (cf. <a href="/mark/11-25.htm">Mark 11:25</a>; <a href="/luke/18-11.htm">Luke 18:11, 13</a>). There is no thought of taking up their position, standing still (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="/acts/5-20.htm">Acts 5:20</a>; cf. <a href="/luke/18-11.htm">Luke 18:11, 40</a>). (For the practice here condemned by our Lord, cf. Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.,' "R. Jochauau said, I saw R. Jannai standing and praying in the streets of Tsippor, and going four cubits, and then praying the Additionary Prayer.") <span class="cmt_word">They have,</span> etc. (ver. 2, note). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/6-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">when</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(hotan)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3752.htm">Strong's 3752: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, whenever.
