It follows His cleansing of the temple and the confrontation with the religious leaders, highlighting His authority and the tension between Him and the Jewish authorities. This departure can be seen as a symbolic act of judgment against those who rejected His message.<p><b>and went out of the city</b><br>Jesus leaving the city of Jerusalem is significant as it reflects His pattern of retreating from the crowds to seek solitude or to be with His disciples. Jerusalem, the center of Jewish religious life, is also the place where Jesus would later be crucified. His temporary departure foreshadows the ultimate rejection He would face there.<p><b>to Bethany</b><br>Bethany is a small village located about two miles east of Jerusalem on the Mount of Olives. It is significant in the Gospels as the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from the dead. Bethany served as a place of refuge and rest for Jesus during His final week before the crucifixion. The village's proximity to Jerusalem made it a convenient location for Jesus to stay while still being able to enter the city during the day.<p><b>where He spent the night</b><br>This detail emphasizes Jesus' humanity and His need for rest. It also shows His intentional withdrawal from the city, possibly to avoid further confrontation with the authorities at that time. Spending the night in Bethany allowed Jesus to be in a supportive environment among friends. This act of retreating for the night can be seen as a preparation for the events that would soon unfold in Jerusalem, including His passion and crucifixion.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is leaving Jerusalem after a day of significant events, including the cleansing of the temple and teaching the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethany.htm">Bethany</a></b><br>A small village located about two miles east of Jerusalem, Bethany is significant as a place of rest and refuge for Jesus.

His departure signals judgment on empty religion, models dependence on the Father, and prepares the stage for the climactic acts of Passion Week. The verse, though brief, pulses with purpose: separation from unbelief, identification with the lowly, and steadfast movement toward the cross.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">And went out of the city into Bethany.</span>--St. Mark, as already noticed, places the incident that follows on the morning that followed the triumphal entry, and before the cleansing. We have to choose, there being an obvious error of arrangement in one or other of the narratives, between the two, and the probability seems on the whole in favour of the more precise and more vivid record of St. Mark. The lodging at Bethany is explained partly by what we read in <a href="/context/matthew/26-6.htm" title="Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,">Matthew 26:6-13</a>, yet more by <a href="/context/john/11-1.htm" title="Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.">John 11:1-2</a>; <a href="/john/12-1.htm" title="Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.">John 12:1</a>. There He found in the house of the friends who were dear to Him the rest and peace which He could not find in the crowded city. The suppression of the name of those friends in the first three Gospels is every way significant, as suggesting that there were reasons which for a time (probably till the death of Lazarus) led all writers of the records which served as the basis of the Gospel history to abstain from the mention of any facts that might attract attention to them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He left them</span>. The chief priests had nothing to say in reply to this testimony of Scripture. They feared to arrest him in the face of the enthusiastic multitude; they bided their time, for the present apparently silenced. Jesus, wasting no further argument on these wilfully unbelieving people, turned and left them. The King had no home in his royal city; he sought one in lowly Bethany, where he was always sure of a welcome in the house of Martha and Mary. It is somewhat doubtful whether he availed himself of his friends' hospitality at this time. The term "Bethany" would include the district so called in the vicinity of the town, as in the description of the scene of the Ascension (<a href="/luke/24-50.htm">Luke 24:50</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lodged</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>). This word, if its strict classical use is pressed, would imply that Jesus passed the night in the open air; but it may mean merely "lodge," or "pass the night," without any further connotation; so no certain inference can be drawn from its employment in this passage. This withdrawal of Jesus obviated all danger of a rising in his favour, which, supported by the vast resources of the temple, might have had momentous consequences at this time of popular concourse and excitement. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">He left</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#955;&#953;&#960;&#8060;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(katalip&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2641.htm">Strong's 2641: </a> </span><span class="str2">From kata and leipo; to leave down, i.e. Behind; by implication, to abandon, have remaining.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">them</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(autous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Accusative Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
