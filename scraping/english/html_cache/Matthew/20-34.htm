Compassion is a recurring theme in Jesus' ministry, reflecting God's character as merciful and loving. In the Gospels, Jesus often responds to human suffering with compassion, as seen in <a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a> and <a href="/mark/1-41.htm">Mark 1:41</a>. This compassion is not just an emotional response but leads to action, demonstrating the divine nature of Jesus as the Good Shepherd who cares for His flock.<p><b>Jesus touched their eyes</b><br>The act of touching signifies a personal and intimate connection. In the cultural context of the time, touching a blind person would have been seen as an act of kindness and breaking social norms, as physical ailments were often stigmatized. Jesus' touch is a powerful symbol of His willingness to engage with and heal those marginalized by society. This act also fulfills the messianic prophecies of healing found in <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5</a>, which speaks of the eyes of the blind being opened.<p><b>and at once they received their sight</b><br>The immediacy of the healing underscores Jesus' divine authority and power. Unlike other healers of the time, who might have used rituals or incantations, Jesus' word and touch alone bring about miraculous change. This instantaneous healing is a testament to His identity as the Son of God and serves as a sign of the inbreaking of God's kingdom, where restoration and wholeness are realized.<p><b>and followed Him</b><br>The response of the healed individuals is one of discipleship and gratitude. Following Jesus implies a commitment to His teachings and a transformation of life. This mirrors the call of the first disciples in <a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19-20</a>, who left everything to follow Him. It also reflects the broader biblical theme of spiritual enlightenment, where physical sight symbolizes the opening of spiritual eyes to recognize and follow the truth of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the compassionate healer who responds to the needs of the blind men.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_blind_men.htm">The Blind Men</a></b><br>Two individuals who are physically blind and call out to Jesus for mercy, demonstrating faith in His ability to heal.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_road_from_jericho.htm">The Road from Jericho</a></b><br>The setting of this event, where Jesus encounters the blind men as He is traveling with His disciples and a large crowd.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_in_action.htm">Compassion in Action</a></b><br>Jesus' response to the blind men demonstrates that true compassion leads to action.

Despite the crowd's attempts to silence them, they continue to call out to Jesus. This teaches us the importance of persevering in faith, even when faced with obstacles.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_sight.htm">Spiritual Sight</a></b><br>While the physical healing of the blind men is miraculous, it also symbolizes the spiritual sight that Jesus offers.

We see it when the father runs to the prodigal (<a href="/luke/15-20.htm">Luke 15:20</a>) and when Jesus feeds hungry multitudes (<a href="/mark/8-2.htm">Mark 8:2&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; His compassion assures us that every cry is heard (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a>) and every tear noticed (<a href="/psalms/56-8.htm">Psalm 56:8</a>). In <a href="/bsb/matthew/20.htm">Matthew 20</a>, the blind men call out, and the Savior&#8217;s first response is inward mercy that propels outward help.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus touched their eyes</b><p>The Lord could heal with a word (<a href="/luke/7-7.htm">Luke 7:7</a>), yet He often chooses touch.<p>&#8226; Touch communicates worth. Lepers felt untouchable until Jesus &#8220;reached out His hand and touched him&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/8-3.htm">Matthew 8:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Touch conveys identification.

And then the two followed Him, glorifying God. In St. Luke's narrative the incident is followed by the story of Zacchaeus and the parable of the Pounds. Possibly (see Note on <a href="/matthew/20-30.htm" title="And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, you son of David.">Matthew 20:30</a>) they preceded it.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Touched their</span> <span class="cmt_word">eyes.</span> Only St. Matthew mentions this action of our Lord; but in all other cases of the cure of blindness the healing touch of the Man accompanied the word of the God (comp. <a href="/matthew/9-29.htm">Matthew 9:29</a>; <a href="/mark/8-23.htm">Mark 8:23</a>; <a href="/john/9-6.htm">John 9:6</a>), and Christ did not now depart from his usual practice. Thus, as we have noticed before, he connected the cure with himself. He proved that his flesh taken unto the Godhead was life-giving, remedial, efficacious; and he confirmed the faith of the sufferers and bystanders by showing that there was no deceit or collusion. The other synoptists give Christ's assurance to the men, that the restoration of their sight was the reward of faith - a faith exhibited by the invocation of Jesus as "Son of David," by continued importunity amid surrounding difficulties, by confidence in his power and willingness to heal brought to a point by Christ's question, "What will ye that I shall do unto you?" <span class="cmt_word">They followed him.</span> A fact only less remarkable than the miracle that led to it. The impulse of a grateful heart drew them along the road which the Saviour travelled. They may have accompanied him to Jerusalem, and joined the applauding multitude which escorted him to the holy city, and employed their new power of sight in observing that wonderful spectacle which the next few days afforded. One, at any rate, of these men, Bartimaeus, seems to have become known in the early Church as a devoted follower of Christ, and hence his name is recorded for all time in the sacred narrative. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/20-34.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Moved with compassion,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#931;&#960;&#955;&#945;&#947;&#967;&#957;&#953;&#963;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Splanchnistheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4697.htm">Strong's 4697: </a> </span><span class="str2">To feel compassion, have pity on, be moved. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">touched</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7973;&#968;&#945;&#964;&#959;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;psato)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Middle - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_680.htm">Strong's 680: </a> </span><span class="str2">Prop: I fasten to; I lay hold of, touch, know carnally.
