The act of rebuking is a command that shows His power over demonic forces, a theme consistent throughout the Gospels. This authority is rooted in His divine nature, as seen in other instances such as <a href="/mark/1-25.htm">Mark 1:25</a> and <a href="/luke/4-35.htm">Luke 4:35</a>. The rebuke signifies not only a verbal command but also a spiritual confrontation, emphasizing Jesus' role as the ultimate victor over evil.<p><b>and it came out of the boy</b><br>The immediate response of the demon to Jesus' command highlights the power of His word. This event is a fulfillment of the messianic prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>, where the Messiah is described as one who sets captives free. The expulsion of the demon also serves as a sign of the in-breaking of God's kingdom, where evil is defeated and God's reign is established. This act is a testament to Jesus' mission to liberate those oppressed by spiritual forces.<p><b>and he was healed from that moment</b><br>The healing of the boy is both physical and spiritual, illustrating the comprehensive nature of Jesus' miracles. The phrase "from that moment" indicates the immediacy and completeness of the healing, underscoring the transformative power of Jesus' intervention. This healing is a foretaste of the ultimate restoration promised in the eschatological hope of <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>, where all suffering and pain will be eradicated. The boy's healing also serves as a type of the greater spiritual healing available through faith in Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who performs the miracle of casting out the demon.

And he said, Of a child.">Mark 9:21</a> implies, as indeed the Greek does here, that the sufferer had passed beyond the age of childhood. St. Mark gives the words of the rebuke, "Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out from him, and enter no more into him." This was followed by a great cry and another convulsion; then he fell down, "as it were, dead," and many cried out, "He is dead." Then Jesus took him by the hand, and raised him up, and the work of healing was accomplished. Calmness, and peace, and self-possession were seen instead of the convulsive agony. The spiritual power of the Healer had overcome the force, whether morbid or demoniac, which was the cause of his sufferings. Our Lord's words, it need hardly be said, assume it to have been the latter; and those who deny the reality of the possession must, in their turn, assume either that He shared the belief of the people, or accepted it because they were not able to receive any other explanation of the mysterious sufferings which they had witnessed. Each hypothesis presents difficulties of its own, and we may well be content to confess our inability to solve them. (See Note on <a href="/matthew/8-28.htm" title="And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.">Matthew 8:28</a>.) Speaking generally, the language of the New Testament seems to recognise, if not in all diseases, yet at least in all that disturb the moral equilibrium of man's nature, an infraction of the divine order, and therefore rightly sees in them the work, directly or indirectly, of the great antagonist of that order. All our Lord's works of mercy are summed up by St. Peter in the words that "He went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil" (<a href="/acts/10-38.htm" title="How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.">Acts 10:38</a>), and on this supposition the particular phenomena of each case were logically ascribed to demoniac forces.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus rebuked the devil</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span>, <span class="accented">him</span>). Some take the pronoun as masculine, and refer it to the diseased boy; but it is more natural that the rebuke should be addressed to the possessing demon. This is the first place where St. Matthew mentions the spiritual aspect of the malady. As the child was being brought to Jesus, a terrible scene ensued, which is described with its horrific details by St. Mark, who also gives Christ's conversation with the father, whereby he desired to arouse faith in his heart, and to draw that assurance from him which could not be obtained from the irresponsible sufferer. <span class="cmt_word">He departed out of him.</span> In contrast to the faltering exorcism of the apostles, which the devil had disregarded, Jesus orders with the calmness of assured authority, and is at once obeyed. After a final act of defeated malice, the demon quitted his hold of the child. <span class="cmt_word">Was cured from that very hour</span>. Never more to fall under the devil's influence, restored wholly in body and mind. There is something very mysterious in the sufferings of this poor boy, as there is in those of infants. It is plain that the description, "epileptic mania," will not connote all the features of this case. The evangelists' narrative and Christ's words and actions conclusively prove that it had a demoniacal element, and that this was miraculously eliminated. For epilepsy, I believe, no cure is known. The suddenness and the permanence (<a href="/mark/9-25.htm">Mark 9:25</a>) of the relief further demonstrate the reality of the miracle. We learn also from this incident that all possessed persons were not morally evil, that often the possession appertained to the physical and psychical nature, and had no ethical relation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/17-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">rebuked</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#949;&#964;&#943;&#956;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(epetim&#275;sen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2008.htm">Strong's 2008: </a> </span><span class="str2">From epi and timao; to tax upon, i.e. Censure or admonish; by implication, forbid.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the demon],</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Dative Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
