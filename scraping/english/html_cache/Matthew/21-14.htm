It was a place where sacrifices were offered, and people gathered for prayer and teaching. The presence of the blind and the lame at the temple is significant because, according to Levitical law, those with physical defects were often excluded from certain religious activities (<a href="/leviticus/21-17.htm">Leviticus 21:17-23</a>). However, Jesus' ministry consistently demonstrated a breaking down of barriers and an inclusion of those marginalized by society. This act of the blind and the lame coming to Jesus at the temple signifies a fulfillment of messianic prophecies, such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which foretold that the Messiah would bring healing and restoration.<p><b>and He healed them</b><br>Jesus' healing of the blind and the lame at the temple is a powerful demonstration of His divine authority and compassion. It underscores His role as the promised Messiah who brings physical and spiritual restoration. This act of healing not only fulfills Old Testament prophecies but also serves as a type of the ultimate healing and redemption that Jesus offers through His death and resurrection. The healing miracles of Jesus are a foretaste of the complete restoration that will occur in the new creation, as described in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>, where there will be no more pain or suffering.

Scripture repeatedly highlights that faith, not status, gains access to Jesus.<p>&#8226; <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a> foretold a day when &#8220;the eyes of the blind will be opened and the lame will leap like a deer.&#8221; Their coming signals that Messianic hope is unfolding in real time.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>at the temple</b><p>&#8226; Jesus has just declared, &#8220;My house will be called a house of prayer&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/21-13.htm">Matthew 21:13</a>, citing <a href="/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>). Cleansing the courts removes barriers; healing the broken brings worshipers in.<p>&#8226; Choosing the temple underscores His authority. <a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a> anticipated the Lord Himself entering His sanctuary to purify it. <a href="/john/2-14.htm">John 2:14-17</a> shows a similar zeal earlier in His ministry.<p>&#8226; The scene reverses centuries of exclusion. Where the law once highlighted impurity, Christ now displays grace. <a href="/psalms/24-7.htm">Psalm 24:7</a> invites gates to open for the King of Glory; here those gates open for the hurting because the King is present.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and He healed them</b><p>&#8226; The verb is simple but sweeping: Jesus restores what sin and a fallen world have damaged. Matthew&#8217;s Gospel has emphasized this power since 4:23-24 and 8:16-17, where healing validates His identity and compassion.<p>&#8226; His works fulfill His own answer to John&#8217;s disciples: &#8220;The blind receive sight and the lame walk&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-4.htm">Matthew 11:4-5</a>; cf. <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1-2</a>).<p>&#8226; Physical wholeness also points to spiritual renewal. <a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6-8</a> shows the risen Christ continuing the same ministry through His apostles, launching praise within the temple courts.<p>&#8226; For believers today, these healings assure us that Jesus is both willing and able to address our deepest needs&#8212;body, soul, and spirit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/21-14.htm">Matthew 21:14</a> presents a vivid, literal snapshot of the Messiah&#8217;s mission: excluded people approach Jesus; the sacred space welcomes them; and He decisively heals them. The verse demonstrates His compassion, His fulfillment of prophetic promise, and His authority within God&#8217;s house&#8212;encouraging us to come boldly, expectantly, and worshipfully to Him who still restores.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(14) <span class= "bld">The blind and the lame.</span>--These, as we see from <a href="/acts/3-2.htm" title="And a certain man lame from his mother's womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;">Acts 3:2</a>, and probably from <a href="/john/9-1.htm" title="And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.">John 9:1</a>, thronged the approaches to the Temple, and asked alms of the worshippers. They now followed the great Healer into the Temple itself, and sought at His hands relief from their infirmities. If we were to accept the LXX. reading of the strange proverbial saying of <a href="/2_samuel/5-8.htm" title="And David said on that day, Whoever gets up to the gutter, and smites the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain. Why they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.">2Samuel 5:8</a>, "The blind and the lame shall not come into the house <span class= "ital">of the Lord,"</span> it would seem as if this were a departure from the usual regulations of the Temple; but the words in italics are not in the Hebrew. Most commentators give an entirely different meaning to the proverb, and there is no evidence from Jewish writers that the blind and the lame were ever, as a matter of fact, excluded from the Temple. All that we can legitimately infer from the two passages is the contrast between the hasty, passionate words of the conquering king, and the tender compassion of the Son of David, to whom the blind and the lame were objects, not of antipathy, but pity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The blind and the lame came to him in the temple</span>. This notice is peculiar to St. Matthew, though St. Luke (<a href="/luke/19-47.htm">Luke 19:47</a>) mentions that "he taught daily in the temple." An old expositor has remarked that Christ first as King purified his palace, and then took his seat therein, and of his royal bounty distributed gilts to his people. It was a new fulfilment of the prophecy of Isaiah (<a href="/isaiah/35-4.htm">Isaiah 35:4-6</a>), which spake of Messiah coming to open the eyes of the blind, to unstop the ears of the deaf, to make the lame man leap as an hart. For acts of sacrilege which profaned the temple precincts, he substituted acts of mercy which hallowed them; the good Physician takes the place of the greedy trafficker; the den of thieves becomes a beneficent hospital. How many were the acts of healing, we are not told; but the words point to the relief of numberless sufferers, none of whom were sent empty away. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[The] blind</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#965;&#966;&#955;&#959;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(typhloi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5185.htm">Strong's 5185: </a> </span><span class="str2">Blind, physically or mentally.
