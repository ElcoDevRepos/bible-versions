In the cultural context of the time, such a response would be seen as disrespectful, as honoring one's parents was a significant aspect of Jewish law (<a href="/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). This initial refusal can be compared to the Israelites' frequent disobedience to God's commands throughout the Old Testament, such as in the wilderness (<a href="/numbers/14-2.htm">Numbers 14:2-4</a>). It also highlights the human tendency to resist divine authority, a theme seen in the parable of the two sons, where actions speak louder than words.<p><b>But later he changed his mind and went.</b><br>This change of heart signifies repentance, a central theme in the teachings of Jesus. The Greek term used here for "changed his mind" is often associated with repentance, indicating a transformation of heart and will. This mirrors the call to repentance found throughout the New Testament, such as in the ministry of John the Baptist (<a href="/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>) and Jesus' own message (<a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>). The son's eventual obedience aligns with the biblical principle that true repentance leads to action, as seen in the parable of the prodigal son (<a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17-20</a>). This transformation also prefigures the acceptance of the gospel by those initially resistant, such as the Gentiles, who later embraced the faith (<a href="/acts/11-18.htm">Acts 11:18</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Represents God, who gives instructions to His children.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_first_son.htm">The First Son</a></b><br>Initially refuses to obey his father but later repents and fulfills the father's request.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vineyard.htm">The Vineyard</a></b><br>Symbolic of God's kingdom and the work He calls His people to do.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The speaker of the parable, teaching about obedience and repentance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_audience.htm">The Audience</a></b><br>Primarily the chief priests and elders of the people, who are being challenged by Jesus to reflect on their own obedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_repentance.htm">The Importance of Repentance</a></b><br>True repentance involves a change of heart and action.
