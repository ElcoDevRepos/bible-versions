In biblical times, an axe was a common tool for cutting down trees, symbolizing the readiness to remove what is unproductive. The imagery of the axe at the root suggests that the judgment is not only near but also thorough, as cutting at the root ensures the tree cannot grow back. This reflects the urgency of John the Baptist's message of repentance. The metaphor of trees often represents people or nations in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/10-33.htm">Isaiah 10:33-34</a> and <a href="/jeremiah/1-10.htm">Jeremiah 1:10</a>, where God&#8217;s judgment is depicted as cutting down trees.<p><b>and every tree that does not produce good fruit</b><br>In the Bible, fruitfulness is a common metaphor for spiritual and moral productivity. Good fruit represents righteous deeds and a life aligned with God's will, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>, which lists the fruits of the Spirit. The expectation of producing good fruit is consistent with the teachings of Jesus, who often used agricultural metaphors to describe spiritual truths, such as in <a href="/john/15.htm">John 15:1-8</a>, where He speaks of Himself as the true vine and His followers as branches expected to bear fruit.<p><b>will be cut down</b><br>This phrase indicates the consequence of failing to produce good fruit. The act of cutting down a tree is a decisive action, symbolizing the removal of what is deemed worthless or harmful. In the context of John the Baptist's ministry, this serves as a warning to the religious leaders and the people of Israel to repent and live righteously. The cutting down of unfruitful trees is echoed in Jesus' parable of the barren fig tree in <a href="/luke/13-6.htm">Luke 13:6-9</a>, emphasizing the patience and eventual judgment of God.<p><b>and thrown into the fire</b><br>Fire is a common biblical symbol for judgment and purification. In this context, it represents the final and irreversible judgment on those who do not repent and bear good fruit. The imagery of fire is used throughout Scripture to describe divine judgment, as seen in <a href="/malachi/4.htm">Malachi 4:1</a>, where the day of the Lord is described as burning like a furnace. This phrase underscores the seriousness of the call to repentance and the reality of divine judgment, aligning with the broader biblical narrative of God&#8217;s justice and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/john_the_baptist.htm">John the Baptist</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, John the Baptist, is a prophet who prepares the way for Jesus Christ by calling people to repentance and baptizing them in the Jordan River.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_sadducees.htm">Pharisees and Sadducees</a></b><br>Religious leaders of the time who come to John&#8217;s baptism, often criticized for their hypocrisy and lack of true repentance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_jordan_river.htm">The Jordan River</a></b><br>The location where John the Baptist conducts his ministry of baptism, symbolizing cleansing and repentance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_trees.htm">The Trees</a></b><br>Symbolic representation of individuals or groups, particularly those who claim to be part of God's people but do not produce the fruits of repentance.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_ax_and_fire.htm">The Ax and Fire</a></b><br>Symbols of impending judgment and the consequences of failing to produce good fruit, representing God's righteous judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_urgency_of_repentance.htm">The Urgency of Repentance</a></b><br>John&#8217;s message emphasizes the immediacy of repentance.

The same sense of urgency surfaces in <a href="/hebrews/9-27.htm">Hebrews 9:27</a>, &#8220;people are appointed to die once, and after that to face judgment,&#8221; and again in <a href="/isaiah/55-6.htm">Isaiah 55:6</a>, where the Lord urges, &#8220;Seek the LORD while He may be found.&#8221; There is no delay in God&#8217;s timetable; His instruments of justice are prepared, waiting only for His command.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>At the root of the trees</b><p>The axe is not poised at a branch but at the root, emphasizing that God&#8217;s assessment reaches the very core. First Samuel 16:7 reminds us, &#8220;man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.&#8221; Likewise, <a href="/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a> declares, &#8220;I, the LORD, search the heart and examine the mind.&#8221; God is concerned with more than surface behavior; He sees the source&#8212;our motives, desires, and loyalties&#8212;and deals decisively with them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Every tree that does not produce good fruit</b><p>Fruitless trees represent lives empty of genuine repentance and godly character. Jesus echoes this in <a href="/john/15-2.htm">John 15:2</a>, &#8220;He cuts off every branch in Me that bears no fruit,&#8221; and Paul outlines the expected produce in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22-23</a>, listing &#8220;love, joy, peace&#8230;&#8221; as evidence of the Spirit&#8217;s work. <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a> adds, &#8220;faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead,&#8221; tying authentic belief to visible fruit. A life joined to Christ inevitably yields righteousness; absence of such fruit exposes a heart still unconverted.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Will be cut down and thrown into the fire</b><p>Cutting down is swift removal; the fire signifies irreversible judgment. Jesus uses identical language in <a href="/matthew/13-40.htm">Matthew 13:40-42</a>, where weeds &#8220;are gathered and burned in the fire,&#8221; depicting the fate of the wicked. <a href="/revelation/20-15.htm">Revelation 20:15</a> speaks soberly: &#8220;Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.&#8221; These passages confirm that the warning in <a href="/matthew/3-10.htm">Matthew 3:10</a> is literal, not figurative. God&#8217;s justice culminates either in eternal life or eternal punishment; there is no third option.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/3-10.htm">Matthew 3:10</a> pictures imminent, penetrating judgment: the axe is ready now; it strikes not at superficial habits but at the heart; every life lacking the visible fruit of repentance faces decisive removal and fiery judgment. The verse calls each listener to authentic faith that bears Spirit-produced fruit, because God&#8217;s righteous verdict is certain and final.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(10) <span class= "bld">Now.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">already.</span> The present of an act no longer future.<p><span class= "bld">The ax is laid unto the root of the trees.</span>--The symbolism which saw in "trees" the representatives of human characters, of nations, and institutions, had been recognised in Isaiah's parable of the vine (<a href="/context/isaiah/5-1.htm" title="Now will I sing to my well beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard.
