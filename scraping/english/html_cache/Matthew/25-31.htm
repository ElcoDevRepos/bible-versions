The title "Son of Man" is a messianic term that Jesus frequently used for Himself, drawing from <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where the "Son of Man" is given dominion and glory. The "glory" signifies divine majesty and power, contrasting with His first coming in humility. This event is anticipated as a time of judgment and fulfillment of prophecy, aligning with passages like <a href="/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a> and <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>.<p><b>and all the angels with Him</b><br>The presence of angels underscores the divine authority and majesty of the event. Angels are often depicted as God's messengers and agents of His will, as seen in passages like <a href="/matthew/13-41.htm">Matthew 13:41</a> and <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>. Their accompaniment signifies the heavenly host's participation in the final judgment, emphasizing the cosmic significance of Christ's return.<p><b>He will sit on His glorious throne</b><br>The imagery of a throne represents authority, judgment, and kingship. In biblical context, a throne is a symbol of sovereign rule, as seen in <a href="/psalms/9-7.htm">Psalm 9:7</a> and <a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11</a>. This phrase indicates that Jesus will assume His rightful place as King and Judge over all nations, fulfilling prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/9-7.htm">Isaiah 9:7</a> and affirming His role as the ultimate ruler in the Kingdom of God. The "glorious throne" highlights the splendor and righteousness of His reign, contrasting earthly thrones with divine justice and authority.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/son_of_man.htm">Son of Man</a></b><br>A title Jesus frequently used for Himself, emphasizing His role as the Messiah and His authority in judgment.

The form of the announcement is in part based, as indeed are all the thoughts connected with the final Advent, upon the vision of <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>. The "throne of His glory" is that which He shares with "the Ancient of Days," the throne of Jehovah, surrounded with the brightness of the Shechinah.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 31-46.</span> - <span class="accented">The final judgment on all the nations.</span> (Peculiar to St. Matthew.) Before entering upon the exposition of this majestic section, which is a prophecy, not a parable, we have to settle the preliminary question as to who are the subjects of the judgment here so graphically and fearfully delineated. Are they only the heathen, or Christians, or all mankind without exception? The Lord's present utterance is plainly the development of the account of the parousia in <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30, 3</a>l. There those that are gathered are "the elect," nothing being said concerning the rest of mankind; here we have the forecast completed, both righteous and unrighteous receiving their sentence. "All the nations" usually represent all Gentiles distinguished from the Jews. But there is nothing to indicate separate judgment for the Jew and Gentile. Equally unlikely is the notion that the transaction is confined to the heathen, whether the opinion is grounded on a supposed extension of the mercies of Christ to those ignorant of him, but having lived according to the laws of natural religion; or whether it assumes as certain that believers will not be judged at all (an erroneous deduction from <a href="/john/5-24.htm">John 5:24</a>). It seems, on the one hand, incongruous that persons who have never heard of Christ should be addressed as "blessed of my Father," etc., ver. 34: and it seems, on the other hand, monstrous that such, having failed through ignorance and lack of teaching, should be condemned to awful punishment. That Christians alone are the persons who are thus assembled for judgment is not likely. Is there, then, to be no inquisition held on the life and Character of non-Christians? Are they wholly to escape the great assize? If not, where else does Christ refer to their case? What reason can be given for the exclusion of this great majority from the account of the proceedings at the last day? It appears, on the whole, to be safest to consider "all the nations" as meaning the whole race of men, who, dead and living, small and great, Jew and Gentile, shall stand before God to be judged according to their works (<a href="/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11-13</a>). This is not a parable, but a statement of future proceedings by him who himself shall conduct them. It is not a full account of details, but an indication of the kind of criteria which shall govern the verdicts given. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 31.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;</span>, <span class="accented">but when</span>). The particle, unnoticed in the Authorized Version, indicates the distinction between this section and the preceding parables, the latter exemplifying the judgment specially on Christians, this setting forth the judgment on the whole world. <span class="cmt_word">Son of man.</span> With his glorified body, such as he was seen at his Transfiguration (<a href="/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In his glory.</span> The term occurs twice in this verse, as elsewhere (<a href="/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>; <a href="/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a>, where see notes) denoting that then his humiliation will have passed away, and he will appear as he is. <span class="cmt_word">All the holy angels with him.</span> "Holy" is probably a transcriber's addition, which has crept into the later text.
