Parables are simple stories used to illustrate a moral or spiritual lesson. This method was common in Jewish teaching and allowed Jesus to convey deep truths in a relatable way. The use of parables also fulfilled the prophecy in <a href="/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a>, which speaks of teaching in parables.<p><b>The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field:</b><br>The "kingdom of heaven" is a central theme in Jesus' teachings, referring to God's sovereign rule and the spiritual realm where His will is fulfilled. The imagery of sowing seed is agricultural, reflecting the agrarian society of first-century Palestine. Sowing good seed represents the spreading of the Gospel and the establishment of God's kingdom on earth. The "man" in the parable can be seen as a type of Christ, who sows the Word of God. The "field" symbolizes the world, as explained later in the parable (<a href="/matthew/13-38.htm">Matthew 13:38</a>). This imagery connects to other scriptural references, such as <a href="/isaiah/55-10.htm">Isaiah 55:10-11</a>, where God's word is likened to rain and snow that water the earth, causing it to bring forth and bud.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, who is teaching through parables to convey spiritual truths about the Kingdom of Heaven.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man</a></b><br>Represents Jesus or God, who sows good seed, symbolizing the spreading of the Gospel and the establishment of the Kingdom of Heaven.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_field.htm">The Field</a></b><br>Symbolizes the world where the seeds (the Word of God) are sown.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/good_seed.htm">Good Seed</a></b><br>Represents the children of the Kingdom, those who receive and live by the Word of God.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/parable.htm">Parable</a></b><br>A teaching method used by Jesus to convey deep spiritual truths through simple, relatable accounts.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_kingdom_of_heaven.htm">Understanding the Kingdom of Heaven</a></b><br>The Kingdom of Heaven is not just a future reality but is actively being established in the world through the spreading of the Gospel.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_believers.htm">Role of Believers</a></b><br>As the good seed, believers are called to grow and bear fruit in the world, living out the values of the Kingdom.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_and_patience.htm">Discernment and Patience</a></b><br>Just as the sower waits for the harvest, believers must exercise patience and discernment, trusting God's timing and judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_warfare.htm">Spiritual Warfare</a></b><br>Recognize that there is an enemy who seeks to disrupt the work of the Kingdom, and be vigilant in prayer and spiritual discipline.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_sowing.htm">Faithfulness in Sowing</a></b><br>Be diligent in spreading the Word of God, knowing that the ultimate growth and harvest are in God's hands.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_13_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 13:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_spot_good_vs_bad_in_daily_life.htm">How can we discern "good seed" from "weeds" in our daily lives?

The verse sets the stage for the coming contrast with the enemy&#8217;s work, assuring us from the outset that the King&#8217;s seed, planted by His own hand, is inherently good and destined to bear fruit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">Another parable.</span>--The explanation of the parable of the Sower had been given apparently in the boat in which our Lord sat with His disciples. Then, again addressing Himself to the multitude on the shore, He spake the parables of the Tares, the Mustard Seed, and the Leaven; then, dismissing the multitude (<a href="/matthew/13-36.htm" title="Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came to him, saying, Declare to us the parable of the tares of the field.">Matthew 13:36</a>), He landed with His disciples, and went into the house which was for a time their home.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 24-30</span> - <span class="accented">The parable of the tares.</span> Matthew only. The parable of the sower dealt with the first reception of the gospel; this deals with the after-development. The aim of this parable is to prevent over-sanguine expectations as to the purity of the society of believers, and to hinder rash attempts to purify it by merely external processes. Archbishop Benson ('Dict. of Christian Biogr.,' 1:745) calls attention to the fact that the first extant exposition of this parable is in Cyprian's successful appeal to the Novatianists not to separate from the Church (Ep. 54.). The aim of the somewhat similar parable in <a href="/mark/4-26.htm">Mark 4:26-29</a> is to show the slowness and gradualness of the growth of the kingdom of heaven, and also the certainty of its consummation. So many words and phrases in the two parables are identical, that the possibility of one being derived from the other, either by omission or addition, must be acknowledged, but the definiteness of the aim in each points rather to their being originally two distinct parables. The divisions of the parable are - <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The fact of tares being present as well as good seed, and its cause (vers. 24-28<span class="accented">a</span>). <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Although there is the natural desire to gather out the tares at once, yet, on account of the impossibility of doing so without destroying some of the good seed, this must not be attempted. At the proper time full separation shall be made by the proper agents (vers. 28<span class="accented">b</span>-30). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Another parable put he forth unto them;</span> <span class="accented">set he before them</span> (Revised Version, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>); so also ver. 31.
