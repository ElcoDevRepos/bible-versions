This imprisonment took place in the fortress of Machaerus, located east of the Dead Sea. John's situation reflects the cost of prophetic ministry and the opposition faced by those who speak truth to power. His imprisonment also fulfills the prophetic role of suffering for righteousness' sake, as seen in the lives of other prophets like Jeremiah.<p><b>about the works of Christ</b><br>John had previously baptized Jesus and witnessed the Holy Spirit descending upon Him, affirming Jesus as the Messiah (<a href="/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16-17</a>). The "works of Christ" refer to Jesus' miracles, teachings, and acts of compassion, which were signs of the Kingdom of God. These works fulfilled Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah, such as healing the blind and setting captives free (<a href="/isaiah/61.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>). John's hearing of these works while in prison suggests a continued interest and hope in the messianic mission, despite his own circumstances.<p><b>and he sent his disciples</b><br>John's disciples remained loyal to him during his imprisonment, indicating the strong influence he had as a teacher and prophet. By sending them to Jesus, John sought confirmation of Jesus' identity as the Messiah. This action demonstrates John's humility and desire for his followers to transition to Jesus, as he had previously stated, "He must increase, but I must decrease" (<a href="/john/3-30.htm">John 3:30</a>).

John, hearing trustworthy reports of Messiah&#8217;s works, sends disciples to seek clarity and deeper faith. The verse reminds us that confinement cannot mute God&#8217;s Word, that genuine believers may wrestle with unmet expectations, and that the surest remedy is a fresh look at Christ Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">When John had heard in the prison.</span>--The position of the Baptist was so far that of a prisoner treated with respect.

He himself, in the prison of Machaerus, was languishing with the sickness of hope deferred for the Messianic kingdom, which he had proclaimed. His disciples brought back word of what they had seen and heard (<a href="/luke/7-18.htm" title="And the disciples of John showed him of all these things.">Luke 7:18</a>), and yet all things continued as before, and there was no deliverance either for himself or Israel.
