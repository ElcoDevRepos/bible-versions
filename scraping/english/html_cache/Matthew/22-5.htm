In the context of the parable, this represents the Jewish leaders and people who ignored the message of Jesus and the call to the Kingdom of God. This indifference can be seen as a reflection of the spiritual apathy prevalent among the religious elite of the time, who were more concerned with their own traditions and power than with the message of repentance and salvation. This attitude is reminiscent of the Israelites' repeated disobedience and neglect of God's prophets throughout the Old Testament, as seen in passages like <a href="/jeremiah/7-24.htm">Jeremiah 7:24-26</a>.<p><b>and went away</b><br>The act of going away signifies a deliberate choice to reject the invitation. This mirrors the broader theme of free will in the Bible, where individuals are given the choice to accept or reject God's call. The decision to turn away from the invitation can be seen as a metaphor for turning away from God and His purposes. This is a recurring theme in Scripture, where people often choose their own path over God's, as seen in the story of Jonah or the Israelites in the wilderness.<p><b>one to his field</b><br>The mention of the field indicates a preoccupation with personal and material concerns over spiritual matters. In an agrarian society like that of ancient Israel, fields were a primary source of livelihood, symbolizing the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of wealth that can choke the word, as described in the Parable of the Sower (<a href="/matthew/13-22.htm">Matthew 13:22</a>). This reflects the human tendency to prioritize earthly responsibilities and possessions over spiritual commitments and the Kingdom of God.<p><b>another to his business</b><br>This phrase underscores the distractions of commerce and daily life that can lead individuals away from spiritual truths. In the historical context, business and trade were integral to the economy and social structure, often demanding significant time and attention. The reference to business here serves as a warning against allowing the pursuit of wealth and success to overshadow one's relationship with God. This is echoed in Jesus' teaching that one cannot serve both God and money (<a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>), emphasizing the need for prioritizing spiritual over material pursuits.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_king.htm">The King</a></b><br>Represents God the Father, who is preparing a wedding banquet for His Son, symbolizing the Kingdom of Heaven.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_invited_guests.htm">The Invited Guests</a></b><br>Initially, these are the Jewish people who were first invited to partake in the blessings of God's kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servants.htm">The Servants</a></b><br>Symbolize the prophets and messengers sent by God to call His people to repentance and to accept His invitation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wedding_banquet.htm">The Wedding Banquet</a></b><br>Represents the joyous and eternal fellowship with God in His kingdom.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son.htm">The Son</a></b><br>Represents Jesus Christ, for whom the wedding banquet is prepared.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/i/indifference_to_god's_call.htm">Indifference to God's Call</a></b><br>The phrase "But they paid no attention" (<a href="/matthew/22-5.htm">Matthew 22:5</a>) highlights the danger of indifference to God's invitation.

We must be vigilant not to ignore God's call in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/prioritizing_worldly_concerns.htm">Prioritizing Worldly Concerns</a></b><br>The guests' excuses reflect a prioritization of worldly matters over spiritual ones.
