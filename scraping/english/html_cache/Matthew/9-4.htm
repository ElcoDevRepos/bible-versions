Throughout the Gospels, Jesus demonstrates His ability to perceive the thoughts and intentions of others, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>, where He knows what is in man. This ability fulfills Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah, such as <a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2-3</a>, which speaks of the Spirit of the Lord resting upon Him, granting wisdom and understanding. Jesus' knowledge of their thoughts also underscores His authority and the truth of His teachings, as He can discern the hidden motives of the heart.<p><b>and said, &#8220;Why do you harbor evil in your hearts?</b><br>In this part of the verse, Jesus directly addresses the scribes and Pharisees, who were often critical of His ministry. The term "harbor evil" suggests a deliberate and persistent holding onto sinful thoughts, reflecting the hardened hearts of the religious leaders. This confrontation is consistent with Jesus' frequent rebukes of the Pharisees for their hypocrisy and legalism, as seen in <a href="/matthew/23.htm">Matthew 23</a>. The heart, in biblical terms, is the center of one's being, encompassing mind, will, and emotions. <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a> describes the heart as deceitful and desperately wicked, emphasizing the need for divine intervention and transformation.

Their internal criticism is as real to Jesus as spoken words.<p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; awareness underscores that hidden unbelief is still accountable before God (<a href="/luke/5-22.htm">Luke 5:22</a>).<p>&#8226; From the beginning, God has warned that He &#8220;looks at the heart&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>). Our inner life cannot be compartmentalized from our outward behavior.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and said</b><p>&#8226; Rather than letting the scribes stew in private doubt, the Lord addresses them directly.

Allowing such thoughts to settle leads to further hardness (<a href="/hebrews/3-12.htm">Hebrews 3:12-13</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently locates sin&#8217;s origin within: &#8220;Out of the heart come evil thoughts&#8221; (<a href="/mark/7-21.htm">Mark 7:21-23</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/17-9.htm">Jeremiah 17:9</a>).
