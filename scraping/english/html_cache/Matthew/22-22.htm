The context is a trap set by these groups to ensnare Jesus in His words. The question posed to Jesus was whether it was lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, a politically charged issue. Jesus' response, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's," demonstrates His wisdom and ability to navigate complex social and political issues. This reflects the wisdom of God, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>, where wisdom and understanding come from the Lord.<p><b>they were amazed</b><br>The amazement of the Pharisees and Herodians highlights the unexpected nature of Jesus' answer. His response transcended the political and religious traps set for Him, showcasing His divine insight. This amazement is a recurring reaction to Jesus' teachings and miracles throughout the Gospels, as seen in <a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28-29</a>, where the crowds were astonished at His teaching because He taught with authority. The amazement also underscores the authority and wisdom of Jesus, which often left His opponents without a rebuttal.<p><b>So they left Him</b><br>The decision to leave Jesus indicates the failure of their attempt to trap Him. This action reflects the broader pattern of opposition Jesus faced from religious leaders, who were often confounded by His wisdom and authority. The departure of the Pharisees and Herodians can be seen as a temporary retreat in their ongoing conflict with Jesus, which ultimately culminates in His crucifixion. This moment foreshadows the eventual rejection of Jesus by the religious establishment, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as despised and rejected by men.<p><b>and went away</b><br>Their departure signifies a momentary withdrawal from confrontation, but not a change of heart. The religious leaders' continued opposition to Jesus is evident throughout the Gospels, leading to their role in His arrest and crucifixion. This phrase also highlights the transient nature of their schemes against Jesus, as His mission and message continued despite their efforts. The act of going away can be seen as a fulfillment of <a href="/psalms/2.htm">Psalm 2:1-4</a>, where the nations conspire against the Lord and His Anointed, yet God remains sovereign and unthreatened by human plots.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to a question about paying taxes to Caesar, demonstrating His wisdom and authority.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_herodians.htm">Pharisees and Herodians</a></b><br>These groups, often at odds with each other, unite in an attempt to trap Jesus with a question about paying taxes to the Roman government.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/c/caesar.htm">Caesar</a></b><br>The Roman emperor, representing the secular authority and the subject of the question posed to Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting of this encounter, a city central to Jewish religious life and under Roman occupation at the time.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_coin.htm">The Coin</a></b><br>A denarius, which bore the image of Caesar, used by Jesus to illustrate His point about rendering to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/w/wisdom_in_speech.htm">Wisdom in Speech</a></b><br>Jesus demonstrates the importance of responding with wisdom and discernment, especially when faced with challenging questions or potential traps.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dual_citizenship.htm">Dual Citizenship</a></b><br>As Christians, we are called to navigate our responsibilities to earthly authorities while maintaining our ultimate allegiance to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/i/image_and_ownership.htm">Image and Ownership</a></b><br>Just as the coin bears Caesar's image and belongs to him, we bear God's image and belong to Him, emphasizing our duty to live for His glory.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_hypocrisy.htm">Avoiding Hypocrisy</a></b><br>The Pharisees and Herodians' attempt to trap Jesus highlights the danger of hypocrisy and the importance of sincerity in our faith.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/amazement_at_christ's_authority.htm">Amazement at Christ's Authority</a></b><br>The reaction of amazement from Jesus' opponents serves as a reminder of His divine wisdom and authority, which should inspire reverence and obedience in us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_22_22_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 22:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/When_should_we_give_to_Caesar.htm">How can we discern when to "give to Caesar" in our daily lives?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_22_22_Earthly_vs_divine_duties.htm">What does Matthew 22:22 teach about balancing earthly and divine responsibilities?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Romans_13_1-7_to_Matthew_22_22.htm">How does Romans 13:1-7 relate to Jesus' teaching in Matthew 22:22?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_can_we_apply_give_to_God_today.htm">In what ways can we apply "give to God what is God's" today?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Verse_s_impact_on_authority_views.htm">How does this verse challenge our understanding of authority and submission?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_22_22_s_take_on_authority.htm">How does Matthew 22:22 challenge our understanding of authority and governance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shaped_Matthew_22_22.htm">What historical context influenced the message in Matthew 22:22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_22_22_and_church-state_divide.htm">How does Matthew 22:22 relate to the separation of church and state?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_22.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 22?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/how_often_did_jesus_pray_to_avoid_the_cross.htm">How many times did Jesus move away to pray in the gospels where he prayed to avoid the cross?

The Herodians could not charge the Teacher with forbidding to give tribute to Caesar. The Pharisees found the duty of giving to God what belonged to Him pressed as strongly as they had ever pressed it.

Their carefully laid plot, which had seemed so irresistible, was utterly frustrated. The view of the relations of Church and state set forth by Christ was novel and incomprehensible. Hitherto the two provinces had been considered identical. The emperor, as we see impressed on his coins, was Pontifex Maximus; the Jewish priesthood had a political character, and the civil power was its instrument. In Christ's theory the spheres were distinct and not to be confounded. The state compelled obedience to its enactments; the Church left the conscience free, and obedience was voluntary and enforced by no external powers. The new society stood aloof from all political interests, and was responsible alone to God, while it performed its duties. <span class="cmt_word">Left him.</span> They had no answer to give. There was nothing in Christ's words that they could lay hold of; nothing treasonable, nothing unpatriotic. Baffled, though not convinced, the questioners sullenly withdrew; but they or their comrades afterwards had the effrontery to accuse Jesus of forbidding to pay tribute to Caesar (<a href="/luke/23-2.htm">Luke 23:2</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/22-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">when they heard [this],</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(akousantes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_191.htm">Strong's 191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To hear, listen, comprehend by hearing; pass: is heard, reported.
