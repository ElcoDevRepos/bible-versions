This was intended to serve as a deterrent to others. The location above His head also signifies the authority and kingship of Jesus, as a crown would be placed above a king's head.<p><b>they posted the written charge against Him:</b><br>The written charge was a common practice in Roman executions, where the crime was inscribed on a placard and displayed. This was known as the "titulus." The charge against Jesus was written in three languages: Hebrew, Latin, and Greek (<a href="/john/19-20.htm">John 19:20</a>), ensuring that all who passed by could read it. This reflects the universal nature of Jesus' kingship and the widespread impact of His crucifixion.<p><b>THIS IS JESUS,</b><br>The use of Jesus' name here is significant. "Jesus" means "The Lord saves," which is fitting given the salvific nature of His death. The inscription identifies Him personally, emphasizing His humanity and the personal nature of His sacrifice.<p><b>THE KING OF THE JEWS.</b><br>This title is both a declaration and an accusation.

The title was meant to mock Jesus, as the Jewish leaders rejected His claim to kingship. However, it ironically affirms His true identity as the King of Kings (<a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a>).

Each Gospel gives it in a slightly different form--Mark (<a href="/mark/15-26.htm" title="And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.">Mark 15:26</a>), "The King of the Jews;" Luke (<a href="/luke/23-38.htm" title="And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.">Luke 23:38</a>), "This is the King of the Jews;" John (<a href="/john/19-19.htm" title="And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.">John 19:19</a>), "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews." The variations are, perhaps, in part, explicable on the assumption of corresponding differences in the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin forms of the inscription, which reproduced themselves in the reports upon which the Gospel narratives were based. But in part also they may reasonably be ascribed to the natural variations sure to arise even among eye-witnesses, and <span class= "ital">a fortiori</span> among those who were not eye witnesses, as to the circumstantial details of events which they record in common. On grounds of ordinary likelihood St. John's record, as that of the only disciple whom we know to have been present at the crucifixion (<a href="/john/19-25.htm" title="Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.">John 19:25</a>), may claim to be the most accurate.<p>There was, apparently, a kind of rough tenderness towards the Man whom he had condemned in the form which Pilate had ordered. He would at least recognise His claims to be in some sense a King. The priests obviously felt it to imply such a recognition, a declaration, as it were, to them and to the people that One who had a right to be their King, who was the only kind of King they were ever likely to have, had died the death of a malefactor, and therefore they clamoured for a change, which Pilate refused to make (<a href="/john/19-20.htm" title="This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was near to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.">John 19:20</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Set up over his head his accusation written.</span> This was the <span class="accented">titulus.

It was written in three languages, so that all of whatever nationality might read it - in Hebrew and in Latin and in Greek (for the order, see Westcott on <a href="/john/19-20.htm">John 19:20</a>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the national Aramaic, familiar to all Jews; the official Latin,understood by the soldiers and Romans; the current Greek, the dialect of Hellenistic Jews, and largely used by all classes. "These three languages gathered up the results of the religious, the social, the intellectual preparation for Christ, and in each witness was given to his office" (Westcott). The title is given by the four evangelists with some verbal variations, which are owing in part to the actual differences existing in the three versions of the inscription. They run thus: "'This is Jesus the King of the Jews" (Matthew); "The King of the Jews" (Mark); "This is the King of the Jews" (Luke); "Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews" (John). Of these titles, those given by Mark and Luke probably represent the Latin; that of Matthew, the Greek; while that of John was intended for the national population, who alone would understand the veiled sneer contained in the addition, "of Nazareth." The legend of the finding of the cross and its inscription is given by Butler, 'Lives of the Saints,' on 'The Invention of the Holy Cross.' A supposed fragment of the title is preserved at Rome, in the Church of the Holy Cross, and declared by a papal bull to be authentic. In this case infallibility has rather overstepped its limits. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Above</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#940;&#957;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(epan&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1883.htm">Strong's 1883: </a> </span><span class="str2">From epi and ano; up above, i.e. Over or on.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">His</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span> <span class="translit">(autou)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
