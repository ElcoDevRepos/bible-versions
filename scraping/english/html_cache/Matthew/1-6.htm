Jesse's lineage is crucial as it connects to the tribe of Judah, fulfilling Jacob's prophecy that the scepter would not depart from Judah (<a href="/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>). David, his youngest son, was anointed by the prophet Samuel to be king over Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/16.htm">1 Samuel 16:1-13</a>). David's kingship is central to the biblical narrative, as he is a type of Christ, foreshadowing the eternal kingship of Jesus, who is often referred to as the "Son of David" (<a href="/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>). David's reign established Jerusalem as the political and spiritual center of Israel, and his covenant with God promised that his throne would be established forever (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>), a promise fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<p><b>David was the father of Solomon by Uriah&#8217;s wife,</b><br>David's relationship with Bathsheba, originally Uriah's wife, is a pivotal story in the Bible, illustrating themes of sin, repentance, and redemption (2 Samuel 11-12). David's adultery with Bathsheba and the subsequent murder of her husband Uriah highlight the human frailty even in a man after God's own heart (<a href="/1_samuel/13-14.htm">1 Samuel 13:14</a>). Despite this, Solomon, their son, becomes a significant figure, known for his wisdom and for building the first Temple in Jerusalem (1 Kings 6). Solomon's birth and reign are a testament to God's grace and the complexity of His plans, as God chose Solomon to continue the Davidic line, leading ultimately to the birth of Jesus Christ. This lineage underscores the theme of God's sovereignty and redemption, working through flawed human history to bring about His divine purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesse.htm">Jesse</a></b><br>The father of David, Jesse was a Bethlehemite and is significant in the lineage of Jesus as the father of the great King David.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>Known as "David the king," he was the second king of Israel, a man after God's own heart, and a central figure in the lineage of Jesus.

As this is the last of such names in the genealogy, it may be well to deal with the question whether any special purpose can be traced in the selection, beyond that of noting points of interest. Nothing can carry us beyond probable conjectures; but, within those limits, it is at least suggestive that all the names are those of women who, either as of heathen origin (Bathsheba, like her husband, was probably a Hittite), or by personal guilt, were as those whom the strict judgment of the Pharisee excluded from his fellowship. St. Matthew may have meant men to draw the inference that, as these women were not excluded from the honour of being in the Messiah's line of ancestry, so others like them would not be shut out from fellowship with His kingdom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David the king</span>. The mention of David's royal position seems made here because at this point the line of the Messiah first becomes connected with the royal house. At the time when Saul was made king the people chose to have him in opposition to the Divine will; but giving them next as king a man after his own heart, God uses the offence of his people so that it shall become a channel of blessing, and from this king Christ himself shall be born. Of her that had been the wife of Urias. It is not easy to see why Bathsheba is spoken of thus indirectly, as her own name was certainly better known, and is more frequently mentioned in the Old Testament than Uriah's. The phrase seems to call attention most pointedly to David's sin. and that too in a sentence where his kingly dignity has just been markedly emphasized. The way in which God dealt with David and his sin is very parallel to that in which he dealt with the Israelites after their choice of Saul. David's first child, like the Israelites' first king, finds not God's blessing; but the second child is the pledge of peace with God (Solomon) - is Jedidiah, "the beloved of the Lord," as David the second king was the man after God's own heart. She that had been the wife of Uriah, after David's repentance becomes Solomon's mother. Up to this point the genealogies in St. Matthew and St. Luke have entirely accorded, but with the mention of Solomon we come upon a variation, which continues till the union of the two forms of the pedigree in Salathiel ( <span class="accented">Shealtiel</span>, Revised Ver-zion), the father of Zerubbabel. In St. Matthew the line which is followed is the succession of the kings of Judah from Solomon to Jehoiachin ( <span class="accented">Jechonias</span>) . St. Luke mentions, after David, his son Nathan (of whom we find a notice in <a href="/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>; <a href="/2_samuel/5-14.htm">2 Samuel 5:14</a>), and then passes on through a series of nineteen names, none of which is found in other parts of Scripture as belonging to the race of David. We have nothing, therefore, with which to compare them; but in number they correspond very nearly with the known descendants in the line of Solo,non, so that, although we cannot verify the names, the list bears upon its face the appearance of being derived from some duly kept record of the pedigree of Nathan, the son of David. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/1-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">and</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesse</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#949;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Iessai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2421.htm">Strong's 2421: </a> </span><span class="str2">(Hebrew), Jesse, son of Obed, and father of King David.
