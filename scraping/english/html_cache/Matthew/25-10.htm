In the cultural context of first-century Jewish weddings, the bridegroom's arrival was often unpredictable, requiring the bridal party to be ready at any moment. The foolish virgins' decision to leave and buy oil signifies a lack of foresight and spiritual readiness. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual preparedness, emphasizing the importance of being ready for Christ's return, as echoed in other scriptures like <a href="/matthew/24-44.htm">Matthew 24:44</a>.<p><b>the bridegroom arrived</b><br>The arrival of the bridegroom symbolizes the second coming of Christ. In Jewish tradition, the bridegroom's coming was a time of joy and celebration, but it also required vigilance. This imagery is consistent with other biblical passages that describe Christ as the bridegroom (e.g., <a href="/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>, <a href="/revelation/19-7.htm">Revelation 19:7</a>). The suddenness of his arrival serves as a warning to always be prepared for the end times.<p><b>Those who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet</b><br>This phrase underscores the reward for those who are spiritually prepared. The wedding banquet is a common biblical metaphor for the Kingdom of Heaven (e.g., <a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>). Those who are ready represent the faithful believers who have lived in anticipation of Christ's return. Their entry into the banquet signifies eternal fellowship with God, a theme prevalent throughout the New Testament.<p><b>and the door was shut</b><br>The closing of the door signifies finality and judgment. Once the door is shut, there is no further opportunity for the unprepared to enter, reflecting the irreversible nature of Christ's judgment at the end of times. This echoes the parable of the narrow door in <a href="/luke/13-25.htm">Luke 13:25</a>, where those who are not ready are left outside. It serves as a solemn reminder of the consequences of spiritual negligence and the urgency of repentance and faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bridegroom.htm">The Bridegroom</a></b><br>Represents Jesus Christ, who will return at an unexpected time.

The mistake lay in their not having gone before. It is too late, in other words, to have recourse to the ordinary means of grace for the formation of character, to ordinances, sacraments, rules of life, at the moment of the crisis in personal or national life, which answers to the coming of the bridegroom. The door is then shut, and is no longer opened even to those who knock.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">While they went to buy.</span> They followed the advice given them. Whether they were successful or not is left untold; the issue would have been the same in either case; their return would have been too late. The opportunity they had had was not properly used; when preparation was comparatively easy they had neglected to make it; they had been once converted, so to speak, and rested in that fact, and thought it sufficient for all time, omitting to seek for daily supplies of grace, and now they find themselves miserably deceived. There is a certain wilful forgetfulness and negligence which can never be remedied on this side the grave. <span class="cmt_word">They that were ready.</span> The five wise virgins who had made provision for the meeting, had renewed the grace of God in their hearts, and kept it alive by diligence and perseverance, according to the apostle's counsel (<a href="/2_peter/1-4.htm">2 Peter 1:4-8</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Went in with him to the marriage</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">the marriage feast</span>). They not only duly met the bridegroom on his way, but accompanied him into the joyful scene, the bridal feast, the type of all spiritual happiness (<a href="/revelation/19-9.htm">Revelation 19:9</a>). "This world," says 'Pirke Aboth,' "is like the vestibule, the world to come is like the dining chamber: prepare thyself in the vestibule, that thou mayest be able to enter into the dining chamber." Well says the Son of Sirach, "Let nothing hinder thee to pay thy vow in due time, and defer not until death to be justified" (Ecclus. 18:22). <span class="cmt_word">The door was shut</span> (<a href="/luke/13-25.htm">Luke 13:25</a>). It is customary in the East, at great entertainments, to close the doors when all the guests are assembled. So at our universities, during the dinner hour, the gates of the colleges are always shut. Scott, in 'Old Mortality' (ch. 8. note), remarks that this custom was rigorously observed in Scotland. When the door is shut in the parable, there is no more entrance for any one. Trench quotes St. Augustine's saying, "Non inimicus intrat, nec amicus exit." Christ is the door by which our prayers reach God; through him alone they prevail; when this is closed the access to the heavenly throne is barred. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/25-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[while] they</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Feminine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
