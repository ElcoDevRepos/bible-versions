The "this" refers to the voice of God the Father speaking from the cloud, declaring Jesus as His beloved Son. This divine revelation underscores Jesus' authority and divinity, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah. The disciples' hearing of God's voice directly is a rare and profound experience, echoing instances like God's communication with Moses on Mount Sinai.<p><b>they fell facedown</b><br>Falling facedown is a common biblical response to divine encounters, signifying reverence, submission, and worship. This posture is seen throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/genesis/17-3.htm">Genesis 17:3</a> when Abram falls facedown before God, and in <a href="/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a> when Ezekiel sees the glory of the Lord. It reflects the disciples' recognition of the holiness and majesty of God, as well as their own humility and unworthiness in His presence.<p><b>in terror</b><br>The disciples' terror is a natural human reaction to the overwhelming presence of God's glory and the supernatural event they are witnessing. This fear is not merely fright but a profound awe and reverence for the divine. Similar reactions are seen in <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>, where Isaiah is struck with fear upon seeing the Lord, and in <a href="/revelation/1-17.htm">Revelation 1:17</a>, where John falls as though dead at the sight of the glorified Christ.
