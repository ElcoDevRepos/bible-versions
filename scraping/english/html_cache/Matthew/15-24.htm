His response is significant as it highlights His mission and the focus of His earthly ministry. The context of this interaction is crucial, as it takes place in the region of Tyre and Sidon, areas known for their Gentile populations. Jesus' response is not dismissive but rather a statement of His primary mission.<p><b>I was sent</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the divine mission of Jesus. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus frequently refers to being sent by the Father, indicating His obedience and purpose. This mission is rooted in the prophecies of the Old Testament, where the Messiah is depicted as one who is sent to fulfill God's plan of salvation. The concept of being "sent" also connects to the broader theme of Jesus as the Apostle and High Priest of our confession (<a href="/hebrews/3.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a>).<p><b>only to the lost sheep</b><br>The term "lost sheep" is a metaphor for the people of Israel, who were often described as sheep without a shepherd (<a href="/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5-6</a>, <a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>). This imagery is used to convey the spiritual state of Israel, who had strayed from God's ways. Jesus' mission was to call them back to repentance and faith, fulfilling the role of the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>).<p><b>of the house of Israel</b><br>The "house of Israel" refers to the descendants of Jacob, the twelve tribes that formed the nation of Israel. Jesus' ministry was initially focused on the Jewish people, in fulfillment of God's covenant promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This focus is seen throughout the Gospels, where Jesus often prioritizes His teachings and miracles for the Jewish audience. However, this does not exclude the Gentiles from God's plan, as seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>) and the inclusion of Gentiles in the early church (Acts 10).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to a Canaanite woman who is seeking healing for her daughter.

His first response is silence, then the disciples urge Him to send her away, and finally &#8220;He answered.&#8221;<p>&#8226; By answering, He reveals both His heart and His mission. Compare this with <a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19</a>, where He says, &#8220;The Son can do nothing by Himself; He can do only what He sees the Father doing.&#8221; The reply that follows is perfectly in step with the Father&#8217;s timetable.<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/4-43.htm">Luke 4:43</a> shows the same pattern: &#8220;I must preach the gospel of the kingdom of God to the other towns as well, because that is why I was sent.&#8221; Jesus never reacts randomly; every word aligns with the Father&#8217;s redemptive plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I was sent only</b><p>&#8226; The language of being &#8220;sent&#8221; highlights divine commissioning. <a href="/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a> prophesied, &#8220;The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on Me, because the LORD has anointed Me to preach good news to the poor.&#8221; Jesus consciously lives out that prophecy.<p>&#8226; <a href="/matthew/10-5.htm">Matthew 10:5-6</a> records Him commissioning the Twelve: &#8220;Do not go among the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.

Jesus&#8217; earthly ministry begins with Israel to validate every covenant promise, gather the lost sheep, and confirm God&#8217;s faithfulness. Once that foundation is laid, the same grace overflows to the nations, as the rest of the chapter foreshadows when Jesus ultimately commends the Canaanite woman&#8217;s faith and grants her request.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(24) <span class= "bld">I am not sent</span> (better, <span class= "ital">I was not sent</span>)<span class= "bld"> but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</span>--This, then, was what had restrained Him. Those wandering sheep, without a shepherd, were the appointed objects of His care. Were He to go beyond that limit in a single case, it might be followed by a thousand, and then, becoming, as it were, before the time, the Apostle of the Gentiles, He would cease to draw to Himself the hearts of Israel as their Redeemer. We call to mind the case of the centurion's servant (<a href="/matthew/8-10.htm" title="When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to them that followed, Truly I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.">Matthew 8:10</a>), and wonder that that was not decisive as a precedent in the supplicant's favour. The two cases stood, however, on a very different footing. The centurion who had built a synagogue was practically, if not formally, a proselyte of the gate. As the elders of the synagogue pleaded for him as worthy, the work of healing wrought for him would not alienate them or their followers. The woman belonged, on the contrary, to the most scorned and hated of all heathen races, to the Canaan on which the primeval curse was held to rest (<a href="/genesis/9-25.htm" title="And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be to his brothers.">Genesis 9:25</a>), and had as yet done nothing to show that she was in any sense a convert to the faith of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am</span> (<span class="accented">was</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel</span>. Doubtless the woman had listened to the apostles' intercession, and thought her cause won; but the repulse is only repeated; this Gentile is beyond the sphere of his mission; he cannot help her without departing from the rule which he had set himself. Jesus says nothing here about the rejection of the Jews and the future ingathering of the Gentiles; he states merely that his personal mission while he was on earth was confined to the Hebrew nation. He was, as St. Paul calls him (<a href="/romans/15-8.htm">Romans 15:8</a>), "a Minister of the circumcision." Later, he would send others to evangelize those who were now aliens from the chosen commonwealth; at present he has come unto his own possessions. <span class="cmt_word">Lost sheep.</span> There is a tenderness in this expression natural from the mouth of the good Shepherd. He had used it when he sent forth the twelve on their apostolical journey (<a href="/matthew/10-6.htm">Matthew 10:6</a>); the metaphor is found in the Old Testament (see <a href="/jeremiah/50-6.htm">Jeremiah 50:6</a>, etc.) It is appropriate here, where he is emphasizing his attitude towards the chosen people, and teaching the Canaanitish woman the relative position of Jew and Gentile. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/15-24.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He answered,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(apokritheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;I was sent</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#949;&#963;&#964;&#940;&#955;&#951;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(apestal&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Passive - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_649.htm">Strong's 649: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and stello; set apart, i.e. to send out literally or figuratively.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">only</span><br /><span class="grk">&#949;&#7984;</span> <span class="translit">(ei)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1487.htm">Strong's 1487: </a> </span><span class="str2">If.
