The crowd witnessing this event would have been familiar with the Jewish belief that only God can forgive sins, making Jesus' actions both astonishing and controversial. The crowd's reaction is significant as it reflects the public acknowledgment of Jesus' miraculous works and divine authority.<p><b>they were filled with awe</b><br>The Greek word used here can also be translated as "fear" or "reverence." This reaction is common in the Gospels when people witness the miraculous works of Jesus, indicating a recognition of divine intervention. The awe experienced by the crowd is a testament to the power and authority of Jesus, which surpasses human understanding and evokes a deep sense of wonder and respect.<p><b>and glorified God</b><br>The glorification of God by the crowd suggests that they recognized the divine source of Jesus' authority and power. This response aligns with the Jewish tradition of giving glory to God for miraculous events. It also highlights the purpose of Jesus' miracles: to reveal God's glory and lead people to worship Him. This reaction is consistent with other biblical accounts where God's intervention leads to praise and worship.<p><b>who had given such authority to men</b><br>This phrase underscores the unique authority granted to Jesus, who, though fully human, exercises divine power. The crowd's acknowledgment of this authority reflects a partial understanding of Jesus' identity as the Messiah. In the broader biblical narrative, this authority is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies concerning the coming of a Savior with divine power. It also prefigures the authority that Jesus would later bestow upon His disciples, as seen in the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18-20</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus has just healed a paralytic, demonstrating His divine authority and power.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowds.htm">The Crowds</a></b><br>The people who witnessed the miracle performed by Jesus.

The miracle was visible, undeniable evidence that His claim was true. Much like in <a href="/mark/2-12.htm">Mark 2:12</a> and <a href="/luke/5-26.htm">Luke 5:26</a>, eyewitnesses could not dismiss what their own eyes confirmed. The event compelled an immediate reaction because it proved that God was actively working in their midst&#8212;right then, right there.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they were filled with awe</b><p>&#8226; The word describes reverent amazement, a holy trembling when people encounter God&#8217;s power (<a href="/luke/7-16.htm">Luke 7:16</a>; <a href="/mark/1-27.htm">Mark 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Awe keeps the heart from casual indifference; it reminds us that God&#8217;s works are anything but ordinary (<a href="/acts/3-10.htm">Acts 3:10</a>).<p>&#8226; This response is the natural outcome whenever the Lord displays His might, as seen again after the calming of the storm (<a href="/matthew/8-27.htm">Matthew 8:27</a>) and the resurrection of Jairus&#8217;s daughter (<a href="/mark/5-42.htm">Mark 5:42</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and glorified God</b><p>&#8226; Praise immediately followed awe, aligning with the pattern throughout Scripture: witness a divine act, give God the glory (<a href="/matthew/15-31.htm">Matthew 15:31</a>; <a href="/luke/18-43.htm">Luke 18:43</a>).<p>&#8226; Glorifying God means acknowledging His character&#8212;mercy, power, authority&#8212;and lifting His reputation before others (<a href="/acts/4-21.htm">Acts 4:21</a>).<p>&#8226; Their worship shows the event&#8217;s purpose: not only relief for one man, but public honor for the Father who sent the Son (<a href="/john/12-28.htm">John 12:28</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who had given such authority</b><p>&#8226; The crowd rightly recognized that Jesus&#8217; authority came from God (<a href="/john/5-19.htm">John 5:19-23</a>).<p>&#8226; His authority included both the visible (physical healing) and the invisible (forgiveness of sins), fulfilling the messianic prophecies of <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>.<p>&#8226; After His resurrection, Jesus affirmed, &#8220;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>), reinforcing the truth they glimpsed that day.<p>&#8226; <a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a> later echoes this: God attested to Jesus by &#8220;miracles, wonders, and signs.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to men</b><p>&#8226; The phrase underscores the incarnation: divine authority was operating through a true man standing before them (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7-8</a>).<p>&#8226; It also hints at the delegation Jesus would extend to His followers&#8212;first to the Twelve (<a href="/matthew/10-1.htm">Matthew 10:1</a>), then to the Seventy-Two (<a href="/luke/10-19.htm">Luke 10:19</a>), and ultimately to the Church empowered by the Spirit (<a href="/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>; <a href="/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Nevertheless, the source remains God; any authority exercised by believers is derived and subordinate (<a href="/john/20-21.htm">John 20:21-23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/9-8.htm">Matthew 9:8</a> records the crowd&#8217;s reaction to a tangible miracle that authenticated Jesus&#8217; divine authority.
