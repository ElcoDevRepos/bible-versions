This awareness is consistent with His ability to know the hearts and minds of people, as seen in other passages like <a href="/john/2-24.htm">John 2:24-25</a>. It underscores His role as the all-knowing Son of God.<p><b>Jesus said</b><br>The authority of Jesus is evident as He addresses His disciples. His words carry weight and are meant to instruct and correct. This moment is a teaching opportunity, reflecting His role as Rabbi and Teacher, guiding His followers in understanding spiritual truths.<p><b>You of little faith</b><br>This phrase is a gentle rebuke, highlighting the disciples' struggle to fully trust in Jesus despite witnessing His miracles. It echoes similar rebukes in <a href="/matthew/8-26.htm">Matthew 8:26</a> and <a href="/matthew/14-31.htm">Matthew 14:31</a>, where Jesus calls out their lack of faith in the face of fear and doubt. It serves as a reminder of the importance of faith in the life of a believer.<p><b>why are you debating among yourselves</b><br>The disciples' discussion reflects their misunderstanding and focus on physical needs rather than spiritual truths. This internal debate shows their human tendency to worry and reason without considering Jesus' power and provision, as seen in the feeding of the 5,000 and 4,000.<p><b>about having no bread?</b><br>The concern over bread is symbolic of a deeper spiritual lesson. Jesus had recently performed miracles of provision, yet the disciples are preoccupied with material needs. This mirrors the Israelites' struggle in the wilderness, where they doubted God's provision despite His past faithfulness (Exodus 16). Jesus uses this moment to redirect their focus from earthly concerns to trust in His divine provision and care.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is addressing His disciples and teaching them about faith and understanding.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are being taught and corrected in this passage.

Nothing slips past the Lord.

His awareness is a comfort&#8212;He sees&#8212;and a caution&#8212;He will address unbelief when it surfaces.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus said</b><p>When Jesus speaks, it is with full authority (<a href="/matthew/7-29.htm">Matthew 7:29</a>). He does not join the disciples&#8217; anxious chatter; He lovingly confronts it. Like the Good Shepherd (<a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a>), He calls their attention back to His voice, cutting through the noise of their own reasoning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You of little faith</b><p>This familiar phrase marks moments when disciples trust Him for eternity yet doubt Him for the day-to-day (<a href="/matthew/6-30.htm">Matthew 6:30</a>; 8:26; 14:31; 17:20). Their faith is real but small, shrunk by immediate circumstances. Christ&#8217;s gentle rebuke invites them&#8212;and us&#8212;to enlarge faith by remembering His past deeds.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Why are you debating among yourselves</b><p>Debate without dependence quickly becomes worry. Instead of turning to Jesus, they turned to one another, pooling limited human logic. <a href="/proverbs/3-5.htm">Proverbs 3:5</a> reminds us to trust the Lord rather than lean on our own understanding. <a href="/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a> calls believers to pray, not panic. Community discussion is healthy; anxious dispute is not.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>About having no bread?</b><p>The question exposes forgetfulness. Only days earlier He fed five thousand, then four thousand (<a href="/matthew/16-9.htm">Matthew 16:9-10</a>). The pantry of heaven is never bare (<a href="/psalms/78-19.htm">Psalm 78:19</a>). Their focus on lunch blinded them to a larger lesson about &#8220;the leaven of the Pharisees&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/16-11.htm">Matthew 16:11-12</a>): beware corrosive unbelief, not sandwich shortages. Jesus, the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>), stands in the boat ready to supply both body and soul.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/16-8.htm">Matthew 16:8</a> shows Jesus uncovering anxious hearts, challenging small faith, and redirecting attention from earthly lack to divine sufficiency.

The discernment depended (in part, at least) on imaginative power, or acquired culture, for the lack of which they were not responsible. But their memory of the manner in which their wants had been twice supplied might at least have taught them that no such case of extreme necessity, such as they pictured to themselves, was likely to arise while He was with them, and therefore that their gross carnal interpretation of His words could not possibly be the true one. Memory in this case should have been an aid to faith, and faith, in its turn, would have quickened spiritual discernment.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Jesus perceived</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>).
