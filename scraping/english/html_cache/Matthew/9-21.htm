In the cultural context of the time, women often had limited public voice, making her internal resolve significant. Her self-talk reveals her belief in Jesus' power, despite societal norms that might discourage her from approaching Him.<p><b>&#8220;If only I touch His cloak</b><br>The cloak, or outer garment, was a common piece of clothing in ancient Israel. Touching the hem of a garment was a symbolic act, often associated with seeking blessing or healing. In <a href="/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38-39</a>, Israelites were instructed to wear tassels on the corners of their garments to remind them of God's commandments. This woman&#8217;s faith in touching Jesus' cloak suggests her belief in His divine authority and power, possibly recognizing Him as the fulfillment of the Law.<p><b>I will be healed.&#8221;</b><br>Her statement is a declaration of faith, showing her belief in Jesus' ability to heal her condition, which had persisted for twelve years (<a href="/matthew/9-20.htm">Matthew 9:20</a>). This reflects a common theme in the Gospels where faith is a prerequisite for healing (<a href="/matthew/9-22.htm">Matthew 9:22</a>, <a href="/mark/5-34.htm">Mark 5:34</a>). Her faith is proactive, not passive, demonstrating a trust in Jesus' power that transcends the physical act of touching His garment. This anticipates the healing miracles of Jesus, which often required an element of personal faith (<a href="/matthew/8-13.htm">Matthew 8:13</a>, <a href="/luke/17-19.htm">Luke 17:19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman_with_the_issue_of_blood.htm">The Woman with the Issue of Blood</a></b><br>A woman suffering from a bleeding disorder for twelve years, which made her ceremonially unclean according to Jewish law.

She believed, as the leper did, in the power to heal, but did not trust the love, and shrank from the thought lest the Healer should shrink from her. And she thought not of a will that seeks to bless and save, but of a physical effluence passing from the body to the garments, and from the garments to the hand that touched them. Yet weak as the faith was, it was accepted, and outward things were endowed with a "virtue" which was not their own. So afterwards, where a like belief prevailed, the "handkerchiefs and aprons" that were brought from St. Paul's flesh became means of healing (<a href="/acts/19-12.htm" title="So that from his body were brought to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.">Acts 19:12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For she said within herself, If I may</span>; <span class="accented">do</span> (Revised Version).
