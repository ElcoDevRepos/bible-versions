The term "dogs" was sometimes used metaphorically to describe those who were outside the covenant community or who rejected the teachings of God. The "holy" likely refers to sacred teachings or truths, possibly the message of the Gospel. This phrase suggests discernment in sharing spiritual truths, recognizing that not everyone will appreciate or respect them. In the Old Testament, holiness was associated with items set apart for God, such as the temple offerings, which were not to be given to those who would defile them.<p><b>do not throw your pearls before swine.</b><br>Swine, like dogs, were considered unclean animals in Jewish culture, and the imagery of pearls, which are valuable and precious, being thrown to pigs highlights the futility and disrespect of such an action. Pearls can symbolize wisdom or the kingdom of heaven, as seen in <a href="/matthew/13-45.htm">Matthew 13:45-46</a>, where the kingdom is likened to a pearl of great value. This phrase emphasizes the need for wisdom in sharing the Gospel, as some may not only fail to appreciate it but may also react with hostility.<p><b>If you do, they may trample them under their feet,</b><br>This part of the verse illustrates the potential outcome of sharing sacred truths with those who are not receptive. The image of trampling suggests disdain and disrespect, indicating that the message may be rejected and treated with contempt. This reflects the broader biblical theme of the rejection of God's message by those who are hardened in heart, as seen in the parable of the sower (<a href="/matthew/13-18.htm">Matthew 13:18-23</a>), where the seed on the path is quickly devoured.<p><b>and then turn and tear you to pieces.</b><br>The warning here is not only about the rejection of the message but also about the potential danger to the messenger. The imagery of being torn to pieces suggests a violent reaction, highlighting the hostility that can arise from those who reject spiritual truths. This echoes Jesus' own experiences, as He faced opposition and persecution from those who rejected His message. It also serves as a caution to believers to be wise and discerning in their evangelistic efforts, understanding that not all will receive the message with openness or peace.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, a foundational teaching moment in His ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The primary audience of Jesus' teachings, representing all followers of Christ who seek to live according to His instructions.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/dogs_and_swine.htm">Dogs and Swine</a></b><br>Metaphorical representations of those who are hostile or unreceptive to the Gospel and its truths.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/d/discernment_in_sharing_the_gospel.htm">Discernment in Sharing the Gospel</a></b><br>Believers are called to exercise wisdom and discernment in sharing the Gospel, recognizing when an audience is unreceptive or hostile.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/v/value_of_the_gospel.htm">Value of the Gospel</a></b><br>The Gospel is likened to pearls, emphasizing its preciousness and the need to protect it from being devalued or ridiculed.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/respect_for_sacred_things.htm">Respect for Sacred Things</a></b><br>Christians should maintain a reverence for what is holy and not subject it to scorn or mockery by those who do not understand its worth.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/a/avoiding_fruitless_engagements.htm">Avoiding Fruitless Engagements</a></b><br>Engaging with those who are antagonistic to the faith can lead to unnecessary conflict and distraction from fruitful ministry opportunities.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/practical_evangelism.htm">Practical Evangelism</a></b><br>While sharing the Gospel is a command, believers must also recognize when to move on and seek those who are open and ready to receive the message.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_7_6_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 7:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Identify_dogs_and_pigs_in_Matthew_7_6.htm">How can we discern who are the "dogs" and "pigs" in Matthew 7:6?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_holy_in_evangelism.htm">What does "do not give dogs what is holy" mean for evangelism?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_Matthew_7_6_Proverbs_9_8_on_mockers.htm">How does Matthew 7:6 connect with Proverbs 9:8 about correcting mockers?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Matthew_7_6_in_Gospel_sharing.htm">How can we apply Matthew 7:6 in sharing the Gospel wisely?  </a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_wisely_share_ministry_resources.htm">What practical steps ensure we don't "throw pearls before swine" in ministry?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Meaning_of_do_not_give_dogs_what_is_holy.htm">What does Matthew 7:6 mean by "do not give dogs what is holy"?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Interpret_pearls_before_swine_in_Matt_7_6.htm">How should Christians interpret "do not throw your pearls before swine" in Matthew 7:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/What_history_shapes_Matthew_7_6.htm">What historical context influences the understanding of Matthew 7:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_7.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 7?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/what_is_sacred_in_matthew_7_6.htm">What is sacred in Matthew 7:6?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/why_avoid_casting_pearls_before_swine.htm">Why did Jesus advise against casting pearls before swine?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/common_questions_about_proverbs.htm">What are common questions about proverbs?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/does_proverbs_23_9_conflict_with_sharing_truth.htm">Proverbs 23:9 says not to speak to a fool; does this conflict with the New Testament&#8217;s call to share truth with everyone? </a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Matthew 7:6 Mean</div><b>Do not give dogs what is holy</b><p>Jesus says, &#8220;Do not give dogs what is holy&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a>).

Jesus modeled this by leaving Nazareth when they tried to throw Him off a cliff (<a href="/luke/4-28.htm">Luke 4:28&#8211;30</a>) and by withdrawing from contentious crowds at times (<a href="/john/10-39.htm">John 10:39&#8211;40</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/7-6.htm">Matthew 7:6</a> teaches that sacred truth is infinitely precious; to treat it lightly or press it on the defiantly unrepentant invites ridicule and even danger.

Discernment guards the holiness of the message and the well-being of Christ&#8217;s servants while keeping the door open for future repentance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/7.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">That which is holy.</span>--The words point to the flesh which has been offered for sacrifice, the "holy thing" of <a href="/context/leviticus/22-6.htm" title="The soul which has touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.">Leviticus 22:6-7</a>; <a href="/leviticus/22-10.htm" title="There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.">Leviticus 22:10</a>; <a href="/leviticus/22-16.htm" title="Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.">Leviticus 22:16</a>, of which no un clean person or stranger, and <span class= "ital">a fortiori</span> no unclean beast, was to eat. To give that holy flesh to dogs would have seemed to the devout Israelite the greatest of all profanations. Our Lord teaches us that there is a like risk of desecration in dealing with the yet holier treasure of divine truth. Another aspect of the same warning is brought out in the second clause. The fashion of the time had made pearls the costliest of all jewels, as in the parable of <a href="/matthew/13-45.htm" title="Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:">Matthew 13:45</a> (comp. also <a href="/1_timothy/2-9.htm" title="In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with modesty and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;">1Timothy 2:9</a>), and so they too became symbols of the preciousness of truth. The "dogs" and the "swine," in their turn, represent distinct forms of evil, the former being here, as in <a href="/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Philippians 3:2</a>, <a href="/revelation/22-15.htm" title="For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and fornicators, and murderers, and idolaters, and whoever loves and makes a lie.">Revelation 22:15</a>, the type of impurity, the latter (as in <a href="/psalms/80-13.htm" title="The boar out of the wood does waste it, and the wild beast of the field does devour it.">Psalm 80:13</a>) of ferocity. The second comparison may possibly imply, as in a condensed fable, the disappointment and consequent rage of the swine at finding that what they took for grain was only pearls. We are to beware lest we so present the truth, either in direct teaching or by an undiscerning disclosure of the deeper religious emotions of the soul, to men, that we make them worse and not better than before. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">Give not that</span> <span class="cmt_word">which is holy,</span> etc. While you are not to be censorious towards brethren (vers. 1-5), you must recognize the great and fundamental differences that there are between men.

The scavengers of Eastern cities, which by nature and habit love and greedily devour the most unholy of things (cf. <a href="/exodus/22-31.htm">Exodus 22:31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Neither</span> <span class="cmt_word">cast ye your pearls,</span> <span class="accented">Pearls.</span> Only here and <a href="/matthew/13-45.htm">Matthew 13:45, 46</a> in the Gospels. In form not so very unlike swine's food of beans or nuts, they here represent the beauty and precious wealth of the various parts of the Gospel, in which Christ's disciples are accustomed to delight (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). Ignatius ('Ephesians,' &sect; 11) calls his bonds his "spiritual pearls." <span class="cmt_word">Before swine</span>; <span class="accented">before the swine</span> (Revised Version). Probably in both cases the article is used with the object of bringing the particular dogs and swine to whom these are given more vividly before us. <span class="accented">Swine.</span> Which have no care for such things, but rather wallow in filth (<a href="/2_peter/2-22.htm">2 Peter 2:22</a>). <span class="accented">Dogs... swine.</span> The terms seem to so far indicate different classes of men, or more truly different characters in men, as that the one term points to the greedy participation of the wicked in open profanation, the ether to the sottish indifference of sinners to that which is most attractive. <span class="cmt_word">Lest</span> <span class="cmt_word">they;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the swine. Dogs, even though wild in the East, would not "tread down" the food. <span class="cmt_word">Trample them under their feet</span> (<a href="/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13</a>). In ignorance of their real worth and in disappointment that they do not afford them satisfaction (For the future, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, cf. <a href="/matthew/5-25.htm">Matthew 5:25</a>, note.) It here expresses the greater certainty of the trampling than of the rending (aorist subjective). <span class="cmt_word">And turn again</span> - Revised Version omits "again" <span class="cmt_word">- and rend you</span>. In rage at the disappointment experienced. The clause expresses the personal enmity which those who wilfully reject the gospel often feel towards those that have offered it to them. It might be thought difficult to carry out this command, as it is evident that we cannot know beforehand who will accept the gospel or not. But in cases where the character of the person is not known (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> as when St. Paul preached at Athens, etc.), the command does not apply. Our Lord <span class="accented">supposes</span> the case where the character is apparent (cf. <a href="/1_timothy/5-24.htm">1 Timothy 5:24</a>). Theodoret (<span class="accented">vide</span> Resch, 'Agrapha,' pp. 103, 168), in quoting this verse, adds, "My mysteries are tot me and mine," which, clearly an adaptation of Symmachus and Theodotion's rendering of <a href="/isaiah/24-16.htm">Isaiah 24:16</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5d6;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d9;</span> (cf. also Targ. Jon.), seems to have become almost an authorized, and certainly a true, interpretation of our verse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/7-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{Do} not</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#8052;</span> <span class="translit">(M&#275;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3361.htm">Strong's 3361: </a> </span><span class="str2">Not, lest.
