Located on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee, it was a prosperous fishing village and a hub of commerce. Jesus performed many miracles here, including healing the centurion's servant and Peter's mother-in-law. Despite witnessing these works, the town largely rejected His message, leading to this rebuke.<p><b>will you be lifted up to heaven?</b><br>This rhetorical question implies a sense of pride or expectation of exaltation. In biblical terms, being "lifted up to heaven" suggests honor and divine favor. Capernaum, having witnessed Jesus' miracles, might have assumed it was favored by God. However, the question challenges this assumption, highlighting the town's spiritual arrogance and lack of repentance.<p><b>No, you will be brought down to Hades!</b><br>Hades, in Jewish thought, was the realm of the dead, often associated with judgment and separation from God. This statement is a pronouncement of judgment, indicating that Capernaum's fate would be severe due to its unbelief. The imagery of being "brought down" contrasts sharply with being "lifted up," emphasizing the reversal of expectations due to their rejection of Christ.<p><b>For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom,</b><br>Sodom is infamous for its wickedness and subsequent destruction by divine judgment (Genesis 19). By comparing Capernaum to Sodom, Jesus underscores the gravity of their unbelief. The miracles performed in Capernaum were acts of divine revelation and grace, intended to lead to repentance. The comparison suggests that even a city as sinful as Sodom would have repented if given the same opportunity.<p><b>it would have remained to this day.</b><br>This hypothetical statement highlights the potential for repentance and transformation through witnessing God's power. It implies that Sodom's destruction could have been averted if it had experienced the same miraculous works as Capernaum. The enduring presence of Sodom would have been a testament to God's mercy in response to genuine repentance, contrasting with Capernaum's missed opportunity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/capernaum.htm">Capernaum</a></b><br>A significant town in Jesus' ministry, located on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee.

In this sense, and not in any outward prosperity, had Capernaum been "exalted unto heaven." All this, however, had been in vain, and therefore the sentence was passed on it that it should be "brought down to hell," i.e., to <span class= "ital">Hades,</span> the grave, not <span class= "ital">Gehenna.</span> The words point, as the next verse shows, to the ultimate abasement of the guilty city in the day of judgment, but the words have had an almost literal fulfilment. A few ruins conjecturally identified mark the site of Capernaum. Not one stone is left upon the other in Chorazin and Bethsaida. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou, Capernaum</span> (<a href="/matthew/4-13.htm">Matthew 4:13</a>, note), <span class="cmt_word">which art exalted unto heaven;</span> <span class="accented">Shalt thou be exalted unto heaven</span>?
