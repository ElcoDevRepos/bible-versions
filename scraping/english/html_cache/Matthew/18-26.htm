This act of humility reflects the servant's acknowledgment of the master's authority and his own helplessness. Kneeling is often associated with prayer and supplication in the Bible, as seen in <a href="/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a> and <a href="/acts/9-40.htm">Acts 9:40</a>, symbolizing a posture of earnest pleading and reverence. The servant's action here is a physical manifestation of his urgent plea for mercy.<p><b>&#8216;Have patience with me,&#8217; he begged,</b><br>The plea for patience indicates the servant's recognition of his inability to repay the debt immediately. Patience, or longsuffering, is a virtue extolled throughout Scripture, as seen in <a href="/galatians/5-22.htm">Galatians 5:22</a>, where it is listed as a fruit of the Spirit. The servant's request highlights the human need for grace and mercy, themes central to the teachings of Jesus. This plea also reflects the broader biblical narrative of God's patience with humanity, as seen in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, where God is described as patient, not wanting anyone to perish.<p><b>&#8216;and I will pay back everything.&#8217;</b><br>The promise to repay the debt, though likely impossible given the servant's situation, demonstrates a willingness to make amends and a desire to restore what was owed. This reflects the biblical principle of restitution found in passages like <a href="/exodus/22.htm">Exodus 22:1-14</a>, where making things right is a key aspect of justice. However, the hyperbolic nature of the debt in the parable (<a href="/matthew/18-24.htm">Matthew 18:24</a>) underscores the futility of human efforts to repay the spiritual debt of sin, pointing to the need for divine forgiveness. This phrase also foreshadows the ultimate forgiveness offered through Christ, who pays the debt of sin on behalf of humanity, as seen in <a href="/colossians/2-13.htm">Colossians 2:13-14</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servant.htm">The Servant</a></b><br>Represents a debtor who owes a significant amount to his master.

Kneeling in Scripture signals humility, desperation, and recognition of authority. <a href="/mark/10-17.htm">Mark 10:17</a> shows the rich young ruler doing the same before Jesus, while <a href="/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10</a> reminds us that &#8220;at the name of Jesus every knee should bow.&#8221;<p>&#8226; In the parable, the king pictures God. The servant&#8217;s immediate collapse underlines our proper place before Him&#8212;no bargaining from a position of strength, only honest surrender.<p>&#8226; It also foreshadows the mercy that will follow; <a href="/james/4-10.htm">James 4:10</a> says, &#8220;Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will exalt you.&#8221; The first move toward forgiveness is always a downward one&#8212;onto our knees.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Have patience with me&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The plea is for time, not justice. The servant senses that only the master&#8217;s long-suffering can keep him alive. This echoes <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>: &#8220;The Lord is not slow in keeping His promise&#8230; but is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Patience, in biblical terms, is more than delayed judgment; it is a window for repentance (<a href="/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>). The verse captures that moment where the sinner realizes mercy is his only hope.<p>&#8226; By asking for patience, the servant confesses the enormity of his debt indirectly. There is no claim of innocence, merely a cry for the master&#8217;s forbearance.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He begged</b><p>&#8226; Matthew deliberately highlights the intensity: this is not casual asking but urgent pleading. <a href="/luke/11-9.htm">Luke 11:9</a> encourages such persistence&#8212;&#8220;ask&#8230; seek&#8230; knock.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Real repentance engages both heart and voice. <a href="/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17</a> says, &#8220;A broken and contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The verb also shows dependence. <a href="/hebrews/4-16.htm">Hebrews 4:16</a> invites us to &#8220;approach the throne of grace with confidence,&#8221; yet always as supplicants, never as equals.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;And I will pay back everything&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The servant promises the impossible. Earlier Jesus has described his debt as ten thousand talents (<a href="/matthew/18-24.htm">Matthew 18:24</a>), a sum no laborer could repay. His statement exposes human instinct to fix our own sin problem.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/49-7.htm">Psalm 49:7-8</a> states flatly, &#8220;No man can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for him.&#8221; Likewise, <a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a> declares salvation &#8220;is the gift of God, not by works.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Still, the promise reveals a flicker of responsibility: he does not deny the obligation. Genuine repentance admits guilt, even if it misjudges the solution. The master&#8217;s later cancellation of the debt will teach that grace, not repayment, settles accounts (<a href="/matthew/18-27.htm">Matthew 18:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/18-26.htm">Matthew 18:26</a> paints a vivid picture of the sinner&#8217;s approach to a holy God: humble knees, a plea for patience, earnest begging, and an unrealistic vow to repay. The verse highlights our need to surrender pride, acknowledge our debt, and cast ourselves on divine mercy. It sets the stage for the king&#8217;s astounding forgiveness, reminding us that while we cannot square our own ledger, God stands ready to erase it through grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Fell down, and worshipped him.</span>--The word implies simply the prostrate homage of a servant crouching before his master.<p><span class= "bld">I will pay thee all.</span>--The promise was, under such circumstances, an idle boast, but it describes with singular aptness the first natural impulse of one who is roused to a sense of the exceeding sinfulness of sin. He will try to balance the account as by a series of instalments; he will score righteous acts in the future as a set-off against the transgressions of the past. In theological language, he seeks to be "justified by works."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Worshipped him.</span> Prostrated himself before the monarch, and in this abject attitude sued for mercy. <span class="cmt_word">Have patience with me.</span> Be long suffering in my case; give me time. <span class="cmt_word">And I will pay thee all.</span> In his terror and anguish, he promises impossible things; even the revenues of a province would not in any convenient time supply this deficiency. The scene is very true to life. To save himself from a present difficulty, a debtor will make any promise that occurs to him, without considering whether he will ever be in a position to fulfil it. The defaulter in the parable must have thought well of the king's generosity and tenderheartedness to make such a proposition at this extreme moment. If we take the spiritual sense of the parable, we see that no sinner could offer to pay, much less pay, the debt due from him to his Lord, "so that must be let alone forever" (<a href="/psalms/49-8.htm">Psalm 49:8</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/18-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
