The concept of "innocent blood" is significant in Jewish law, which emphasizes the sanctity of life and the prohibition against shedding innocent blood (<a href="/deuteronomy/19-10.htm">Deuteronomy 19:10</a>). Judas's admission of sin highlights the gravity of his actions and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies regarding the betrayal of the Messiah (<a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>). The term "innocent" underscores Jesus's sinlessness, aligning with the New Testament portrayal of Christ as the spotless Lamb (<a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>).<p><b>he said.</b><br>Judas's confession is verbal, indicating a moment of realization and remorse. This moment is crucial in the narrative, as it shows Judas's internal conflict and recognition of his betrayal's moral implications. His statement is a rare instance of direct speech from Judas, providing insight into his character and the weight of his actions.<p><b>What is that to us?</b><br>The response from the chief priests and elders reveals their indifference to Judas's remorse and the moral implications of their actions. This rhetorical question indicates their focus on legalistic and political concerns rather than justice or righteousness. Their lack of empathy and responsibility contrasts with the teachings of the law, which emphasize justice and mercy (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>).<p><b>they replied.</b><br>The religious leaders' reply is dismissive, highlighting their role in the conspiracy against Jesus. Their response fulfills the prophecy of the leaders' rejection of the Messiah (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>). This interaction underscores the theme of spiritual blindness and the failure of the religious establishment to recognize Jesus as the promised Savior.<p><b>You bear the responsibility.</b><br>The leaders place the burden of guilt solely on Judas, absolving themselves of any wrongdoing. This statement reflects the theme of personal responsibility and the consequences of sin. It also foreshadows the ultimate responsibility that Jesus will bear on the cross for the sins of humanity (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-6</a>). The leaders' refusal to accept their part in the betrayal contrasts with the Christian understanding of collective sin and the need for repentance.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judas_iscariot.htm">Judas Iscariot</a></b><br>One of the twelve disciples of Jesus, who betrayed Him for thirty pieces of silver.

Compare his confession to David&#8217;s in <a href="/2_samuel/12-13.htm">2 Samuel 12:13</a> and <a href="/psalms/51-3.htm">Psalm 51:3&#8211;4</a>, where genuine guilt breaks through a hardened heart.<p>- He admits his action was betrayal, mirroring the prophecy of <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a> and the fulfillment noted in <a href="/acts/1-16.htm">Acts 1:16</a>.<p>- The words &#8220;innocent blood&#8221; underline that Jesus is spotless (<a href="/isaiah/53-9.htm">Isaiah 53:9</a>; <a href="/1_peter/1-19.htm">1 Peter 1:19</a>; <a href="/luke/23-4.htm">Luke 23:4</a>). Judas has no excuses left, only responsibility for shedding the blood of the perfectly righteous One.<p>- Recognition of sin, however, is not the same as repentance. Unlike Peter, who weeps bitterly and turns back to Christ (<a href="/luke/22-62.htm">Luke 22:62</a>; <a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15&#8211;17</a>), Judas turns inward and collapses under guilt.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What is that to us?</b><p>- The chief priests and elders reveal a chilling indifference. Their question echoes Cain&#8217;s &#8220;Am I my brother&#8217;s keeper?&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/4-9.htm">Genesis 4:9</a>), showing a heart untouched by the very law they claimed to uphold (<a href="/micah/6-8.htm">Micah 6:8</a>; <a href="/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>).<p>- Though they orchestrated the arrest (<a href="/john/18-3.htm">John 18:3</a>) and pushed for crucifixion (<a href="/john/19-6.htm">John 19:6</a>), they distance themselves from Judas to keep their hands &#8220;clean.&#8221; This is the hypocrisy Jesus condemned in <a href="/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27&#8211;28</a>.<p>- Their apathy contrasts sharply with God&#8217;s concern for the innocent (<a href="/proverbs/6-16.htm">Proverbs 6:16&#8211;17</a>) and stands as a warning against religious activity without compassion.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You bear the responsibility.</b><p>- By placing the blame solely on Judas, the leaders ignore their own culpability. Yet Scripture holds them accountable: Peter later declares, &#8220;You handed Him over&#8230; you killed the Author of life&#8221; (<a href="/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13&#8211;15</a>).<p>- The law they teach warns, &#8220;Cursed is he who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/27-25.htm">Deuteronomy 27:25</a>). Their dismissal cannot erase divine justice.<p>- Ironically they will soon accept full responsibility before Pilate: &#8220;His blood be on us and on our children!&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/27-25.htm">Matthew 27:25</a>). Responsibility for Christ&#8217;s death is shared by Judas, the leaders, Pilate, the crowds&#8212;and every sinner for whom He died (<a href="/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23&#8211;25</a>).<p>- Refusing ownership of sin never removes its weight; only Christ&#8217;s atoning sacrifice does (<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/27-4.htm">Matthew 27:4</a> exposes three hearts: a betrayer crushed by guilt, religious leaders hardened by hypocrisy, and the spotless Savior whose innocence magnifies both their sin and His grace. Judas confesses but never repents; the priests deny any stake in the matter, yet Scripture testifies they are as guilty as he. The verse calls us to honest admission of sin, genuine turning to Christ, and humble acceptance that only His innocent blood&#8212;once betrayed, then poured out&#8212;can cleanse our guilty hands.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">I have sinned in that I have betrayed.</span>--More accurately, <span class= "ital">I sinned in betraying.</span><p><span class= "bld">What is that to us</span>?--We instinctively feel, as we read these words, that deep as was the guilt of Judas, that of those who thus mocked him was deeper still. Speaking after the manner of men, we may say that a word of sympathy and true counsel might have saved him even then. His confession was as the germ of repentance, but this repulse drove him back upon despair, and he had not the courage or the faith to turn to the great Absolver; and so his life closed as in a blackness of darkness; and if we ask the question, Is there any hope? We dare not answer. Possibly there mingled with his agony, as has been suggested by one at least of the great teachers of the Church (Origen, <span class= "ital">Horn. in Matt.</span> 35), some confused thought that in the world of the dead, behind the veil, he might meet his Lord and confess his guilt to Him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I have sinned.</span> He confesses his sin, indeed, yet not to God, but to the partners and instigators of his crime, and this, not with godly sorrow, but in self-disgust and vexation of spirit that could not be repressed. His was the sorrow that worketh death (<a href="/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In that I</span> <span class="cmt_word">have betrayed</span> [<span class="cmt_word">the</span>] <span class="cmt_word">innocent blood</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b8;&#x1ff7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, or, according to some manuscripts, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, but in either case without the article). By speaking of "blood," he showed that he knew the murder was certain. Judas seems to have had no faith in Christ's Divinity, but he had perfect assurance of his holiness and innocence, and felt, and endeavoured to make the rulers feel, that an iniquitous sentence had been passed, and that a guiltless person was condemned to death. This consideration added to the bitterness of his regret. But he obtained no comfort from the hardened and unfeeling priests. They had gotten what they had desired. The question of Christ's moral guilt or innocence was nothing to them; equally indifferent to them was the fierce remorse of Judas. <span class="cmt_word">What is that to us?</span> <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span>; <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>See thou to that</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">tu videris</span>, equivalent to "that is your concern," as in ver. 24). A more unfeeling, nay, fiendish answer could not have been given. It threw the wretched man back on himself, left him alone with his remorse, the blackness of his night unrelieved by any ray of human sympathy. In their own obduracy and impenitence they scorn the weakness of their miserable tool. As Bengel well moralizes, "Impii in facto consortes, post factum deserunt; pii, in facto non consortes, postea medentur." To sympathize with repentance is the duty and the privilege of the Christian; to deride and scoff at the returning sinner is devilish. It is profitable to contrast the sincere repentance of Peter after his fall with the remorse of the despairing Judas. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;I have sinned</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7981;&#956;&#945;&#961;&#964;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(H&#275;marton)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_264.htm">Strong's 264: </a> </span><span class="str2">Perhaps from a and the base of meros; properly, to miss the mark, i.e. to err, especially to sin.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">by betraying</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#948;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(paradous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3860.htm">Strong's 3860: </a> </span><span class="str2">From para and didomi; to surrender, i.e yield up, intrust, transmit.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">innocent</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#952;&#8183;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(ath&#333;on)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_121.htm">Strong's 121: </a> </span><span class="str2">(sometimes: unpunished), guiltless, innocent.
