This response highlights the intimate teacher-student relationship between Jesus and His disciples, emphasizing His role as the revealer of divine truth.<p><b>The knowledge of the mysteries</b><br>The term "mysteries" refers to divine truths that were previously hidden but are now revealed through Jesus. In biblical terms, a mystery is not something incomprehensible but rather a truth that is revealed by God at the appropriate time. This aligns with the concept of progressive revelation seen throughout Scripture, where God unveils His plans and purposes gradually.<p><b>of the kingdom of heaven</b><br>The "kingdom of heaven" is a central theme in Jesus' teachings, representing God's sovereign rule and reign. It is both a present reality and a future hope. The phrase is synonymous with the "kingdom of God" and reflects the Jewish tradition of reverence for God's name. The kingdom is characterized by righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, as seen in <a href="/romans/14-17.htm">Romans 14:17</a>.<p><b>has been given to you</b><br>This indicates that the understanding of these mysteries is a gift from God, not something earned or achieved through human effort. It underscores the grace of God in revealing His truths to those He chooses. The disciples, as followers of Jesus, are recipients of this divine revelation, which is a theme echoed in passages like <a href="/ephesians/1-17.htm">Ephesians 1:17-18</a>, where Paul prays for the spirit of wisdom and revelation.<p><b>but not to them</b><br>"Them" refers to the crowds and religious leaders who hear Jesus' parables but do not understand them. This distinction highlights the theme of spiritual discernment and the idea that understanding is granted to those who are open and receptive to God's message.

In this verse our Lord does not directly reply to their question, but only states God's ways of dealing with the two different classes of people (cf. <a href="/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">It is given unto you</span> (<span class="accented">unto you it is given</span>, Revised Version); which better represents the sharpness of the antithesis in the Greek. <span class="accented">It is given</span>; already (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f73;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)<span class="accented">, i.e.</span> in the counsel of God, though now given in possession, so far as regards this parable, by the explanation that I will add. <span class="cmt_word">To know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.</span> The secrets about the establishment and development of God's realm, which cannot be discovered by human reason, but which are made known to the initiated. Under the term "mystery," St. Paul refers to such revealed secrets as the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles (<a href="/ephesians/3-3.htm">Ephesians 3:3, 4, 9</a>; <a href="/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26</a>), the conversion of the Jews (<a href="/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>), the relation of Christ to the Church being like that of husband and wife (<a href="/ephesians/5-32.htm">Ephesians 5:32</a>), and the general resurrection (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>). (Cf. <a href="/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>, note, "revealed;" and <span class="accented">infra</span>, ver. 35, note, and especially Bishop Lightfoot on the passage in Colossians.) <span class="cmt_word">But to them it is not given.</span> Professor Marshall suggests that the variation "the rest" (Luke), points to a slight difference in one word of the original Aramaic text, the phrase in Mark ("them that are without") combining both readings (see <span class="accented">Expositor</span> IV. 4:446). The suggestion is ingenious, but seems hardly necessary. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/13-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He replied,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(apokritheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;The knowledge</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#957;&#8182;&#957;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(gn&#333;nai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Infinitive Active<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1097.htm">Strong's 1097: </a> </span><span class="str2">A prolonged form of a primary verb; to 'know' in a great variety of applications and with many implications.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#8048;</span> <span class="translit">(ta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
