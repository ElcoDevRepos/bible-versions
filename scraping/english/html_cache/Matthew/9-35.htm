He did not confine His work to a single location but traveled extensively throughout the region of Galilee. This approach reflects the fulfillment of <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, which speaks of a great light shining in Galilee. The towns and villages refer to both larger settlements and smaller communities, indicating that Jesus' message was for everyone, regardless of their social or economic status. This widespread travel also underscores the accessibility of Jesus' ministry, as He brought His message directly to the people.<p><b>teaching in their synagogues</b><br>The synagogue was the center of Jewish religious life and community gatherings. Teaching in synagogues was a common practice for rabbis and teachers of the law. Jesus' teaching in synagogues signifies His role as a respected teacher and His engagement with the Jewish religious system. It also provided a platform for Him to interpret the Scriptures and reveal their fulfillment in Himself. This practice connects to <a href="/luke/4-16.htm">Luke 4:16-21</a>, where Jesus reads from Isaiah and declares its fulfillment in Him, emphasizing His messianic mission.<p><b>preaching the gospel of the kingdom</b><br>The "gospel of the kingdom" refers to the good news of God's reign and the arrival of His kingdom through Jesus Christ. This message was central to Jesus' ministry and is rooted in Old Testament prophecies about the coming Messiah and the establishment of God's rule (e.g., <a href="/daniel/2-44.htm">Daniel 2:44</a>). The kingdom of God is both a present reality and a future hope, as Jesus inaugurated it through His life, death, and resurrection, and it will be fully realized at His return. This preaching aligns with <a href="/mark/1-15.htm">Mark 1:15</a>, where Jesus calls for repentance and belief in the gospel.<p><b>and healing every disease and sickness</b><br>Jesus' healing ministry demonstrated His compassion and authority over physical ailments, affirming His identity as the Messiah. These healings were signs of the kingdom, illustrating the restoration and wholeness that God's reign brings. They fulfilled prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/35-5.htm">Isaiah 35:5-6</a>, which speak of miraculous healings accompanying the messianic age. Healing every disease and sickness also symbolizes the comprehensive nature of Jesus' redemptive work, addressing both spiritual and physical brokenness. This aspect of His ministry foreshadows the ultimate healing and restoration promised in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this verse, Jesus is depicted as actively ministering to the people.

It is manifestly the beginning of the section which contains the great discourse of Matthew 10, and was intended to lead up to it.<p><span class= "bld">Every sickness and every disease</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> every variety or type, rather than every individual case. The work of healing was, we must believe, dependent, as before, on the faith of those who came seeking to be healed. Of the two words, the former is in the Greek the stronger, and, though the relative significance of the English words is not sharply defined, it would, perhaps, be better to invert the renderings.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 35.</span> - Parallel passages: <a href="/mark/6-6.htm">Mark 6:6</a> (<a href="/luke/13-22.htm">Luke 13:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus went about all the cities and</span> (<span class="accented">the</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">villages</span>. The Revised Version rightly restricts the "all" to the cities (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>).

A village was distinguished from a city by being <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> unwalled (though occasionally towns were themselves unwalled); <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> dependent on the cities (cf.

Its omission here and the alteration of the words," in all Galilee," to "all the cities and the villages," are both due to the wider scope of what follows. Observe that in <a href="/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a> our Lord's circuit is the occasion of crowds resorting to him, and serves as an introduction to a full account of his personal teaching, while here it is the occasion of his sending representatives, and serves as an introduction to his commission to them.
