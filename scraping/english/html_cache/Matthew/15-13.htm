The system and the men that they had been taught to regard as pre-eminently religious were, after all, in their Master's judgment, as the tares and not as the wheat (<a href="/context/matthew/13-37.htm" title="He answered and said to them, He that sows the good seed is the Son of man;">Matthew 13:37-38</a>). So far as they were a sect or party, His Father had not planted them. They, too, were left, according to the teaching of that parable, to grow until the harvest, but their end was sure--they should be "rooted out." The words which proclaim their doom were, however, intentionally general in their form. In that divine judgment which works through the world's history, foreshadowing the issues of the last great day, that doom is written on every system, party, sect which originates in man's zeal, in narrowness, in self-will. It has not been planted by the Father, and therefore it is doomed to perish.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Every plant,</span> etc. The answer of Christ signifies - Do not be alarmed by the displeasure of the Pharisees, and at my opposition to their teaching; the system which they support is ungodly and shall be soon destroyed. Christ, as often, puts the statement in a parabolic form, using two images, one derived from the vegetable kingdom in this verse, and one from human life in ver. 14. <span class="cmt_word">Plant</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>); <span class="accented">plantation.</span> The act of planting, and then by metonymy the thing planted. It here signifies the sect and doctrine of the Pharisees, the persons themselves, and that which they taught. The comparison of men and trees, plant and doctrine, is a common biblical metaphor (comp. <a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/5-7.htm">Isaiah 5:7</a>; <a href="/matthew/7-16.htm">Matthew 7:16-20</a>; <a href="/luke/6-43.htm">Luke 6:43, 44</a>, etc.). The traditions of the rabbis were plants <span class="cmt_word">which my heavenly</span> <span class="cmt_word">Father hath not planted.</span> They were of human, not Divine, growth; and the men themselves, even though originally planted in holy soil, had degenerated, and become not only unfruitful, but pernicious. So the Lord speaks by Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>), "I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?" <span class="cmt_word">Shall be rooted up.</span> Our Lord is not referring to the judgment of the last day (<a href="/matthew/3-10.htm">Matthew 3:10</a>), nor to any forcible destruction effected by human agency; he means that the system must pass away entirely to make room for a better growth, even the gospel. The Jews would not see that the Law was a schoolmaster to bring men to Christ; they deemed that their ceremonies and rites were to be permanent and universal; and this, more than anything, impeded the reception of Christ's claims, and made men utterly averse from his teaching. It was in vain that Jesus proclaimed, "If ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me" (<a href="/john/5-46.htm">John 5:46</a>). The very Law, as handled and obscured by the Pharisees, was made an obstacle to the truth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/15-13.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] replied,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(apokritheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Every</span><br /><span class="grk">&#928;&#8118;&#963;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Pasa)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3956.htm">Strong's 3956: </a> </span><span class="str2">All, the whole, every kind of.
