The term "foolish" is used in Scripture to describe those who lack wisdom and discernment, often in spiritual matters. In Proverbs, foolishness is contrasted with wisdom, which is rooted in the fear of the Lord. The foolish virgins represent individuals who are unprepared for the coming of the Kingdom of Heaven.<p><b>took their lamps</b><br>Lamps in the ancient Near East were small, handheld vessels that held oil and a wick. They symbolize the light of faith and readiness. In the context of the parable, the lamps represent the outward appearance of readiness for the bridegroom's arrival, which is a metaphor for Christ's return. The act of taking lamps suggests an initial acceptance of the invitation to the wedding feast, akin to an initial acceptance of the gospel.<p><b>but did not take along any extra oil</b><br>Oil in the Bible often symbolizes the Holy Spirit, anointing, and spiritual preparedness. The lack of extra oil indicates a failure to maintain a living, active faith and readiness for Christ's return. This phrase highlights the importance of perseverance and continual spiritual vigilance. The absence of extra oil suggests a superficial faith that lacks depth and sustainability, similar to the seed that fell on rocky ground in the Parable of the Sower, which sprang up quickly but withered away because it had no root.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_foolish_virgins.htm">The Foolish Virgins</a></b><br>These are the individuals in the parable who are unprepared for the bridegroom's arrival.

The foolish virgins neglected to seek that supply, either from the Great Giver, or through the human agencies by which He graciously imparts it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They that were foolish</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>)... <span class="cmt_word">took no oil with them</span>. It has been doubted whether they brought no oil of their own at all, trusting to get their lamps filled by others, or whether they neglected to bring an additional supply to replenish them when exhausted. The latter seems most likely to be the sense intended; as the spiritual aspect of the parable places both classes in exactly the same position at starting, and we know from other sources that, the oil reservoirs being very small, it was the custom to carry another vessel from which to refill them. Some good manuscripts commence the verse with "for," thus making the verse justify the epithets applied to the virgins. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/25-3.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">The</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Feminine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
