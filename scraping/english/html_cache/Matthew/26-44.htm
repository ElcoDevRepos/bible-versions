The disciples, representing humanity, are unable to fully grasp or participate in the spiritual burden Jesus is about to bear. This separation underscores the loneliness of His mission, a theme echoed in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as "despised and rejected by men."<p><b>and went away once more</b><br>Jesus' repeated withdrawal to pray emphasizes His need for communion with the Father during this critical moment. This act of seeking solitude for prayer is consistent with His practice throughout His ministry (<a href="/mark/1-35.htm">Mark 1:35</a>, <a href="/luke/5-16.htm">Luke 5:16</a>). The Garden of Gethsemane, where this event takes place, is located on the Mount of Olives, a place Jesus frequented for prayer and reflection (<a href="/luke/22-39.htm">Luke 22:39</a>).<p><b>and prayed a third time</b><br>The number three in biblical terms often signifies completeness or perfection. Jesus praying three times reflects the intensity and completeness of His submission to the Father's will. This mirrors other significant triads in Scripture, such as Peter's three denials (<a href="/matthew/26-34.htm">Matthew 26:34</a>) and the three days between Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection (<a href="/matthew/12-40.htm">Matthew 12:40</a>).<p><b>saying the same thing</b><br>Jesus' repetition of His prayer underscores the depth of His anguish and His unwavering commitment to the Father's plan. The content of His prayer, asking for the cup to pass yet submitting to God's will (<a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39, 42</a>), reveals His dual nature as fully human and fully divine.
