In the preceding chapter, Jesus had been teaching about forgiveness and the kingdom of heaven. This pattern of concluding a teaching with a phrase like "when Jesus had finished" is a literary device used by Matthew to structure his Gospel, seen in other sections such as <a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28, 11</a>:1, 13:53, and 26:1. It highlights the importance of Jesus' teachings and prepares the reader for a new phase in His ministry.<p><b>He left Galilee</b><br>Galilee was the primary region of Jesus' ministry, where He performed many miracles and taught extensively. It was a region known for its mixed population of Jews and Gentiles, which is significant in understanding Jesus' mission to both groups. Leaving Galilee signifies a shift in Jesus' focus as He moves towards the culmination of His earthly ministry in Jerusalem. This movement also fulfills the prophecy of <a href="/isaiah/9.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>, which speaks of a great light coming from Galilee.<p><b>and went into the region of Judea</b><br>Judea was the southern part of ancient Israel, encompassing Jerusalem, the religious and political center of Jewish life. This journey to Judea is significant as it sets the stage for the events leading to Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection. Judea was under Roman occupation, and tensions were high between the Jewish leaders and the Roman authorities. Jesus' presence in Judea would have been seen as a challenge to both religious and political structures.<p><b>beyond the Jordan</b><br>This phrase indicates that Jesus traveled to the area east of the Jordan River, known as Perea. This region was also under the jurisdiction of Herod Antipas, like Galilee. The area beyond the Jordan was significant in Jewish history as the place where the Israelites crossed into the Promised Land under Joshua's leadership (Joshua 3). It also holds typological significance as a place of transition and preparation, paralleling Jesus' own journey towards His ultimate sacrifice. This movement beyond the Jordan can be seen as a symbolic act, echoing the themes of crossing over and entering into a new covenant.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is teaching and ministering to the people.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/galilee.htm">Galilee</a></b><br>A region in northern Israel where Jesus conducted much of His early ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/judea.htm">Judea</a></b><br>A region in the southern part of ancient Israel, significant for its religious and historical importance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/b/beyond_the_jordan.htm">Beyond the Jordan</a></b><br>Refers to the area east of the Jordan River, often associated with the region of Perea during Jesus' time.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/transition_in_ministry.htm">Transition in Ministry</a></b><br>Jesus' movement from Galilee to Judea marks a significant transition in His ministry.

Matthew repeatedly notes this transition phrase (see <a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28</a>; 11:1; 13:53; 26:1), marking the close of a major teaching section&#8212;in this case, the discourse on humility, forgiveness, and marriage in <a href="/bsb/matthew/18.htm">Matthew 18</a>.<p>&#8226; It underscores Jesus as the divinely authorized Teacher who speaks, completes, and then moves on in perfect order, just as God&#8217;s word is always purposeful (<a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us to receive what He has just taught as complete and final, not optional advice (<a href="/john/13-17.htm">John 13:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He left Galilee</b><p>&#8226; Jesus&#8217; public ministry began in Galilee (<a href="/matthew/4-23.htm">Matthew 4:23</a>) and largely centered there, but now He deliberately sets His face southward.<p>&#8226; This departure signals a prophetic timetable: Galilee&#8217;s season of witness is fulfilled; now Judea must hear again before the cross (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51</a>).<p>&#8226; It also fulfills the pattern of progressive revelation&#8212;light shining first in Galilee of the Gentiles (<a href="/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>) and then advancing toward Jerusalem, the covenant center (<a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and went into the region of Judea beyond the Jordan</b><p>&#8226;

<a href="/mark/10-1.htm">Mark 10:1</a> parallels this move and adds that crowds gathered and He taught them again, highlighting His compassion to reach every pocket of Israel along the way.<p>&#8226;

The verse assures us of His orderly mission, unwavering purpose, and relentless commitment to bring the truth to every region right up to the appointed hour of the cross.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">XIX.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">He departed from Galilee.</span>--The verse covers a considerable interval of time which the materials supplied by St. Luke and St. John enable us to fill up. From the former we get the outlines of what has been called, as being "beyond Jordan," our Lord's Peraean ministry, from <a href="/luke/9-51.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,">Luke 9:51</a> to <a href="/luke/18-30.htm" title="Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.">Luke 18:30</a>; from the latter, according to the arrangement of the best harmonists, His visit to Jerusalem at the Feast of Tabernacles (<a href="/john/7-2.htm" title="Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.">John 7:2</a>), and again at that of the Dedication (<a href="/john/10-22.htm" title="And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.">John 10:22</a>). To keep these facts in mind will throw some light on the narrative that follows here. The journey from Galilee to Peraea appears from <a href="/luke/17-11.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the middle of Samaria and Galilee.">Luke 17:11</a> to have led our Lord through Samaria. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-12.</span> - <span class="accented">The beginning of the last journey to Jerusalem</span>. <span class="accented">The question concerning divorce</span>.

But St. Matthew's narrative omits many events that happened in the interval between the account of the Galilaean ministry and the history of these last days, that is, from the autumn of one year to the spring of the next. The transactions of this time, which are omitted also by St. Mark, are given by St. Luke (<a href="/luke/9-51.htm">Luke 9:51-17:11</a>) and St. John (<a href="/john/7-2.htm">John 7:2-11:54</a>), comprising many things that occurred at Jerusalem during the Feast of Tabernacles and on other occlusions. <span class="cmt_word">He departed from Galilee.</span> Not visiting it again till he appeared there after his resurrection. There was no part of the Holy Land in which he did not at some time sojourn, and now, as the final consummation drew nigh, he resolutely set his face towards Jerusalem. <span class="cmt_word">Came into the coasts of Judea beyond Jordan.</span> <span class="accented">Coasts</span> should be <span class="accented">borders</span>. Judaea was bounded by the river, and there was no part of it beyond, that is, on the east of Jordan. The words, "beyond Jordan," belong to the verb "came," and the clause signifies that the object of Christ's journey was the vicinity of Judaea, and that, instead of entering the province by the direct road through Samaria, he took the more lengthy but safer route through Peraea. This was the name of the region on the east of the Jordan (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">beyond</span>), extending at this time from the river Hieromax, or Jarmouk, on the north, to the Arnon on the south, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. to the middle of the eastern shore of the Dead Sea. The ruler of this district was Herod Antipas, and it was at this era in a most flourishing condition, notably fertile, and containing many fine towns ornamented with magnificent buildings. Here the simple, pastoral country people were less influenced by the narrow bigotry of the Pharisaic party, and in the towns the ban which excluded Jesus from the synagogues of Galilee and Judaea was either not recognized or not enforced. A quiet opportunity for preaching the gospel was thus offered. This may possibly be the sojourn in Peraea mentioned by St. John (<a href="/john/10-40.htm">John 10:40-42</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/19-1.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8005;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(hote)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3753.htm">Strong's 3753: </a> </span><span class="str2">When, at which time.
