The Sadducees, who did not believe in the resurrection, were attempting to challenge Jesus with a question about Levirate marriage, a practice outlined in <a href="/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5-6</a>. This law required a man to marry his deceased brother's widow to produce offspring in the brother's name. The mention of the second and third brothers highlights the continuation of this practice, emphasizing the legal and familial obligations in Jewish culture. This scenario underscores the Sadducees' misunderstanding of the resurrection and eternal life, which Jesus later addresses.<p><b>down to the seventh</b><br>The phrase "down to the seventh" indicates the completion of the hypothetical situation, where each brother in turn marries the widow and then dies without leaving offspring. The number seven often symbolizes completeness or perfection in biblical literature, seen in the creation week (Genesis 1) and the seven churches in Revelation (<a href="/revelation/1-4.htm">Revelation 1:4</a>). This use of seven brothers may imply the exhaustive nature of the Sadducees' question, attempting to cover all possibilities to trap Jesus. It also reflects the cultural importance of lineage and inheritance in Jewish society, where producing heirs was crucial for maintaining family legacy and property.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sadducees.htm">Sadducees</a></b><br>A Jewish sect known for their denial of the resurrection, who posed the question to Jesus to challenge Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in the passage, responding to the Sadducees' question.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_seven_brothers.htm">The Seven Brothers</a></b><br>Part of the hypothetical scenario presented by the Sadducees, each marrying the same woman in succession.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_woman.htm">The Woman</a></b><br>The widow in the Sadducees' scenario, who marries each brother in turn.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>The setting where this interaction takes place, during Jesus' ministry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_resurrection.htm">Understanding the Resurrection</a></b><br>The Sadducees' question reveals their misunderstanding of the resurrection.
