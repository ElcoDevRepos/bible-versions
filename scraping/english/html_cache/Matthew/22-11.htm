The setting is a royal wedding feast, symbolizing the kingdom of heaven. The king's entrance signifies divine judgment and the final assessment of those who have been called. This reflects the eschatological theme of the final judgment, where God will evaluate the hearts and lives of all who claim to be part of His kingdom. The imagery of a king inspecting his guests underscores the authority and sovereignty of God.<p><b>he spotted a man</b><br>The king's ability to spot the man among the guests highlights God's omniscience. In biblical terms, this represents God's ability to discern the true spiritual state of individuals. The man represents those who outwardly appear to be part of the community of believers but inwardly lack genuine faith and righteousness. This echoes the theme of divine discernment found in passages like <a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>, where God looks at the heart rather than outward appearances.<p><b>who was not dressed in wedding clothes</b><br>Wedding clothes symbolize the righteousness required to enter the kingdom of heaven. In ancient Jewish culture, wedding garments were often provided by the host, indicating that the necessary attire was available to all guests. The absence of wedding clothes signifies a lack of preparation and respect for the occasion. Spiritually, this represents the failure to put on the righteousness of Christ, as described in passages like <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a> and <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>.

The king came to see whether all the guests had fulfilled the implied condition of coming in suitable apparel. The framework of the parable probably pre-supposes the Oriental custom of providing garments for the guests who were invited to a royal feast. Wardrobes filled with many thousand garments formed part of the wealth of every Eastern prince (<a href="/matthew/6-19.htm" title="Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust does corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:">Matthew 6:19</a>; <a href="/james/5-2.htm" title="Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten.">James 5:2</a>), and it was part of his glory, as in the case of the assembly which Jehu held for the worshippers of Baal (<a href="/2_kings/10-22.htm" title="And he said to him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.">2Kings 10:22</a>), to bring them out for use on state occasions. On this assumption, the act of the man who was found "not having a wedding garment" was one of wilful insult. He came in the "filthy rags" (<a href="/isaiah/64-6.htm" title="But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.">Isaiah 64:6</a>) of his old life, instead of putting on the "white linen" meet for a kingly feast (<a href="/ecclesiastes/9-8.htm" title="Let your garments be always white; and let your head lack no ointment.">Ecclesiastes 9:8</a>; <a href="/context/revelation/3-4.htm" title="You have a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.">Revelation 3:4-5</a>) which had been freely offered him. Even without this assumption, the parable pre-supposes that the man might easily have got the garment, and that it was, therefore, his own fault that he had it not. What, then, is the "wedding garment?" Answers have been returned to that question from very different dogmatic standpoints. Some have seen in it the outward ordinance of Baptism, some the imputed righteousness of Christ covering the nakedness of our own unrighteousness. These answers, it is believed, are at once too narrow and too technical. The analogy of Scriptural symbolism elsewhere (<a href="/context/revelation/3-4.htm" title="You have a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.">Revelation 3:4-5</a>; <a href="/revelation/3-18.htm" title="I counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that you may be rich; and white raiment, that you may be clothed, and that the shame of your nakedness do not appear; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see.">Revelation 3:18</a>; <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm" title="And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.">Revelation 19:8</a>; <a href="/1_peter/5-5.htm" title="Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves to the elder. Yes, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble.">1Peter 5:5</a>; <a href="/isaiah/1-18.htm" title="Come now, and let us reason together, said the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.">Isaiah 1:18</a>; <a href="/psalms/109-18.htm" title="As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.">Psalm 109:18</a>), leads us to see in the "garment" of a man the habits of good or evil by which his character is manifested to others. Here, therefore, the "wedding garment" is nothing less than the "holiness" without which "no man shall see the Lord" (<a href="/hebrews/12-14.htm" title="Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:">Hebrews 12:14</a>), and that holiness, as in the framework of the parable and in the realities of the spiritual life, Christ is ever ready to impart to him that truly believes. It is obvious that no inference can be drawn from the fact that in the parable one guest only is without the wedding garment, any more than from there being only one "wicked and slothful servant" in the parables of the Talents and the Pounds. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The king came in to see the guests,</span> who by this time had taken their appointed places at table. This second portion of the parable teaches that admission to the visible Church is not all that is required; there is also a scrutiny to be undergone and an award to be made. And that this investigation is keen and searching is denoted by the verb used, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, which means not merely, to see casually, but to gaze upon with the intent of seeing the real nature and character of an object. The king makes his appearance in the banqueting hall, not to feast with the guests, but to welcome them, and to examine if they are properly ordered, served, and fitted for the high honour accorded to them. How close and personal is this inquiry is shown by the immediate detection of one unseemly guest among the multitude. The time when he thus comes is, in one view, the day of judgment; but such visitation and scrutiny are always recurring, as at solemn seasons, in days of trial, sacred services, holy communion, when he searches men's hearts, and sees if they are prepared for his presence. <span class="cmt_word">Which had not on a wedding garment;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>: <span class="accented">not garbed in wedding garment</span>, the genitive expressing the peculiar character or quality of the garment. Wordsworth compares similar phrases: <a href="/luke/16-9.htm">Luke 16:9</a>; <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3, 9</a>; <a href="/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>; <a href="/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>, etc. It is said to have been an Oriental custom to present each guest invited to a royal feast with a festive robe to be worn on the occasion, as nowadays persons admitted to the royal presence are clothed with a caftan. Traces of the custom have been found in <a href="/genesis/45-22.htm">Genesis 45:22</a>; <a href="/judges/14-12.htm">Judges 14:12</a>; <a href="/2_kings/5-22.htm">2 Kings 5:22</a>; <a href="/2_kings/10-22.htm">2 Kings 10:22</a>; but they are not very convincing. The Romans seem to have had such a custom, the robes being called "cenatoria." Thus Martial, 10:87, 11, writes - <p><span class="accented">"Pugnorum reus ebriaeque noctis,<br />Cenatoria mittat advocato."</span> But the fact remains that this guest had not presented himself in attire befitting the solemnity; in his everyday garb, and with no proper preparation, he had dared to come to this great festival. What is the spiritual meaning of the wedding garment is much disputed. It is evidently some virtue, or quality, or mark which conditions admission to the enjoyment of the kingdom of God. On the one hand, it is said that both bad and good guests wear it, and its possession does not alter the character of the wearer. Dress is something external and visible, therefore the garment cannot represent an inward grace or feeling, but some outward token by which Christians are distinguished, such as open reception of baptism and sacraments, and public profession of the faith. On the other hand, it is contended that the whole matter is spiritual, though veiled in material forms, and is concerned with man's moral and spiritual nature. Hence it by no means follows that the wedding garment is not intended to have a spiritual signification. Ancient commentators universally look upon it in this light. Some regard it as an emblem of faith in Christ; others, of faith and love combined. "Habete fidem cum dilectione," writes St. Augustine, 'Serm.,' 90, "ista est vestis nuptialis." But it must be observed that faith of some sort was shown by accepting the invitation; so this could not be represented by the special garb which was absent. Others, again, see in it good works, or humility, or the purity effected by the grace of the Holy Spirit. Some moderns take it of "imputed," others of imparted, righteousness, bringing their controversies into the King's presence. chamber. The English Church, taking the marriage feast as a figure of the Holy Communion, applies the wedding garment to that cleansing of the conscience which enables persons to come holy and clean to that heavenly feast (see the first Exhortation to Holy Communion). This is legitimate, but too restricted in its reference. The feast denotes the present and future kingdom of God; the entrance to this is a matter of free grace; the garment is moral fitness, the life and conduct dependent on the due use of God's grace. This is in the power of all who have received the call; they have to act up to the high calling, to be wholly, heartily, really what they profess to be. The scrutiny, whether made in this life or in the life to come, shows how grace has been used, if we have put on Christ, if we have kept our soul pure and white, unsullied by sin, or washed clean by penitential tears and the blood of Christ (see <a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>). The metaphor concerning this robe of righteousness is found in <a href="/isaiah/61-10.htm">Isaiah 61:10</a>, "He hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with a garland, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels."
