It emphasizes His role as the ultimate interpreter of God's will, surpassing the authority of the scribes and Pharisees. This introduction sets the stage for a deeper moral and spiritual insight into the Law.<p><b>that anyone who looks at a woman</b><br>The focus here is on the act of looking, which in the cultural context of the time, was often associated with intent and desire. In a patriarchal society, women were frequently viewed as objects of desire, and Jesus challenges this perception by addressing the internal motivations of the heart. This phrase underscores the importance of purity in thought, not just in action.<p><b>to lust after her</b><br>Lust is a strong desire or craving, often associated with sexual desire. In biblical terms, it is considered a sin because it objectifies individuals and deviates from God's design for human relationships. This phrase highlights the internalization of sin, where the mere intention or desire is equated with the act itself. It connects to the Tenth Commandment, which warns against coveting, and emphasizes the need for self-control and purity.<p><b>has already committed adultery</b><br>Adultery, in biblical law, was a serious offense, punishable by death (<a href="/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>). By equating lustful intent with the act of adultery, Jesus elevates the standard of righteousness, focusing on the heart's condition rather than just outward actions. This teaching aligns with the prophetic call for a new heart and spirit (<a href="/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>).<p><b>with her in his heart</b><br>The heart, in biblical terms, is the center of thought, emotion, and will. Jesus' teaching here emphasizes that sin originates from within, not just from external actions. This internal focus is consistent with the broader biblical narrative that God desires truth in the inward being (<a href="/psalms/51-6.htm">Psalm 51:6</a>) and that transformation begins with the renewal of the mind (<a href="/romans/12-2.htm">Romans 12:2</a>).

It is not the passing glance, not even the momentary impulse of desire, but the continued gaze by which the impulse is deliberately cherished till it becomes a passion. This noble and beautiful teaching, it has often been remarked, and by way of disparagement, is found elsewhere. Such disparagement is out of place. By the mercy of God the Light that "lighteth every man" has led men to recognise the truth thus asserted, and parallels to it may be found in the writings of Conlucius, Seneca, Epictetus, and even of the Jewish Rabbis themselves. The words of Juvenal closely express the general sentiment:--<p>" Scelus intra se tacitus qui cogitat ullum,<p>Facti crimen habet."<p>["Who in his breast a guilty thought doth cherish,<p>He bears the guilt of action."]<p>Our Lord's words speak primarily of <span class= "ital">"</span>adultery," but are, of course, applicable to every form of sensual impurity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I say</span> (ver. 22, note). The bare command forbidding an external action is insufficient. It must extend to the thought. Contrast Josephus ('Ant.,' 12:09. 1), "The purposing to do a thing, without actually doing it, is not worthy of punishment." Generally, however, the sinfulness of wrong thoughts must have been acknowledged (cf. <a href="/psalms/51-10.htm">Psalm 51:10</a>, and the tenth commandment; cf. late examples in Schott-gen). Hammond ('Pr. Cat.,' in Ford) says, "In the Law, the fastening of the eyes on an idol, considering the beauty of it, saith Maimonides, is forbidden (<a href="/leviticus/19-4.htm">Leviticus 19:4</a>), and not only the worship of it" (<span class="accented">vide</span> Maimonides, 'Hilk. Ab.

As <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;</span> with the infinitive (<span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1</a>), primarily denotes purpose; this may be equivalent to "looketh in order that he may lust, looketh to stimulate his lust" (cf.

Hence Nosgen <span class="accented">suggests</span> "<span class="accented">looketh</span>... lustfully" (cf. <a href="/james/4-5.htm">James 4:5</a>). Probably this is one of those cases where, as Ellicott says on <a href="/1_corinthians/9-18.htm">1 Corinthians 9:18</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;</span> with the infinitive has "<span class="accented">a</span> shade of meaning that seems to lie between <span class="accented">purpose</span> and <span class="accented">result</span>, and even sometimes to approximate to the latter." At all events, it does not express, as <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;</span> would have expressed, the <span class="accented">immediate</span> purpose of the look (<span class="accented">vide</span> Ellicott, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>); cf. <a href="/matthew/6-1.htm">Matthew 6:1</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Her</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, B, D, etc.); accusative with <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, here only in the New Testament.
