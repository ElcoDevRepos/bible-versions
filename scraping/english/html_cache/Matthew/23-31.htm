By saying they "testify against themselves," He highlights their acknowledgment of their spiritual lineage and actions. This self-incrimination is significant because it reveals their awareness of their connection to past transgressions against God's messengers. The concept of self-testimony is crucial in Jewish law, where a person's own words can be used as evidence against them. This phrase underscores the leaders' hypocrisy, as they claim to honor the prophets while embodying the same rebellious spirit that led to the prophets' persecution.<p><b>that you are the sons</b><br>The term "sons" here is not merely biological but also spiritual and ideological. In biblical terms, being a "son" often implies sharing in the character or actions of one's ancestors. This phrase connects the religious leaders to a legacy of opposition to God's will, as seen in the history of Israel. The use of "sons" also reflects the biblical theme of generational sin and the perpetuation of certain behaviors and attitudes. This connection is seen in passages like <a href="/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, where God speaks of visiting "the iniquity of the fathers on the children."<p><b>of those who murdered the prophets</b><br>This phrase directly accuses the religious leaders of being aligned with their forefathers who killed God's prophets. Throughout the Old Testament, prophets were often rejected and persecuted for delivering God's messages, as seen in the stories of Elijah, Jeremiah, and Zechariah. The historical context here is crucial, as it reflects a pattern of resistance to divine correction and guidance. Jesus' accusation is a prophetic indictment, aligning with His role as the ultimate prophet who would also be rejected and crucified. This phrase also foreshadows the leaders' role in His impending death, drawing a parallel between their ancestors' actions and their own.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, addressing the scribes and Pharisees in Jerusalem.
