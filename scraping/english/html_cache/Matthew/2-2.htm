The title "King of the Jews" is significant as it acknowledges Jesus' royal lineage through David, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as those found in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a> and <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a>. The Magi's question implies that they were aware of Jewish messianic expectations, possibly through Jewish communities in the East or through ancient prophecies like those of Balaam in <a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>, which speaks of a star rising out of Jacob.<p><b>We saw His star in the east</b><br>The mention of "His star" suggests a celestial event that signified the birth of Jesus. This star is often linked to the prophecy in <a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>. The phrase "in the east" indicates the Magi's origin, likely from regions such as Persia or Babylon, where astrology was a respected science. The star's appearance could have been a supernatural event or a natural astronomical phenomenon, such as a conjunction of planets or a comet, which the Magi interpreted as a sign of the Jewish Messiah's birth.<p><b>and have come to worship Him.&#8221;</b><br>The Magi's intent to worship signifies recognition of Jesus' divine nature and kingship. Worship in this context goes beyond mere homage to a king; it implies reverence and adoration reserved for deity. This act of worship by Gentiles foreshadows the inclusion of all nations in the salvation plan, as seen in prophecies like <a href="/isaiah/60-3.htm">Isaiah 60:3</a>, which speaks of nations coming to the light of Israel. The Magi's journey and worship highlight the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham that all nations would be blessed through his seed (<a href="/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/magi.htm">Magi (Wise Men)</a></b><br>These were learned men from the East, likely Persia or Babylon, who studied the stars and were knowledgeable in various sciences and possibly ancient prophecies.

The King has not been appointed by human vote or military might; He has entered history through a real, physical birth, underscoring the incarnation truth found in <a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>: &#8220;The Word became flesh and dwelt among us.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>King of the Jews?</b><p>The title signals both royalty and Messiahship. <a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6-7</a> declares the LORD&#8217;s installation of His King, while <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a> pledges David an everlasting throne. By calling the infant &#8220;King,&#8221; the Magi affirm Jesus&#8217; rightful sovereignty at the very start of His earthly life&#8212;foreshadowing the sign over the cross, &#8220;THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/27-37.htm">Matthew 27:37</a>), and anticipating <a href="/revelation/19-16.htm">Revelation 19:16</a> where He is &#8220;King of kings.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>We saw His star in the east</b><p>God uses a celestial sign to draw Gentile seekers, fulfilling <a href="/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>, &#8220;A star will come forth from Jacob.&#8221; The star is His star&#8212;divinely appointed, not astrology&#8217;s randomness.

The verse assures us that Scripture&#8217;s prophecies come to pass exactly as spoken, that Christ&#8217;s kingship is established from birth, and that all who earnestly seek Him&#8212;near or far&#8212;will find Him worthy of wholehearted adoration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/2.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(2) <span class= "bld">Where is he . . .?</span>--The Magi express here the feeling which the Roman historians, Tacitus and Suetonius, tell us sixty or seventy years later had been for a long time very widely diffused. Everywhere throughout the East men were looking for the advent of a great king who was to rise from among the Jews. The expectation partly rested on such Messianic prophecies of Isaiah as Isaiah 9, 11, partly on the later predictions of Daniel 7. It had fermented in the minds of men, heathens as well as Jews, and would have led them to welcome Jesus as the Christ had He come in accordance with their expectations. As it was, He came precisely as they did <span class= "ital">not</span> expect Him, shattering their earthly hopes to pieces, and so they did not receive Him.<p><span class= "bld">We have seen his star in the east.</span>--Here again we enter on questions which we cannot answer. Was the star (as Kepler conjectured) natural--the conjuncture of the planets Jupiter and Saturn appearing as a single star of special brightness--or supernatural; visible to all beholders, or to the Magi only? Astronomy is against the first view, by showing that the planets at their nearest were divided by the apparent diameter of the moon. The last hypothesis introduces a fresh miracle without a shadow of authority from Scripture. We must be content to remain in ignorance. We know too little of the astrology of that period to determine what star might or might not seem to those who watched the heavens as the precursor of a great king. Any star (as <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> that which was connected with the birth of Caesar) might, under given rules of art, acquire a new significance. Stories, not necessarily legends, of the appearances of such stars gathered round the births of Alexander the Great and Mithridates as well as Caesar. The language of Balaam as to "the Star that was to rise out of Jacob" (<a href="/numbers/24-17.htm" title="I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.">Numbers 24:17</a>) implied the existence of such an association of thoughts then, and tended to perpetuate it. As late as the reign of Hadrian, the rebel chief who headed the insurrection of the Jews took the name of Bar-cochab, the "Son of a Star." Without building too much on uncertain <span class= "ital">data,</span> we may, however, at least believe that the "wise men" were Gentiles. They do not ask for "<span class= "ital">our</span> king," but for the king of the Jews; and yet, though Gentiles, they were sharers in the Messianic hopes of the Jews. They came to worship, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to do homage, as subjects of the new-born King. They were watchers of the signs of the heavens, and when they saw what they interpreted as the sign that the King had come, they undertook a four months' journey (if they came from Babylon, <a href="/ezra/7-9.htm" title="For on the first day of the first month began he to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God on him.">Ezra 7:9</a>; more, if they came from Persia), partly, perhaps, led by the position of the star (though this is not stated), partly naturally making their way to Jerusalem, as certain to hear there some tidings of the Jewish King.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Saying</span>. The inquiry was on their lips at the moment of their appearance. <span class="cmt_word">Where is?</span> Not "whether there is." The Magi show no signs of doubt. <span class="cmt_word">He that is born King of the Jews</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> he that is born to be King of the Jews. Whether he <span class="accented">is</span> king from the very moment of his birth is not stated. The rendering of the Revised Version margin, "Where is the King of the Jews that is born?" would imply this. With either form the bystanders could hardly help contrasting him with their then ruler, who had acquired the kingship after years of conflict, and who was of foreign extraction. <span class="accented">King of the Jews.</span> Notice: <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> This was, perhaps, Herod's exact title (ver. 1, note). <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> They do not say king of the world.
