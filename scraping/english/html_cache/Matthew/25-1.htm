Jesus anchors the story in the certainty of His return, urges every listener to genuine, Spirit-filled readiness, and reminds us that the kingdom of heaven rewards watchful hearts more than outward show.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/25.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>XXV.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">Then shall the kingdom of heaven</span> <span class= "bld">. . .</span>--The three parables of this chapter appear here as in closest sequence to the great discourse of Matthew 24, and are as its natural conclusion. On the other hand, no trace of such parables being then spoken appears either in St. Mark or St. Luke, and their absence is at least a phenomenon that calls for explanation. That which seems most probable is that the strictly apocalyptic part of the discourse was, as the destruction of Jerusalem drew near, frequently impressed by oral teaching on the minds of disciples, and then reproduced in writing, with the diversities of detail incidental to such a process, as a document complete in itself, while it was reserved for St. Matthew--here as elsewhere, eager in collecting parables--to add the teaching that actually followed it. The parables have a common aim, as impressing on the disciples the necessity at once of watchfulness and of activity in good, but each has, it will be seen, a very distinct scope of its own.<p><span class= "bld">Be likened unto ten virgins.</span>--On the general meaning of the symbolism of the Wedding Feast enough has been said in the Notes on <a href="/matthew/22-2.htm" title="The kingdom of heaven is like to a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,">Matthew 22:2</a>. Here, as there, we have to remember, that while the bride is the Church in her collective unity, the contrasted characters of the members of the Church are represented here by the virgins, as there by the guests who were invited; and for this reason, probably, the bride herself is not introduced as part of the imagery of the parable. As far as the frame-work of the figure is concerned, the stage in the marriage rites which is brought before us is the return of the bridegroom, after the espousals have been completed in the house of the bride's father, to his own abode, bringing the bride with him. Jewish custom required the bridesmaids to wait at the bridegroom's house, to receive him and the bride, and as this was commonly after sunset, they were provided with lamps or torches.<p><span class= "bld">Which took their lamps.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">torches,</span> as the word is rendered in <a href="/john/18-3.htm" title="Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, comes thither with lanterns and torches and weapons.">John 18:3</a>. These were of tow, steeped in oil and fastened to the end of sticks.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/25.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-13.</span> - <span class="accented">Parable of the ten virgins.</span> (Peculiar to St. Matthew.) This parable, as a continuation of the teaching of the last chapter, sets forth the necessity of having and retaining grace unto the end, in order to be able to welcome the advent of Christ. The duty of watchfulness and preparation for the great day is, of course, implied and set forth (ver. 13); but the point is that the oil of God's grace alone enables the soul to meet the bridegroom joyfully, without dismay. The usual marriage customs of the Jews are well known. On the appointed day, the bridegroom, accompanied by his friends, proceeded to the bride's house, and thence escorted her, with her attendant maidens and friends, to his own or his parents' home. In the parable, however, the proceedings are somewhat different. Here the bridegroom is not in the town, but somewhere at a distance, so that, though the day is settled, the exact hour of his arrival is uncertain. He will come in the course of the night, and the virgins who are to meet him have assembled in the house where the wedding is to take place. They wait for the smnmons to go forth and meet the bridegroom and conduct him to the bridal place; and when the signal is given that he is approaching, they set forth on the road, each bearing her lamp (Edersheim). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>. The time refers to the hour of the Lord's advent (<a href="/matthew/24-50.htm">Matthew 24:50, 51</a>), and the parousia of the Son of man (<a href="/matthew/24-36.htm">Matthew 24:36</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Shall the kingdom of heaven be likened.</span> At the time named something analogous to the coming story shall happen in the Church, in the gospel dispensation. <span class="cmt_word">Ten virgins.</span> Ten is the number of perfection; such a number of persons was required to form a synagogue, and to be present at any office, ceremony, or formal benediction. Talmudic authorities affirm that the lamps used in bridal processions were usually ten. The "virgins" here are the friends of the bride, who are arranged to sally forth to meet the bridegroom as soon as his approach is signalled. "The Church, in her aggregate and ideal unity, is the bride; the members of the Church, as individually called, are guests; in their separation from the world, and expectation of the Lord's coming, they are his virgins" (Lange). The bride herself is not named in the parable, as she is not needed for illustration, and the virgins occupy her place. These virgins represent believers divided into two sections; evidently they are all supposed to hold the true faith, and to be pure and undefiled followers of the Lord (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/14-4.htm">Revelation 14:4</a>), to be waiting for his coming, and to love his appearing; but some fail for lack of grace or of perseverance, as is shown further on. <span class="cmt_word">Their lamps</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, better <span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">their own lamps</span>). They all made separate and personal, independent preparation for the meeting. These lamps (for they were not torches) were, as Dr. Edersheim notes, hollow cups or saucers, with a round receptacle for the wick, which was fed with pitch or oil.
