The context is a series of parables in <a href="/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13</a>, where Jesus uses stories to reveal truths about God's kingdom. This method of teaching was common in Jewish tradition, allowing listeners to engage with spiritual truths through familiar scenarios.<p><b>For this reason</b><br>This phrase connects the statement to the preceding parables, suggesting that the understanding of the kingdom of heaven requires a new perspective. Jesus is emphasizing the importance of comprehending the mysteries of the kingdom, which He has been revealing through parables.<p><b>every scribe who has been discipled in the kingdom of heaven</b><br>Here, "scribe" refers to a teacher or expert in the Jewish law. In the context of the New Testament, it implies someone who is knowledgeable in the Scriptures. Being "discipled in the kingdom of heaven" suggests a transformation from merely knowing the law to understanding and living by the principles of God's kingdom. This transformation is akin to the new covenant prophesied in <a href="/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31-34</a>, where God's law is written on the hearts of His people.<p><b>is like a homeowner</b><br>The homeowner represents someone with authority and responsibility over their household. In biblical times, a homeowner would be responsible for the well-being and provision of their family and servants. This analogy implies that those who understand the kingdom of heaven have a responsibility to share and manage the spiritual truths they have received.<p><b>who brings out of his storeroom</b><br>The storeroom symbolizes a place of abundance and preparation. In ancient times, storerooms were essential for storing food and goods, ensuring the household's survival and prosperity. Spiritually, this represents the wealth of knowledge and wisdom that a disciple of the kingdom possesses.<p><b>new treasures as well as old</b><br>This phrase highlights the value of both new and old teachings. The "new treasures" can be seen as the new revelations and understandings brought by Jesus' teachings, while the "old" refers to the established truths of the Old Testament. This balance underscores the continuity and fulfillment of the Old Testament in the New Testament, as seen in <a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>, where Jesus states He came not to abolish the law but to fulfill it. The integration of both old and new treasures reflects the comprehensive nature of God's revelation through Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this parable, Jesus is teaching His disciples about the kingdom of heaven through parables.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/s/scribes.htm">Scribes</a></b><br>In the context of this verse, scribes are those who are learned in the Scriptures and have been instructed in the ways of the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, representing those who are learning and growing in their understanding of God's kingdom.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/k/kingdom_of_heaven.htm">Kingdom of Heaven</a></b><br>A central theme in Jesus' teachings, representing God's reign and rule, both present and future.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/homeowner.htm">Homeowner</a></b><br>A metaphor for a person who is responsible for managing and sharing the treasures of knowledge and wisdom from God's Word.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_the_role_of_a_scribe.htm">Understanding the Role of a Scribe</a></b><br>A scribe in the kingdom of heaven is not just a keeper of old traditions but is also open to new revelations and insights from God&#8217;s Word.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/b/balancing_old_and_new.htm">Balancing Old and New</a></b><br>Believers are called to appreciate the richness of the Old Testament while embracing the new covenant teachings of Jesus.

By saying, &#8220;Then He told them,&#8221; the Lord is personally tying this closing word to everything He has just taught. He isn&#8217;t tossing in an afterthought; He is sealing the lesson. Much like the way He concluded the Sermon on the Mount with the wise and foolish builders (<a href="/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>), He now caps the parable section with an illustration aimed at the disciples&#8217; responsibility to teach and live what they&#8217;ve received (cf. <a href="/mark/4-33.htm">Mark 4:33-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For this reason</b><p>The phrase points back to the disciples&#8217; acknowledgment that they understand His teaching (<a href="/matthew/13-51.htm">Matthew 13:51</a>). Because they grasp these kingdom truths, they are now accountable. James will echo the same idea later: &#8220;Be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>). Understanding is never an end in itself; it calls for stewardship.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>every scribe</b><p>In Jesus&#8217; day, scribes were experts in the Law (<a href="/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>). Here the Lord envisions a scribe who has accepted Him and His kingdom message&#8212;very different from the hostile scribes in <a href="/matthew/12-38.htm">Matthew 12:38</a>. Rather than limiting the role to the first-century professional class, the word paints a picture of anyone entrusted with the Scriptures. Paul will later apply the idea broadly: &#8220;Consider us servants of Christ and stewards of God&#8217;s mysteries&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who has been discipled in the kingdom of heaven</b><p>This scribe is not self-made; he has been &#8220;discipled,&#8221; literally trained as a learner under Jesus&#8217; reign. The Great Commission spells it out clearly: &#8220;make disciples of all nations&#8230; teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>). The kingdom shapes both the content and the character of the disciple. Like Timothy, who learned the sacred writings from childhood and then from Paul (<a href="/2_timothy/3-14.htm">2 Timothy 3:14-15</a>), he submits his life to the King.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>is like a homeowner</b><p>A homeowner (oikodesp&#243;t&#275;s) possesses authority over his household. The picture recalls <a href="/proverbs/24-3.htm">Proverbs 24:3-4</a>: &#8220;By wisdom a house is built&#8230; and by knowledge its rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant riches.&#8221; The discipled scribe is no mere renter of truth; he manages God&#8217;s property and answers to the Owner, as Jesus illustrates in the parable of the talents (<a href="/matthew/25-14.htm">Matthew 25:14-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who brings out of his storeroom</b><p>The storeroom is a treasure chest of divine revelation. Bringing items out implies intentional sharing, not hoarding. Jesus earlier warned, &#8220;No one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/5-15.htm">Matthew 5:15</a>). The discipled scribe opens the doors wide, illuminating others with what God has entrusted to him (cf. <a href="/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>new treasures as well as old</b><p>Old treasures: the rich heritage of the Law, Psalms, and Prophets&#8212;unchanging truths fulfilled in Christ (<a href="/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17-18</a>).<p>New treasures: the fresh insights of the kingdom parables, the revelation of Messiah&#8217;s person and work, mysteries &#8220;kept secret for long ages but now revealed&#8221; (<a href="/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25-26</a>).<p>Both are vital. Jesus rebuked leaders who clung only to tradition (<a href="/matthew/15-3.htm">Matthew 15:3</a>) and others who craved novelty without roots (<a href="/2_timothy/4-3.htm">2 Timothy 4:3-4</a>). A balanced steward offers the whole counsel of God (<a href="/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a>), weaving the promise with the fulfillment, the shadow with the substance (<a href="/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/13-52.htm">Matthew 13:52</a> pictures a disciple-scribe who has welcomed the King&#8217;s rule, mastered the Scriptures old and new, and faithfully distributes those riches to others. Understanding Christ&#8217;s parables is not the finish line; it is the starting block for a life of informed, generous stewardship&#8212;drawing from the entire storehouse of God&#8217;s word so that every listener meets the timeless and the timely truth of the kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(52) <span class= "bld">Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven.</span>--The verse is interesting as one of the very few passages in which our Lord compares His own work and that of the Apostles after Him to that of the scribes of the Jewish schools. That He was so regarded during His ministry--that men thought of Him as a Rabbi, no less than as a Prophet, or as the Christ--is clear from the facts that He was called by that name (or its equivalent, Master, or Teacher) both by His disciples and by others; that He assumed the office of a scribe, as interpreting the scriptures in the Sabbath services (<a href="/luke/4-16.htm" title="And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read.">Luke 4:16</a>); that He questioned with the scribes after their own manner ("Have ye never read?" <a href="/matthew/12-3.htm" title="But he said to them, Have you not read what David did, when he was an hungered, and they that were with him;">Matthew 12:3</a>; <a href="/matthew/19-4.htm" title="And he answered and said to them, Have you not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,">Matthew 19:4</a>; <a href="/matthew/21-16.htm" title="And said to him, Hear you what these say? And Jesus said to them, Yes; have you never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have perfected praise?">Matthew 21:16</a>, <span class= "ital">et al.</span>) and as one of their order. And now He was training the disciples, "unlearned" as they were, to be His successors in that office. They too were sitting at the feet of a Gamaliel--of One greater than Gamaliel. But His method of training was altogether of another kind than that of the Masters of the Schools. It consisted, not in minute comments on the words of the Law, not in the subtleties of an intricate and often revolting casuistry, not in puerile and fantastic legends, but rather in the eternal laws of His Father's kingdom, and the manifold parables of those laws in the visible universe; in this way it was that He was educating them to be scribes of the kingdom of heaven.<p><span class= "bld">Things new and old.</span>--Our Lord's own teaching was, of course, the highest example of this union. There were the old eternal laws of righteousness, the proclamation of the true meaning of all that every true teacher had included in the idea of duty and religion, but there were also new truths, such as His own mission as the Head of the divine kingdom and the future Judge of all men, and the work of the Spirit as regenerating and sanctifying. As the years passed, and new facts, such as the Crucifixion, Resurrection, and Ascension, supplied the ground-work for new doctrines, these also took their place in the store-house of the well-instructed scribe. But the words applied also to the manner no less than to the substance of the teaching. Now the old familiar words of Lawgiver and Psalmist, now the gracious words such as man had never heard till then, now illustrations freely drawn, in proverbs or parable, from the world of nature or of men--these too were part of the treasure of the scribe. In that union the scribe of later times, every true teacher of the minds and hearts of men, may find the secret at once of reverence for the past and of courage for the future. So long as they bring forth out of their treasures "things new and old," we may hope that religious conservatism will be more than the "froward retention" of a custom or a formula, and religious progress more than a reckless love of novelty for the sake of its newness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 52.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then said he unto them, Therefore</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> because you understand, I add this. <span class="cmt_word">Every scribe</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>). The interpretation of the following clause, naturally suggested by this word in itself is that our Lord meant to indicate the possibilities that lay before a Jewish scribe if he were only converted; but for such a reference by our Lord to Jewish scribes there appears no reason in the context. The word must therefore be understood of Christian teachers, who by their study of the Gospel should hold a position in the Christian Church parallel to that of scribes among the Jews. It is possible that our Lord chose the term in order to accustom his disciples to the idea of carrying on the study of Divine things which the scribes were accustomed to make. Even if the disciples were not to follow their methods they might well imitate their devotion Dean Plumptre has an interesting note on our Lord's comparison of his own work and that of the apostles after him, to the work of the scribes of the Jewish schools. In <a href="/matthew/23-34.htm">Matthew 23:34</a> is found a wider application of the term than usual, hardly referring, however, to Christians, but rather to the Jewish scribes in their ideal character. <span class="cmt_word">Which is instructed</span>; <span class="accented">who hath been made a disciple</span> (Revised Version, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>). Though the correction is right (cf. <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19</a>), the word, nevertheless, implies much more than mere admission to the circle of disciples it includes also the thought of instruction having been really received. <span class="cmt_word">Unto</span> (<span class="accented">to</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">the kingdom of</span> <span class="cmt_word">heaven</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, dative of reference; cf. Winer, &sect; 31:4). The kingdom is not regarded as the teacher, but as the school, with reference to which discipleship is entered upon. <span class="cmt_word">Is like.</span> In the preceding parables the general principles, etc., of the kingdom of heaven have been compared; here, only certain individuals belonging to it. <span class="cmt_word">Unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure</span> (cf. <a href="/matthew/2-11.htm">Matthew 2:11</a>, note). The thing signified is his experience and spiritual understanding. Ch. 12:35 has a similar thought, but the treasure there is rather his personality as affecting his life; here, as affecting his intellect. It is curious that the thought of <a href="/matthew/12-33.htm">Matthew 12:33, 34</a> should also resemble our vers. 47-50. <span class="cmt_word">Things new and old.</span> The thought of the saying is that as a householder brings out from his stores food recently and long ago acquired (cf. <a href="/songs/7-13.htm">Song of Solomon 7:13</a>), so a Christian "scribe" brings out (primarily, if not solely, for the use of others) the new truths that he learns, and also old ones that he has long since known. It is thus a promise that the disciples shall (if they use their opportunities rightly) be able to do more than understand Christ's teaching (as they have just claimed to have done); for they shall be able to teach (not merely to learn), and that not only new truths, but also old ones; they shall be able, that is to say, to understand the relation of the old to the new, and to bring out even the old in its true meaning, Hence <span class="accented">old</span> is mentioned after <span class="accented">new</span>, for it implies greater knowledge and skill. It will be observed that Irenaeus' interpretation (IV. 9:1) of <span class="accented">new and old</span> as the New and Old Testaments is only partially right. With the disciples, it is true, the <span class="accented">old</span> would naturally be, in the first place, Old Testament truths, and the <span class="accented">new</span>, such truths as they learned from Christ; but these also would, after a few weeks or months, in their turn become old to them, and the fresh truths taught them as their life went on would be ever the new ones. The thought of <a href="/1_john/2-7.htm">1 John 2:7, 8</a> is very similar. Weiss' interpretation is different and even less right. According to him, <span class="accented">new</span> represents the truths about the kingdom of God, and <span class="accented">old</span> the long known arrangements of nature and human life, which, as the parables show, are drawn up on the same hues.
