The mountain is traditionally identified as Mount Tabor or Mount Hermon. The event signifies a pivotal moment in Jesus' ministry, revealing His divine glory. The mountain setting is significant in biblical narratives, often associated with divine encounters, such as Moses receiving the Law on Mount Sinai.<p><b>Jesus commanded them</b><br>Jesus' command underscores His authority and the importance of timing in revealing His identity and mission. Throughout the Gospels, Jesus often instructs His disciples with specific commands, emphasizing obedience and the unfolding of God's plan according to divine timing.<p><b>Do not tell anyone about this vision</b><br>The vision refers to the transfiguration, where Jesus' divine nature was revealed. The instruction to keep it secret highlights the concept of the "Messianic Secret," where Jesus often instructed His followers not to disclose His identity prematurely. This was to prevent misunderstandings about His mission as a political Messiah and to ensure that His path to the cross was not hindered.<p><b>until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead</b><br>The title "Son of Man" is a messianic term rooted in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, emphasizing both Jesus' humanity and His divine authority. The reference to being "raised from the dead" foreshadows Jesus' resurrection, a cornerstone of Christian faith.

href="/matthew/17-1.htm">Matthew 17:1-8</a>), a literal unveiling of Jesus&#8217; divine glory witnessed by Peter, James, and John.<p>&#8226; Coming down signals a transition from revelation to obedience; the mountaintop moment must now shape everyday discipleship (cf. <a href="/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29-32</a>, where Moses descends after seeing God&#8217;s glory).<p>&#8226; Peter later affirms the historicity of this scene: &#8220;We were eyewitnesses of His majesty&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-16.htm">2 Peter 1:16-18</a>).<p>&#8226; The movement down the mountain reminds believers that extraordinary encounters are meant to fuel faithful service in ordinary life.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus commanded them</b><p>The Lord speaks with undisputed authority: &#8220;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>).<p>&#8226; His command deserves immediate compliance (<a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>).<p>&#8226; Like the prophet Moses foretold&#8212;&#8220;You must listen to Him&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>)&#8212;the disciples are to receive and obey without debate.<p>&#8226; This directive underscores that no vision, however glorious, is to be publicized apart from His timing.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Do not tell anyone about this vision</b><p>Jesus imposes purposeful silence.<p>&#8226; The crowd, still expecting a political Messiah, would misinterpret such glory (<a href="/matthew/16-20.htm">Matthew 16:20</a>; <a href="/mark/8-30.htm">Mark 8:30</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter, James, and John &#8220;kept silent and, in those days, told no one what they had seen&#8221; (<a href="/luke/9-36.htm">Luke 9:36</a>).<p>&#8226; The word &#8220;vision&#8221; does not lessen reality; it highlights that they saw a supernatural disclosure, much like Paul&#8217;s &#8220;visions and revelations of the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/12-1.htm">2 Corinthians 12:1-4</a>).<p>&#8226; Guarded testimony ensures the gospel unfolds according to divine schedule, not human enthusiasm.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>until the

suffering (<a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&#8221; (<a href="/john/2-19.htm">John 2:19-22</a>) underlines that His rising authenticates every claim.<p>&#8226; Post-resurrection preaching&#8212;see <a href="/acts/2-32.htm">Acts 2:32</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>&#8212;will hinge on eyewitness testimony, including this mountain scene, proving Jesus as the promised Redeemer.<p>&#8226; The title &#8220;Son of Man&#8221; echoes <a

17:9</a> teaches that the transfiguration was a real, glorious event meant to be concealed until the resurrection. Jesus exercises sovereign authority, guiding His followers in what to share and when to share it. By waiting for the risen Christ, the disciples would proclaim His glory with full understanding, placing the spotlight on the cross and empty tomb where redemption is secured and His majesty unmistakably confirmed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/17.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(9) <span class= "bld">Tell</span> <span class= "bld">the vision to no man.</span>--The command obviously included even the rest of the Apostles within the range of its prohibition. For them in their lower stage of spiritual growth, the report of the vision at second hand would either have led them to distrust it or to pervert its meaning. Whatever reasons excluded them from being spectators were of still greater weight for the time against their hearing of what had been seen from others. The Greek word for "vision," it may be noted, means simply "what they had seen," and does not suggest, as the English word does, the thought of a dream-state in the beholders.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">As they came down from the mountain</span>. The Transfiguration is supposed to have taken place at night, and the following conversation to have passed in the early morning of the next day. <span class="cmt_word">Tell the vision</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">what bad been seen</span>) <span class="cmt_word">to no man.</span> This was a strict and formal command. The chosen three were at present not to mention the occurrence to anyone, not even to their fellow disciples. Possibly these would hardly have believed the marvellous tale, and their unbelief would have hardened their heart; or, if they fully credited it, they might have been jealous of the preference shown to some of their company. At any rate, neither they nor others were prepared to receive the great lesson of the scene - that the old covenant had done its work, that the Law and the prophets were superseded and must make way for the new dispensation. Had the story been divulged to the people generally, they would have stumbled at the cross and Passion, which would seem no fitting sequel to this glory (see on Matthew 16:20). <span class="cmt_word">Until the Son of man be risen again</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">from the dead.</span> When this great event happened and was known to be the fact, there could be no doubt that Christ was God, and the tale of the Transfiguration would no longer be incredible. Thomas's confession, "My Lord and my God," would be echoed in the heart and conscience of all disciples. St. Luke, though he does not mention Christ's injunction, notifies that it was carefully observed, "They kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen." (These last words, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c9;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, explain what St. Matthew above calls "the vision," <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, the objective spectacle.) The compliance with the injunction shows that they understood something of the spiritual nature of the transaction. We may also note that the prohibition itself is presumptive evidence against the supposed mythical character of the vision. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/17-9.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">As</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Masculine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
