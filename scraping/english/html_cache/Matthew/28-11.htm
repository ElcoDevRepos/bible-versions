They were on their way to inform the disciples of the resurrection, as instructed by the angel. This highlights the role of women as the first witnesses to the resurrection, which is significant given the cultural context where women's testimonies were often undervalued. This moment underscores the transformative nature of the Gospel, where societal norms are upended.<p><b>some of the guards went into the city</b><br>The guards mentioned here were Roman soldiers assigned to watch over Jesus' tomb to prevent His body from being stolen, as the chief priests and Pharisees had feared. Their going into the city, likely Jerusalem, indicates a sense of urgency and the gravity of the situation, as they were responsible for the security of the tomb. The city, being the center of Jewish religious life, is significant as the place where the news of the resurrection would first spread.<p><b>and reported to the chief priests all that had happened</b><br>The guards' report to the chief priests is crucial, as it sets the stage for the religious leaders' response to the resurrection. The chief priests were part of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, and had been instrumental in orchestrating Jesus' crucifixion. Their receipt of the guards' report highlights the tension between the miraculous event of the resurrection and the religious leaders' attempts to suppress it. This moment fulfills Jesus' predictions of His resurrection and the opposition it would face, as seen in earlier Gospel accounts. The guards' testimony, despite their pagan background, inadvertently supports the truth of the resurrection, contrasting with the disbelief of the religious leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_women.htm">The Women</a></b><br>Refers to the women who visited Jesus' tomb and were the first to witness His resurrection.

<a href="/john/20-17.htm">John 20:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase establishes a simultaneous timeline: as authentic witnesses hurry to spread the good news, hostile forces move to suppress it.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>some of the guards went into the city</b><p>The guards had been posted by order of the chief priests and Pharisees to prevent any claim of resurrection (<a href="/matthew/27-62.htm">Matthew 27:62-66</a>).<p>&#8226; Verse 4 records that at the angel&#8217;s appearance &#8220;the guards trembled and became like dead men,&#8221; showing they fully experienced the supernatural event.<p>&#8226; Instead of fleeing home or reporting to Pilate, &#8220;some of the guards went into the city,&#8221;

As writing primarily for the Jews of Palestine, it was natural that he should take special notice of the rumour which hindered many of them from accepting the fact of the Resurrection, and trace it to its corrupt source. The object of the soldiers was, of course, to escape the penalty which they were likely to incur for seeming negligence, but their statement to the priests was at first a truthful one. They told "all the things that were done"--the earthquake, the opened and emptied sepulchre, perhaps also of the form in bright raiment that had filled them with speechless terror.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-15.</span> - <span class="accented">The Roman soldiers bribed by the Jewish rulers to give a false account of the Resurrection.</span> (Peculiar to St. Matthew.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When</span> (<span class="accented">while</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>they were going.</span> Into the city, in order to find the disciples and to deliver to them their Lord's message.

As soon as they recovered from their swoon and had assured themselves that the tomb was empty, the soldiers hurried in affright to the Jewish rulers, under whose orders they had temporarily been placed, and told them <span class="cmt_word">all the things that were done.</span> They could speak of the earthquake, of the appearing of the angel, of the removal of the stone, of the absence of the body which they were appointed to watch. Their task was done; the corpse was gone, they knew not how taken; they could not be expected to contend with supernatural visitants, or to guard against supernatural occurrences. St. Matthew seems to have introduced this incident in order to account for the prevalence of the lying rumour which he proceeds to mention, and which had been widely disseminated among his countrymen. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/28-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">While</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[the women]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aut&#333;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Genitive Feminine 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_846.htm">Strong's 846: </a> </span><span class="str2">He, she, it, they, them, same.
