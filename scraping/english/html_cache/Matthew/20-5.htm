In the context of the parable, it reflects the willingness of individuals to respond to God's call, similar to the disciples' immediate response to Jesus' invitation to follow Him (<a href="/matthew/4-19.htm">Matthew 4:19-20</a>). The act of going signifies faith and trust in the landowner's promise, paralleling the Christian's journey of faith.<p><b>He went out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour</b><br>The sixth hour corresponds to noon, and the ninth hour to 3 PM, according to Jewish timekeeping. This detail highlights the landowner's persistent search for workers throughout the day, symbolizing God's continual invitation to people at various stages of life. The repeated action emphasizes God's grace and the inclusivity of His kingdom, as seen in the parable of the Prodigal Son (<a href="/luke/15-11.htm">Luke 15:11-32</a>), where the father eagerly welcomes back his son at any time.<p><b>and did the same thing.</b><br>The landowner's consistent approach in hiring workers at different times of the day illustrates the unchanging nature of God's grace and His desire for all to come to Him, regardless of when they respond. This mirrors the message in <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, where God is patient, not wanting anyone to perish.
