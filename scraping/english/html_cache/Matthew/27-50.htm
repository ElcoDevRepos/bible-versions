The loud cry signifies both physical agony and a profound spiritual declaration. In the context of the crucifixion, this cry is a fulfillment of <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>, which begins with "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" This psalm is a prophetic depiction of the suffering Messiah. The loud voice also demonstrates Jesus' control over His own life and death, as He chooses the moment to release His spirit. Historically, crucifixion was designed to be a slow, torturous death, often resulting in victims dying from asphyxiation. Jesus' ability to cry out loudly at this point indicates His strength and the voluntary nature of His sacrifice.<p><b>He yielded up His spirit</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the voluntary nature of Jesus' death. Unlike other victims of crucifixion, Jesus actively surrenders His life, fulfilling His own words in <a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>, "No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord." The term "yielded" suggests a willing submission to the Father's will, completing His earthly mission. This act is the culmination of His obedience, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>, where the suffering servant "poured out his life unto death." Theologically, this moment signifies the completion of the atonement, as Jesus' death pays the penalty for sin, reconciling humanity with God. The yielding of His spirit also marks the transition from the Old Covenant to the New Covenant, as symbolized by the tearing of the temple veil immediately following His death (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>), granting believers direct access to God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of this passage, Jesus is the Son of God who is crucified for the sins of humanity.

Jesus remains fully aware and purposeful, fulfilling <a href="/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1 and 22</a>:24.<p>&#8226; Luke parallels the scene with &#8220;Father, forgive them&#8221; and &#8220;Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit&#8221; (<a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34, 46</a>). John records &#8220;It is finished&#8221; (<a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>). These combined cries form a tapestry of atonement, forgiveness, and completed redemption.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in a loud voice</b><p>&#8226; The volume matters. After hours of brutal suffering, a strong shout testifies that His life is not drained away by Roman power but offered willingly (<a href="/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/5-7.htm">Hebrews 5:7</a> reminds us He &#8220;offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears,&#8221; pointing to a Messiah who prays passionately and is heard because of His reverence.<p>&#8226; The loudness would draw every nearby ear, making the moment unmistakable for the centurion who soon confesses, &#8220;Truly this was the Son of God&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/27-54.htm">Matthew 27:54</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He yielded up</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Yielded&#8221; is voluntary language. Jesus is not a victim swept away by circumstance; He is the sovereign Savior laying down His life at the exact Passover hour the Father appointed (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a> adds, &#8220;He bowed His head and gave up His spirit,&#8221; echoing <a href="/isaiah/53-12.htm">Isaiah 53:12</a>&#8212;&#8220;He poured out His life unto death and was numbered with the transgressors.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The curtain of the temple will tear the very next verse (<a href="/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>), confirming His sacrifice is accepted and access to God is now open.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>His spirit</b><p>&#8226; Scripture differentiates between body and spirit. Jesus&#8217; body remains on the cross, but His spirit departs to the Father, guaranteeing conscious existence beyond death (<a href="/luke/23-46.htm">Luke 23:46</a>).<p>&#8226; Stephen later mirrors this confidence: &#8220;Lord Jesus, receive my spirit&#8221; (<a href="/acts/7-59.htm">Acts 7:59</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/ecclesiastes/12-7.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a> affirms, &#8220;the dust returns to the ground it came from, and the spirit returns to God who gave it,&#8221; underscoring that life truly belongs to the Creator, and Jesus demonstrates that reality perfectly.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/27-50.htm">Matthew 27:50</a> shows Jesus acting deliberately and powerfully in His final moments. He cries out once more&#8212;loud enough for all to hear&#8212;then voluntarily releases His spirit to the Father, proving His authority over life and death. The verse assures us that the cross was not a tragic accident but the triumphant fulfillment of God&#8217;s redemptive plan, opening the way for sinners to be reconciled to God through the finished work of Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(50) <span class= "bld">When he had cried again with a loud voice.</span>--It is well that we should remember what the words were which immediately preceded the last death cry; the "It is finished" of <a href="/john/19-30.htm" title="When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.">John 19:30</a>, the "Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit" of <a href="/luke/23-46.htm" title="And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.">Luke 23:46</a>, expressing as they did, the fulness of peace and trust, the sense of a completed work.<p>It was seldom that crucifixion, as a punishment, ended so rapidly as it did here, and those who have discussed, what is hardly perhaps a fit subject for discussion, the physical causes of our Lord's death, have ascribed it accordingly, especially in connection with the fact recorded in <a href="/john/19-34.htm" title="But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and immediately came there out blood and water.">John 19:34</a>, and with the "loud cry," indicating the pangs of an intolerable anguish, to a rupture of the vessels of the heart. Simple exhaustion as the consequence of the long vigil, the agony in the garden, the mocking and the scourging, would be, perhaps, almost as natural an explanation.<p><span class= "bld">Yielded up the ghost.</span>--Better, <span class= "ital">yielded up His spirit.</span> All four Evangelists agree in using this or some like expression, instead of the simpler form, "He died." It is as though they dwelt on the act as, in some sense, voluntary, and connected it with the words in which He had commended His spirit to the Father (<a href="/luke/23-46.htm" title="And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into your hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.">Luke 23:46</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 50.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When he had cried again.</span> He had cried aloud once before (ver. 46). But he does not repeat the former words; the horror of great darkness was past. Probably the cry here resolved itself into the words recorded by St. Luke, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit." <span class="cmt_word">With a loud voice.</span> This loud cry at the moment of death proved that he laid down his life voluntarily; no man could take it from him (<a href="/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17, 18</a>); he himself willed to die; and this preternatural voice proceeded from one who died not altogether from physical exhaustion, but from determined purpose. <span class="cmt_word">Yielded up the ghost</span> (<span class="greek_word">a)fh = ke to\ pneu = ma</span>); literally, <span class="accented">dismissed his spirit</span>; <span class="accented">emisit spiritum</span>). The phrase has been interpreted to signify that Christ exerted his power to anticipate the actual moment of dissolution; but there is no necessity of importing this idea into the expression. It is used ordinarily to denote the act of dying, as we say, "He expired." Perhaps the exertion of uttering this great cry ruptured some organ of the body. We know from the effect of the piercing of his side that his sacred heart was previously broken; and thus he verily and really died upon the cross. He, being in the form of God, and equal with God, became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, suffered death forevery man. It is to be noted that the death of Christ occurred at 3 p.m., the very time when the Paschal lambs began to be slain in the temple courts. Thus the long prepared type was at last fulfilled, when "Christ our Passover was sacrificed for us." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-50.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">had cried out</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#961;&#940;&#958;&#945;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(kraxas)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2896.htm">Strong's 2896: </a> </span><span class="str2">To cry aloud, shriek.
