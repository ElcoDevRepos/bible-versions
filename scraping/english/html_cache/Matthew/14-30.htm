The "strength of the wind" highlights the natural challenges faced by the disciples, emphasizing the reality of the situation. Biblically, wind often symbolizes chaos and trials (e.g., <a href="/job/1-19.htm">Job 1:19</a>, <a href="/jonah/1-4.htm">Jonah 1:4</a>). Peter's focus shifts from Jesus to the surrounding circumstances, illustrating a common human tendency to be overwhelmed by immediate challenges rather than maintaining faith.<p><b>he was afraid</b><br>Fear is a natural human response to danger, and Peter's fear reflects a momentary lapse in faith. Throughout Scripture, fear is often juxtaposed with faith (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>, <a href="/matthew/8-26.htm">Matthew 8:26</a>). This moment serves as a reminder of the importance of trust in God, even when circumstances seem dire. Peter's fear contrasts with Jesus' earlier command to "take courage" (<a href="/matthew/14-27.htm">Matthew 14:27</a>), highlighting the struggle between faith and doubt.<p><b>and, beginning to sink</b><br>Peter's sinking is both literal and metaphorical, representing the consequences of taking one's eyes off Jesus. The act of sinking symbolizes the loss of spiritual focus and the resulting vulnerability. This imagery is echoed in other biblical passages where individuals face peril when they stray from God's guidance (e.g., <a href="/jonah/2-3.htm">Jonah 2:3-6</a>). It serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of doubt and the need for steadfast faith.<p><b>cried out, &#8220;Lord, save me!&#8221;</b><br>Peter's cry is a direct appeal to Jesus, acknowledging his inability to save himself. This plea is a model of prayer and dependence on God, reflecting the essence of salvation&#8212;recognizing one's need for divine intervention. The phrase "Lord, save me" is a succinct expression of faith and trust in Jesus' power to deliver. It parallels other instances in Scripture where individuals call upon the Lord in times of distress (<a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>, <a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>).

The narrative is literal and historical, showing that the Lord truly rules over nature (<a href="/job/9-8.htm">Job 9:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/65-7.htm">Psalm 65:7</a>). Yet the moment Peter&#8217;s attention shifted from Christ to the whipping gusts, his confidence faltered. This illustrates how faith is maintained by keeping &#8220;our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a>). As soon as circumstances loom larger than the Savior, perspective distorts. We are reminded that &#8220;we walk by faith, not by sight&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-7.htm">2 Corinthians 5:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he was afraid</b><p>Fear rushed in where faith should have remained. Jesus had calmed a storm earlier with a word (<a href="/mark/4-39.htm">Mark 4:39-40</a>), proving His care and power, yet Peter allowed anxiety to override the memory of that miracle. God repeatedly commands, &#8220;Do not fear, for I am with you&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/41-10.htm">Isaiah 41:10</a>). When fear overwhelms, it exposes an inner calculation that devalues God&#8217;s presence and promises.<p>&#8226; Fear magnifies the problem; faith magnifies the Savior.<p>&#8226; Fear forgets past deliverances (<a href="/psalms/106-7.htm">Psalm 106:7</a>); faith rehearses them.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>beginning to sink</b><p>The physical sinking matches Peter&#8217;s spiritual slump. Fear&#8217;s fruit is swift decline: &#8220;Save me, O God, for the waters are up to my neck&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/69-1.htm">Psalm 69:1-2</a>). The downward motion is real, not symbolic&#8212;proving that unbelief has tangible consequences. Still, the Lord allows the descent only far enough to awaken dependence. Jonah felt a similar slide beneath the waves (<a href="/jonah/2-3.htm">Jonah 2:3-6</a>) before God lifted him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>cried out, &#8220;Lord, save me!&#8221;</b><p>Peter&#8217;s brief prayer contains urgency, clarity, and total reliance. <a href="/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a> promises, &#8220;Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.&#8221; <a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17</a> echoes, &#8220;The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears.&#8221; Instantly, &#8220;Jesus reached out His hand and took hold of Peter&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/14-31.htm">Matthew 14:31</a>). There was no lecture before rescue&#8212;grace moved first, then instruction followed (&#8220;O you of little faith&#8230;&#8221;).<p>&#8226; Salvation is always by grace through faith, never by self-effort.<p>&#8226; Even faltering faith, when directed to Jesus, secures His strong grasp.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/14-30.htm">Matthew 14:30</a> records a literal moment on Galilee&#8217;s waters that teaches every believer: keep your gaze on Christ, refuse fear&#8217;s grip, recognize the peril of drifting trust, and cry out to the only One who saves.
