The title "Son of Man" is a messianic term rooted in <a href="/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13-14</a>, where it describes a divine figure given authority and an everlasting kingdom. This return is a central tenet of Christian eschatology, emphasizing Jesus' role as both judge and redeemer.<p><b>in His Father&#8217;s glory</b><br>The glory of the Father signifies divine majesty and holiness. In biblical terms, "glory" often denotes the visible manifestation of God's presence.

It reflects the moral order established by God, where deeds are evaluated.<p><b>according to what he has done</b><br>This emphasizes personal responsibility and the moral implications of one's actions. It aligns with the biblical principle of sowing and reaping, as found in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7-8</a>.
