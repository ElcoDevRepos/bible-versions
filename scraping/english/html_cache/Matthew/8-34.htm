The town referred to is likely Gadara or Gerasa, part of the Decapolis, a group of ten cities with a strong Greco-Roman influence. The people&#8217;s reaction can be seen as a reflection of the cultural and religious tensions between Jewish and Gentile populations. The townspeople's decision to meet Jesus en masse suggests a mixture of curiosity, fear, and perhaps anger, as they had just witnessed the dramatic healing of two demon-possessed men and the subsequent loss of a herd of pigs. This event highlights the power and authority of Jesus over spiritual forces, a theme consistent throughout the Gospels.<p><b>And when they saw Him,</b><br>The act of seeing Jesus implies a direct encounter with His presence, which often elicited strong reactions from those who witnessed His miracles. In biblical narratives, seeing is often associated with understanding or revelation, yet here it leads to a rejection. This moment is pivotal, as it contrasts with other instances where seeing Jesus led to faith and worship. The townspeople's reaction can be compared to other biblical accounts where individuals or groups failed to recognize Jesus' divine authority and mission.<p><b>they begged Him to leave their region.</b><br>The request for Jesus to leave underscores the fear and misunderstanding of His power. The loss of the pigs, a significant economic resource, likely contributed to their fear and desire for Him to depart. This reaction can be seen as a rejection of the transformative power of Jesus, prioritizing material loss over spiritual gain. It also reflects a broader theme in the Gospels where Jesus is often rejected by those who do not understand His mission. This incident foreshadows the rejection Jesus would face from His own people, as prophesied in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as "despised and rejected by men." The townspeople's plea for Jesus to leave contrasts with the welcoming reception He receives in other regions, highlighting the varied responses to His ministry.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>Central figure in the passage, whose presence and actions have caused a significant reaction from the townspeople.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_whole_town.htm">The Whole Town</a></b><br>Represents the collective response of the people in the region who were affected by Jesus' miraculous works.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_region_of_the_gadarenes.htm">The Region of the Gadarenes</a></b><br>The geographical area where this event takes place, known for its Gentile population and the presence of swine herders.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_demoniacs.htm">The Demoniacs</a></b><br>Although not mentioned in this specific verse, the context involves Jesus healing two demon-possessed men, which led to the townspeople's reaction.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_swine.htm">The Swine</a></b><br>The herd of pigs that ran into the sea and perished, an event that precipitated the townspeople's plea for Jesus to leave.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cost_of_discipleship.htm">The Cost of Discipleship</a></b><br>Following Jesus may lead to societal rejection or discomfort, as seen in the townspeople's reaction.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/fear_of_change.htm">Fear of Change</a></b><br>The townspeople's plea for Jesus to leave highlights a fear of the unknown and a preference for the status quo, even when it means rejecting divine intervention.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/m/material_loss_vs._spiritual_gain.htm">Material Loss vs. Spiritual Gain</a></b><br>The loss of the swine represents a material cost that the townspeople were unwilling to bear for the spiritual healing of the demoniacs.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/recognizing_jesus'_authority.htm">Recognizing Jesus' Authority</a></b><br>Despite witnessing a miracle, the townspeople failed to recognize Jesus' divine authority, a reminder to be open to God's work in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_challenge_of_evangelism.htm">The Challenge of Evangelism</a></b><br>This passage underscores the challenge of sharing the Gospel in areas resistant to change or where economic interests are threatened.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_8_34_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 8:34?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_the_town_ask_Jesus_to_leave.htm">Why did the whole town plead with Jesus to leave their region?

St. Mark and St. Luke add, that they found the demoniac "clothed, and in his right mind, sitting at the feet of Jesus," in the clinging gratitude of faith. The narrative half suggests the thought that the garment which he now wore as the outward sign of a new self-reverence had been supplied by the pity of the disciples.<p><span class= "bld">Besought him that he would depart.</span>--It was characteristic of the wild, half-heathen population that they were led to look on the Prophet who had wrought so great a work as a Destroyer rather than a Saviour, and therefore shrank from His presence among them.

He followed Him to the boat, and as He was in the act of embarking (<a href="/mark/5-18.htm" title="And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.">Mark 5:18</a>), prayed that he might be with Him. But this was not the discipline which was needed for his spiritual health. Retirement, renewed fellowship with his kindred in his own house, the quiet witness borne there that the Lord had had compassion on him--this was better for him than the work of a more avowed discipleship. And so he went his way "proclaiming," or "preaching," what Jesus had done for him--a true evangelist to a people whose panic terror showed that they were as yet in darkness and the shadow of death.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, behold</span>.
