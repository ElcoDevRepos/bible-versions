Jesus often used such moments to instruct His disciples, preparing them for future ministry. The act of calling them to Him suggests a deliberate intention to impart wisdom or perform a significant act. This reflects the rabbinic tradition where a teacher would gather his students to convey important lessons.<p><b>&#8220;I have compassion for this crowd,</b><br>Jesus' compassion is a recurring theme in the Gospels, highlighting His divine empathy and love for humanity. This compassion is not just emotional but leads to action, demonstrating the heart of God towards His creation. The Greek word for compassion here implies a deep, visceral feeling, showing the intensity of Jesus' concern.<p><b>because they have already been with Me three days</b><br>The mention of three days signifies a period of complete devotion and interest from the crowd, who prioritized spiritual nourishment over physical needs. This mirrors the three days Jesus spent in the tomb, symbolizing a period of waiting and anticipation before a miraculous event. It also reflects the dedication of the people to follow Jesus despite the lack of resources.<p><b>and have nothing to eat.</b><br>This highlights the physical needs of the crowd, emphasizing the human aspect of Jesus' ministry. It shows that while spiritual teaching is paramount, Jesus also cares for the physical well-being of His followers. This dual concern for both spiritual and physical needs is a model for holistic ministry.<p><b>I do not want to send them away hungry,</b><br>Jesus' reluctance to send the crowd away hungry underscores His understanding of human frailty and His desire to provide. This reflects the biblical principle of God as a provider, seen throughout Scripture, such as in the provision of manna in the wilderness (Exodus 16).<p><b>or they may faint along the way.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates Jesus' foresight and care for the journey ahead, both physically and spiritually. It suggests that without divine intervention, the people would be unable to sustain themselves. This can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual sustenance, where Jesus provides what is necessary for the journey of faith, echoing His role as the Bread of Life (<a href="/john/6-35.htm">John 6:35</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, demonstrating His compassion and concern for the physical needs of the crowd.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are being taught and prepared for ministry; they are witnesses to Jesus' compassion and miraculous provision.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>A large group of people who have been with Jesus for three days, eager to hear His teachings and witness His miracles.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_wilderness.htm">The Wilderness</a></b><br>The setting of this event, emphasizing the isolation and the lack of resources available to the crowd.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/compassion_in_action.htm">Compassion in Action</a></b><br>Jesus' compassion is not just a feeling but leads to action.

His compassion then is the same compassion we depend on today.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(32) <span class= "bld">I have compassion on the multitude.</span>--The obvious resemblance between the details of this narrative and that of the feeding of the Five Thousand has led the schools of critics, who do not regard either as the record of a fact, to treat this as only another version of the same incident, or rather, from their point of view, of the same legend. The notes of distinctness are, however, too numerous to admit of that explanation. The number of the people fed, their three days' waiting till their food was exhausted, the number of the loaves at hand, and of the baskets in which the fragments were collected after the meal, are all different. More than this, the words rendered in both narratives by "basket" in the Authorised version are not the same in the Greek. Here the word is <span class= "greekheb">??????</span> (<span class= "ital">spuris</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> the hamper in which provisions were packed as for a party travelling together, large enough, as in St. Paul's escape from Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-25.htm" title="Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.">Acts 9:25</a>), to hold a man; while in the other it was the <span class= "greekheb">???????</span> (<span class= "ital">cophinus</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> or smaller basket, which a man carried in his hand. Lastly, our Lord's words in <a href="/context/matthew/16-9.htm" title="Do you not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?">Matthew 16:9-10</a>, distinctly recognise the two miracles, and connect the close of each with the word which was thus specially appropriate to it. Unless we adopt the incredible hypothesis that the one narrative was first so disguised that it lost the marks of its identity, and that the Evangelists, having combined the two, then invented our Lord's words, with all their apparent freshness and adaptation to the special circumstances of the hour, they must be admitted to be decisive as proving that there had been two events, like in kind, to which He thus referred. It is significant that here, as so often before, the display of miraculous power in its highest form originates not in answer to a challenge, or as being offered as a proof of a divine mission, but simply from compassion. Three days had passed, and still the crowds hung on His words and waited for His loving acts, and now they began to show signs of exhaustion that moved His sympathy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Called his disciples</span> unto him. Seeing the necessities of the multitude, Jesus, as it were, takes his disciples into council, treating them not as servants, but as friends. They were doubtless dispersed among the crowd, and Jesus summons them around him, and puts before them the special point to which his attention is turned. Thus he tries their faith, and shows that there were no human means available for feeding these famishing people. Thus God, so to speak, takes Abraham into his confidence before visiting the iniquity of Sodom: "Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?" (<a href="/genesis/18-17.htm">Genesis 18:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I have compassion</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">on</span> <span class="cmt_word">the multitude</span>. The human heart of Jesus felt for these distressed followers; his perfect sympathy was aroused in their behalf. We observe references to this tender feeling in many other instances (see <a href="/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a>; <a href="/matthew/14-14.htm">Matthew 14:14</a>; <a href="/matthew/20-34.htm">Matthew 20:34</a>; <a href="/mark/1-41.htm">Mark 1:41</a>; <a href="/mark/5-19.htm">Mark 5:19</a>; <a href="/luke/7-13.htm">Luke 7:13</a>. And in the Old Testament, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/isaiah/49-15.htm">Isaiah 49:15</a>; <a href="/jeremiah/12-15.htm">Jeremiah 12:15</a>; <a href="/micah/7-19.htm">Micah 7:19</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They continue with me</span> <span class="cmt_word">now three days.</span> The verb used here (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) implies close attendance persevered in against obstacles; it is used in <a href="/acts/11-23.htm">Acts 11:23</a> in a spiritual sense, "He exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) unto the Lord." The three days, according to the Hebrew formula of computation, would consist of one whole day and parts of two others. Thus constantly employed in healing and teaching, Jesus thinks not of himself; his whole care is centred on the people who, in their anxiety to see and hear him, forget their own necessities. There would be nothing strange in the people camping out for a night in Palestine. Men and women ordinarily lie down to rest in the clothes which they have worn during the day, and need no special preparation for sleeping. Thus a man covers himself with his heavy outer garment, lies on the dry ground, like Jacob at Bethel, with a stone or his arm for a pillow, and sleeps comfortably and safely till awakened by the morning sun. <span class="cmt_word">I wilt not send them away fasting.</span> Like a good master of a household, in his tender pity, Christ takes the circumstances of the multitude into consideration, and cannot endure the idea of dismissing them wearied and unfed to find their way to their own homes, which, as St. Mark adds, were, in the case of many of them, at a long distance. <span class="cmt_word">Faint</span>. Travellers tell us that out of the motley crowd of pilgrims that flock to Jerusalem at Easter-tide, many run short of provisions and perish on the road. Christ's thoughtful care regards the possibility of such disaster, and prepares the remedy. He had treated the sicknesses of the multitude; he had instructed their ignorance; now he will feed their bodies. They had sought nothing from him, nor begged for food; probably they had no idea of looking to him to supply their want. But they who follow Jesus shall never lack. They were seeking first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and temporal blessings were added to them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/15-32.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">called</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#963;&#940;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(proskalesamenos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Middle - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4341.htm">Strong's 4341: </a> </span><span class="str2">To call to myself, summon.
