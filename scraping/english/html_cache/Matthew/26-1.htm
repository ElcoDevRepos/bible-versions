This discourse includes prophecies about the destruction of the temple, the end times, and the final judgment. The phrase "finished saying all these things" indicates a transition from Jesus' public teaching to the events leading up to His crucifixion. It is a literary marker used by the Gospel writer to denote the end of a major teaching section, similar to other transitions in Matthew (e.g., <a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28, 11</a>:1, 13:53, 19:1). This structure highlights the importance of Jesus' teachings and prepares the reader for the narrative of His passion.<p><b>He told His disciples</b><br>Jesus' communication with His disciples is intimate and direct, emphasizing the close relationship He shares with them. The disciples are His chosen followers, who have been with Him throughout His ministry, witnessing His miracles and teachings. This moment is significant as it sets the stage for the events of the Passion Week. Jesus is preparing His disciples for what is to come, both in terms of His impending death and the fulfillment of His mission. The disciples, representing the early church, are being equipped to carry on His work after His departure. This phrase also underscores the theme of discipleship, a central element in the Gospel of Matthew, where Jesus instructs and prepares His followers for their future roles.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is preparing for His impending crucifixion.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The followers of Jesus who are being prepared for the events that will soon unfold, including His death and resurrection.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerusalem.htm">Jerusalem</a></b><br>While not mentioned directly in this verse, it is the setting for the upcoming events of the Passion Week.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_jesus'_mission.htm">Understanding Jesus' Mission</a></b><br>Jesus' teachings and actions are purposeful, leading to the fulfillment of His mission on earth.

Each time, a major block of teaching closes and fresh action begins.<p>&#8226; Here, the teaching just completed is the Olivet Discourse (<a href="/bsb/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24&#8211;25</a>), where Jesus unpacks end-time signs, vigilance, and judgment&#8212;truths that remain certain because &#8220;Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/24-35.htm">Matthew 24:35</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase reminds us that Jesus sets the agenda.

We cannot ignore the fact that it brings with it also some peculiar difficulties. The first three Gospels are in substantial agreement as to the order of the facts and the time at which they occurred. But the fourth, in some respects the fullest and most striking, differs from the Three: (1) in omitting all mention that the Last Supper of our Lord with His disciples was also the Paschal Supper, and at least appearing to imply (<a href="/john/13-1.htm" title="Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end.">John 13:1</a>; <a href="/john/18-28.htm" title="Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.">John 18:28</a>) that it was before it; (2) in also omitting all record (<span class= "ital">a</span>) of the institution of the Lord's Supper as the sign of the New Covenant, and (<span class= "ital">b</span>) of the agony in Gethsemane; (3) in recording much, both as to our Lord's acts and words, which the Three do not record. It will be enough to discuss once for all the problems which thus present themselves, and it is believed that the right place for the discussion will be in the Notes on the Gospel which first presents the difficulties. Here, therefore, our work will be confined to the text actually before us, with only such passing references to the narrative of St. John as occasion may require. As far as the variations in the first three Gospels are concerned, they are sufficiently explained by the hypothesis that they had a common origin in a history at first delivered orally, and reduced afterwards to writing, with the diversities which are, in the nature of the case, incident to such a process.<p><span class= "bld">All these sayings.</span>--The words clearly point to the great discourse of Matthew 24, 25. The "disciples" to whom our Lord then spoke of His betrayal and death, may have been either the four who are named in <a href="/mark/13-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,">Mark 13:3</a>, or the whole company of the Twelve. In the latter case, we must assume that the rest had joined Him, either during the utterance of the discourse or after it was finished.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1, 2.</span> - <span class="accented">Final announcement of the approaching Passion.</span> (<a href="/mark/14-1.htm">Mark 14:1</a>; <a href="/luke/22-1.htm">Luke 22:1</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When Jesus had finished all these sayings;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those comprised in chs. 22-25.
