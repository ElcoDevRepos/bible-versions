In biblical narratives, dreams often serve as divine communication (e.g., <a href="/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a>, <a href="/daniel/2-19.htm">Daniel 2:19</a>). Joseph's response to the dream reflects his righteousness and willingness to follow God's guidance, aligning with the biblical theme of God speaking through dreams to direct His people.<p><b>he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him</b><br>Joseph's immediate compliance with the angel's command demonstrates his faithfulness and trust in God's plan. The angel of the Lord is a recurring figure in Scripture, often delivering messages of great importance (e.g., <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2</a>, <a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>). Joseph's obedience is reminiscent of other biblical figures who acted on divine instructions, such as Abraham (<a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>) and Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10-12</a>).<p><b>and embraced Mary as his wife</b><br>By taking Mary as his wife, Joseph publicly accepts her and the child she carries, despite the potential for social stigma and personal sacrifice. This act fulfills the angel's message and aligns with the cultural context of betrothal and marriage in first-century Jewish society, where betrothal was a binding agreement. Joseph's acceptance of Mary prefigures Christ's acceptance of the Church, His bride, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-27</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/joseph.htm">Joseph</a></b><br>A righteous man, betrothed to Mary, who is obedient to God's command despite potential social stigma.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/a/angel_of_the_lord.htm">Angel of the Lord</a></b><br>A divine messenger who appears to Joseph in a dream, providing guidance and reassurance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/m/mary.htm">Mary</a></b><br>The mother of Jesus, who is taken as Joseph's wife in obedience to God's plan.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/d/dream.htm">Dream</a></b><br>The medium through which God communicates His will to Joseph, emphasizing divine intervention.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/marriage.htm">Marriage</a></b><br>The event of Joseph taking Mary as his wife, signifying his obedience and trust in God's plan.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/o/obedience_to_god's_command.htm">Obedience to God's Command</a></b><br>Joseph's immediate action upon waking demonstrates the importance of obeying God's instructions without delay or hesitation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_divine_guidance.htm">Trust in Divine Guidance</a></b><br>Joseph's acceptance of the angel's message shows a deep trust in God's plan, even when it defies societal norms or personal understanding.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_action.htm">Faith in Action</a></b><br>Joseph's decision to take Mary as his wife is a practical demonstration of faith, illustrating that true faith often requires tangible actions.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/c/courage_in_the_face_of_judgment.htm">Courage in the Face of Judgment</a></b><br>Joseph's willingness to marry Mary despite potential public disgrace highlights the courage required to follow God's will.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_divine_intervention.htm">Role of Divine Intervention</a></b><br>The angel's appearance in a dream underscores the belief that God actively intervenes in human affairs to guide and direct His people.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_1_24_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 1:24?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Joseph_s_obedience_impact_on_your_faith.htm">How does Joseph's obedience in Matthew 1:24 inspire your own faith actions?

They imply also that what had seemed evidence of guilt among the neighbours of that home, brought with it to Joseph's mind no ground for blame. To them, if they were not told the history, and it is not probable that they were, it must have been deemed an act of exceptional mercy and forbearance.
