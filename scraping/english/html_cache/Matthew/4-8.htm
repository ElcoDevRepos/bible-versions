The use of "again" suggests a persistent effort by Satan to lead Jesus astray. The "very high mountain" is symbolic rather than a specific geographical location, as no single mountain could offer a view of all the world's kingdoms. Mountains in biblical literature often represent places of revelation or significant spiritual encounters, such as Mount Sinai or the Mount of Transfiguration. This setting emphasizes the magnitude of the temptation and the spiritual battle taking place.<p><b>and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world</b><br>The devil's ability to show Jesus "all the kingdoms of the world" suggests a supernatural vision rather than a physical sight. This vision represents the political and cultural powers of the earth, highlighting the temptation of worldly authority and dominion. In the biblical context, kingdoms often symbolize human power structures in contrast to God's kingdom. This temptation echoes the promise of dominion given to Adam, which was marred by sin, and contrasts with the spiritual kingdom Jesus came to establish.<p><b>and their glory</b><br>The "glory" of the kingdoms refers to their wealth, splendor, and power. In the ancient world, kingdoms were often judged by their military might, economic prosperity, and cultural achievements. This temptation appeals to human desires for power and prestige. However, Jesus' mission was not to seek earthly glory but to fulfill the will of the Father, ultimately leading to the cross. This moment foreshadows the choice between temporary earthly glory and eternal spiritual victory, a theme prevalent throughout Jesus' ministry and teachings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, the Son of God, who is being tempted by the devil in the wilderness.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_devil.htm">The Devil</a></b><br>Also known as Satan, the adversary who tempts Jesus, attempting to divert Him from His divine mission.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/a_very_high_mountain.htm">A Very High Mountain</a></b><br>The location to which the devil takes Jesus to show Him all the kingdoms of the world.

No "specular mount" (I use Milton's phrase) in the whole earth commands a survey of "all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them." St. Luke's addition "in a moment of time," in one of those flashes of intuition which concentrate into a single act of consciousness the work of years, adds, if anything could add, to the certainty of this view. Milton's well-known expansion of this part of the Temptation (<span class= "ital">Paradise Regained,</span> Book III.), though too obviously the work of a scholar exulting in his scholarship, is yet worth studying as the first serious attempt to realise in part, at least, what must thus have been presented to our Lord's mind.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Into an exceeding high mountain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c8;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>; <span class="accented">cf.</span> <a href="/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a>; <a href="/revelation/21-10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>). Not in Luke. While no material mountain would have enabled our Lord to see all the kingdoms, etc., with his bodily eyes, it is probable that the physical elevation and distance of landscape would psychologically help such a vision. The Quarantana, which "commands a noble prospect" (Soein's ' Baedeker,' p. 263), may have been the spot. In the case of Ezekiel it is expressly said that his being "brought into the land of Israel, and set upon a very high mountain," was only "in the visions of God." <span class="cmt_word">All the kingdoms of the world</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>; but Luke, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c1;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of the whole world as occupied by man, cf.

The kingdoms themselves and their outward show. Contrast the words of the seraphim, "The whole earth is full of his glory" (<a href="/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>). In Luke this expression does not occur at this point, but in the tempter's words. As it there comes more abruptly, that is perhaps the more original position.
