Jesus is addressing their failure to grasp the heart of God's commandments. This echoes <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a>, where God emphasizes the importance of mercy over ritualistic sacrifice. The Pharisees' focus on legalism blinded them to the true intent of the Law, which is love and compassion.<p><b>&#8216;I desire mercy, not sacrifice,&#8217;</b><br>This quote from <a href="/hosea/6-6.htm">Hosea 6:6</a> highlights God's preference for mercy over ritualistic observance. In the historical context, sacrifices were a central part of Jewish worship, but they were meant to be expressions of a heart aligned with God's will. The prophets often criticized Israel for offering sacrifices without genuine repentance or love for others. This statement underscores the priority of ethical behavior and compassion over mere ceremonial compliance. It also foreshadows the New Covenant, where Jesus fulfills the Law and emphasizes love as the greatest commandment (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37-40</a>).<p><b>you would not have condemned the innocent.</b><br>Here, Jesus points out the Pharisees' error in judging His disciples for plucking grain on the Sabbath. The disciples were innocent, yet the Pharisees' rigid interpretation of the Law led them to condemn them. This reflects a broader theme in the Gospels where Jesus challenges the religious leaders' understanding of righteousness. The "innocent" can also be seen as a type of Christ, who was ultimately condemned despite His innocence.

The teachers or interpreters of the Law had failed to catch the meaning of the simplest utterances of the prophets. "Mercy and not sacrifice," moral and not positive duties, these made up the true life of religion, and were alone acceptable to God. It was because they had inverted the right relation of the two that they had, in this instance, condemned those whom our Lord now declares to have been in this respect absolutely guiltless.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - Matthew only. <span class="cmt_word">But if ye had known what this meaneth, I wilt have mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless</span> (on the quotation, see <a href="/matthew/9-13.htm">Matthew 9:13</a>, note).
