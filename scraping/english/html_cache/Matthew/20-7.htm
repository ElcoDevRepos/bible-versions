In the historical context of first-century Judea, day laborers would gather in public places hoping to be hired for work. The fact that no one had hired them suggests a sense of desperation and vulnerability, as they depended on daily wages for survival. This situation highlights the social and economic challenges of the time, where employment was uncertain and often insufficient. Theologically, this can be seen as a metaphor for spiritual idleness and the need for divine intervention to find purpose and fulfillment.<p><b>they answered.</b><br>The laborers' response indicates their willingness to work and their readiness to accept any opportunity that comes their way. This reflects a broader biblical theme of human response to God's call. In the parable, their answer signifies an openness to the invitation of the landowner, which can be seen as a representation of God's call to individuals. This mirrors the call to discipleship found throughout the New Testament, where believers are invited to respond to Jesus' invitation to follow Him.<p><b>So he told them,</b><br>The landowner's response is immediate and decisive. This reflects the character of God as portrayed in the Bible&#8212;compassionate, just, and eager to include all who are willing. The landowner's actions can be seen as a type of Christ, who seeks out the lost and offers them a place in His kingdom. This also connects to the biblical theme of God's grace, which is extended to all, regardless of their status or previous inactivity.<p><b>&#8216;You also go into my vineyard.&#8217;</b><br>The vineyard is a significant biblical symbol, often representing Israel or the Kingdom of God. In this context, the invitation to work in the vineyard signifies an invitation to participate in God's work and to be part of His kingdom. This phrase echoes the call to service and mission found in other parts of Scripture, such as the Great Commission in <a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>. It underscores the inclusivity of God's call, extending to those who may feel overlooked or marginalized. Theologically, it emphasizes that God's grace and opportunity for service are available to all, regardless of when they come to faith or begin their labor in His kingdom.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/l/landowner.htm">Landowner</a></b><br>Represents God, who is sovereign and gracious, calling people to work in His kingdom.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/l/laborers.htm">Laborers</a></b><br>Symbolize believers or those called to serve in God's kingdom, regardless of when they are called.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/v/vineyard.htm">Vineyard</a></b><br>Represents the kingdom of God, where believers are called to work and serve.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/marketplace.htm">Marketplace</a></b><br>The place where laborers wait to be hired, symbolizing the world where people await their calling.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/hiring.htm">Hiring</a></b><br>The act of calling laborers, representing God's invitation to join His work at any stage of life.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereign_call.htm">God's Sovereign Call</a></b><br>God calls people to His work at different times and stages in life.

Much like Isaiah&#8217;s confession, &#8220;Here am I. Send me!&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/6-8.htm">Isaiah 6:8</a>), they stand ready once called.<p>- The landowner&#8217;s presence reveals that God sees every idle heart; He knows where His servants are and what they can become.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>they answered</b><p>- Their response shows humility and readiness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/psalms/25-9.htm">Psalm 25:9</a> says, &#8220;He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them His way.&#8221; These men exemplify that teachable spirit.<p>- By answering, they acknowledge the authority of the landowner. In <a href="/john/10-27.htm">John 10:27</a> Jesus affirms, &#8220;My sheep listen to My voice; I know them, and they follow Me.&#8221; The pattern is the same: hear, recognize, respond.<p>- The absence of excuses highlights a willingness that God still honors (<a href="/2_chronicles/16-9.htm">2 Chronicles 16:9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So he told them,</b><p>- The landowner&#8217;s directive is immediate and personal.<p>&#8226; <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a> urges, &#8220;Be doers of the word, and not hearers only.&#8221; The master moves them from listening to doing.<p>- His command demonstrates sovereignty; He alone decides the timing and terms of service (<a href="/romans/9-15.htm">Romans 9:15-16</a>).<p>- Grace motivates the instruction. Just as Jesus invited Levi the tax collector with two words, &#8220;Follow Me&#8221; (<a href="/mark/2-14.htm">Mark 2:14</a>), the landowner graciously calls latecomers without hesitation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You also go into my vineyard.</b><p>- Inclusion is the key idea.<p>&#8226; <a href="/ephesians/2-13.htm">Ephesians 2:13</a> proclaims that those &#8220;far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ.&#8221; Likewise, these workers are welcomed into meaningful labor.<p>- &#8220;My vineyard&#8221; underlines ownership. The work belongs to God; we are stewards (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9</a>, &#8220;For we are God&#8217;s fellow workers&#8221;).<p>- The timing&#8212;late in the day&#8212;underscores that it is never too late to serve. The thief on the cross found mercy in his final hours (<a href="/luke/23-42.htm">Luke 23:42-43</a>).<p>- The assignment is simple: go and work.

By honestly acknowledging their need, the late-hour workers receive a gracious invitation to share in the landowner&#8217;s work and reward. The verse affirms that God&#8217;s call can come at any stage of life, and whenever it comes, humble, immediate obedience brings us into His fruitful service.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Because no man hath hired</span> us.--This, again, is one of the salient points of the parable.
