By Jesus' time, the term was largely historical, but it highlights the woman's non-Jewish, Gentile status. This encounter occurs in the region of Tyre and Sidon, areas known for their pagan practices and historical enmity with Israel. Her approach to Jesus signifies a breaking of cultural and religious barriers, as Jews typically avoided interactions with Canaanites.<p><b>crying out</b><br>The woman's cry indicates desperation and urgency. In the cultural context, women, especially Gentile women, were often marginalized, yet her boldness in approaching Jesus demonstrates her faith and determination. Her public plea also reflects the social norms where women would often have to advocate vocally for their needs to be heard.<p><b>&#8220;Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me!</b><br>By addressing Jesus as "Lord," she acknowledges His authority and divinity. The title "Son of David" is a Messianic term, recognizing Jesus as the promised descendant of David who would bring salvation. This is significant as it shows her understanding of Jewish Messianic expectations, despite her Gentile background. Her plea for mercy aligns with the biblical theme of God's compassion and grace towards those who seek Him.<p><b>My daughter is miserably possessed by a demon.&#8221;</b><br>Demon possession was a recognized affliction in the New Testament, often associated with physical and spiritual torment. The woman's description of her daughter's condition as "miserably possessed" underscores the severity of the situation. This reflects the broader biblical narrative of spiritual warfare and the power of Jesus over demonic forces, as seen in other Gospel accounts where Jesus casts out demons, demonstrating His authority over evil.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/canaanite_woman.htm">Canaanite Woman</a></b><br>A Gentile woman from the region of Tyre and Sidon,

distance, and societal scorn to seek Jesus. Addressing Him as &#8220;Lord, Son of David,&#8221; she exhibits remarkable faith, asking not on the basis of her worth but on His mercy. Her plea for her demon-tormented daughter reveals confidence that Christ alone commands authority over evil spirits. The verse thus foreshadows the gospel&#8217;s global scope, affirms Jesus as merciful Messiah, and invites every desperate heart to come boldly to Him, trusting His power and compassion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">A woman of Canaan.</span>--The terms Canaanite and Canaan, which in the earlier books of the Old Testament were often applied in a wider sense to all the original inhabitants of what was afterwards the land of Israel (<a href="/genesis/10-18.htm" title="And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.">Genesis 10:18</a>; <a href="/genesis/12-6.htm" title="And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.">Genesis 12:6</a>; <a href="/judges/1-10.htm" title="And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelled in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.">Judges 1:10</a>), were used more specifically of Ph?nicia and its inhabitants (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm" title="And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good land and a large, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.">Exodus 3:8</a>; <a href="/exodus/3-17.htm" title="And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.">Exodus 3:17</a>; <a href="/ezra/9-1.htm" title="Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.">Ezra 9:1</a>, and elsewhere), and are employed here with that meaning. St. Mark describes her more definitely as "a Greek" (i.e., a heathen, the name "Greek" having gained a wider connotation, much as "Frank" has done in recent times), a "Syro-Ph?nician by nation." . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold</span>. The word marks the sudden and unexpected character of the incident. <span class="cmt_word">A woman of Canaan.</span> She belonged to the accursed race of Canaan, the ancient inhabitants of the land, doomed, indeed, to destruction, but never thoroughly extirpated. St. Mark calls her "a Greek," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a Gentile, and "a Syro-Phoenician," which explains her proper nationality. <span class="cmt_word">Out of the same coasts.</span> Some join these words with "a woman;" but came out would still imply that she left her own territory to meet Christ. <span class="cmt_word">Have mercy on me.</span> She speaks as though she herself were the one that needed healing, identifying herself with her diseased daughter, as though the horrible incubus lay upon her own spirit and could not be relieved without the cure of the suffering girl. <span class="cmt_word">O Lord,</span> thou <span class="cmt_word">Son of David</span>. Living among a mixed population of Jews and Gentiles, she had heard this title applied to Jesus; she knew something of the hopes of the Hebrew nation, that they were expecting a Messiah, son of the great King David, who should preach to the poor and heal the sick, as she heard that Jesus had done. We know that the reputation of Jesus had spread into these parts, and that persons from this country had come to him to be healed (<a href="/mark/3-8.htm">Mark 3:8</a>; <a href="/luke/6-17.htm">Luke 6:17</a>). There is no reason to suppose that the woman was a proselyte; but evidently she was of a humble and religious spirit, open to conviction, and of an enlightened understanding, which needed only grace and instruction to ripen into faith. At present she saw in Christ only a merciful Wonder-worker - an error which he often combated, and which now by his conduct he corrected. <span class="cmt_word">My daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</span> She must have learned from her Hebrew neighbours to attribute her child's malady to demoniacal influence, as such an idea would not have naturally occurred to a heathen Greek. The power of the devil was shown more openly in heathen localities. We do not read of many bad cases of possession in strictly Jewish districts. It is in Gentile or semi-Gentile regions that the worst instances occur; and while the pagan inhabitants attributed the mysterious maladies to natural causes, the truer insight of believers assigned them, and often most justly, to spiritual agencies. In the present case, the possession must have been unconnected with any ethical relations. It was not that the child, by any act of her own, had put herself into the demon's power. We must regard it, like the sufferings of innocent infants, as a providential arrangement which God for wise purposes allows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/15-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">And</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">a Canaanite</span><br /><span class="grk">&#935;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#943;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(Chananaia)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5478.htm">Strong's 5478: </a> </span><span class="str2">Canaanite, a Biblical and archaic name for Phoenician.
