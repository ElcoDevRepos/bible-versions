In biblical context, fullness often signifies the culmination of time or events, as seen in <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4</a>, where the "fullness of time" refers to Christ's coming. The imagery of a net being full can be linked to the gathering of people for judgment, as seen in the parable of the wheat and tares earlier in <a href="/matthew/13.htm">Matthew 13</a>.<p><b>the men pulled it ashore</b><br>The act of pulling the net ashore signifies the gathering of people for judgment. In the cultural context of first-century Palestine, fishing was a common occupation, and the imagery would be familiar to Jesus' audience. The shore represents a place of transition, where the sea (often symbolizing chaos or the world) meets the land (symbolizing stability or the kingdom of God). This transition reflects the movement from earthly life to divine judgment.<p><b>Then they sat down</b><br>Sitting down indicates a deliberate and thoughtful process, often associated with judgment or teaching in biblical times. In Jewish tradition, rabbis would sit to teach, and judges would sit to deliberate cases. This action underscores the careful and discerning nature of the judgment process, as seen in <a href="/psalms/1-5.htm">Psalm 1:5</a>, where the wicked will not stand in the judgment.<p><b>and sorted the good fish into containers</b><br>The sorting of fish represents the separation of the righteous from the wicked, a common theme in Jesus' parables. The good fish symbolize those who are righteous and have lived according to God's will. Containers suggest preservation and value, indicating that the righteous are treasured and kept safe for eternal life. This imagery parallels the separation of sheep and goats in <a href="/matthew/25-32.htm">Matthew 25:32-33</a>.<p><b>but threw the bad away</b><br>The bad fish represent those who are wicked or have rejected God's ways. Throwing them away signifies their exclusion from the kingdom of God and eternal life. This act of discarding reflects the finality of divine judgment, as seen in <a href="/revelation/20-15.htm">Revelation 20:15</a>, where those not found in the book of life are cast into the lake of fire. The imagery emphasizes the seriousness of living a life aligned with God's will.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fishermen.htm">The Fishermen</a></b><br>Represent the angels or servants of God who are tasked with gathering and sorting.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sea.htm">The Sea</a></b><br>Symbolizes the world where all kinds of people live and interact.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_net.htm">The Net</a></b><br>Represents the kingdom of heaven, which gathers all people together.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_good_fish.htm">The Good Fish</a></b><br>Symbolize the righteous or those who have accepted the Gospel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_bad_fish.htm">The Bad Fish</a></b><br>Represent the wicked or those who reject the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_kingdom's_inclusivity_and_exclusivity.htm">The Kingdom's Inclusivity and Exclusivity</a></b><br>The net gathers all kinds of fish, symbolizing the inclusive call of the Gospel. However, there is an exclusive sorting process, emphasizing the need for genuine faith and righteousness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_judgment.htm">The Certainty of Judgment</a></b><br>Just as the fishermen sort the fish, there will be a divine judgment where the righteous are separated from the wicked.
