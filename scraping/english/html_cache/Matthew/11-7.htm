The departure of the disciples signifies the end of their mission and the beginning of Jesus' teaching to the crowd about John.<p><b>Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John</b><br>Here, Jesus takes the opportunity to address the crowd regarding John the Baptist's significance.

The wilderness setting also connects to the Israelites' journey and their encounters with God, emphasizing the prophetic nature of John's ministry.<p><b>A reed swaying in the wind?</b><br>This metaphor suggests instability and lack of conviction, characteristics not associated with John the Baptist.

John has just sent messengers to ask whether Jesus is &#8220;the One who was to come&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/11-2.htm">Matthew 11:2-6</a>).<p>- Jesus waits until those disciples are on their way back before turning to the crowd. This protects John&#8217;s reputation; Jesus will commend him publicly, but first answers John privately (cf. <a href="/proverbs/27-2.htm">Proverbs 27:2</a>).<p>- The scene underscores the continuity between the ministries of John and Jesus&#8212;there is no rivalry, only affirmation (<a href="/john/3-27.htm">John 3:27-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John</b><p>- Christ does not allow confusion to grow. He defines who John is before the listening audience can form their own incomplete conclusions (cf. <a href="/luke/7-24.htm">Luke 7:24-28</a>).<p>- By directing the crowd&#8217;s attention to John, Jesus underscores that recognizing John&#8217;s role is essential to recognizing the Messiah&#8217;s identity (<a href="/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>; <a href="/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>).<p>- This move counters any temptation to belittle John because of his momentary doubt; instead, Jesus highlights his prophetic stature.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What did you go out into the wilderness to see?</b><p>- The wilderness recalls Israel&#8217;s history of meeting God in barren places (<a href="/exodus/3-1.htm">Exodus 3:1-2</a>; <a href="/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14</a>).<p>- The question is rhetorical, inviting the crowd to examine their motives. They had traveled far, indicating they sensed something extraordinary about John (<a href="/mark/1-4.htm">Mark 1:4-5</a>).<p>- Jesus prompts self-reflection: did they seek novelty or divine revelation? Their answer shapes how they will respond to Jesus Himself.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>A reed swaying in the wind?</b><p>- Reeds along the Jordan were common and easily bent by every gust. Jesus implies John is the opposite&#8212;firm and uncompromising (<a href="/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7-12</a>).<p>- John did not tailor his message to public opinion, even confronting Herod&#8217;s sin (<a href="/mark/6-17.htm">Mark 6:17-18</a>).<p>- The imagery contrasts with leaders who adjust their stance for approval (<a href="/ephesians/4-14.htm">Ephesians 4:14</a>). John&#8217;s steadfastness authenticates him as God&#8217;s messenger.<p>- By dismissing the idea of John as a &#8220;reed,&#8221; Jesus challenges listeners to value conviction over comfort (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/11-7.htm">Matthew 11:7</a> shows Jesus protecting John&#8217;s honor, clarifying his prophetic role, and inviting the crowd to weigh their own expectations. Far from being weak or vacillating, John stands as a steadfast herald of the Messiah. Recognizing John&#8217;s unwavering character prepares hearts to recognize and receive Jesus, the One whose coming John so boldly proclaimed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/11.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">As they departed.</span>--There was an obvious risk that those who heard the question of the Baptist, and our Lord's answer, might be led to think with undue harshness, perhaps even with contempt, of one who had so far failed in steadfastness. As if to meet that risk, Jesus turns, before the messengers were out of hearing, to bear His testimony to the work and character of John. But a little while before, almost as his last public utterance, the forerunner had borne his witness to the King (<a href="/context/john/3-23.htm" title="And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.">John 3:23-36</a>), and now He, in His turn, recognises to the full all the greatness of the work which that forerunner had accomplished.<p><span class= "bld">What went ye out</span> <span class= "bld">. . .?</span>--The tense points to the time when the first proclamation of the Baptist, as the voice of one crying in the wilderness, drew out crowds to listen to him. Jesus, by His question, bids them recall the impression which had then been made upon them. Had they gone out to see "a reed shaken by the wind?" The imagery was, of course, drawn from the rushes that grew upon the banks of the Jordan, but the use of the singular shows that it was meant to be understood symbolically. Had they gone out to see one who was swayed this way and that by every blast of popular feeling? No, not that; something quite other than that was what they had then beheld.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-15.</span> <span class="accented">- Jesus</span> <span class="accented">recognition of the greatness of John as herald.</span> Vers. 7-11: parallel passage: <a href="/luke/7-24.htm">Luke 7:24-28</a>. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And as they departed</span>; <span class="accented">and as these went their way</span> (Revised Version). Fulfilling his command (ver. 4). It' we may combine the language of St. Matthew and St. Luke ("when the messengers of John were departed"), we may say that they had left the circle immediately round our Lord, but were hardly further than the outskirts of the crowd. <span class="cmt_word">What went ye out into the wilderness to see?</span> <span class="accented">to behold</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> (cf. <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>,). It almost suggests that they went out as though to see a spectacle. They were stirred by no deeper motive. Bengel compares <a href="/john/5-35.htm">John 5:35</a>. <span class="cmt_word">A reed shaken with the wind?</span> If the reed referred to by our Lord was the papyrus, which still grows freely in certain parts of the Jordan valley, the description of this plant in 'Rob Roy on the Jordan,' ch. 17, is specially interesting: "There is first a lateral trunk, lying on the water and half-submerged. This is sometimes as thick as a man's body, and from its lower side hang innumerable string-like roots from three to five feet long, and of a deep purple colour .... These pendent roots... retard much of the surface-current where the papyrus grows On the upper surface of the trunks the stems grow alternately in oblique rows;, their thickness at the junction is often four inches, and their height fifteen feet, gracefully tapering until at the top is a little round knob, with long, thin brown, wire-like hairs eighteen inches long, which rise and then, recurving, hang about it in a thyrsus-shaped head." He also says, "The whole jungle of papyrus was <span class="accented">floating upon the water</span>, and so the waves raised by the breeze were rocking the green curtain to and fro." This explained "a most curious hissing, grinding, bustling sound, that was heard like waves upon a shingly beach," as "the papyrus stems were rubbing against each other as they nodded out and in." It is, however, much more probable that the reed referred to was "the <span class="accented">Arundo donax</span>, a very tall cane, growing twelve feet high, with a magnificent panicle of blossom at the top, and so slender and yielding that it will lie perfectly flat under a gust of wind, and immediately resume its upright position." It grows especially on the western side of the Dead Sea (cf. Tristram, 'Natural History of the Bible,' p. 4,37, edit. 1889). To our Lord's question no answer was needed.
