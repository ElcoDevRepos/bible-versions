This reply is significant as it demonstrates Jesus' teaching method, often using questions to provoke thought and deeper understanding. His response is not dismissive but rather redirects the focus to a spiritual truth. This method of teaching is consistent with rabbinic traditions of the time, where questions were used to engage listeners and encourage reflection.<p><b>&#8220;Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?&#8221;</b><br>Here, Jesus challenges the traditional understanding of family, emphasizing spiritual kinship over biological ties. This question invites His listeners to consider the nature of true discipleship and the family of God. In the cultural context of first-century Judaism, family ties were paramount, and Jesus' statement would have been radical. This redefinition of family aligns with other teachings of Jesus, such as in <a href="/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>, where He speaks of the cost of discipleship and prioritizing Him above familial relationships. It also foreshadows the formation of the early Christian community, which is characterized by spiritual bonds rather than ethnic or familial ones. This concept is further developed in passages like <a href="/galatians/3-28.htm">Galatians 3:28</a>, where Paul speaks of unity in Christ transcending social and cultural divisions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to a situation where His biological family is seeking Him.
