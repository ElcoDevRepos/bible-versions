It contrasts with the traditional teachings of the scribes and Pharisees, emphasizing His role as the ultimate lawgiver and teacher. This authoritative statement is a hallmark of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus redefines righteousness.<p><b>that anyone who is angry with his brother</b><br>Anger is addressed as a heart issue, not just an external action. In biblical context, "brother" refers to fellow believers or members of the community. Jesus elevates the commandment against murder by focusing on the internal emotion of anger, which can lead to destructive behavior. This teaching aligns with the broader biblical theme that God examines the heart (<a href="/1_samuel/16-7.htm">1 Samuel 16:7</a>).<p><b>will be subject to judgment</b><br>This phrase underscores the seriousness of harboring anger. Judgment here refers to divine judgment, as well as potential earthly consequences. The concept of judgment is consistent with Old Testament teachings, where God holds individuals accountable for their thoughts and intentions (<a href="/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>).<p><b>Again, anyone who says to his brother, &#8216;Raca,&#8217;</b><br>"Raca" is an Aramaic term of contempt, roughly equivalent to calling someone "empty-headed" or "worthless." This reflects the cultural context of the time, where verbal insults were taken seriously. The use of Aramaic highlights the everyday language of Jesus' audience, making His teaching relatable and impactful.<p><b>will be subject to the Sanhedrin</b><br>The Sanhedrin was the highest Jewish court, responsible for religious and legal matters. Being subject to the Sanhedrin indicates the gravity of using such insults, equating them with serious offenses. This reflects the cultural and legal practices of first-century Judaism, where words could lead to formal charges.<p><b>But anyone who says, &#8216;You fool!&#8217;</b><br>Calling someone a "fool" implies moral and spiritual deficiency, not just intellectual lack. In biblical terms, a fool is someone who rejects God and His wisdom (<a href="/psalms/14.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>). This phrase highlights the destructive power of words and the importance of speaking with love and respect.<p><b>will be subject to the fire of hell</b><br>The "fire of hell" refers to Gehenna, a place outside Jerusalem associated with judgment and punishment. Gehenna was historically a site of child sacrifice and later became a metaphor for divine judgment. This phrase emphasizes the eternal consequences of sinful anger and speech, aligning with the biblical theme of accountability before God (<a href="/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, which is a foundational teaching of Christian ethics and morality.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_brother.htm">The Brother</a></b><br>Represents fellow believers or, more broadly, fellow human beings with whom one has a relationship.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanhedrin.htm">The Sanhedrin</a></b><br>The highest Jewish council and court of justice in ancient Jerusalem, symbolizing earthly judgment.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_fire_of_hell.htm">The Fire of Hell (Gehenna)</a></b><br>A term used to describe eternal punishment, drawing from the imagery of the Valley of Hinnom, a place of burning refuse outside Jerusalem.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_sermon_on_the_mount.htm">The Sermon on the Mount</a></b><br>The context in which this teaching is given, emphasizing the deeper righteousness required in the Kingdom of Heaven.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_seriousness_of_anger.htm">The Seriousness of Anger</a></b><br>Jesus elevates the understanding of anger, equating it with the severity of murder in terms of spiritual consequences.

Such condemnatory speech usurps God&#8217;s role as Judge.<p>&#8226; Jesus now speaks of &#8220;the fire of hell&#8221; (Gehenna), shifting from human courts to final, divine judgment.

Secret anger invites judgment, spoken contempt calls for higher accountability, and character assassination bears the weight of hell itself. The Savior&#8217;s standard is not merely to restrain violence but to cultivate hearts free of hatred, tongues guarded from contempt, and relationships marked by reconciling love (<a href="/ephesians/4-32.htm">Ephesians 4:32</a>; <a href="/romans/12-18.htm">Romans 12:18</a>). Taking Jesus&#8217; words literally drives us to repent of hidden hostility, rely on His grace for new hearts, and pursue peace with every brother and sister as citizens of His kingdom.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">I say unto you.</span>--The <span class= "ital">I</span> is emphasized in the Greek. It was this probably that, more than anything else, led to the feeling of wonder expressed in <a href="/context/matthew/7-28.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:">Matthew 7:28-29</a>. The scribe in his teaching invariably referred to this Rabbi and that; the new Teacher spoke as one having a higher authority of His own.<p><span class= "bld">Angry . . . without a cause.</span>--The last three words are wanting in many of the best MSS. They may have been inserted to soften down the apparent harshness of the teaching; but if so, it must have been at an early date--before the fourth century. They may, on the other hand, have been in the text originally, and struck out, as giving too wide a margin to vain and vague excuses. Ethically, the teaching is not that the emotion of anger, with or without a cause, stands on the same level of guilt with murder, but that the former so soon expands and explodes into the latter, that it will be brought to trial and sentenced according to the merits of each case, the occasion of the anger, the degree in which it has been checked or cherished, and the like. As no earthly tribunal can take cognisance of emotions as such, the "judgment" here is clearly that of the Unseen Judge dealing with offences which in His eyes are of the same character as those which come before the human judges. "Hates any man the thing he would not kill?"<p><span class= "bld">Raca.</span>--As far as the dictionary sense of the word goes, it is the same as that of the "<span class= "ital">vain</span> fellows" of <a href="/context/judges/9-4.htm" title="And they gave him three score and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.">Judges 9:4, Jdg_11:3</a>; <a href="/proverbs/12-11.htm" title="He that tills his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that follows vain persons is void of understanding.">Proverbs 12:11</a>; but all words of abuse depend for their full force on popular association, and <span class= "ital">raca,</span> like words of kindred meaning among ourselves, was in common use as expressing not anger only but insolent contempt. The temper condemned is that in which anger has so far gained the mastery that we no longer recognise a "brother" in the man who has offended us, but look on him with malignant scorn.<p><span class= "bld">The council.</span>--Offences of this kind are placed by our Lord on the same level as those which came before the great court of the Sanhedrim. That word, though it looks like Hebrew, is really only a transliterated form of the Greek word for council. The court consisted of seventy or seventy-two members, with a president and vice-president, and was made up of the heads of the twenty-four courses of the priests, with forty-six or forty-eight (how chosen it is not known) from the "elders" and "scribes." Like the Areopagus at Athens, it took cognisance--as in the case of our Lord (<a href="/matthew/26-65.htm" title="Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.">Matthew 26:65</a>) and Stephen (<a href="/acts/6-13.htm" title="And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceases not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:">Acts 6:13</a>)--of blasphemy and other like offences, and its peculiar prerogative was that it could order death by stoning. The point of our Lord's teaching was, therefore, that to scorn God's image in man is to do dishonour to God Himself. We cannot truly "fear God" unless we also "honour all men" (<a href="/1_peter/2-17.htm" title="Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.">1Peter 2:17</a>). The reverence for humanity as such must extend even to the man who has most provoked us. In the unseen eternal world the want of that reverence has its own appropriate punishment. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But I say unto you</span>.
