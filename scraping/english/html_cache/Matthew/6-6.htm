In the Jewish tradition, prayer was a daily practice, often performed in public settings like synagogues or street corners. Jesus emphasizes the importance of sincerity in prayer, contrasting with the hypocritical practices of some religious leaders of His time who prayed for public recognition.<p><b>go into your inner room</b><br>The "inner room" refers to a private space, away from public view. In first-century Jewish homes, this could be a small storage room or a secluded area. The emphasis is on privacy and intimacy with God, highlighting the personal nature of prayer. This instruction underscores the importance of focusing on God rather than seeking human approval.<p><b>shut your door</b><br>Closing the door symbolizes shutting out distractions and creating a sacred space for communion with God. It reflects the need for undisturbed time with the Father, free from the influence of the outside world. This act of closing the door is a metaphor for entering into a personal and private dialogue with God.<p><b>and pray to your Father, who is unseen</b><br>God's unseen nature emphasizes His omnipresence and omniscience. Unlike the visible idols of pagan religions, the God of Israel is spirit and cannot be confined to physical form. This phrase encourages believers to trust in the reality of God's presence, even when He is not visible to the human eye. It also reflects the intimate relationship between the believer and God, who is addressed as "Father."<p><b>And your Father, who sees what is done in secret</b><br>God's ability to see what is done in secret highlights His all-knowing nature. This assurance provides comfort to believers, knowing that their sincere prayers are heard by God, even when unnoticed by others. It also serves as a reminder of God's justice and the futility of seeking human approval over divine approval.<p><b>will reward you</b><br>The promise of reward underscores the value God places on genuine, heartfelt prayer. This reward is not necessarily material or immediate but can be understood as spiritual blessings, peace, and a deeper relationship with God. The concept of divine reward is consistent with other biblical teachings, such as in <a href="/hebrews/11-6.htm">Hebrews 11:6</a>, which states that God rewards those who earnestly seek Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, providing instruction on how to pray.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_father.htm">The Father</a></b><br>Refers to God, who is unseen but sees what is done in secret.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/inner_room.htm">Inner Room</a></b><br>A metaphorical or literal place of privacy where one can pray without distraction.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prayer.htm">Prayer</a></b><br>The act of communicating with God, emphasized here as a private and sincere practice.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/r/reward.htm">Reward</a></b><br>The outcome of sincere prayer, as promised by God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_privacy_in_prayer.htm">The Importance of Privacy in Prayer</a></b><br>Jesus emphasizes the need for a private setting to foster genuine communication with God, free from distractions and the temptation to seek human approval.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_omniscience_and_intimacy.htm">God's Omniscience and Intimacy</a></b><br>The verse reassures believers that God sees and values what is done in secret, highlighting His omniscience and the personal relationship He desires with each individual.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/sincerity_over_show.htm">Sincerity Over Show</a></b><br>The focus is on the heart's intention rather than outward appearances.

Not in synagogue or street, nor by the river-side (<a href="/acts/16-13.htm" title="And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spoke to the women which resorted thither.">Acts 16:13</a>); not under the fig-tree in the court-yard (<a href="/john/1-50.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, believe you? you shall see greater things than these.">John 1:50</a>), nor on the housetop where men were wont to pray (<a href="/acts/10-9.htm" title="On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew near to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:">Acts 10:9</a>)--these might, each and all, present the temptations of publicity--but in the steward's closet, in the place which seemed to men least likely, which they would count it irreverent to connect with the idea of prayer. The principle thus clothed in paradox is, of course, that personal prayer should be strictly personal and private. Our Lord's mode of acting on the principle was, it will be remembered, to withdraw from crowds and cities, and to pass the night in prayer on the lonely slopes of the hills of Galilee (<a href="/matthew/14-23.htm" title="And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.">Matthew 14:23</a>; <a href="/mark/6-46.htm" title="And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to pray.">Mark 6:46</a>; <a href="/john/6-15.htm" title="When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.">John 6:15</a>). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But thou</span> (emphatic) <span class="cmt_word">when thou prayset, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray,</span> etc. An adaptation of <a href="/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a> (cf. also <a href="/2_kings/4-33.htm">2 Kings 4:33</a>).
