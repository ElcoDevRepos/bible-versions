This reflects the political and social hierarchy of the time, where Roman officials held significant authority over the Jewish leaders. The Jewish leaders, despite their own authority within the Jewish community, had to appeal to Pilate for matters concerning Roman law and order.<p><b>&#8220;we remember that while He was alive&#8221;</b><br>This phrase indicates the awareness and concern of the Jewish leaders regarding Jesus' previous statements. It shows that Jesus' teachings and predictions were well-known, even among those who opposed Him. This acknowledgment of His words highlights the impact of His ministry and the threat they perceived it posed to their authority and beliefs.<p><b>that deceiver said,</b><br>Referring to Jesus as "that deceiver" reveals the Jewish leaders' rejection of His claims and their view of Him as a false prophet. This term underscores the tension between Jesus and the religious authorities, who saw His teachings as a challenge to their interpretation of the Law and their control over the people. It also fulfills the prophecy of the suffering servant being despised and rejected (<a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>).<p><b>&#8216;After three days I will rise again.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This statement refers to Jesus' prediction of His resurrection, which He mentioned multiple times during His ministry (e.g., <a href="/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21, 17</a>:23, 20:19). The phrase "after three days" is significant in Jewish understanding, as it was a common expression for a period of time that could include parts of three days. The resurrection is a cornerstone of Christian faith, fulfilling Old Testament prophecies such as <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a> and foreshadowing the ultimate victory over sin and death. The Jewish leaders' concern about this prediction indicates their fear of its potential fulfillment and the implications it would have for their authority and the validation of Jesus' claims.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests_and_pharisees.htm">Chief Priests and Pharisees</a></b><br>Religious leaders of the Jewish community who were often in opposition to Jesus.

It is true that the apostles and the good women were far from believing in the realization of this assertion in the manner in which it came to pass. They probably looked for Christ's return in glory to establish his kingdom and to reign as Messiah.
