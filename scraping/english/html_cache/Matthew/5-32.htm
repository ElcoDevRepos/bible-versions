In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus often contrasts His teachings with traditional interpretations of the Law, indicating a deeper understanding and fulfillment of the Law. This authoritative statement reflects His role as the ultimate interpreter of God's will.<p><b>that anyone who divorces his wife</b><br>Divorce in the Jewish context was permitted under Mosaic Law (<a href="/deuteronomy/24.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1-4</a>), but it was often misused. The Pharisees debated the grounds for divorce, with some advocating for a more liberal interpretation. Jesus addresses this issue by focusing on the sanctity of marriage.<p><b>except for sexual immorality</b><br>The Greek term used here is "porneia," which encompasses various forms of sexual misconduct. This exception clause indicates that sexual immorality is a legitimate ground for divorce, aligning with the Jewish understanding of marital unfaithfulness as a serious breach of the marriage covenant.<p><b>brings adultery upon her</b><br>In the cultural context, a divorced woman often faced social stigma and economic hardship. By stating that divorce leads to adultery, Jesus underscores the seriousness of breaking the marriage bond. This reflects the high value placed on marital fidelity and the protection of women from unjust treatment.<p><b>And he who marries a divorced woman commits adultery</b><br>This statement highlights the ongoing implications of divorce and remarriage. It suggests that marriage is a lifelong covenant, and entering into a new marriage while the original spouse is still living constitutes adultery. This teaching aligns with other New Testament passages (e.g., <a href="/mark/10-11.htm">Mark 10:11-12</a>, <a href="/luke/16-18.htm">Luke 16:18</a>) that emphasize the permanence of marriage.<br><br>Overall, this verse calls for a return to the original intent of marriage as a lifelong, faithful union, reflecting God's covenant relationship with His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, delivering the Sermon on the Mount, which is a foundational teaching of Christian ethics and morality.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples_and_the_crowd.htm">The Disciples and the Crowd</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teachings, representing both His close followers and the broader public.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_context_of_first-century_judea.htm">The Context of First-Century Judea</a></b><br>The cultural and religious backdrop where divorce was a debated issue, with varying interpretations of the Mosaic Law.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_sanctity_of_marriage.htm">The Sanctity of Marriage</a></b><br>Marriage is a sacred covenant designed by God, intended to be a lifelong union between a man and a woman.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_exception_clause.htm">The Exception Clause</a></b><br>Jesus acknowledges "sexual immorality" (Greek: "porneia") as a legitimate ground for divorce, emphasizing the seriousness of marital unfaithfulness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_divorce.htm">The Consequences of Divorce</a></b><br>Divorce, outside of the exception given, leads to adultery, highlighting the moral and spiritual implications of breaking the marital bond.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_call_to_faithfulness.htm">The Call to Faithfulness</a></b><br>Believers are called to uphold the sanctity of marriage and strive for reconciliation and forgiveness, reflecting Christ's love and commitment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_grace_and_redemption.htm">The Role of Grace and Redemption</a></b><br>While divorce is a serious matter, God's grace and redemption are available for those who have experienced brokenness in marriage, offering hope and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_5_32_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 5:32?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/What_grounds_for_divorce_in_Matt_5_32.htm">How does Matthew 5:32 define the grounds for permissible divorce?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_5_32_Divorce_consequences.htm">What are the consequences of divorce according to Matthew 5:32?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_5_32_vs_Genesis_2_24_on_marriage.htm">How does Matthew 5:32 relate to Genesis 2:24 on marriage?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Matthew_5_32_to_marriage_today.htm">How can we apply Matthew 5:32 to strengthen our marriages today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/How_to_avoid_divorce_per_Matthew_5_32.htm">What steps can be taken to prevent divorce as warned in Matthew 5:32?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_5_32_on_marriage_sanctity.htm">What does Matthew 5:32 imply about the sanctity of marriage?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_5_32_on_divorce_adultery.htm">How does Matthew 5:32 address the issue of divorce and adultery?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Why_is_divorce_allowed_for_infidelity_only.htm">Why does Matthew 5:32 only allow divorce in cases of sexual immorality?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_5.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 5?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/is_porn_called_a_sin_in_the_bible.htm">Is pornography explicitly labeled a sin in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/what_does_'porneia'_mean_in_the_bible.htm">What does "porneia" mean in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/where_can_the_holy_spirit_be_found.htm">What does 'porneia' mean in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/how_do_shammaite_and_hillelite_differ.htm">What distinguishes Shammaite and Hillelite perspectives?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Matthew 5:32 Mean</div><b>But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife</b><p>&#8226;

The words <span class= "ital">causeth her to commit adultery</span> imply that the "putting away" was legally a divorce <span class= "ital">a vinculo,</span> leaving the wife, and <span class= "ital">a fortiori</span> the husband, at liberty to marry again; for otherwise she could not have incurred the guilt of adultery by a second marriage: but it asserts that in such a case, when divorce was obtained on any other ground than the specific sin which violated the essence of the marriage contract, man's law (even that of Moses) was at variance with the true eternal law of God.<p><span class= "bld">Whosoever shall marry her that is divorced.</span>--The Greek is less definite, and may be rendered either "a woman who has been put away," or better, "her when she has been put away." Those who take the former construction, infer from it the absolute unlawfulness of marriage with a divorced woman under any circumstances whatever; some holding that the husband is under the same restrictions, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>that the <span class= "ital">vinculum matrimonii</span> is absolutely indissoluble; while others teach that in the excepted case, both the husband and the wife gain the right to contract a second marriage. The Romish Church, in theory, takes the former view, the Greek and most Reformed Churches the latter; while some codes, like those of some countries in modern Europe, go back to the looser interpretation of <a href="/deuteronomy/24-1.htm" title="When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>, and allow the divorce <span class= "ital">a vinculo</span> for many lesser causes than incontinence. Of these contending views, that which is intermediate between the two extremes seems to be most in harmony with the true meaning of our Lord's words. The words "put away" would necessarily convey to His Jewish hearers the idea of an entire dissolution of the marriage union, leaving both parties free to contract a fresh marriage; and if it were not so, then the case in which He specially permits that dissolution would stand on the same level as the others. The injured husband would still be bound to the wife who had broken the vow which was of the essence of the marriage-contract. But if he was free to marry again, then the guilt of adultery could not possibly attach to her subsequent marriage with another. The context, therefore, requires us to restrict that guilt to the case of a wife divorced for other reasons, such as Jewish casuistry looked on as adequate. This, then, seems the true law of divorce for the Church of Christ as such to recognise. The question as to how far national legislation may permit divorce for other causes, such as cruelty or desertion, seems to stand on a different footing, and must be discussed on different grounds. In proportion as the "hardness of heart" which made the wider license the least of two evils prevails now, it may be not only expedient, but right and necessary, though it implies a standard of morals lower than the law of Christ, to meet it, as it was met of old, by a like reluctant permission.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - (For full notes, cf. <a href="/matthew/19-9.htm">Matthew 19:9</a>.)
