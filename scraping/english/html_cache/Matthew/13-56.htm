The mention of His sisters indicates that Jesus had a larger family, which was typical in Jewish culture of the time. The reference to His sisters being "with us" suggests that they were known to the community, emphasizing Jesus' ordinary upbringing. This familiarity with His family contributed to the skepticism of the townspeople, as they struggled to reconcile Jesus' humble origins with His wisdom and miraculous powers. The mention of sisters also aligns with the cultural context of first-century Jewish society, where family ties were significant, and women were often identified in relation to their male relatives.<p><b>Where then did this man get all these things?&#8221;</b><br>This question reflects the astonishment and disbelief of the people of Nazareth regarding Jesus' teachings and miracles. The phrase "this man" indicates a degree of dismissiveness, as they refer to Jesus in a way that underscores their perception of Him as merely one of their own, rather than acknowledging His divine nature. The question reveals their struggle to understand the source of Jesus' authority and wisdom, as they were aware of His ordinary background and lacked faith in His divine mission. This skepticism is echoed in other parts of the Gospels, where Jesus' identity and authority are questioned by those who knew Him before His public ministry. The phrase also connects to the broader theme of prophetic fulfillment, as Jesus' rejection by His own people was foretold in the Scriptures, highlighting the tension between human expectations and divine revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>- Central figure in the New Testament, whose teachings and miracles are the foundation of Christian faith.

This echoes <a href="/john/1-46.htm">John 1:46</a>, where Nathanael initially doubts anything good can come from Nazareth.<p>&#8226; Unbelief even extended to His siblings; &#8220;even His own brothers did not believe in Him&#8221; at first (<a href="/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a>). After the resurrection, however, they joined the early church in prayer (<a href="/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a>), and James became a leader in Jerusalem (<a href="/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>).<p>&#8226; The mention of sisters highlights how fully God entered our world: Jesus grew up in a real family, yet remained sinless (<a href="/hebrews/4-15.htm">Hebrews 4:15</a>), fulfilling <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>&#8217;s promise of Immanuel&#8212;God with us.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Where then did this man get all these things?&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; The same neighbors who watched Jesus mature could not explain the authority behind His teaching and miracles (<a href="/matthew/13-54.htm">Matthew 13:54&#8211;55</a>; <a href="/mark/6-2.htm">Mark 6:2</a>). Their question reveals spiritual blindness rather than sincere inquiry.<p>&#8226; They saw only &#8220;this man,&#8221; the carpenter&#8217;s son, missing that &#8220;the Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him&#8221; (<a href="/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2</a>). As <a href="/john/7-15.htm">John 7:15</a> records, crowds later marveled, &#8220;How does this man have such learning without having studied?&#8221;<p>&#8226; Jesus Himself answers elsewhere: &#8220;My teaching is not My own; it comes from Him who sent Me&#8221; (<a href="/john/7-16.htm">John 7:16</a>) and &#8220;the Father who dwells in Me does His works&#8221; (<a href="/john/14-10.htm">John 14:10</a>).<p>&#8226; Peter affirms at Pentecost that God authenticated Jesus &#8220;by miracles, wonders, and signs&#8221; (<a href="/acts/2-22.htm">Acts 2:22</a>). The origin of &#8220;all these things&#8221; is the Father, demonstrating that Jesus is both fully man and fully God.<p>&#8226; Their rejection fulfills the pattern of prophets without honor in their hometowns (<a href="/luke/4-24.htm">Luke 4:24</a>) and showcases the danger of valuing familiarity over faith (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/13-56.htm">Matthew 13:56</a> records hometown skepticism that failed to see beyond Jesus&#8217; familiar family ties and humble upbringing. His literal sisters living among them proved His real humanity, while their question about His wisdom and power exposed hearts unwilling to acknowledge His divine mission. Scripture answers both doubts: Jesus had a genuine earthly family, and He received His teaching and miracles directly from the Father. Recognizing both truths invites us to honor the Lord who became one of us yet speaks and acts as God Himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 56.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his sisters.</span> Mentioned only here and in the parallel passage in Mark (cf. also "Western" authorities in <a href="/mark/3-32.htm">Mark 3:32</a>, where see Westcott and Heft, 'Append.').
