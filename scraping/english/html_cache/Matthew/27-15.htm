This custom is not documented outside the Gospels, but it aligns with Roman practices of clemency and public appeasement. The governor here refers to Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect of Judea, who held the power to grant such pardons.<p><b>at the feast</b><br>The feast mentioned is the Passover, a significant Jewish festival commemorating the Israelites' liberation from Egyptian slavery. This time of year drew large crowds to Jerusalem, increasing the potential for unrest, which Roman authorities were keen to manage. The Passover's themes of liberation and deliverance provide a poignant backdrop for the events of Jesus' trial and crucifixion.<p><b>to release to the crowd</b><br>The act of releasing a prisoner to the crowd underscores the political dynamics at play. Pilate's decision to involve the crowd in the choice of prisoner reflects his attempt to placate the Jewish populace and avoid inciting a riot. This interaction highlights the tension between Roman authority and Jewish expectations.<p><b>a prisoner of their choosing</b><br>The choice given to the crowd introduces the concept of substitution, a key theme in Christian theology. The crowd's choice between Jesus and Barabbas (a known insurrectionist) symbolizes the broader spiritual choice between sin and salvation. This moment foreshadows the substitutionary atonement of Christ, where Jesus takes the place of sinners. The decision also reflects the fickle nature of public opinion and the influence of religious leaders in swaying the crowd's choice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/governor.htm">Governor (Pontius Pilate)</a></b><br>The Roman governor of Judea, responsible for maintaining order and administering justice.

The fact that the release of criminals was a common incident of a Latin <span class= "ital">lectisternium,</span> or feast in honour of the gods, makes the latter the more probable. If introduced by Pilate (and this is the only recorded instance of the practice) it was, we may believe, a concession intended to conciliate those whom his previous severities had alienated. Before this stage of the proceedings we have to place (1) the second conference between Pilate and the priests after his dialogue with our Lord (<a href="/context/luke/23-4.htm" title="Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.">Luke 23:4-5</a>), and their definite charge of sedition, now urged for the first time; and (2) his attempt, catching at the word "Galilee" as the scene of our Lord's work, to transfer the responsibility of judging to Herod (<a href="/context/luke/23-6.htm" title="When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.">Luke 23:6-12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 15-26.</span> - <span class="accented">Barabbas preferred to Jesus.</span> (<a href="/mark/15-6.htm">Mark 15:6-15</a>; <a href="/luke/23-17.htm">Luke 23:17-25</a>; <a href="/john/18-39.htm">John 18:39, 40</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - Pilate now tries another expedient for delivering himself from the responsibility of condemning Jesus. <span class="cmt_word">At that feast</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">at a feast</span>, at feast time).
