This setting is significant as it mirrors the 40 years the Israelites spent in the desert, highlighting Jesus as the true and faithful Israel. His response is immediate and authoritative, demonstrating His reliance on Scripture as the ultimate source of truth and guidance.<p><b>It is written</b><br>Jesus begins His response by quoting Scripture, specifically from the Old Testament. This phrase underscores the authority and permanence of God's Word. By using Scripture, Jesus sets an example for believers to rely on the Bible as the foundation for resisting temptation and discerning truth.<p><b>Man shall not live on bread alone</b><br>This part of the verse is a direct quote from <a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>, where Moses reminds the Israelites of their dependence on God during their wilderness journey. The emphasis here is on the insufficiency of physical sustenance alone for true life. Jesus highlights that human existence is not merely about physical needs but also spiritual nourishment.<p><b>but on every word that comes from the mouth of God</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the necessity of spiritual sustenance, which is found in God's Word. It points to the comprehensive nature of Scripture as essential for life, guidance, and spiritual health. The "word" here is not limited to written Scripture but includes all of God's revelations and commands.

Jesus defeats temptation by esteeming Scripture above physical necessity, inviting us to live the same way&#8212;feeding on the totality of God&#8217;s Word, trusting its authority, and obeying it in daily life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">It is written.</span>--The words of all the three answers to the Tempter come from two chapters of Deuteronomy, one of which (Deuteronomy 6) supplied one of the passages (6:4-9) for the phylacteries or frontlets worn by devout Jews. The fact is every way suggestive. A prominence was thus given to that portion of the book, which made it an essential part of the education of every Israelite. The words which our Lord now uses had, we must believe, been familiar to Him from His childhood, and He had read their meaning rightly. With them He may have sustained the faith <span class= "ital">of</span> others in the struggles of the Nazareth home with poverty and want. And now He finds in them a truth which belongs to His high calling as well as to His life of lowliness. "Not by bread only doth man live, but by the word, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the will, of God." He can leave His life and all that belongs to it in His Father's hands. In so losing His life, if that should be the issue, He is certain that He shall save it. If His Father has given Him a work to do, He will enable Him to fulfil it. As this act of faith throws us back on the training of the childhood, so we trace its echoes in the after-teaching of the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="/context/matthew/6-25.htm" title="Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor yet for your body, what you shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?">Matthew 6:25-32</a>), of <a href="/matthew/10-39.htm" title="He that finds his life shall lose it: and he that loses his life for my sake shall find it.">Matthew 10:39</a>, yet more in that of John 6. The experience of the wilderness clothed the history of the bread from heaven with a new significance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is written</span>. Our Lord's three quotations are from <a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/6-16.htm">Deuteronomy 6:16, 13</a>. Some portion of Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 6:4-9; 11:13-21, because included in the Sh'ma) was the first part of Scripture taught a Jewish child. Possibly, though there is no evidence upon the subject, the neighbouring portions were often added. If they had been in our Lord's case, such a recurrence of them to his mind in his present state of exhaustion is in complete accord with psychological probability. <span class="cmt_word">Man... God</span> (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-3.htm">Deuteronomy 8:3</a>, LXX.). As we could not accept Weiss's interpretation of the object of the devil's temptation, so neither can we accept his interpretation of our Lord's reply, that it is equivalent to "Not by means either natural or supernatural, is man's life really sustained, but by exact obedience to God's command." Our Lord quotes the passage in its primary meaning, which was fully applicable to the present occasion. It is equivalent to "Man lives, not necessarily by natural means, but by even supernatural means, if God so wishes." "The creative word, the <span class="greek">&#x1fe4;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, which alone imparts to the bread its sustaining power, can sustain, even as he is confident that in the present need it will sustain, apart from the bread" (Trench, 'Studies,' p. 35). The words of Deuteronomy are paraphrased in Wisd. 16:26, where the author, in a thoroughly Jewish exposition, enumerates the lessons taught by the giving of the manna. "It was altered... that thy children, O Lord, whom thou lovest, might know that it is not the growing of fruits that nourisheth man; but that it is thy Word, which preserveth them that put their trust in thee." <span class="cmt_word">By every word</span>. <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;</span> (Textus Receptus; Westcott and Hort) is doubtless right. The alteration to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span> (Lath-mann, Tregelles) is probably due to a tendency towards the simple expression of <span class="accented">means</span>, but perhaps to the feeling that life, especially spiritual life, is maintained rather <span class="accented">in</span> a sphere than on a basis (cf. <a href="/romans/10-5.htm">Romans 10:5</a>; <a href="/galatians/3-12.htm">Galatians 3:12</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/4-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">But</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">[Jesus] answered,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(apokritheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;It is written:</span><br /><span class="grk">&#915;&#941;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#960;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(Gegraptai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Perfect Indicative Middle or Passive - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1125.htm">Strong's 1125: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary verb; to 'grave', especially to write; figuratively, to describe.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8216;Man</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(anthr&#333;pos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_444.htm">Strong's 444: </a> </span><span class="str2">A man, one of the human race.
