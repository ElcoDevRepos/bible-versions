It reflects the Jewish leadership's attempt to resolve the issue of what to do with the thirty pieces of silver returned by Judas. The act of conferring suggests a formal decision-making process, which was typical of the Sanhedrin, the ruling council in Jerusalem. This decision-making process highlights the leaders' concern for maintaining ritual purity, as the money was considered blood money and could not be placed in the temple treasury.<p><b>they used the money</b><br>The money in question is the thirty pieces of silver that Judas Iscariot received for betraying Jesus. This sum was significant, equivalent to the price of a slave, as noted in <a href="/exodus/21-32.htm">Exodus 21:32</a>. The use of this money for a specific purpose underscores the leaders' desire to distance themselves from the guilt associated with Jesus' death, while also fulfilling their legal and religious obligations.<p><b>to buy the potter&#8217;s field</b><br>The potter's field was likely a piece of land used by potters to extract clay for their work. Such fields were often left barren and considered of little value once the clay was exhausted. The purchase of this field with the blood money fulfills the prophecy found in <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>, which speaks of thirty pieces of silver being cast to the potter. This act also foreshadows the redemptive work of Christ, who transforms what is considered worthless into something of eternal value.<p><b>as a burial place for foreigners</b><br>The designation of the field as a burial place for foreigners, or "strangers," reflects the Jewish customs of the time, which required separate burial grounds for non-Jews. This practice ensured that the land remained ritually pure for Jewish use. The choice to use the field in this way demonstrates a practical solution to a religious problem, while also symbolizing the inclusive nature of Christ's sacrifice, which extends beyond the Jewish people to all nations, as seen in passages like <a href="/isaiah/56-6.htm">Isaiah 56:6-8</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/c/chief_priests_and_elders.htm">Chief Priests and Elders</a></b><br>Religious leaders of the Jewish community who were responsible for making decisions regarding temple practices and legal matters.

It is probable that it had been worked out in course of time, and was now in the state of a disused quarry. It was necessary, now that Roman soldiers were often stationed in the city, and men of all nations came to it, to provide some burial-place for them; but no Jew would admit their bones into the sepulchre of his fathers. On the other hand, every devout Jew would shrink from the thought of burying his dead in the foul and hateful spot which had become the type of the unseen Gehenna. (See Notes on <a href="/matthew/5-22.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.">Matthew 5:22</a>.) There was, therefore, a subtle fitness of association in the policy which the priests adopted. The place was itself accursed; it was bought with accursed money; it was to be used for the burial of the accursed strangers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They took counsel.</span> They deliberated how to dispose of this blood money.

It is traditionally said to have lain on the south of Jerusalem - on the hillside across the valley of Hinnom, on what is called the Hill of Evil Counsel. Here is found a tract of clay, which is still used by the potters of the city. In the time of our Lord. the clay probably was considered to be exhausted, and the area, excavated in all directions, and useless for agricultural purposes, was sold for a trifling price. <span class="cmt_word">To bury strangers in</span>. The "strangers" are probably not pagans, but foreign Jews and Gentile proselytes, who came to Jerusalem to attend the festival, and died there. Others think that foreigners (Greeks and Romans, etc.) exclusively are meant, the Jews regarding their very presence in the holy city as defilement, and a cemetery purchased by unclean money a fitting spot for their interment. The "field" was set apart in the Crusaders' times as a burial place for pilgrims, and to this day contains a charnel house wherein are deposited the poor and unhonoured dead of Jerusalem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[After]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#948;&#8050;</span> <span class="translit">(de)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1161.htm">Strong's 1161: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary particle; but, and, etc.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">conferring together,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#945;&#946;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(labontes)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Active - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2983.htm">Strong's 2983: </a> </span><span class="str2">(a) I receive, get, (b) I take, lay hold of. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[they used]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#958;</span> <span class="translit">(ex)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1537.htm">Strong's 1537: </a> </span><span class="str2">From out, out from among, from, suggesting from the interior outwards.
