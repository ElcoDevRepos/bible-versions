Judas's betrayal was prophesied in the Old Testament, notably in <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a>, which speaks of a close friend who would turn against the Messiah. Judas's role as the betrayer is significant in the narrative of Jesus's passion, highlighting themes of treachery and the fulfillment of divine prophecy. Historically, Judas was one of the twelve apostles, entrusted with the group's finances, which suggests a level of trust and responsibility. His actions set in motion the events leading to the crucifixion, a pivotal moment in Christian theology.<p><b>said, &#8220;Surely not I, Rabbi?&#8221;</b><br>Judas's question is both a denial and a form of address that reveals his relationship with Jesus. The term "Rabbi" was a respectful title for a teacher or master, indicating Judas's acknowledgment of Jesus's authority and role as a teacher. However, his use of "Rabbi" instead of "Lord," which other disciples used, may suggest a lack of deeper spiritual recognition of Jesus's divine nature. This moment occurs during the Last Supper, a significant event in the Christian tradition, where Jesus institutes the Eucharist. Judas's question is ironic, as he already had conspired with the chief priests to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver, as recorded earlier in the chapter.<p><b>Jesus answered, &#8220;You have said it yourself.&#8221;</b><br>Jesus's response to Judas is both an affirmation and a subtle revelation of Judas's impending betrayal. This phrase can be seen as a form of indirect confirmation, a common rhetorical device in Jewish culture, where the speaker allows the listener to acknowledge their own guilt or responsibility. Jesus's calm acknowledgment of Judas's betrayal underscores His foreknowledge and acceptance of the events that would lead to His crucifixion, fulfilling His mission as the sacrificial Lamb. This interaction also highlights Jesus's omniscience and the fulfillment of His role as the Messiah, who would suffer and die for the sins of humanity, as foretold in <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure of the New Testament, Jesus is the Messiah and the Son of God.

Judas alone substitutes &#8220;Rabbi&#8221; for &#8220;Lord,&#8221; exposing a heart that respects Jesus as teacher but refuses Him as Master (cf. <a href="/john/13-13.htm">John 13:13</a>).<p>&#8226; Judas&#8217; question is feigned innocence, a cover for deceit (<a href="/proverbs/26-24.htm">Proverbs 26:24-26</a>).<p>&#8226; His hypocrisy fulfills <a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>&#8212;lips honoring God while the heart remains far away.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Jesus answered, &#8220;You have said it yourself.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Jesus affirms Judas&#8217; guilt without publicly naming him, offering both a private warning and an opportunity to repent (<a href="/john/13-27.htm">John 13:27</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase places responsibility squarely on Judas; the betrayer condemns himself by his own words (<a href="/2_samuel/12-5.htm">2 Samuel 12:5-7</a>).<p>&#8226; Christ&#8217;s calm response displays authority and composure; nothing will derail the divine plan of redemption (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/26-25.htm">Matthew 26:25</a> exposes the contrast between outward appearance and inward reality.

Then said Jesus to him, That you do, do quickly.">John 13:27</a>). Did his Master (he calls Him by the wonted title of honour, Rabbi) indeed know his guilt? It would appear from St. John's narrative (<a href="/john/13-29.htm" title="For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said to him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.">John 13:29</a>) that the dread answer, "Thou hast said;" was not heard by all. All that they did hear was the command, "What thou doest, do quickly;" and some at least, probably the rest who were not in the secret of the signal, thought that that command referred to some matter connected with his customary work as the bursar of the company. He was to buy what was needed for the feast (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> probably, the customary solemn meal, or <span class= "ital">Chagigah,</span> of the day that followed on the Paschal Supper), or to give alms to the poor. He, however, understood the meaning of the words, and straightway went out (<a href="/context/john/13-27.htm" title="And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus to him, That you do, do quickly.">John 13:27-30</a>). It follows, from this view of the sequence of events, that though he had eaten bread with his Master, he did not partake of the bread and the cup that were to be the signs of the New Covenant. At this stage St. John inserts the words as to the new commandment, "that ye should love another," which was embodied in that act of fellowship.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Answered and said, Master, is it I?</span> <span class="greek">&#x39c;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>; <span class="accented">It is not I, is it?</span> as ver. 22. Judas probably had not been one of those who put this question before, and now, availing himself of his proximity to Jesus (see on ver. 23), he has the inconceivable effrontery to make this inquiry privately, as if to assure himself whether Christ was conscious of his treachery or not. It is remarked that he does not call Jesus "Lord," as the other apostles, but "Rabbi," a coldly ceremonious title (so in the garden, ver. 49) The gentle Jeans reproaches him not, but answers him in low tones unheard by the rest (<a href="/john/13-28.htm">John 13:28, 29</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast said.</span> A common formula, equivalent to "yes."
