In the context of <a href="/matthew/12.htm">Matthew 12</a>, Jesus is addressing the Pharisees who accused Him of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul. The statement underscores the impossibility of neutrality in spiritual matters. In the broader biblical context, this aligns with the call for wholehearted devotion found in <a href="/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, where love for God is to be with all one's heart, soul, and strength. The cultural context of first-century Judaism was one of strict religious adherence, and Jesus' claim here challenges the religious leaders' understanding of loyalty to God. This phrase also connects to the prophetic imagery of the Messiah as a dividing line, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/8-14.htm">Isaiah 8:14-15</a>, where the Messiah is a sanctuary for some and a stone of offense for others.<p><b>and he who does not gather with Me scatters</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the active role required in following Jesus. Gathering with Him implies working towards the kingdom of God, akin to the imagery of a shepherd gathering sheep, as seen in <a href="/john/10-14.htm">John 10:14-16</a>. The scattering refers to the consequences of not aligning with Jesus' mission, which can lead to division and disunity, reminiscent of the scattering of Israel due to disobedience (<a href="/jeremiah/23.htm">Jeremiah 23:1-2</a>). Historically, Jesus' ministry was about gathering the lost sheep of Israel (<a href="/matthew/15-24.htm">Matthew 15:24</a>), and this phrase calls for participation in that mission. Theologically, it reflects the eschatological gathering of believers at the end of the age, as prophesied in passages like <a href="/isaiah/11-12.htm">Isaiah 11:12</a>. The imagery of gathering versus scattering also ties into the parable of the wheat and the tares (<a href="/matthew/13-24.htm">Matthew 13:24-30</a>), where the final judgment will separate the faithful from the unfaithful.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this verse, Jesus is addressing the Pharisees and the crowd, emphasizing the importance of allegiance to Him.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees.htm">Pharisees</a></b><br>A religious group in Israel known for strict adherence to the Law and traditions, often in opposition to Jesus' teachings.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crowd.htm">The Crowd</a></b><br>The general public who were witnesses to Jesus' teachings and miracles, often caught between the teachings of Jesus and the Pharisees.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/a/allegiance_to_christ.htm">Allegiance to Christ</a></b><br>This verse calls for a clear decision to follow Jesus.

Anything less is, in His own words, to be &#8220;against&#8221; Him and to &#8220;scatter.&#8221;<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(30) <span class= "bld">He that is not with me is against me.</span>--The words seem at first at variance with the answer to the sons of Zebedee, when they reported that they had seen one casting out devils in the name of Christ, and had forbidden him "because he followed not" with them. Then they heard," Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us" (<a href="/luke/9-50.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.">Luke 9:50</a>); and those words have naturally been the watchword of those who rejoice when Christ is preached every way, and by whatever organisation. In reality, however, the two formulae do but present the opposite poles of the same truth. In the great struggle between light and darkness, good and evil, God and the enemy of God, there is no neutrality. The man of whom the two disciples complained was fighting against the devil in the name of Christ, and was therefore with Him. The Pharisees were hindering and slandering that work, and therefore were on the side of Satan. They were not gathering in God's harvest of souls, and therefore they were scattering and wasting.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="/luke/11-23.htm">Luke 11:23</a>, omitted in Mark. The aim of this verse is doubtful. <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> It may be addressed to the Pharisees, with the object of showing them what their words really implied. They were not due, as some might think, to mere indifferentism or to a judicial neutrality; such a relation to him was impossible. They were due to opposition of inner life and of outward energy. Thus their words denoted complete separation from him. This he brings out more clearly in the two following verses. <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> This interpretation, however, would attribute to the Pharisees too great an ignorance of their own feelings of opposition to Christ, and it is therefore best to understand the verse as addressed to the many bystanders. Christ has do-fended himself from the accusation brought against him, and now urges these waverers not to be content with only not opposing him, but to take sides - for, in fact, they cannot help doing so. Indifference in this case is only another name for opposition; not actively to help is really to hinder. Thus understood, the lesson of this verse finds its parallel in vers. 43-45, by which, indeed, it is immediately followed in Luke. <span class="cmt_word">He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad</span>. The first clause speaks of the inner disposition, that which forms the real being of the man; the second, of his energy. Observe that the figure of the second clause appears to be connected with that of ver. 29. If Christ's property is not collected, it is driven further from him. Christ and Christians must gather (<a href="/john/11-52.htm">John 11:52</a>; cf. Bengel). For <span class="accented">gathereth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), cf. also <a href="/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>; <a href="/matthew/13-30.htm">Matthew 13:30</a>. In <span class="accented">scattereth abroad</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>) the thought almost leaves the simile of the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;</span>, and regards the persons signified. Notice that in <a href="/john/11-52.htm">John 11:52</a>, referred to above, the two verbs <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> and (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, also occur; the figure there, however, appears to be taken from sheep (cf. <a href="/john/10-12.htm">John 10:12</a>). Further, <a href="/mark/9-40.htm">Mark 9:40</a> and <a href="/luke/9-50.htm">Luke 9:50</a> record the saying, "He that is not against us is for us," which was addressed to our Lord's disciples. Both sayings are necessary; earnest Christians need to remember that when outsiders do anything in Christ's name, it must, on the whole, forward his cause (<a href="/philippians/1-18.htm">Philippians 1:18</a>); the undecided must face the fact that neutrality is impossible. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/12-30.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">He who</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8009;</span> <span class="translit">(Ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
