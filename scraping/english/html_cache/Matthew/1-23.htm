The term "virgin" is significant, emphasizing the divine nature of Jesus' conception, as Mary was a virgin when she conceived by the Holy Spirit (<a href="/luke/1-34.htm">Luke 1:34-35</a>). This miraculous event underscores the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy and highlights the supernatural intervention of God in human history.<p><b>and will give birth to a son</b><br>The birth of a son signifies the fulfillment of God's promise to send a Savior. In Jewish culture, the birth of a son was often seen as a continuation of the family line and a blessing. This son, however, is unique, as He is the promised Messiah, the one who would bring salvation to His people. The genealogies in <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a> trace Jesus' lineage, affirming His rightful place in the line of David, fulfilling the covenant promises made to David (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>).<p><b>and they will call Him Immanuel</b><br>The name "Immanuel" means "God with us," signifying the incarnation of God in the person of Jesus Christ. This name reflects the profound truth that God has come to dwell among His people, bridging the gap between the divine and human. The presence of God with His people is a recurring theme throughout Scripture, seen in the tabernacle and temple, and ultimately fulfilled in Jesus (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>).<p><b>(which means, &#8220;God with us&#8221;)</b><br>This parenthetical explanation clarifies the meaning of "Immanuel" for readers, emphasizing the theological significance of Jesus' birth. The concept of "God with us" is central to the Christian faith, as it assures believers of God's intimate involvement in their lives. This presence is further affirmed in the Great Commission, where Jesus promises to be with His followers always (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>). The incarnation is a cornerstone of Christian doctrine, affirming that Jesus is both fully God and fully man, a mystery that is foundational to understanding His role as Savior and Redeemer.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/v/virgin_mary.htm">Virgin Mary</a></b><br>The young woman chosen by God to bear His Son, fulfilling the prophecy of a virgin birth.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The Son born to Mary, who is called Immanuel, signifying "God with us."<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/i/immanuel.htm">Immanuel</a></b><br>A name meaning "God with us," highlighting the divine nature and mission of Jesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/p/prophet_isaiah.htm">Prophet Isaiah</a></b><br>The Old Testament prophet who originally prophesied the virgin birth in <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm">Isaiah 7:14</a>.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/bethlehem.htm">Bethlehem</a></b><br>The prophesied birthplace of Jesus, fulfilling the Messianic prophecy of <a href="/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a>.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_fulfillment_of_prophecy.htm">The Fulfillment of Prophecy</a></b><br><a href="/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a> highlights the fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy, demonstrating God's faithfulness and the reliability of Scripture.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_incarnation_of_christ.htm">The Incarnation of Christ</a></b><br>The name Immanuel signifies the profound mystery of the incarnation&#8212;God taking on human flesh to dwell among us.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_presence_with_us.htm">God's Presence with Us</a></b><br>Immanuel assures us of God's continual presence in our lives, offering comfort and guidance through the Holy Spirit.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_significance_of_names.htm">The Significance of Names</a></b><br>In biblical times, names held deep significance.

As we find them in a literal translation from the Hebrew, the words of <a href="/isaiah/7-14.htm" title="Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.">Isaiah 7:14</a> run thus:--"Behold, the maiden conceives and bears a son, and calls his name Immanuel." If we read these words in connection with the facts recorded in that chapter--the alliance of the kings of Syria and Israel against Judah, Isaiah's promise of deliverance, and his offer of a sign in attestation of his promise, the hypocritical refusal of that offer by Ahaz, who preferred resting on his plan of an alliance with Assyria--their natural meaning seems to be this:--The prophet either points to some maiden of marriageable years, or speaks as if he saw one in his vision of the future, and says that the sign shall be that she shall conceive and bear a <span class= "ital">son</span> (the fulfilment of <span class= "ital">this</span> prediction constituting the sign, without assuming a supernatural conception), and that she should give to that son a name which would embody the true hope of Israel--"God is with us." The early years of that child should be nourished, not on the ordinary food of a civilised and settled population, but on the clotted milk and wild honey, which were (as we see in the case of the Baptist) the food of the dwellers in the wilderness, and which appear in <a href="/context/matthew/1-21.htm" title="And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.">Matthew 1:21-22</a>, as part of the picture of the desolation to which the country would be reduced by the Assyrian invasion. But in spite of that misery, even before the child should attain to the age at which he could refuse the evil and choose the good, the land of those whom Ahaz and his people were then dreading should be "forsaken of both her kings." So understood, all is natural and coherent. It must be added, however, that this child was associated by Isaiah with no common hopes. The land of Israel was to be his land (8:8). It is hardly possible not to connect his name with "the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father "of <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm" title="For to us a child is born, to us a son is given: and the government shall be on his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.">Isaiah 9:6</a>; with the Rod and Branch of the Stem of Jesse that was to grow up and present the picture of an ideal king (<a href="/context/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1-9</a>). All that we speak of as the Messianic hopes of the prophet clustered round the child Immanuel. Those hopes were, as we know, not fulfilled as he had expected. They remained for a later generation to feed on with yearning desire. But, so far as we know, they did not suggest to any Jewish interpreter the thought of a birth altogether supernatural. That thought did not enter into the popular expectations of the Messiah. It was indeed foreign to the prevailing feeling of the Jews as to the holiness of marriage and all that it involved, and would have commended itself to none but a small section of the more austere Essenes. St. Matthew, however, having to record the facts of our Lord's birth, and reading Isaiah with a mind full of the new truths which rested on the Incarnation, could not fail to be struck with the correspondence between the facts and the words which he here quotes, and which in the Greek translation were even more emphatic than in the Hebrew, and saw in them a prophecy that had at last been fulfilled. He does not say whether he looked on it as a conscious or unconscious prophecy. He was sure that the coincidence was not casual.<p>The view thus given deals, it is believed fairly, with both parts of the problem. If to some extent it modifies what till lately was the current view as to the meaning of Isaiah's prediction, it meets by anticipation the objection that the narrative was a mythical outgrowth of the prophecy as popularly received. It would be truer to say that it was the facts narrated that first gave occasion to this interpretation of the prophecy. St. Luke, who narrates the facts with far greater fulness than St. Matthew, does so without any reference to the words of the prophet.<p><span class= "bld">Emmanuel.</span>--As spoken by Isaiah, the name, like that of The Lord our Righteousness, applied by Jeremiah not only to the future Christ (<a href="/jeremiah/23-6.htm" title="In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.">Jeremiah 23:6</a>), but to Jerusalem (<a href="/jeremiah/33-16.htm" title="In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely: and this is the name with which she shall be called, The LORD our righteousness.">Jeremiah 33:16</a>), did not necessarily mean more than that "God was with His people," protecting, guiding, ruling them. The Church of Christ has, however, rightly followed the Evangelist in seeing in it the witness to a Presence more direct, personal, immediate than any that had been known before. It was more than a watchword and a hope--more than a "<span class= "ital">nomen et omen"</span>--and had become a divine reality. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 23.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Behold, a virgin</span> ( <span class="accented">the virgin</span>, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son</span>.
