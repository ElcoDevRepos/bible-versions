It follows Peter's confession of Jesus as the Messiah, a pivotal moment in the Gospel narrative. Jesus' reply underscores the significance of divine revelation and the establishment of Peter's role in the early church.<p><b>Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah!</b><br>The use of "blessed" signifies divine favor and approval. Simon, also known as Peter, is acknowledged by his full name, emphasizing his identity and heritage. The reference to "son of Jonah" connects Peter to his familial lineage, which is significant in Jewish culture. This blessing is a recognition of Peter's faith and insight, which is not of human origin.<p><b>For this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood</b><br>This phrase indicates that Peter's understanding did not come from human wisdom or teaching. "Flesh and blood" is a common Jewish idiom for human beings, emphasizing the contrast between human and divine revelation. This highlights the theme of spiritual insight being a gift from God, not attainable through human effort alone.<p><b>but by My Father in heaven</b><br>The source of Peter's revelation is identified as God the Father, underscoring the divine nature of true understanding. This connection to the Father in heaven emphasizes the intimate relationship between Jesus and God, a central theme in the Gospel. It also points to the divine authority behind Jesus' mission and the establishment of the church.

You will be called Cephas&#8217;&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-42.htm">John 1:42</a>) now confirms that earlier promise.<p>&#8226; The blessing celebrates Peter&#8217;s confession in the previous verse: &#8220;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>). Correct belief always brings God&#8217;s approval (cf. <a href="/john/20-29.htm">John 20:29</a>, &#8220;Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed&#8221;).<p>&#8226; This moment shows that when God reveals truth, He also delights to affirm and encourage the believer.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Flesh and blood&#8221; points to mere human ability. Peter did not reach his confession through debate, polls, or natural reasoning (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-26.htm">1 Corinthians 1:26-29</a>).<p>&#8226; Paul later testifies similarly: &#8220;I did not receive it from any man... but by a revelation of Jesus Christ&#8221; (<a href="/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11-12</a>). Revelation is God&#8217;s sovereign act, not human discovery.<p>&#8226; Natural understanding remains blind to spiritual realities: &#8220;The natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God&#8230; they are spiritually discerned&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse underscores our dependence on supernatural light; salvation begins when God opens eyes we cannot open ourselves (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>but by My Father in heaven</b><p>&#8226; Jesus locates the source: the Father personally disclosed the identity of the Son. Thus Peter&#8217;s confession rests on divine authority.<p>&#8226; Jesus had already taught, &#8220;No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him&#8221; (<a href="/john/6-44.htm">John 6:44</a>). Drawn, Peter speaks.<p>&#8226; This pattern mirrors <a href="/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25-27</a>, where Jesus praises the Father for revealing hidden things &#8220;to little children.&#8221; God does the revealing; believers do the receiving.<p>&#8226; Every genuine confession of Christ flows from the Father of lights (<a href="/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>). Recognizing this humbles us and fuels gratitude, assuring us that our faith stands on an unshakeable foundation.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/16-17.htm">Matthew 16:17</a> shows that recognizing Jesus as the Christ is a gift, not an achievement. Jesus blesses Peter, clarifies that human effort did not produce his insight, and credits the heavenly Father as the revealer. The verse magnifies God&#8217;s grace, assures believers that their faith is divinely grounded, and invites ongoing reliance on the Father who gladly makes His Son known.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona.</span>--Looking to the reality of our Lord's human nature, its capacity for wonder (<a href="/mark/6-6.htm" title="And he marveled because of their unbelief.

And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.">Mark 3:5</a>), sorrow (<a href="/john/11-35.htm" title="Jesus wept.">John 11:35</a>, <a href="/luke/19-41.htm" title="And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,">Luke 19:41</a>), and other emotions, it is not over-bold to recognise in these words something like a tone of exalted joy. It is the first direct personal beatitude pronounced by Him; and, as such, presents a marked contrast to the rebukes which had been addressed to Peter, as to the others, as being "without understanding," "of little faith," with "their heart yet hardened." Here, then, He had found at last the clear, unshaken, unwavering faith which was the indispensable condition for the manifestation of His kingdom as a visible society upon earth. The beatitude is solemnised (as in <a href="/john/1-42.htm" title="And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, You are Simon the son of Jona: you shall be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.">John 1:42</a>) by the full utterance of the name which the disciple had borne before he was called by the new name of Cephas, or Peter, to the work of an Apostle. He was to distinguish between the old natural and the new supernatural life. (Comp. <a href="/john/21-15.htm" title="So when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me more than these? He said to him, Yes, Lord; you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my lambs.">John 21:15</a>.) . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/16.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered and said unto him.</span> This weighty and momentous answer is given alone by St. Matthew. St. Mark, who wrote under the instruction of Peter, and for Roman Christians, mentions it not; the other two evangelists are equally silent, having evidently not understood the special importance attached to it. <span class="cmt_word">Blessed art</span> <span class="cmt_word">thou, Simon Bar-jona.</span> "Blessed," as in the sermon on the mount (ch. 5.), expressing a solemn benediction, not a mere encomium. Peter was highly favoured by a special revelation from God. Christ calls him "son of Jona," to intimate that Peter's confession is true - that he himself is as naturally and truly Son of God as Peter is son of Jona. So Christ addresses him when he restores the fallen apostle at the Sea of Galilee after the second miraculous draught of fishes, reminding him of his frail human nature in the face of great spiritual privileges (<a href="/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15</a>, etc.; comp. Matthew 1:42). Simon would be the name given at his circumcision; Bar-jona, a patronymic to distinguish him from others of the same name. <span class="cmt_word">For</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>). This introduces the reason why Christ calls him "Blessed." <span class="cmt_word">Flesh and blood.</span> This is a phrase to express the idea of the natural man, with his natural endowments and faculties. So St. Paul says (<a href="/galatians/1-16.htm">Galatians 1:16</a>), "I conferred not with flesh and blood;" and "Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood" (<a href="/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>). The Son of Sirach speaks of "the generation of flesh and blood" (Ecclus. 14:18). No natural sagacity, study, or discernment had revealed the great truth. None of these had overcome slowness of apprehension, prejudices of education, slackness of faith. No unregenerate mortal man had taught him the gospel mystery. <span class="cmt_word">My Father which is in heaven.</span> Christ thus accepts Peter's definition of him as "the Son of the living God." None but the Father could have revealed to thee the Son. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/16-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Jesus</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(I&#275;sous)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2424.htm">Strong's 2424: </a> </span><span class="str2">Of Hebrew origin; Jesus, the name of our Lord and two other Israelites.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">replied,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Apokritheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Blessed</span><br /><span class="grk">&#924;&#945;&#954;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Makarios)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3107.htm">Strong's 3107: </a> </span><span class="str2">Happy, blessed, to be envied.
