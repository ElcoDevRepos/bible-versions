The "this" refers to Jesus' response to their challenge about the resurrection, using the example of God being the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, implying that God is the God of the living. The crowds, likely composed of various Jewish groups and individuals gathered in Jerusalem, were attentive to Jesus' teachings, which often challenged the prevailing religious authorities and interpretations of the Law.<p><b>they were astonished</b><br>The reaction of astonishment indicates that Jesus' teaching was both unexpected and profound. His ability to refute the Sadducees' argument with authority and scriptural insight left the audience in awe. This astonishment is a recurring theme in the Gospels, as Jesus often taught with authority that surpassed that of the scribes and Pharisees (<a href="/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28-29</a>). His teachings often revealed deeper truths about God's kingdom, challenging existing beliefs and traditions.<p><b>at His teaching</b><br>Jesus' teaching here not only addressed the immediate question of the resurrection but also revealed deeper theological truths about life, death, and the nature of God. His teachings were rooted in the Hebrew Scriptures, yet they brought new understanding and clarity. This particular teaching emphasized the reality of the resurrection, a concept that was a point of contention among Jewish sects, as the Pharisees believed in it, while the Sadducees did not. Jesus' ability to use Scripture to affirm the resurrection would have been particularly impactful, as it aligned with the Pharisaic belief and challenged the Sadducean denial.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, whose teachings astonish the crowds.

It was the mode of teaching rather than the doctrine taught that astonished them.

The Sadducees, thus answered in the presence of the listening crowds, attempted no reply, slunk away confounded, utterly foiled in their hope of casting ridicule on the teaching of Christ. St. Luke notes that some scribes present, doubtless of the Pharisaic faction, were highly delighted with this public defeat of their adversaries, and cried, in enforced admiration, "Master, thou hast well said!" <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/22-33.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">When</span><br /><span class="grk">&#922;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(Kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#7985;</span> <span class="translit">(hoi)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
