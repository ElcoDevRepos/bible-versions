The irony is profound; Jesus' mission was to save others through His sacrifice, not to save Himself from death. The statement acknowledges His miraculous works, such as healing the sick and raising the dead (e.g., Lazarus in <a href="/john/11-43.htm">John 11:43-44</a>), yet it misunderstands the purpose of His mission. Theologically, this reflects the concept of substitutionary atonement, where Jesus chooses not to save Himself in order to fulfill His role as the Savior of humanity (<a href="/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4-5</a>).<p><b>He is the King of Israel!</b><br>This title, used mockingly by the religious leaders, actually affirms Jesus' true identity. The title "King of Israel" connects to Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah, such as those found in <a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a> and <a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>. Jesus' kingship is spiritual and eternal, contrasting with the political expectations of a messianic king who would liberate Israel from Roman rule. This misunderstanding of His kingship is a recurring theme in the Gospels (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36</a>).<p><b>Let Him come down now from the cross,</b><br>The demand for Jesus to come down from the cross is a challenge to His divine power and authority. It echoes the temptation in the wilderness where Satan challenges Jesus to prove His divinity (<a href="/matthew/4-3.htm">Matthew 4:3-6</a>). The cross is central to Jesus' mission, and coming down would negate the purpose of His incarnation. This moment highlights the tension between human expectations of power and the divine plan of redemption through suffering.<p><b>and we will believe in Him.</b><br>This statement reveals the conditional faith of the religious leaders, who demand a sign to believe. It contrasts with the faith of those who believe without seeing (<a href="/john/20-29.htm">John 20:29</a>). The demand for a miraculous sign is a recurring theme in Jesus' ministry, often met with rebuke (<a href="/matthew/12-38.htm">Matthew 12:38-39</a>). True faith, according to the New Testament, is based on trust in God's promises and the fulfillment of prophecy, not on witnessing miracles (<a href="/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11:1</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure in this passage, crucified and mocked by onlookers.

Jesus had earlier declared, &#8220;No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of My own accord&#8221; (<a href="/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>).<p>- Calling twelve legions of angels was possible (<a href="/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53-54</a>), yet staying on the cross was essential to fulfill <a href="/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a> and to secure our redemption (<a href="/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>).<p>- True power is shown in obedient self-sacrifice, not self-preservation (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He is the King of Israel!</b><p>- The taunt stings with irony. Prophecy had hailed Messiah as Israel&#8217;s King (<a href="/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>; <a href="/psalms/2-6.htm">Psalm 2:6</a>), and the triumphal entry had already affirmed it (<a href="/matthew/21-5.htm">Matthew 21:5</a>).<p>- Even as He hangs in apparent weakness, Jesus remains sovereign; the cross is His throne (<a href="/john/18-36.htm">John 18:36-37</a>).<p>- Nathanael&#8217;s earlier confession, &#8220;You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel&#8221; (<a href="/john/1-49.htm">John 1:49</a>), still stands true, though hidden under suffering.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Let Him come down now from the cross</b><p>- The demand mirrors Satan&#8217;s earlier temptation, &#8220;Throw Yourself down&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/4-6.htm">Matthew 4:6</a>). Both entice Jesus to prove Himself by spectacle instead of submission.<p>- <a href="/psalms/22-7.htm">Psalm 22:7-8</a> foretold these very jeers, showing that even their mockery served God&#8217;s script.<p>- Had He stepped down, atonement would remain unfinished (<a href="/john/12-24.htm">John 12:24</a>), and we would remain unforgiven.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and we will believe in Him</b><p>- History shows signs alone never create saving faith (<a href="/john/12-37.htm">John 12:37</a>; <a href="/luke/16-31.htm">Luke 16:31</a>). Hearts set on unbelief simply set new conditions.<p>- Many who saw Lazarus raised still plotted Jesus&#8217; death (<a href="/john/11-53.htm">John 11:53</a>). The issue is not evidence but willingness to repent (<a href="/matthew/12-39.htm">Matthew 12:39</a>).<p>- Ironically, multitudes would soon believe&#8212;not because He came down, but because He rose up (<a href="/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36-41</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>The crowd&#8217;s ridicule, layer by layer, unveils gospel truth: the miracle-working Savior chose not to save Himself so He could save us; the true King embraced a cross instead of a crown; and the very sign they demanded&#8212;deliverance from death&#8212;would come three days later in resurrection. <a href="/matthew/27-42.htm">Matthew 27:42</a> thus magnifies Jesus&#8217; voluntary, kingly, saving love, proving that His seeming weakness was the greatest display of divine power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/27.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(42) <span class= "bld">He saved others.</span>--The mockers, as before (comp. <a href="/context/john/11-50.htm" title="Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.">John 11:50-51</a>), bear unconscious witness to the truth. They referred, it may be, to the works of healing and the raising of the dead which had been wrought in Galilee and Jerusalem, but their words were true in a yet higher sense. He had come into the world to save others, regardless of Himself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 42.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He</span> <span class="cmt_word">saved others.</span> They knew something of his many miracles of healing; many among them had witnessed the cure of the man blind from his birth (<a href="/john/9.htm">John 9</a>.); most must have heard of the raising of Lazarus; - they made these very works of mercy a reproach against him. He had proved himself a beneficent Saviour; he had shown superhuman power, and yet they say, <span class="cmt_word">Himself he cannot save.</span> There was indeed a sense, not their sense, in which this was true. Christ willed to die; it was his purpose thus to redeem mankind; in adhering to this steadfast determination he could not deliver himself from suffering and death. Some read the clause interrogatively, "Cannot he save himself?" It is then parallel to the expression used at the grave of Lazarus (<a href="/john/11-37.htm">John 11:37</a>). <span class="cmt_word">If he be the King of Israel.</span> "If" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;</span>) is omitted by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, D, L, etc., and many modern editors. Its omission is more concinnons to the other taunts, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> "He saved others;" "He trusted in God." His claim to be Messiah would involve the Kingship of Israel (<a href="/matthew/2-6.htm">Matthew 2:6</a>), which the title over his head asserted. <span class="cmt_word">We will believe him</span> (<span class="greek_word">pisteu/somen au)tw = ""</span>). We will believe (not subj., "let us believe") what he says. The Sinaitic, Vatican, and other good manuscripts read <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "on him." So Westcott and Hort, Tischendorf, etc. This form of expression would imply that they would put their trust in him, become his followers. A confident boast! for they were so fully persuaded of the final triumph of thcir malice, that they decreed they might safely make such a promise. And yet Christ did a greater thing than come down alive from the cross; he rose from the dead; but they believed not in him. And if the sign which they asked had been vouchsafed, they would have explained it away, or evaded its meaning, and nave been no nearer to salvation than now. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/27-42.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">&#8220;He saved</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7956;&#963;&#969;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(es&#333;sen)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 3rd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4982.htm">Strong's 4982: </a> </span><span class="str2">To save, heal, preserve, rescue.
