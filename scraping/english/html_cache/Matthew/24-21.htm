It is a continuation of Jesus' discourse on the Mount of Olives, where He discusses the signs of the end of the age. The timing is crucial, as it follows the abomination of desolation mentioned earlier in the chapter, which is a key prophetic marker.<p><b>there will be great tribulation</b><br>The term "great tribulation" refers to a period of intense suffering and distress. This is a time of unprecedented hardship, often associated with the final judgment and the wrath of God. It is a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecies, such as those found in <a href="/daniel/12.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>, which speak of a time of trouble unlike any other. The tribulation is characterized by both natural and supernatural events that will affect the entire world.<p><b>unseen from the beginning of the world until now</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the unparalleled nature of the tribulation. It suggests that no event in history, no matter how catastrophic, can compare to what will occur during this time. This echoes the language used in the Old Testament, such as in <a href="/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a>, which describes a day of darkness and gloom that has never been seen before. It underscores the severity and uniqueness of the tribulation period.<p><b>and never to be seen again</b><br>The finality of this phrase indicates that the tribulation is a one-time event in human history. It will not be repeated, highlighting its significance in God's redemptive plan. This aligns with the prophetic literature that speaks of a definitive end to human suffering and the establishment of God's eternal kingdom, as seen in <a href="/revelation/21-4.htm">Revelation 21:4</a>, where God promises to wipe away every tear and eliminate death and pain forever.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this prophecy, Jesus is addressing His disciples on the Mount of Olives, providing them with insights into future events.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_disciples.htm">The Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' discourse, they are seeking understanding about the signs of the end times and the coming of the kingdom.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_mount_of_olives.htm">The Mount of Olives</a></b><br>The location where Jesus delivers the Olivet Discourse, a significant place in biblical prophecy and eschatology.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/great_tribulation.htm">Great Tribulation</a></b><br>A period of unprecedented suffering and distress that Jesus describes, which will occur before His second coming.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_world.htm">The World</a></b><br>Refers to the entire human experience and history, emphasizing the global impact of the tribulation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_prophecy.htm">Understanding Prophecy</a></b><br>Recognize the importance of biblical prophecy in understanding God's plan for the world.

One who reads the narrative of Josephus will hardly hesitate to adopt his language, "that all miseries that had been known from the beginning of the world fell short" of those of the siege of the Holy City (<span class= "ital">Wars,</span> v. 13, ?? 4, 5). Other sieges may have witnessed, before and since, scenes of physical wretchedness equally appalling, but nothing that history records offers anything parallel to the alternations of fanatic hope and frenzied despair that attended the breaking up of the faith and polity of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nor then.</span> Jesus gives the reason why this precipitate flight (vers. 16-20) was rendered necessary at the moment spoken of in ver. 15. <span class="cmt_word">Great tribulation.</span> The miseries suffered in the siege of Jerusalem were stupendous To the skilful and fierce attacks of the Romans from without were added from within dire famine and pestilence, dissensions, violence, and continual bloodshed and murder. Josephus estimates the number of those who fell in the siege and capture of Jerusalem at 1,000,000, the usual population being largely increased by the influx of pilgrims attending the Feast of the Passover, and by thousands of fugitives who had flocked in from the country (Josephus. 'Bell. Jud.,' 6:09, 3). He adds that 97,000 were carried away captive during and after the war. <span class="cmt_word">Such as was</span> <span class="cmt_word">not...nor ever shall</span> <span class="cmt_word">be</span> (<a href="/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>). This is not mere hyperbole, but sober fact. Josephus ('Bell. Jud.,' Pro&#183;m. 4) himself bears similar testimony: "Of all the cities under the dominion of Rome, ours was once the most happy, and afterwards the most utterly miserable. For the misfortunes of all the nations upon earth that have ever happened, if they are compared with the calamities to which the Jews were exposed, will, in my opinion, fall far short." Chrysostom sums up the matter thus: "Whence came there thus upon them wrath from God intolerable, and more sore than all that had befallen aforetime, not in Judaea only, but in any part of the world? Is it not quite clear that it was for the deed of the cross and for this rejection? Mark, I pray thee, the exceeding greatness of the ills, when not only compared with the time before, they appear more grievous, but also with all the time to come. For not in all the world, neither in all time that is past, and that is to come, shall any one be able to say such ills have been. And very naturally; for neither had any man perpetrated, not of these that ever have been, nor those to come hereafter, a deed so wicked and horrible" ('Hom.,' <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). The "affliction" spoken of refers not only to bodily sufferings, but to that anguish of mind occasioned by acute apprehension and. expectation of danger, such as was felt in the days before the Flood, and at the time of the oppression of Antiochus Epiphanes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/24-21.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#947;&#8048;&#961;</span> <span class="translit">(gar)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1063.htm">Strong's 1063: </a> </span><span class="str2">For.
