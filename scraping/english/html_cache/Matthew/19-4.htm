His response is authoritative, indicating His role as a teacher and interpreter of the Law. This phrase underscores Jesus' divine wisdom and His ability to address complex issues with clarity. It also highlights His role as the ultimate authority on scriptural interpretation, often challenging the prevailing interpretations of the religious leaders of His time.<p><b>Have you not read</b><br>This phrase emphasizes the importance of Scripture as the foundation for understanding God's will. Jesus often used this rhetorical question to point the Pharisees back to the Scriptures, which they claimed to know well. It suggests that the answers to their questions are already available in the sacred texts, encouraging a return to the original intent of the Scriptures. This also serves as a reminder of the importance of personal engagement with the Bible.<p><b>that from the beginning</b><br>Here, Jesus refers to the creation account in Genesis, indicating that the principles He is about to discuss are rooted in the very foundation of the world. This phrase establishes the timeless nature of God's design for humanity and marriage. It implies that the original creation order is the standard by which all human relationships should be measured, pointing to the unchanging nature of God's purposes.<p><b>the Creator</b><br>This term identifies God as the one who designed and instituted marriage. It affirms the belief in a personal, intentional God who is actively involved in the creation and sustenance of the world. By referring to God as the Creator, Jesus underscores the divine authority behind the institution of marriage, suggesting that it is not merely a human or cultural construct but a divine ordinance.<p><b>&#8216;made them male and female&#8217;</b><br>This phrase is a direct quotation from <a href="/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>, highlighting the complementary nature of men and women in God's design. It affirms the binary nature of gender as part of the created order. This statement is foundational for understanding the biblical view of marriage as a union between one man and one woman. It also reflects the inherent dignity and value of both genders, created in the image of God, and serves as a basis for discussions on gender roles and relationships within a biblical framework.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is responding to a question about divorce posed by the Pharisees.

All his auditors agreed in holding the legality of divorce, though they differed in their estimation of the causes that warranted separation. It was quite a new idea to find the propriety of divorce questioned, and to have their captious question met by an appeal to Scripture which they could not gainsay, and an enunciation of a high ideal of matrimony which their glosses and laxity had miserably perverted or obscured.

The latter is approved by Westcott and Hort. It is best translated, <span class="accented">the Creator</span>. The Vulgate gives, <span class="accented">qui fecit hominem</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>At the beginning</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>). These words should be joined to the following verb <span class="cmt_word">made</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>), and not with the preceding participle, as it is intended to show the primordial design in the creation of man and woman. God made the first members of the human family a male and a female, not a male and females. The lower animals were created separately, male and female; "mankind was created in one person in Adam, and when there was found no help meet for Adam, no companion in body, soul, or spirit, fit for him, then God, instead of creating a wholly new thing, made Eve out of Adam" (Sadler). Two individuals of opposite sexes were thus formed for each other; one was the complement of the other, and the union was perfect and lasted, as long as life. There was in this original institution no room for polygamy, no room for divorce. It was a concrete example of the way in which God unites man and wife. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/19-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Jesus] answered,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(apokritheis)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Participle Passive - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_611.htm">Strong's 611: </a> </span><span class="str2">From apo and krino; to conclude for oneself, i.e. to respond; by Hebraism to begin to speak.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;Have you not read</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#957;&#941;&#947;&#957;&#969;&#964;&#949;</span> <span class="translit">(anegn&#333;te)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Indicative Active - 2nd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_314.htm">Strong's 314: </a> </span><span class="str2">To read, know again, know certainly, recognize, discern.
