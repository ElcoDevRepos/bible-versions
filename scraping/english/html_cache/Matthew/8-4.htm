In the context of <a href="/matthew/8.htm">Matthew 8</a>, Jesus has just healed a leper, demonstrating His power over physical ailments and His compassion for the marginalized. The instruction that follows is significant, as it reflects Jesus' adherence to the Law of Moses and His respect for the established religious practices of the time.<p><b>&#8220;See that you don&#8217;t tell anyone.</b><br>Jesus often instructed those He healed to remain silent about their healing. This is known as the "Messianic Secret," a theme in the Gospels where Jesus seeks to avoid premature recognition as the Messiah. This could be to prevent misunderstandings of His mission, to avoid drawing large crowds that might hinder His ministry, or to delay confrontation with religious authorities. It also emphasizes that Jesus' mission was not just about performing miracles but about spiritual transformation.<p><b>But go, show yourself to the priest</b><br>According to Levitical law (Leviticus 14), a person healed of leprosy was required to present themselves to a priest for examination. This was both a religious and social requirement, as it allowed the healed person to be reintegrated into the community. By instructing the healed man to show himself to the priest, Jesus upholds the Law and ensures the man&#8217;s full restoration to society.<p><b>and offer the gift prescribed by Moses,</b><br>The gift refers to the sacrifices required in <a href="/leviticus/14-10.htm">Leviticus 14:10-32</a>, which included offerings of birds, lambs, and grain. These offerings were a form of thanksgiving and purification, acknowledging God's role in the healing. Jesus' instruction to offer the gift underscores His respect for the Mosaic Law and the importance of gratitude and obedience to God.<p><b>as a testimony to them.&#8221;</b><br>The testimony serves multiple purposes. It is a witness to the priests of the man's healing, potentially leading them to recognize Jesus' authority and divine power. It also serves as a testimony to the community, affirming the man's healing and reinstating him into society. This act points to Jesus as the fulfillment of the Law and the prophets, as He brings physical and spiritual restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus.htm">Jesus</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Jesus is the one who heals the leper and gives him specific instructions afterward.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_leper.htm">The Leper</a></b><br>A man suffering from leprosy who approaches Jesus for healing.

Physical restoration becomes spiritual testimony, proving that Christ&#8217;s works are true, His Word authoritative, and His salvation complete.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">See thou tell no</span> <span class= "bld">man.</span>--St. Mark adds, with his usual vividness, "straitly charged," or vehemently urged him, and "forthwith sent him away." The reasons of the command are not given, but are not far to seek. (1.) The offering of the gift was an act of obedience to the Law (<a href="/leviticus/14-10.htm" title="And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.">Leviticus 14:10</a>; <a href="/context/leviticus/14-21.htm" title="And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil;">Leviticus 14:21-22</a>), and was therefore the right thing for the man to do. In this way also our Lord showed that He had not come to destroy the Law, but to fulfil. (2.) It was the appointed test of the reality and completeness of the cleansing work. (3.) It was better for the man's own spiritual life to cherish his gratitude than to waste it in many words.<p>So much lies on the surface. But as the treatment of leprosy in the Mosaic code was clearly symbolical rather than sanitary, and dealt with the disease as the special type of sin in its most malignant form, so in the healing of the leper we may fairly see the symbol of our Lord's power to purify and save from sin, and in His touching the leper, the close fellowship into which He entered with our unclean nature, that through His touch it might be made clean. The miracle, like most other miracles, was also a parable in act.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of those who were not present (Bengel).
