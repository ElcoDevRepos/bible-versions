People would go to the housetop for relaxation, prayer, or to escape the heat. This phrase suggests urgency, indicating that those on the roof should not delay by descending into the house. The context is a warning about the suddenness of the coming tribulation, emphasizing the need for immediate action without hesitation.<p><b>come down to retrieve anything from his house</b><br>This part of the verse underscores the immediacy and seriousness of the situation. In times of crisis, such as the prophesied destruction of Jerusalem, there would be no time to gather belongings. The instruction reflects a broader biblical theme of prioritizing spiritual readiness over material possessions. This urgency is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/luke/17-31.htm">Luke 17:31</a>, where Jesus warns against turning back for worldly goods. The historical context of the Roman siege of Jerusalem in AD 70 provides a vivid backdrop, as those who heeded such warnings and fled quickly were more likely to survive. This also serves as a metaphor for the Christian life, where believers are called to focus on eternal matters rather than earthly concerns.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The speaker of this passage, delivering the Olivet Discourse, a prophetic message about the end times and the destruction of the temple.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>The immediate audience of Jesus' teaching, who asked about the signs of His coming and the end of the age.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/housetop.htm">Housetop</a></b><br>In ancient Jewish culture, flat rooftops were common and often used as living spaces.

At a moment of danger (in this case that arising from the factions within the city, rather than the invaders without), any delay might prove fatal. Men were to escape as though their life were "given them for a prey" (<a href="/jeremiah/45-5.htm" title="And seek you great things for yourself? seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil on all flesh, said the LORD: but your life will I give to you for a prey in all places where you go.">Jeremiah 45:5</a>), without thinking of their goods or chattels.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Housetop</span>. This was fiat, and used as a place of rest, meditation, and familiar concourse (<a href="/matthew/10-27.htm">Matthew 10:27</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Come down...house.</span> The roof was accessible by two staircases, one external leading from the street or the country, the other mounting from the apartments. The householder was not to descend by this latter to carry off anything from his chambers within, but to escape at once by the outer staircase (setup. <a href="/luke/5-19.htm">Luke 5:19</a>). The flight was to be precipitate, like that of Lot from Sodom (cf. <a href="/luke/17-32.htm">Luke 17:32</a>). The warning was necessary, as, when the Zealots and assassins bad the upper hand, they allowed no one to leave the city. The warning, however, applied to dwellers in any part of Judaea. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/24-17.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[Let no one]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
