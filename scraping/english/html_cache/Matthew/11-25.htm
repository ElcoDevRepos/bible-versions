St. Luke connects them (<a href="/context/luke/10-17.htm" title="And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject to us through your name.">Luke 10:17-24</a>) with the return of the Seventy; but as their mission is not recorded by St. Matthew, it seems reasonable to connect them, as here recorded, with the return of the Twelve, and their report of their work (<a href="/mark/6-30.htm" title="And the apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and told him all things, both what they had done, and what they had taught.">Mark 6:30</a>; <a href="/luke/9-10.htm" title="And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.">Luke 9:10</a>). Their presence, it may be noted, is implied in the narrative with which the next chapter opens. The words, however, were probably repeated as analogous occasions called for them.<p><span class= "bld">I thank thee.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">I confess unto Thee</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> "acknowledge with praise and thanksgiving." The abruptness with which the words come in points to the fragmentary character of the record which St. Matthew incorporates with his Gospel. The context in St. Luke implies a reference to the truths of the kingdom which the disciples had proclaimed, and makes special mention of the joy which thus expressed itself. The two grounds of that joy are inseparably linked together. The "wise and prudent" (comp. the union of the same words in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-19.htm" title="For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.">1Corinthians 1:19</a>) were the scribes and Pharisees, wise in their conceit, seeking men's praise rather than truth as truth, and therefore shut out from the knowledge that requires above all things sincerity of purpose. The "babes" were the disciples who had received the kingdom in the spirit of a little child, child-like, and sometimes even childish, in their thoughts of it, but who, being in earnest and simple-hearted, were brought under the training which was to make them as true scribes for the kingdom of heaven. He, their Lord, taught them as they were able to bear it, giving (to use St. Paul's familiar image) the milk that belonged to babes (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for till now you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able.">1Corinthians 3:2</a>); but beyond His personal teaching there were the flashes of intuition by which (as, conspicuously, in the case of Peter's confession, <a href="/matthew/16-17.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood has not revealed it to you, but my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 16:17</a>) new truths were suddenly disclosed to them, or old truths seen with increasing clearness. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-27.</span> - Parallel passage: <a href="/luke/10-21.htm">Luke 10:21, 22</a>, where the verses are recorded immediately after the return of the seventy. We know no other occasion which would be so likely to evoke this utterance. Although it is just possible that the seventy returned when our Lord was addressing the people in the manner related in the preceding verses of this chapter, it seems much more likely that a sense of a moral and not of a temporal connexion guided St. Matthew in his arrangement. What is true in a time of success (<a href="/luke/10-17.htm">Luke 10:17, 18</a>) is equally true in a time of failure (vers. 20-24). Observe the difference in the style of ver. 27 (<a href="/luke/10-22.htm">Luke 10:22</a>) from that of vers. 25, 26, suggesting the use of another, apparently Johannine, source. But this must have been added before either St. Matthew or St. Luke incorporated the passage. Observe that the comparatively early date thus indicated for Johannine phraseology suggests that the language and form of the Fourth Gospel underwent a long process of development before St. John completed his work. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At that time</span>; <span class="accented">season</span> (Revised Version); <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x1ff7;</span>. St. Luke's phrase ("in that very hour," <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f65;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;</span>) is more precise, definitely connecting the utterance with the return of the seventy. St. Matthew's refers rather to that stage or period in his ministry (cf. <a href="/matthew/12-1.htm">Matthew 12:1</a>; <a href="/matthew/14-1.htm">Matthew 14:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Jesus answered</span>. Only in Matthew. If we could suppose this to be the original context of the passage, the" answer" would probably refer to some expression of astonishment or complaint at his solemn statement in vers. 20-24. Professor Marshall's derivation of both "answered" and "rejoiced" (Luke) from a common Aramaic original (<span class="accented">Expositor</span>, April, 1891) appears very strained. <span class="cmt_word">And said, I thank thee</span>; better, as the Revised Version margin, <span class="accented">praise</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>). There is no thought of gratitude, but of publicity in assent (<a href="/luke/22-6.htm">Luke 22:6</a>), in confession (<a href="/matthew/3-6.htm">Matthew 3:6</a>) and in acknowledgment (<a href="/romans/14-11.htm">Romans 14:11</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>), and thus of praise (<a href="/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19</a>; <a href="/ezra/10-11.htm">Ezra 10:11</a> (Lucian); <a href="/2_chronicles/30-22.htm">2 Chronicles 30:22</a>; <a href="/romans/15-9.htm">Romans 15:9</a>). It implies a profession of personal acceptance by Christ of God's methods. "I profess to thee my entire and joyful acquiescence in what thou doest." Hence St. Luke introduces the utterance by <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, adding <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x1ff3;</span>, thus giving us a glimpse of the unity of purpose and feeling inherent in the Trinity, even during the time that the Word "tabernacled among us." <span class="cmt_word">O Father</span>. <span class="accented">Father</span> occurs in <a href="/matthew/6-9.htm">Matthew 6:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/26-39.htm">Matthew 26:39</a>; <a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34, 46</a>; <a href="/john/11-41.htm">John 11:41</a>; <a href="/john/12-27.htm">John 12:27</a>; <a href="/john/17-1.htm">John 17:1</a>; in fact, in all the recorded prayers of our Lord except <a href="/matthew/27-46.htm">Matthew 27:46</a>, which is a quotation, and where the phrase, "My God, my God," emphasizes his sense of desolation. The word expresses perfect relationship and intimate communion. It points to the trust, the love, and the obedience of Christ, and to the depth of natural affection and confidence (if we may say so) between him and the First Person of the Trinity. It suggests mercies in the past, care in the present, and provision for the future. <span class="cmt_word">Lord of heaven and earth</span>. <a href="/acts/17-24.htm">Acts 17:24</a>, by St. Paul, who may have derived it from these words of our Lord (Resch, ' Agmpha,' p. 150), or perhaps from <a href="/psalms/146-6.htm">Psalm 146:6</a> or <a href="/isaiah/42-5.htm">Isaiah 42:5</a>. As "Father" was the note of personal relationship, so is this of sovereign majesty. Christ unites the thought of God's love to himself with that of his ownership of all creation, thus paving the way for the main subject of the prayer - his Father's method of dealing with men of various kinds and tempers. <span class="cmt_word">Because</span>; <span class="accented">that</span> (Revised Version), perhaps as more idiomatic with "thank." But <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> here gives, not the contents of the "thanksgiving," but the reason for it. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes</span>. The laws by which religious impressions are received, whether ultimately for good or for evil (<a href="/2_corinthians/2-15.htm">2 Corinthians 2:15, 16</a>; <a href="/john/9-39.htm">John 9:39</a>), are here attributed to God. Observe that the sentence is not a kind of hendiadys, but that Christ accepts his Father's action in both directions. The one is the subject of his entire acquiescence as much as the other. <span class="accented">Hast hid</span>... <span class="accented">hast revealed.</span> The aorists (cf. ver. 19, note) may be understood here as either <p><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> describing what took place in each case, or <p><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> regarding God's action as a whole from the standpoint of the hereafter (cf. <a href="/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29, 30</a>). <span class="accented">These things.</span> The truths respecting Christ's teaching and work.
