It follows the event where Judas agrees to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver, a sum that reflects the price of a slave (<a href="/exodus/21-32.htm">Exodus 21:32</a>). This decision aligns with the fulfillment of prophecy, as seen in <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a>, which foreshadows the betrayal of the Messiah for thirty pieces of silver. The phrase suggests a deliberate and ongoing intention, highlighting Judas's commitment to his course of action.<p><b>Judas looked for an opportunity</b><br>Judas's search for an opportunity indicates premeditation and a calculated approach to his betrayal. This reflects the growing tension and danger surrounding Jesus as the religious leaders sought to arrest Him without causing a public uproar (<a href="/matthew/26-3.htm">Matthew 26:3-5</a>). Judas's actions are set against the backdrop of the Passover festival, a time when Jerusalem was crowded with pilgrims, making a discreet arrest challenging. His role as one of the Twelve Apostles, who had intimate access to Jesus, made him uniquely positioned to facilitate the betrayal.<p><b>to betray Jesus.</b><br>The act of betrayal is central to the Passion narrative, fulfilling Jesus's own predictions of His suffering and death (<a href="/matthew/20-18.htm">Matthew 20:18-19</a>). Judas's betrayal is a pivotal event that leads to the arrest, trial, and crucifixion of Jesus, which are essential components of the redemptive plan. Theologically, Judas's actions are often viewed as a manifestation of human sinfulness and the rejection of divine grace. The betrayal also serves as a type of Christ's suffering, paralleling the experiences of Old Testament figures like Joseph, who was betrayed by his brothers (<a href="/genesis/37-28.htm">Genesis 37:28</a>), and David, who was betrayed by Ahithophel (<a href="/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a>).

From that instant, a new course was set.<p>&#8226; <a href="/luke/22-3.htm">Luke 22:3-4</a> notes that &#8220;Satan entered Judas&#8221; and he &#8220;discussed with the chief priests &#8230; how he might betray Him,&#8221; showing a decisive spiritual shift.<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/13-2.htm">John 13:2</a> echoes the time marker: &#8220;During supper &#8230; the devil had already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot &#8230; to betray Jesus.&#8221; What began as a single transaction quickly became a settled resolve.<p>&#8226; This reminds us how a single sinful choice, once embraced, can fix the direction of a life (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Judas looked for an opportunity</b><p>&#8226; The verb pictures persistent, calculated searching. Judas is no longer merely open to betraying; he is actively hunting the perfect moment.<p>&#8211; <a href="/mark/14-11.htm">Mark 14:11</a> records, &#8220;They were delighted &#8230; and promised to give him money. So he began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus in the absence of a crowd.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Key observations:<p>&#8211; Betrayal requires secrecy. Judas waits for a setting where Jesus can be seized &#8220;away from the crowd&#8221; (<a href="/matthew/26-4.htm">Matthew 26:4-5</a>).<p>&#8211; Unrepentant sin grows more strategic. Judas&#8217;s daily companionship with Jesus now becomes daily reconnaissance against Him.<p>&#8211; Contrast such intent with David, who twice had an &#8220;opportunity&#8221; to kill Saul yet refused (<a href="/1_samuel/24-3.htm">1 Samuel 24:3-7</a>; 26:8-11). Judas uses opportunity for evil; David restrains for righteousness.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>to betray Jesus</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Betray&#8221; highlights personal treachery: handing over a friend, Teacher, and Lord to enemies. <a href="/psalms/41-9.htm">Psalm 41:9</a> foretold, &#8220;Even my close friend &#8230; has lifted up his heel against me,&#8221; a prophecy Jesus applies to Judas in <a href="/john/13-18.htm">John 13:18</a>.<p>&#8226; The target is &#8220;Jesus,&#8221; not merely a popular leader but the promised Messiah. <a href="/zechariah/11-12.htm">Zechariah 11:12-13</a> anticipates the thirty pieces of silver and the Potter&#8217;s Field, underscoring God&#8217;s foreknowledge.<p>&#8226; Though foreseen, the act remains morally chargeable to Judas (<a href="/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>). Jesus later says, &#8220;The Son of Man will go as it has been decreed, but woe to that man who betrays Him&#8221; (<a href="/luke/22-22.htm">Luke 22:22</a>).<p>&#8226; Betrayal serves God&#8217;s redemptive plan&#8212;leading to the cross&#8212;yet it shows the depth of human depravity apart from grace (<a href="/john/17-12.htm">John 17:12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/26-16.htm">Matthew 26:16</a> captures the tragic turning point where Judas, having sold his loyalty, continually scouts for the best moment to hand Jesus over.
