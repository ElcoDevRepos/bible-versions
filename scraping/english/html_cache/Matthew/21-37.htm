The sending of the son signifies the culmination of God's attempts to reach humanity, following the rejection of the prophets. This reflects the historical context of Israel's repeated rejection of God's messengers, as seen in the Old Testament. The "son" here is a type of Christ, the ultimate messenger and heir, emphasizing His unique status and authority. This act of sending the son highlights God's patience and long-suffering nature, as He continues to offer reconciliation despite previous rejections.<p><b>&#8216;They will respect my son,&#8217; he said.</b><br>This statement reflects the expectation of honor and reverence due to the son, which is consistent with cultural norms of the time where a son, especially an heir, would be treated with the same respect as the father. The expectation of respect underscores the authority and divinity of Jesus, as the Son of God. However, the tragic irony is that, contrary to the landowner's expectation, the tenants plot to kill the son, foreshadowing the rejection and crucifixion of Jesus by the religious leaders. This connects to prophecies such as <a href="/isaiah/53.htm">Isaiah 53</a>, which foretells the suffering and rejection of the Messiah. The phrase also serves as a critique of the religious leaders' failure to recognize and honor Jesus as the Son of God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_landowner.htm">The Landowner</a></b><br>Represents God the Father, who owns the vineyard and sends his servants and son.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_son.htm">The Son</a></b><br>Symbolizes Jesus Christ, the Son of God, sent to the people of Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_tenants.htm">The Tenants</a></b><br>Represent the religious leaders of Israel who were entrusted with God's vineyard (His people) but failed in their responsibilities.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_vineyard.htm">The Vineyard</a></b><br>Symbolizes the kingdom of God or the people of Israel, entrusted to the care of the religious leaders.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_servants.htm">The Servants</a></b><br>Represent the prophets sent by God throughout history to call His people back to righteousness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_patience_and_persistence.htm">God's Patience and Persistence</a></b><br>God repeatedly reaches out to His people, showing His patience and desire for reconciliation.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_rejection_of_christ.htm">The Rejection of Christ</a></b><br>The parable foreshadows the rejection and crucifixion of Jesus by the religious leaders.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/responsibility_of_leadership.htm">Responsibility of Leadership</a></b><br>Those entrusted with spiritual leadership are accountable to God for their stewardship.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_consequences_of_rejection.htm">The Consequences of Rejection</a></b><br>Ignoring or rejecting God's messengers leads to judgment and loss of privilege.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_ultimate_revelation.htm">The Ultimate Revelation</a></b><br>Jesus is the ultimate revelation of God&#8217;s will and love, and accepting Him is crucial for salvation.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Matthew_21_37_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Matthew 21:37?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_21_37_God_s_patience_love.htm">How does Matthew 21:37 illustrate God's patience and love towards humanity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/What_does_sent_his_son_reveal.htm">What does "last of all, he sent his son" reveal about Jesus' mission?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Matthew_21_37_daily.htm">How can we apply the lesson of Matthew 21:37 in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Link_Matt_21_37_John_3_16_God_s_sacrifice.htm">Connect Matthew 21:37 with John 3:16 regarding God's ultimate sacrifice.</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_21_37_s_challenge_today.htm">How does Matthew 21:37 challenge us to respond to God's message today?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_send_his_son_last_in_Matthew_21_37.htm">Why did the landowner send his son last in Matthew 21:37?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/What_does_the_son_symbolize_in_Matt_21_37.htm">What does the son represent in Matthew 21:37?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Matthew_21_37_God_s_patience_shown.htm">How does Matthew 21:37 reflect God's patience with humanity?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_matthew_21.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Matthew 21?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_is_jacob,_also_known_as_israel.htm">Who is Jacob, also known as Israel?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/are_prophetic_dreams_divinely_sourced.htm">Do prophetic dreams originate from a divine source?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/why_call_jesus_'son_of_david'_in_matt_21_9.htm">Why do the crowds in Matthew 21:9 publicly proclaim Jesus as the 'Son of David' if secular records are silent about this event?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_doesn't_god_make_everyone_believe.htm">If God can change minds (Exodus 4:21), why doesn't He make everyone believe in Him?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Matthew 21:37 Mean</div><b>Finally</b><p>&#8226; The word &#8220;finally&#8221; signals the climax of a long, gracious sequence. For generations the landowner (God) had sent servants (prophets) to His vineyard (Israel), but they were beaten, stoned, or killed (<a href="/matthew/21-34.htm">Matthew 21:34&#8211;36</a>; cf. <a href="/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1&#8211;2</a> echoes this crescendo: &#8220;In the past God spoke to our fathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, but in these last days He has spoken to us by His Son.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The timing underscores God&#8217;s patience and the completeness of His revelation. Nothing more authoritative or loving could be given after the Son.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he sent his son to them</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Sent&#8221; highlights purposeful mission. <a href="/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a> describes the motive: &#8220;For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/galatians/4-4.htm">Galatians 4:4&#8211;5</a> affirms the historical reality: &#8220;But when the fullness of time had come, God sent His Son&#8230; to redeem.&#8221;<p>&#8226; <a href="/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a> reinforces the cost: &#8220;He who did not spare His own Son but gave Him up for us all&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; This sending is literal, not symbolic; Jesus truly entered human history, walked Israel&#8217;s soil, and confronted the tenants face-to-face.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8216;They will respect my son,&#8217; he said</b><p>&#8226; The owner&#8217;s words reveal reasonable expectation: if the servants were rejected, surely the son&#8217;s unique status would elicit honor. <a href="/luke/20-13.htm">Luke 20:13</a>, the parallel account, adds, &#8220;perhaps they will respect him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s offer of respect is real&#8212;even to those who had repeatedly rebelled. <a href="/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a> reminds us He is &#8220;patient&#8230; not wanting anyone to perish.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Tragically, prophecy also knew the outcome: <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a> speaks of the Messiah as &#8220;despised and rejected,&#8221; and <a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a> notes, &#8220;He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.&#8221;<p>&#8226; Yet the invitation stands: recognizing the Son leads to fruitfulness and fellowship; rejecting Him brings judgment, as the parable&#8217;s conclusion makes clear (<a href="/matthew/21-41.htm">Matthew 21:41, 43</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/matthew/21-37.htm">Matthew 21:37</a> reveals the pinnacle of God&#8217;s outreach.

The expectation of respect exposes the tenants&#8217; coming guilt and magnifies the Father&#8217;s love. By receiving the Son we honor the Owner and enter His harvest; by refusing Him we forfeit the kingdom entrusted to us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/21.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(37) <span class= "bld">Last of all.</span>--The variations in the other Gospels are noticeable as more vivid and dramatic. "He had yet one son, his beloved" (<a href="/mark/12-6.htm" title="Having yet therefore one son, his well beloved, he sent him also last to them, saying, They will reverence my son.">Mark 12:6</a>). "He said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son, it may be they will reverence him" (<a href="/luke/20-13.htm" title="Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.">Luke 20:13</a>). The language of deliberation and doubt is evidently inapplicable, except by a bold anthropomorphism, to divine acts, but it sets forth (1) the gradually ascending scale of those who were sent, culminating in a difference not of degree only, but of kind, like the contrast between the prophets and the Son in <a href="/context/hebrews/1-1.htm" title="God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,">Hebrews 1:1-2</a>; and (2) the employment by God, in His long-suffering pity, of all possible means to lead His people to repentance.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Last of all;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">afterwards</span>, later on. The parable now allegorizes the near present, and future, in such a way as for the moment to conceal its bearing, and to lead the hearers to pronounce their own condemnation: <span class="cmt_word">His son.</span> Even Jesus Christ, who was now among them, incarnate, teaching, and demanding of them fruits of righteousness. Here was the authorization which they had required (ver. 23). God sent his Son. <span class="cmt_word">They will reverence my Son.</span> God condescends to speak in human language, as hoping for a good result from this last effort for man's salvation. He, as it were, puts aside his foreknowledge, and gives scope to man's free will. Though the sad issue is known to him, he often acts towards men as if he had hope that they would still use the occasion profitably. In the present case, whereas the immediate result of the last measure was disastrous, the expectation was ultimately realized in the conversion of many Jews to Christianity, which led to the bringing of all nations to the obedience of the faith. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/matthew/21-37.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Finally,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8029;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(Hysteron)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adverb<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_5305.htm">Strong's 5305: </a> </span><span class="str2">Lastly, afterward, later.
