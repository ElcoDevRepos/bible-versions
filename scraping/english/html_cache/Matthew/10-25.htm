In the context of Jesus' ministry, His disciples were to learn from His teachings and actions, striving to reflect His character and mission. This mirrors the rabbinic tradition where students closely followed their rabbis to learn not just through instruction but by observing their way of life. The concept of being "like" the teacher underscores the transformative process of discipleship, where the learner adopts the values, beliefs, and behaviors of the teacher. This is echoed in other scriptures such as <a href="/luke/6-40.htm">Luke 6:40</a>, where Jesus states that a fully trained disciple will be like their teacher.<p><b>and a servant like his master</b><br>This phrase highlights the relationship between a servant and master, which in the cultural context of the time, was one of loyalty and imitation. Servants were expected to carry out the will of their masters and often lived in close proximity, learning their ways. In the New Testament, Jesus is often referred to as "Master" (<a href="/john/13-13.htm">John 13:13</a>), and His followers as servants, indicating a relationship of obedience and service. This reflects the broader biblical theme of servanthood, where greatness in God's kingdom is defined by one's willingness to serve others, as seen in <a href="/mark/10-43.htm">Mark 10:43-45</a>.<p><b>If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul</b><br>Beelzebul, a name derived from a Philistine god, was used by the Jews as a derogatory term for Satan or the prince of demons. In this context, Jesus refers to Himself as the "head of the house," indicating His leadership and authority over His followers. The religious leaders of the time accused Jesus of casting out demons by the power of Beelzebul (<a href="/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a>), a charge that reflects their rejection and misunderstanding of His divine authority. This accusation is a fulfillment of the prophecy in <a href="/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, where the Messiah is described as being despised and rejected by men.<p><b>how much more the members of his household!</b><br>This phrase warns the disciples that they, as members of Jesus' household, will also face similar accusations and persecution. The "household" metaphor indicates a close-knit community bound by shared beliefs and mission. Historically, early Christians faced significant persecution, as seen in the Acts of the Apostles and the epistles, where believers were often maligned and accused of various crimes. This statement serves as both a warning and an encouragement, reminding the disciples that their experiences of suffering and rejection are part of their identification with Christ, as seen in <a href="/1_peter/4-12.htm">1 Peter 4:12-14</a>, where believers are encouraged to rejoice in sharing Christ's sufferings.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>The teacher and master referred to in this verse, who is preparing His disciples for the challenges they will face.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/disciples.htm">Disciples</a></b><br>Followers of Jesus who are being instructed to expect similar treatment to what Jesus Himself receives.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/b/beelzebul.htm">Beelzebul</a></b><br>A name used for Satan or a demon, indicating the level of opposition Jesus faced and, by extension, His followers.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/household.htm">Household</a></b><br>Symbolically represents the community of believers who are part of Jesus' spiritual family.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/p/pharisees_and_religious_leaders.htm">Pharisees and Religious Leaders</a></b><br>Often the ones who accused Jesus of being in league with Beelzebul, representing opposition to His ministry.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/e/expectation_of_opposition.htm">Expectation of Opposition</a></b><br>As followers of Christ, we should expect to face opposition similar to what Jesus faced.

(1.) It appears in the form <span class= "ital">Baal-zebub,</span> the "Lord of flies" (probably as sending or averting the swarms of flies or locusts that are one of the plagues of the East), as the name of a god worshipped by the Philistines at Ekron, and consulted as an oracle (<a href="/2_kings/1-2.htm" title="And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.">2Kings 1:2</a>) in cases of disease. (2.) Later Jews, identifying all heathen deities with evil spirits, saw in the god of their nearest and most hated neighbours the chief or prince of those "demons," and in their scorn transformed the name into <span class= "ital">Baal-zebel,</span> which would mean "Lord of dung," or <span class= "ital">Baal-zebul,</span> "Lord of the dwelling"--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> of the house of the evil spirits who are the enemies of God. Our Lord's connection of the name with "the master of the house" seems to point to the latter meaning as that present to our Lord's thoughts. The reference is clearly made to the charge that had already been implied in <a href="/matthew/9-34.htm" title="But the Pharisees said, He casts out devils through the prince of the devils.">Matthew 9:34</a>. We do not indeed find the name of Beel-zebub there, nor indeed do we meet with the direct application of that name to our Lord anywhere in the Gospel history; but there was obviously but a single step, easily taken, between the language they had actually used and that which is here reported of them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">It is enough</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); <a href="/matthew/6-34.htm">Matthew 6:34</a>, note.

That the pronoun was added to "<span class="accented">lord"</span> in ver. 24 was perhaps due to the unconscious desire on the part of the reporter to, avoid any possible ambiguity arising from the familiar phrase <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: in these two clauses the insertion of the pronoun is rather due to the fact that "disciple" and "servant" are both defined by the article. <span class="cmt_word">If they have called</span>. A typical example of the treatment his disciples will sometimes receive - complete rejection of their message, with deliberate accusation of the worst of crimes. Observe that it is implied that the opprobrious term had already been used of our Lord, although St. Matthew has not yet related it (<a href="/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a>).
