The Roman soldier, familiar to Paul's audience, was known for his rigorous training and loyalty. This imagery emphasizes the need for Christians to be spiritually prepared and dedicated to their mission, much like a soldier is to his duty.<p><b>refrains from entangling himself</b><br>The idea of refraining from entanglement suggests a deliberate choice to avoid distractions. In the Greco-Roman world, soldiers were expected to focus solely on their military duties, avoiding civilian occupations or concerns that could hinder their effectiveness. This reflects the call for Christians to prioritize their spiritual commitments over worldly distractions, as seen in <a href="/hebrews/12.htm">Hebrews 12:1</a>, which speaks of laying aside every weight and sin.<p><b>in civilian affairs</b><br>Civilian affairs refer to the everyday business and concerns of non-military life. For Christians, this can symbolize the worldly pursuits and concerns that can divert attention from spiritual growth and service. The call is to maintain a focus on the eternal rather than the temporal, echoing Jesus' teaching in <a href="/matthew/6-33.htm">Matthew 6:33</a> to seek first the kingdom of God.<p><b>in order to please the one who enlisted him</b><br>The phrase highlights the soldier's primary motivation: to please his commanding officer. For Christians, this is a call to live in a way that pleases God, who has called them into His service. This aligns with passages like <a href="/galatians/1-10.htm">Galatians 1:10</a>, where Paul speaks of seeking to please God rather than men.

It was one very familiar to the numerous peoples dwelling under the shadow of the Roman power, this picture of the soldier concerned only in the military affairs of the great empire--the legionary wrapped up in his service, with no thought or care outside the profession of which he was so proud. None of these sworn legionaries have aught to do with buying or selling, with the Forum, or any of the many employments of civil life. So should it be with the earnest and faithful Christian; paramount and above any earthly considerations ever must rank his Master's service, his Master's commands.<p>The soldier of Christ should never allow himself to be entangled in any earthly business which would interfere with his duty to his own General. But while this general reference to all members of the Church lies on the outside, beneath the surface a solemn injunction may surely be read, addressed to Timothy and to others like him in after times specially engaged in the ministry of the Word and in matters connected with the government of the Church of Christ. And so the Catholic Church has generally understood this direction to Timothy as warning her ministers from engaging in secular pursuits, either connected with business or pleasure.<p><span class= "bld">That he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</span>--More accurately rendered, <span class= "ital">who enrolled him as a soldier.</span> Only those soldiers who with heart and soul devote themselves to their military work win the heart of their commander. The question has been asked, What of St. Paul's own example and that of other of the early Christian teachers, such as Aquila? did not <span class= "ital">they, </span>at all events from time to time, pursue a secular calling--that of tent-makers? The reply here is not a difficult one. The Jewish life in those days contemplated and even desired that its rabbis and teachers should be acquainted with, and even, if necessary, practise some handicraft. The well-known Hebrew saying, "He that teacheth not his son a trade teacheth him to be a thief," is a proof of this. In the case of these early teachers, this occasional practice of an industry or a trade brought them more directly into contact with their Jewish brethren. It was thus among the Jewish people that the Hebrew rabbi often passed imperceptibly into a Christian teacher. It must also be borne in mind that in St. Paul's case, and also in the case of the presbyters of the first and second age, especially if missionaries, it was impossible always to ensure subsistence, unless by some exertions of their own they maintained themselves. It was, too, most desirable that these pioneers of Christianity should ever be above all reproach of covetousness, or even of the suspicion that they wished for any earthly thing from their converts. That however, it was not intended that any such combination of work--at once for the Church and for the world--should be the rule of ecclesiastical order in coming days, the positive and very plain directions of <a href="/context/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?">1Corinthians 9:1-15</a> are decisive, and incapable of being misunderstood.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="accented">Soldier on service</span> for <span class="accented">man that warreth</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">in</span> for <span class="accented">with</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">enrolled him as</span> for <span class="accented">hath chosen him to be</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Soldier on service</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); as <a href="/1_corinthians/9-7.htm">1 Corinthians 9:7</a> (see, too. <a href="/1_timothy/1-18.htm">1 Timothy 1:18</a>).
