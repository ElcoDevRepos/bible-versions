"That day" refers to the Day of the Lord, a time of judgment and reward. The mention of mercy highlights the Christian belief in salvation through grace. Onesiphorus is seen as a model of faithfulness, and Paul's prayer underscores the importance of intercession for fellow believers. The context suggests Onesiphorus may have passed away, as Paul speaks of him in the past tense and prays for mercy on the day of judgment, indicating a hope for his eternal reward.<p><b>You know very well how much he ministered to me in Ephesus.</b><br>Ephesus was a major city in Asia Minor, known for its large Christian community and as a center of early church activity. Paul's reference to Onesiphorus's service in Ephesus highlights the importance of hospitality and support within the early church. This service is a testament to Onesiphorus's dedication and courage, as associating with Paul, who was imprisoned, could have been dangerous. The phrase also emphasizes the communal nature of the early church, where believers supported one another in ministry and adversity. This service is reminiscent of Christ's teaching on serving others, as seen in <a href="/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35-40</a>, where serving the least is equated with serving Christ Himself.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and author of the letter, writing to Timothy, his spiritual son and fellow worker in the faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>The recipient of the letter, a young pastor and close companion of Paul, entrusted with leading the church in Ephesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/o/onesiphorus.htm">Onesiphorus</a></b><br>A faithful believer who supported Paul during his imprisonment and ministered to him in Ephesus.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>A significant city in early Christianity, where Paul spent considerable time preaching and establishing the church.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_day.htm">The Day</a></b><br>Refers to the Day of the Lord, a future time of judgment and reward for believers.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_in_service.htm">Faithfulness in Service</a></b><br>Onesiphorus exemplifies the importance of being faithful and supportive to fellow believers, even in difficult circumstances.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_mercy.htm">The Power of Mercy</a></b><br>Paul's prayer for Onesiphorus highlights the significance of seeking God's mercy for ourselves and others, especially in light of the coming judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/encouragement_in_community.htm">Encouragement in Community</a></b><br>The church community should be a source of encouragement and support, as demonstrated by Onesiphorus's actions towards Paul.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/e/eternal_perspective.htm">Eternal Perspective</a></b><br>Believers are encouraged to live with an eternal perspective, understanding that our actions have implications for the Day of the Lord.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_intercession.htm">Role of Intercession</a></b><br>Paul's intercession for Onesiphorus teaches us the importance of praying for others, especially those who have been a blessing to us.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_2_Timothy_1_18_mean.htm">What is the meaning of 2 Timothy 1:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/How_to_show_mercy_as_in_2_Tim_1_18.htm">How can we show mercy to others as Paul mentions in 2 Timothy 1:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Paul_s_prayer_for_Onesiphorus_lesson.htm">What does Paul's prayer for Onesiphorus teach about intercessory prayer?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Link_2_Tim_1_18_to_Jesus_on_mercy.htm">How does 2 Timothy 1:18 connect with Jesus' teachings on mercy?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/Apply_Onesiphorus_example_daily.htm">How can we apply the example of Onesiphorus in our daily lives?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Gratitude_s_impact_on_relationships_in_2_Tim_1_18.htm">What role does gratitude play in our relationships, as seen in 2 Timothy 1:18?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/2_Tim_1_18_on_God_s_mercy_forgiveness.htm">What does 2 Timothy 1:18 reveal about God's mercy and forgiveness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/2_Tim_1_18_s_focus_on_praying_for_others.htm">How does 2 Timothy 1:18 emphasize the importance of prayer for others?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Onesiphorus_in_2_Tim_1_18_significance.htm">Why is Onesiphorus mentioned in 2 Timothy 1:18, and what is his significance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_2_timothy_1.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from 2 Timothy 1?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/who_was_onesiphorus_in_the_bible.htm">Who was Onesiphorus in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/who_were_priscilla_and_aquila.htm">Who were Priscilla and Aquila in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/can_women_teach_in_church.htm">Can women teach in church?

The passage calls us to refresh God&#8217;s servants now, confident that the Lord will graciously repay every unseen labor when we stand before Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_timothy/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day . . .</span>--The Greek should be rendered here, <span class= "ital">favour of the Lord, </span>instead of by "mercy of the Lord." Some commentators, who have found a difficulty in this unusual repetition of "the Lord," explain it thus: The expression, "the Lord grant," had become among Christians so completely "a formulary," that the second use of the word "Lord" was not noticed; and the prayer is thus-simply equivalent to "O that he may find mercy of the Lord." It seems, however, better to keep to the strict. literal meaning, and to understand the first "Lord," in the sense in which the term is always found in the Epistles of St. Paul, as a title of Christ; and the second "Lord" as used of the Father, to whom here (as in <a href="/romans/2-5.htm" title="But after your hardness and impenitent heart treasure up to yourself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;">Romans 2:5</a>; <a href="/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a>; <a href="/hebrews/12-23.htm" title="To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,">Hebrews 12:23</a>), judgment at the last day is ascribed.<p><span class= "bld">In that day.</span>--The Apostle can never repay now--not even with thanks--the kindness his dead friend showed him in his hour of need; so he prays that the Judge of quick and dead may remember it in the awful day of judgment. It is worthy of note how St. Paul's thoughts here pass over the interval between death and judgment. It was on that day when the great white throne would be set up that he thought of the good deeds done in the body being recompensed by the righteous Judge. No doubt the expectation of the early Christians--in which expectation certainly St. Paul shared--of the speedy coming of the Lord influenced all thinking and speaking of the intermediate state of the soul between death and judgment, and almost seems to have effaced the waiting time from their minds.<p><span class= "bld">And in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</span>--These services rendered to St. Paul at Ephesus are placed side by side with those things he had done for him at Rome, but as they are mentioned after, they perhaps refer to kind offices undertaken for the prisoner by Onesiphorus <span class= "ital">after</span> his return from Rome to Ephesus. These things Timothy, the presiding pastor at Ephesus, would, of course, know in their detail better than St. Paul. The Greek word <span class= "greekheb">?????????</span><span class= "ital">,</span> rendered "he ministered," has given rise to the suggestion that Onesiphorus was a deacon at Ephesus. Although this is possible, still such an inference from one rather general expression is precarious.<p>This passage is famous from its being generally quoted among the very rare statements of the New Testament which seem to bear upon the question of the Romish doctrine of praying for the dead.<p>It may be well very briefly to touch on two points which suggest themselves as to the bearing of this passage on the doctrine in question. (1) Although we here, in common with Roman Catholic interpreters and the majority of the later expositors of the Reformed Church, assume that Onesiphorus was dead when St. Paul wrote to Timothy, and that the words used had reference to St. Paul's <span class= "ital">dead</span> friend, still it must be remembered that others, well worthy of being heard, writing many centuries before any doctrinal controversy on this subject arose, have held quite another opinion. Theodoret and Chrysostom (quoted by Alford) understood that Onesiphorus was with St. Paul at this time. (2) The prayer, whether it be taken as a prayer or an ejaculation, is simply the expression of an earnest desire, on the part of St. Paul, that the kind act of the <span class= "ital">dead</span>--assuming, contrary to the opinion of the above quoted Fathers, that he was dead--Onesiphorus towards himself may be remembered on that day when the books are opened before the Judge of quick and dead. It, indeed, only asks--looking fairly at the context--that an act of unrequited and devoted love shown in this life may be remembered in the final judgment. Without touching upon the controversy itself, it seems only just to point out the extreme precariousness of pressing this text--the only one in the New Testament really touching on this subject, and as to the interpretation of which expositors, as we have seen, are by no means in agreement--in support of a controverted doctrine.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="accented">To find</span> for <span class="accented">that he may find</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">ministered</span> for <span class="accented">ministered unto me</span>, A.V.

The parenthesis seems only to be required on the supposition that the words <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1ff4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f41;</span> <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f51;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>., are a kind of play on the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> of the preceding verse. Otherwise it is better to take the words as a new sentence. The repetition of "the Lord" is remarkable, but nothing seems to hang upon it. The second <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x3c5;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> seems to suppose the Lord sitting on the judgment throne. As regards the amount of encouragement given by this passage to prayers for the dead (supposing Onesiphorus to have been dead), the mere expression of a pious wish or hope that he may find mercy is a very slender foundation on which to build the superstructure of prayer and Masses for the deliverance of souls from purgatory. <span class="cmt_word">In how many things,</span> etc. St. Paul does not say, as the A.V. makes him say, that Onesiphorus "ministered unto him" at Ephesus. It may have been so, but the words do not necessarily mean this. "What good service he did at Ephesus" would faithfully represent the Greek words; and this might describe great exertions made by Onesiphorus after his return from Rome to procure the apostle's acquittal and release by the intercession of the principal persons at Ephesus. This would, of course, be known to Timothy. It may, however, describe the ministerial labours and services of Onesiphorus at Ephesus after his return from Rome, or it may refer to former ministrations when Paul and Timothy were at Ephesus together (see Introduction). There seem to be no materials for arriving at absolute certainty on the point. <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_timothy/1-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">{May} the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
