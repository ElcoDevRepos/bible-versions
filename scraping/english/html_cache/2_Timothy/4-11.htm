Luke's companionship highlights his loyalty and dedication to Paul, especially during his imprisonment in Rome. This reflects the importance of steadfast friendship and support in ministry. Luke's presence also underscores the theme of perseverance in the face of adversity, as he remains with Paul when others have deserted him (<a href="/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>). Historically, Luke's role as a physician may have been crucial in tending to Paul's physical needs, emphasizing the practical aspects of ministry support.<p><b>Get Mark and bring him with you,</b><br>This phrase refers to John Mark, who had previously parted ways with Paul during the first missionary journey (<a href="/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>). However, Mark's relationship with Paul was later restored, as evidenced by this request. This reconciliation highlights themes of forgiveness and restoration within the Christian community. Mark's presence is significant, as he is traditionally credited with writing the Gospel of Mark, which provides a vivid account of Jesus' life and ministry. This request also indicates the importance of collaboration and teamwork in ministry efforts.<p><b>because he is useful to me in the ministry.</b><br>Paul's acknowledgment of Mark's usefulness signifies a change in their relationship and underscores the value of each individual's contributions to the work of the Gospel. This statement reflects the broader biblical principle that God can redeem and use past failures for His purposes. Mark's usefulness may relate to his skills, experience, or spiritual maturity, which have grown since his earlier departure. This phrase also connects to the theme of equipping the saints for ministry (<a href="/ephesians/4-12.htm">Ephesians 4:12</a>), emphasizing that every believer has a role to play in the body of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy.

The verse reminds us that God treasures loyalty, reconciles broken relationships, and repurposes once-failed servants for fruitful ministry.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_timothy/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(11) <span class= "bld">Only Luke is with me.</span>--The "writer" of the Third Gospel, the Gospel which, as has been stated above, was very possibly the work of St. Paul--"my Gospel." Luke, "the beloved physician" of <a href="/colossians/4-14.htm" title=" Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.">Colossians 4:14</a>, of all St. Paul's companions, seems to have been most closely associated with the Apostle. Most likely this close intimacy and long-continued association was owing to the Apostle's weak and infirm health--to that dying body--the noble Paul ever bore about with him. Luke was with St. Paul, we know, in his second missionary journey, and again in his third missionary journey; he accompanied him to Asia, and then to Jerusalem; was with him during the captivity time of Caesarea, and subsequently of Rome, the first time St. Paul was imprisoned in the capital (Acts 18). After St. Paul's death, Epiphanius speaks of him as preaching chiefly in Gaul; a very general tradition includes him among the martyrs of the first age of the Church. The name is probably a contraction of Lucanus. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction</span> <span class= "ital">to the Acts of the Apostles.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</span>--"But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them . . . and went not with them to the work" (<a href="/acts/15-38.htm" title="But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.">Acts 15:38</a>). There is something strangely touching in this message of the aged master to Timothy to bring with him on that last solemn journey one whom, some quarter of a century before, St. Paul had judged so severely, and on whose account he had separated from his old loved friend, Barnabas the Apostle. Since that hour when the young missionary's heart had failed him in Pamphylia, Mark had, by steady, earnest work, won back his place in St. Paul's heart. Barnabas, we know, when his brother Apostle rejected him, took him with him to Cyprus. After some twelve years, we find him, during the first imprisonment, with St. Paul at Rome (<a href="/colossians/4-10.htm" title=" Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salutes you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom you received commandments: if he come to you, receive him;)">Colossians 4:10</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-24.htm" title="Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow laborers.">Philemon 1:24</a>). He is mentioned (<a href="/1_peter/5-13.htm" title="The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you; and so does Marcus my son.">1Peter 5:13</a>) by the endearing term of "my son," and the unanimous traditions of the ancient Christian writers represent him as the secretary or amanuensis of St. Peter. It was his office to commit to writing the orally delivered instructions and narrations of his master. These, in some revised and arranged form, probably under the direction of Peter himself, were given to the Church under the title of St. Mark's Gospel. A later and uncertain tradition says he subsequently became first Bishop of Alexandria, and there suffered martyrdom. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="accented">Useful</span> for <span class="accented">profitable</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">ministering</span> for <span class="accented">the ministry</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Luke</span>; probably a shortened form of <span class="accented">Lucanus.</span> Luke was with St. Paul in his voyage to Rome (<a href="/acts/27-1.htm">Acts 27:1</a>; <a href="/acts/28-11.htm">Acts 28:11, 16</a>), and when he wrote the Epistles to the Colossians and Philemon (<a href="/colossians/4-14.htm">Colossians 4:14</a>; <a href="/philemon/1-4.htm">Philemon 1:4</a>), having doubtless composed the Acts of the Apostles during St. Paul's two years' imprisonment (<a href="/acts/28-30.htm">Acts 28:30</a>).

But it looks as if he may have been in close personal attendance upon him all the time. if he had been permitted to write a supplement to the Acts, perhaps the repeated "we" would have shown this. <span class="cmt_word">Take Mark.</span> Mark had apparently been recently reconciled to St. Paul when he wrote <a href="/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>, and was with him when he wrote <a href="/philemon/1-24.htm">Philemon 1:24</a>. We know nothing more of him till we learn from this passage that he was with or near to Timothy, and likely to accompany him to Rome in his last visit to St. Paul. He is mentioned again in <a href="/1_peter/5-13.htm">1 Peter 5:13</a>, as being with St. Peter at Babylon. The expression, "take" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>), seems to imply that Timothy was to pick him up on the way, as the word is used in <a href="/acts/20-13.htm">Acts 20:13, 14</a>; and, though less certainly, in <a href="/acts/23-31.htm">Acts 23:31</a>. <span class="cmt_word">He is useful to me,</span> etc. (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3c7;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); as ch. 2:21 (where see note). This testimony to Mark's ministerial usefulness, at a time when his faithfulness and courage would be put to a severe test, is very satisfactory. <span class="cmt_word">For ministering</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). It may be doubted whether <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> here means "the ministry," as in the A.V. and <a href="/1_timothy/1-12.htm">1 Timothy 1:12</a>, or, as in the R.V., more generally "for ministering," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for acting as an assistant to me in my apostolic labours. The words, "to me," favour the latter rendering. The sense would then be the same as that of the verb in <a href="/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a>, where we read that Timothy and Erastus "ministered unto him," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> to St. Paul, and that of <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> applied to Mark in <a href="/acts/13-5.htm">Acts 13:5</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_timothy/4-11.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Only</span><br /><span class="grk">&#956;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(monos)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3441.htm">Strong's 3441: </a> </span><span class="str2">Only, solitary, desolate.
