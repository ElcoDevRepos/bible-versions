His suffering is directly linked to his mission to spread the message of Christ. This phrase sets the stage for understanding that his hardships are not random but are a direct result of his commitment to his divine calling.<p><b>even though I suffer as I do</b><br>Paul's suffering includes imprisonment and persecution, common experiences for early Christians. His suffering is a testament to his dedication and mirrors the sufferings of Christ, as seen in passages like <a href="/philippians/1-29.htm">Philippians 1:29</a>. The early church faced significant opposition from both Jewish and Roman authorities, making Paul's endurance a powerful example for believers.<p><b>I am not ashamed</b><br>In a culture where honor and shame were pivotal, Paul boldly declares his lack of shame in the gospel, echoing <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>. Despite societal pressures, he remains steadfast, encouraging Timothy and others to stand firm in their faith without fear of disgrace.<p><b>for I know whom I have believed</b><br>Paul emphasizes a personal relationship with Christ, not just intellectual assent. This knowledge is experiential and rooted in his encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus (Acts 9). It underscores the importance of a personal faith that goes beyond mere tradition or ritual.<p><b>and I am convinced that He is able</b><br>Paul's confidence is in God's power and faithfulness. This assurance is echoed in other scriptures, such as <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>, where Paul expresses certainty in God's ability to complete the work He has begun. It reflects a deep trust in God's sovereignty and omnipotence.<p><b>to guard what I have entrusted to Him</b><br>The "entrusted" could refer to Paul's life, ministry, or the gospel itself. The imagery of guarding suggests protection and preservation, akin to a deposit kept safe. This reflects the biblical theme of God as a protector, as seen in <a href="/psalms/121-7.htm">Psalm 121:7-8</a>.<p><b>for that day</b><br>"That day" refers to the eschatological hope of Christ's return and the final judgment. This future orientation is a common theme in Paul's writings, providing motivation and hope for enduring present trials. It aligns with passages like <a href="/2_thessalonians/1-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:10</a>, where the return of Christ is anticipated with eager expectation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and author of the letter, writing to Timothy from prison, expressing his unwavering faith despite suffering.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and close companion of Paul, recipient of the letter, encouraged to remain steadfast in faith.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/r/roman_imprisonment.htm">Roman Imprisonment</a></b><br>The context of Paul's writing, highlighting his physical suffering and the potential for execution.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The one in whom Paul has placed his trust, capable of guarding what Paul has entrusted to Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/that_day.htm">That Day</a></b><br>Refers to the future day of judgment or Christ's return, when all will be revealed and rewarded.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/unashamed_faith.htm">Unashamed Faith</a></b><br>Despite suffering, Paul remains unashamed of his faith.

There was no need to refer to them more particularly. Timothy knew well what he was then undergoing. The reason of the Apostle's touching at all upon himself and his fortunes will appear in the next clause, when, from the depths, as it would seem, of human misfortune, he triumphantly rehearses his sure grounds of confidence. Timothy was dispirited, cast down, sorrowful. He need not be. When tempted to despair, let him think of his old master and friend, Paul the Apostle, who rejoiced in the midst of the greatest sufferings, knowing that these were the sure earthly guerdon of the most devoted work, but that there was One, in whom he believed, able and, at the same time, willing to save him for yet higher and grander things.<p><span class= "bld">Nevertheless I am not ashamed.</span>--Not ashamed of the suffering I am now enduring for the cause of the Lord. He then, by showing the grounds of his joyful hope, proceeds to show how men can rise to the same lofty heights of independence to which he had risen, whence they can look down with indifference on all human opinion and human reward and regard.<p><span class= "bld">For I know whom I have believed.</span>--Better rendered, <span class= "ital">whom I have trusted;</span> yea, and still trust. "Whom" here refers to God the Father.<p><span class= "bld">That which I have committed unto him.</span>--More exactly, <span class= "ital">my deposit.</span> Considerable diversity of opinion has existed among commentators of all ages as to the exact meaning which should be assigned to the words "my deposit." Let us glance back at what has gone before. St. Paul, the forsaken prisoner, looking for death, has been bidding his younger comrade <span class= "ital">never</span> to let his heart sink or his spirit grow faint when oncoming dangers threaten to crush him; for, he says, you know me and my seemingly ruined fortunes and blasted hopes. Friendless and alone, you know, I am awaiting death (<a href="/2_timothy/4-6.htm" title="For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.">2Timothy 4:6</a>); and yet, in spite of all this crushing weight of sorrow, which has come on me <span class= "ital">because I am a Christian, </span>yet am <span class= "ital">I</span> not ashamed, for I know <span class= "ital">whom</span> I have trusted--I know <span class= "ital">His</span> sovereign power to whom I have committed "my deposit." <span class= "ital">He, I</span> know, can keep it safe against that day. St. Paul had intrusted his deathless soul to the keeping of his Heavenly Father, and having done this, serene and joyful he waited for the end. His disciple Timothy must do the same.<p>"That which I have committed unto Him, my deposit," signified a most precious treasure committed by St. Paul to his God. The language and imagery was probably taken by the Apostle from one of those Hebrew Psalms he knew so well (<a href="/psalms/31-5.htm" title="Into your hand I commit my spirit: you have redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.">Psalm 31:5</a>)--"Into thy hand I commend my spirit," rendered in the LXX. version (<a href="/psalms/30-5.htm" title="For his anger endures but a moment; in his favor is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy comes in the morning.">Psalm 30:5</a>), "I will commit" (<span class= "ital">parath?somai</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> In Josephus, a writer of the same age, <span class= "ital">the soul</span> is especially termed a <span class= "ital">parakatatheke</span>--deposit. The passage is one in which he is speaking against suicide (<span class= "ital">B. J.</span> iii. 8, 5). Philo, also, who may almost be termed a contemporary of St. Paul, uses the very same expression, and also calls the soul "a deposit" (p. 499, ed. Richter). Both passages are quoted at length by Alford, who, however, comes to a slightly different conclusion.<p><span class= "bld">Against that day.</span>--The day of the coming of Christ--"that day when I (the Lord of Hosts) make up my jewels." He will keep my soul--"my deposit"--safe against that day when the crown of life will be given to all that love His appearing. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="accented">Suffer also</span> for <span class="accented">also suffer</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">yet</span> for <span class="accented">nevertheless</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">him whom</span> for <span class="accented">whom</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">guard</span> for <span class="accented">keep</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">For the which cause (</span>ver. 6, note) <span class="cmt_word">I suffer also</span>. The apostle adds the weight of his own example to the preceding exhortation. What he was exhorting Timothy to do he was actually doing himself, without any wavering or hesitation or misgiving as to the result. <span class="cmt_word">I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed unto him.</span> The ground of the apostle's confidence, even in the hour of extreme peril, was his perfect trust in the faithfulness of God. This he expresses in a metaphor drawn from the common action of one person entrusting another with some precious deposit, to be kept for a time and restored whole and uninjured. All the words in the sentence are part of this metaphor. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;</span> must be taken in the sense of "entrusting" (<span class="accented">curae ac fidei alicujus committo</span>), as <a href="/luke/16-11.htm">Luke 16:11</a>. So <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "to be entrusted with the gospel" (<a href="/1_thessalonians/2-4.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a>); <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "I am entrusted with a dispensation" (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-17.htm">1 Corinthians 9:17</a>; see Wisd. 14:5, etc.). And so in classical Greek, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> means "to entrust something to another" to take care of for you. Here, then, St. Paul says (not as in the R.V., "I know him whom I have believed," which is quite inadmissible, but), "I know whom I have trusted [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> in whom I have placed confidence, and to whom I have committed the keeping of my deposit], and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have entrusted to him (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>) unto that day." The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span> is the thing which Paul entrusted to his faithful guardian, one who he knew would never betray the trust, but would restore it to him safe and sound at the day of Christ. What the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> was may be difficult to express in any one word, but it comprised himself, his life, his whole treasure, his salvation, his joy, his eternal happiness - all for the sake of which he risked life and limb in this world, content to lose sight of them for a while, knowing that he should receive them all from the hands of God in the day of Christ. All thus hangs perfectly together. There can be no reasonable doubt that <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> means, "my deposit" - that which I have deposited with him. Neither is there the slightest difficulty in the different applications of the same metaphor in ver. 14 and in <a href="/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>. For it is as true that God entrusts to his faithful servants the deposit of the faith, to be kept by them with jealous fidelity, as it is that his servants entrust to him the keeping of their souls, as knowing him to be faithful. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_timothy/1-12.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="grk">&#916;&#953;&#8217;</span> <span class="translit">(Di&#8217;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1223.htm">Strong's 1223: </a> </span><span class="str2">A primary preposition denoting the channel of an act; through.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7971;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#275;n)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Relative Pronoun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3739.htm">Strong's 3739: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who, which, what, that. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">reason,</span><br /><span class="grk">&#945;&#7984;&#964;&#943;&#945;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(aitian)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Accusative Feminine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_156.htm">Strong's 156: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the same as aiteo; a cause, i.e. reason, crime.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">even [though]</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I suffer</span><br /><span class="grk">&#960;&#940;&#963;&#967;&#969;</span> <span class="translit">(pasch&#333;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Active - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3958.htm">Strong's 3958: </a> </span><span class="str2">I am acted upon in a certain way, either good or bad; I experience ill treatment, suffer. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">[as I do],</span><br /><span class="grk">&#964;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945;</span> <span class="translit">(tauta)</span><br /><span class="parse">Demonstrative Pronoun - Accusative Neuter Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3778.htm">Strong's 3778: </a> </span><span class="str2">This; he, she, it. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">I am not ashamed;</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7952;&#960;&#945;&#953;&#963;&#967;&#973;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#953;</span> <span class="translit">(epaischynomai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Present Indicative Middle or Passive - 1st Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1870.htm">Strong's 1870: </a> </span><span class="str2">To be ashamed, be ashamed of.
