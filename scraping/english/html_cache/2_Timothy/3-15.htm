In the Jewish tradition, children were taught the Torah from a young age, emphasizing the importance of Scripture in daily life. Timothy's mother, Eunice, and grandmother, Lois, were devout Jews who instilled in him a deep respect and understanding of the Scriptures (<a href="/2_timothy/1-5.htm">2 Timothy 1:5</a>). This early education laid a strong spiritual foundation, illustrating the importance of teaching children the Word of God from a young age (<a href="/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>).<p><b>which are able to make you wise for salvation</b><br>The Scriptures are described as having the power to impart wisdom that leads to salvation. This wisdom is not merely intellectual but spiritual, guiding individuals to understand God's plan for redemption. The Old Testament, which Timothy would have been familiar with, contains prophecies and types that point to the coming Messiah, offering insights into God's redemptive work (Isaiah 53, <a href="/psalms/22.htm">Psalm 22</a>). The wisdom gained from the Scriptures is transformative, leading to a life aligned with God's will (<a href="/proverbs/2-6.htm">Proverbs 2:6</a>).<p><b>through faith in Christ Jesus</b><br>Salvation is ultimately achieved through faith in Jesus Christ, the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies and the embodiment of God's plan for humanity's redemption. The Scriptures point to Christ as the central figure in God's redemptive history (<a href="/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27</a>). Faith in Christ is the means by which the wisdom of the Scriptures is actualized in the believer's life, leading to salvation (<a href="/ephesians/2-8.htm">Ephesians 2:8-9</a>).

The expression "writings" for the Scriptures is not found elsewhere in the New Testament; it is, however, used by Josephus.<p>Two powerful arguments have been here used by the Apostle to induce Timothy to remain steadfast to the great doctrines of faith, and neither to take anything from them or to add anything to them. The first presses upon him the <span class= "ital">source</span> whence he had learned them. He, better than any one, knew <span class= "ital">who</span> and <span class= "ital">what</span> St. Paul was, and the position he held with his brother Apostles, as one who had been in direct communication with the Lord Himself; and the second reminded him of his own early training, under his pious mother. He appealed, as it were, to Timothy's own deep knowledge of those Old Testament Scriptures. St. Paul's disciple would know that the great Christian doctrines respecting the Messiah were all based strictly on these Old Testament writings. Timothy had a double reason for keeping to the old paths pointed out by the first generation of teachers. He knew the authority of the master who instructed him; and then, from his own early and thorough knowledge of the Scriptures of the Jews, he was able to test thoroughly whether or no his master's teaching was in accordance with those sacred documents.<p><span class= "bld">Which are able to make thee wise unto salvation.</span>--The present participle rendered by "which are able" is noticeable, being here used to express the ever-present power of the Scriptures on the human heart. The Holy Scriptures had not completed their work on Timothy when, in his boyhood, he first mastered their contents. It was still going on. "Wise unto salvation" marks the glorious end and destination of the true wisdom which is gained by a study of these sacred books. Other wisdom has a different goal. In some cases it leads to power, fame, wealth; but this wisdom leads only to one goal--salvation. The last clause--"through faith which is in Christ Jesus"--points out the only way to use these Scriptures of the old covenant so as to attain through them the goal of all true wisdom--"eternal salvation." They must be read and studied in the light of faith in Jesus Christ. "Those (Old Testament) Scriptures, he (St. Paul) granteth, were able to make him wise unto salvation;" but, he addeth, "through the faith which is in Christ" (Hooker, <span class= "ital">Ecc. Polity, </span>i. 14, 4). Faith in Jesus must be the torch by the light of which these ancient prophecies and types must be read.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="accented">Babe</span> for <span class="accented">child</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">sacred writings</span> for <span class="accented">Holy Scriptures</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">And that from a babe,</span> etc. Another consideration urged as a reason for standing fast.
