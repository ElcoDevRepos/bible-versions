The "testimony of our Lord" refers to the gospel, the good news of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. In the Roman world, where Christianity was often met with hostility and persecution, being associated with Jesus could lead to social ostracism or worse. This exhortation echoes Jesus' own words in <a href="/mark/8-38.htm">Mark 8:38</a>, where He warns against being ashamed of Him and His words. The call to boldness is a reminder of the power and truth of the gospel, which transcends cultural and societal pressures.<p><b>or of me, His prisoner</b><br>Paul identifies himself as a prisoner, not of Rome, but of Christ, indicating his imprisonment is for the sake of the gospel. This reflects a common theme in Paul's letters, where he often refers to himself as a "prisoner of Christ Jesus" (<a href="/ephesians/3.htm">Ephesians 3:1</a>). His imprisonment serves as a testament to his unwavering commitment to spreading the gospel, despite the personal cost. This phrase also highlights the early church's experience of persecution and the need for solidarity among believers. Paul's situation serves as a powerful example of enduring hardship for the faith, as seen in <a href="/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25</a>, where Paul and Silas sing hymns while imprisoned.<p><b>Instead, join me in suffering for the gospel</b><br>Paul invites Timothy to share in the sufferings associated with proclaiming the gospel. This call to suffer is not a call to seek out hardship but to remain faithful in the face of inevitable trials. The early church faced significant persecution, as seen in <a href="/acts/8.htm">Acts 8:1-3</a>, where believers were scattered due to persecution. Suffering for the gospel is portrayed as a participation in Christ's own sufferings, as Paul writes in <a href="/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>. This shared suffering is seen as a mark of true discipleship and a means of spiritual growth and deeper fellowship with Christ.<p><b>by the power of God</b><br>Paul emphasizes that enduring suffering for the gospel is possible only through God's power. This divine empowerment is a recurring theme in Paul's writings, as seen in <a href="/philippians/4-13.htm">Philippians 4:13</a>, where he declares that he can do all things through Christ who strengthens him. The power of God is not only a source of strength but also a guarantee of the ultimate victory of the gospel message. This assurance is rooted in the resurrection of Jesus, which demonstrates God's power over sin and death. Believers are called to rely on this power, trusting that God will sustain them through trials and use their suffering for His glory and purposes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy.

This "testimony" of which Timothy was not to be ashamed, of course includes the sufferings and the shame of Christ. In these, before mocking, scornful men, must Timothy, as an example to the flock, rather glory; but "the testimony" signifies much more than what relates only to the Passion story. The Christian, instead of being ashamed of his "profession," must before the world show fearlessly that its hopes and its promises are his most precious treasure.<p><span class= "bld">Nor of me his prisoner.</span>--Nor must Timothy either then, or in days to come, be afraid of confessing before men that he had been the disciple and friend of the prisoner St. Paul, who had paid so dearly for the courage of his opinions. Nor Timothy, nor any Christian must shrink from openly espousing the unpopular cause of the Crucified, or from publicly declaring their sympathy with its hated martyrs.<p><span class= "bld">But be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel.</span>--More accurately rendered, <span class= "ital">but rather</span> <span class= "ital">suffer afflictions for the gospel.</span> But, on the contrary, instead of injuring the good cause by faint-hearted conduct, should Timothy rather be ready to suffer, if need be, with St. Paul, ready to bear some shame with him, ready to incur, perhaps, sore danger for the gospel's sake; and then St. Paul, emphasising his words, and strengthening with a new strength his argument and his exhortation, adds, "in accordance with the power of God"--yes, join with me in suffering, if needs be, for the gospel. Mighty and pitiful was God's power towards us: great, surely, in proportion should be <span class= "ital">our</span> readiness to suffer in return, if He asks this--as He is now doing from you and me--at our hands.<p><span class= "bld">According to the power of God.</span>--What power of God? has been asked. <span class= "ital">Not</span> according to the power we get from God, but according to the power which God has displayed towards us in our calling and in our marvellous salvation. In other words, God, with great power, has succoured us; surely we may be confident that He will never leave us, never desert us, but in the hour of our sorest trouble incurred for Him will help us, and will bring us safely through it. So Chrysostom, who, while asserting that suffering will be borne, but not in our strength but in God's, says, "Consider how thou hast been saved, and how thou hast been called;" inferring that He who has done so great things for man, in his calling and in his salvation, will never let him want for strength.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="accented">Be not ashamed therefore</span> for <span class="accented">be not thou therefore ashamed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">suffer hardship with the gospel</span> for <span class="accented">be thou partaker of the afflictions</span> of <span class="accented">the gospel</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Be not ashamed,</span> etc. The exhortation based upon the previous statement. The spirit of power and love must show itself in a brave, unflinching acceptance of all the hardships and afflictions incident to a faithful execution of his episcopal office (comp. <a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Suffer hardship with the gospel.</span> This, of course, is a possible rendering, but an unnatural one, and not at all in harmony with the context. The force of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7a;&#x3bd;</span> in <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (only found here in the New Testament and in the R.T. of <a href="/2_timothy/2-3.htm">2 Timothy 2:3</a>) is manifestly to associate Timothy with St. Paul in the afflictions of the gospel. "Be a fellow partaker with me of the afflictions," which is in obvious contrast with being ashamed of the testimony of the Lord and of the apostle his prisoner. <span class="accented">The gospel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for the gospel, as <a href="/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>, "striving for the faith of the gospel" (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>), and as Chrysostom explains it: <span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> (Huther). <span class="cmt_word">According to the power of God;</span> either "according to that spirit of power which God gave you at your ordination," or "according to the mighty power of God manifested in our salvation and in the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ." The latter seems to be what St. Paul had in his mind. Timothy ought to feel that this power was on his side. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_timothy/1-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">So</span><br /><span class="grk">&#959;&#8022;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(oun)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3767.htm">Strong's 3767: </a> </span><span class="str2">Therefore, then.
