This reflects the biblical theme of God's sovereignty in choosing individuals for specific purposes, as seen in the calling of prophets like Jeremiah (<a href="/jeremiah/1-5.htm">Jeremiah 1:5</a>) and apostles like Peter (<a href="/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>). The term "appointed" underscores the authority and responsibility given by God, not by human decision.<p><b>as a preacher</b><br>The role of a preacher involves proclaiming the Gospel, a task central to Paul's ministry. This aligns with the Great Commission (<a href="/matthew/28-19.htm">Matthew 28:19-20</a>) where Jesus commands His followers to spread His teachings. Preaching in the early church was often done in synagogues, public squares, and homes, reflecting the cultural practice of public discourse and debate.<p><b>an apostle</b><br>An apostle is a "sent one," specifically chosen by Christ to establish the church and spread the Gospel. Paul's apostleship is unique as he was called by the risen Christ on the road to Damascus (<a href="/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3-6</a>). This role connects to the foundation of the church, as apostles were instrumental in laying its doctrinal and structural groundwork (<a href="/ephesians/2-20.htm">Ephesians 2:20</a>).<p><b>and a teacher</b><br>Teaching involves explaining and interpreting the Scriptures, a critical function in the early church to ensure sound doctrine. Paul&#8217;s role as a teacher is evident in his epistles, which provide theological instruction and practical guidance. This role is vital for discipleship and the growth of believers, as seen in the pastoral epistles and the emphasis on teaching in the church (<a href="/1_timothy/4-13.htm">1 Timothy 4:13</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The author of the letter, an apostle of Christ Jesus, who is writing to Timothy to encourage and instruct him in his ministry.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>- The recipient of the letter, a young pastor and prot&#233;g&#233; of Paul, who is leading the church in Ephesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/g/gospel.htm">Gospel</a></b><br>- The good news of Jesus Christ, which Paul is appointed to proclaim.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/herald.htm">Herald</a></b><br>- A messenger or proclaimer of the gospel, emphasizing Paul's role in spreading the message.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/a/apostle.htm">Apostle</a></b><br>- One who is sent with a commission, highlighting Paul's authority and mission given by Christ.<br><br>6. <b><a href="/topical/t/teacher.htm">Teacher</a></b><br>- One who instructs others in the faith, underscoring Paul's role in educating and edifying the church.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/u/understanding_our_calling.htm">Understanding Our Calling</a></b><br>Just as Paul was appointed to specific roles, believers should seek to understand and embrace their unique callings within the body of Christ.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_the_gospel.htm">The Importance of the Gospel</a></b><br>The centrality of the gospel in Paul's life serves as a reminder of its importance in our own lives and ministries.

In all his deep humiliation, a solitary prisoner awaiting death, deserted by his friends, St. Paul, with solemn emphasis, rehearses the titles of dignity which, by his Master's appointment, he possessed in the Christian Church. The poor prisoner, waiting his summons to a painful death, wished his last charge to go forth with all the authority of an Apostle, adding, however, in the next verse, that his present sufferings were entailed on him, owing to this very position in the Christian community to which his Master had called him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="accented">Was</span> for <span class="accented">am</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">teacher</span> for <span class="accented">teacher of the Gentiles</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Was appointed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>); comp. <a href="/1_timothy/1-12.htm">1 Timothy 1:12</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "appointing me to the ministry;" and 1 Tim 2:7. <span class="cmt_word">A preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher</span> (so also <a href="/1_timothy/2-7.htm">1 Timothy 2:7</a>).
