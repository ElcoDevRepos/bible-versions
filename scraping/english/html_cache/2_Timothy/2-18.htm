In the context of 2 Timothy, Paul is addressing false teachers who are leading believers astray. The "truth" here is the gospel message, which is central to Christian doctrine. This deviation is not merely a minor error but a significant departure from the foundational truths of Christianity. In the broader biblical context, deviation from the truth is often associated with false prophets and teachers, as seen in passages like <a href="/2_peter/2.htm">2 Peter 2:1 and 1</a> <a href="/john/4.htm">John 4:1</a>. Historically, the early church faced numerous heresies, such as Gnosticism, which challenged orthodox beliefs.<p><b>They say that the resurrection has already occurred,</b><br>This specific false teaching claims that the resurrection, a future event in Christian eschatology, has already taken place. This could be linked to a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the spiritual resurrection believers experience through faith in Christ, as mentioned in <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4-5</a>. The claim undermines the hope of a future bodily resurrection, which is a cornerstone of Christian eschatological hope, as outlined in <a href="/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>. Theologically, this error distorts the timeline of God's redemptive plan and the ultimate restoration of creation.<p><b>and they undermine the faith of some.</b><br>The consequence of this false teaching is the destabilization of believers' faith. By promoting a doctrine contrary to apostolic teaching, these individuals cause confusion and doubt among the faithful. This reflects the broader New Testament concern with maintaining sound doctrine, as seen in passages like <a href="/titus/1-9.htm">Titus 1:9</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3-4</a>. The undermining of faith can lead to spiritual shipwreck, as Paul warns in <a href="/1_timothy/1-19.htm">1 Timothy 1:19</a>.

Grace be with you. Amen.">1Timothy 6:21</a>.)<p>The resurrection of the body, grounded upon the Lord's own words (<a href="/context/john/5-28.htm" title="Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,">John 5:28-29</a>), was one of the Articles of the Christian faith upon which St. Paul especially loved to dwell. (See, for instance, his words before Felix--<a href="/acts/24-15.htm" title="And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.">Acts 24:15</a>.) With this "resurrection of the body" St. Paul, prompted by the Holy Ghost, taught men that the future state of rewards and punishments was intimately bound up; the soul will be clothed with a body of glory or with a body of shame, according to the deeds done in the flesh. This doctrine appears, in very early times, to have been questioned by some in the Christian community. Then, as now, was the thought repugnant to the shrinking soul of man,--that the body in which he then lived and sinned would rise again.<p>Elaborated, but still scarcely disguised, the same denial of a bodily resurrection was a characteristic of the more important of the widely-spread Gnostic systems of the second and third centuries.<p>These early Christian followers of men like Hymenaeus and Philetus had much in common with the ascetic Jewish sects of Essenes and Therapeutae, and especially with the famous Sadducean school, which attracted then so many cultured and wealthy Jews. They opposed, to use Van Oosterzee's words, "their own sickly idealism to St. Paul's strong and healthy realism." Death and resurrection, with these early opponents of St. Paul, were terms which had only a spiritual meaning and application. As Waterland puts it, "They allegorised away the doctrine, and turned all into figures and metaphors."<p>Another consideration must not be lost sight of when we are considering the reasons for St. Paul's fiery indignation with this unhappy school of dreamers. In attacking, with their thinly-veiled scepticism, the great doctrine of the resurrection of the body, in pushing aside the glorious hope, they touched with their impious hands the corner-stone of all Christian belief--<span class= "ital">the resurrection in the body of the Redeemer. This</span> Resurrection was indeed past already.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="accented">Men who</span> for <span class="accented">who</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Have erred</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); see <a href="/1_timothy/1-6.htm">1 Timothy 1:6</a> (note) and 1 Tim 6:21.

It is remarkable that it was the subject of the resurrection which was so misunderstood in both cases. The heretics to whom St. Paul here alludes probably explained away the resurrection, as the Gnostics in the time of Irenaeus and Tertullian did (Huther), by spiritualizing it in the sense of <a href="/romans/6-4.htm">Romans 6:4</a>; <a href="/ephesians/2-1.htm">Ephesians 2:1</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-12.htm">Colossians 2:12</a>; <a href="/colossians/3-1.htm">Colossians 3:1</a>, etc. It is the usual way with heresy to corrupt and destroy the gospel, under pretence of improving it. And there are always some weak brethren ready to be deceived and misled.
