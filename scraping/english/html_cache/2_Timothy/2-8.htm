In the context of 2 Timothy, Paul is writing to Timothy, his spiritual son, to encourage him in his ministry. The emphasis on remembering Jesus Christ highlights the importance of keeping Christ at the forefront of one's faith and ministry. This is a reminder of the personal relationship believers have with Jesus, who is both Savior and Lord. The call to remember is not just intellectual but involves a deep, personal commitment to Christ.<p><b>Raised from the dead</b><br>The resurrection of Jesus is a cornerstone of Christian doctrine, affirming His victory over sin and death. This event is not only a historical claim but also a theological one, signifying Jesus' divine nature and the hope of eternal life for believers. The resurrection is prophesied in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href="/psalms/16-10.htm">Psalm 16:10</a>) and fulfilled in the New Testament (e.g., <a href="/matthew/28-6.htm">Matthew 28:6</a>). It serves as a guarantee of the future resurrection of believers (<a href="/1_corinthians/15-20.htm">1 Corinthians 15:20-22</a>).<p><b>Descended from David</b><br>This phrase emphasizes Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy regarding the Messiah's lineage. The Davidic lineage is significant because it connects Jesus to the promises made to David, particularly the promise of an eternal kingdom (<a href="/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12-16</a>). This lineage is affirmed in the genealogies of Jesus found in <a href="/matthew/1.htm">Matthew 1</a> and <a href="/luke/3.htm">Luke 3</a>. It underscores Jesus' rightful claim to the throne of Israel and His role as the promised King.<p><b>As proclaimed by my gospel</b><br>Paul refers to "my gospel" to emphasize the message he has been entrusted to preach, which centers on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This gospel is not a different message but the same gospel that aligns with the teachings of the other apostles (<a href="/galatians/1-11.htm">Galatians 1:11-12</a>). The use of "my" indicates Paul's personal commitment and responsibility to spread this message. The gospel is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes (<a href="/romans/1-16.htm">Romans 1:16</a>), and it is the foundation of Christian faith and practice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jesus_christ.htm">Jesus Christ</a></b><br>Central figure of Christianity, the Son of God, whose resurrection is the cornerstone of Christian faith.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/david.htm">David</a></b><br>The second king of Israel, an ancestor of Jesus, whose lineage fulfills Old Testament prophecy regarding the Messiah.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and author of 2 Timothy, writing to encourage and instruct Timothy, his prot&#233;g&#233;, in the faith.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and close companion of Paul, recipient of this epistle, tasked with leading the church in Ephesus.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_resurrection.htm">The Resurrection</a></b><br>The event of Jesus rising from the dead, validating His divinity and the truth of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_centrality_of_the_resurrection.htm">The Centrality of the Resurrection</a></b><br>The resurrection of Jesus is not just a historical event but the foundation of Christian hope and faith.

The translation should run thus: <span class= "ital">Remember Jesus Christ as one raised from the dead, born of the seed of David.</span> Timothy was to remember, was ever to bear in mind, two great facts. They were to be the foundation stones of his whole life's work. Remembering these in the hour of his greatest trouble, he was never to be cast down, but ever to take fresh courage. And the two facts he was to remember were: that Jesus Christ, for whose sake he suffered--like him, Timothy, or like St. Paul--was born of flesh and blood, and yet He had risen from the dead. Surely, in the hour of his weakness, such a thought would be sufficient to inspire him with comfort and courage. Two facts, then, are to be ever in Timothy's mind: the Resurrection and the Incarnation of his Lord. The thought of the first mentioned, "the Resurrection," would always be reminding him of his Master's victory over death and of His present glory. The thought of the second mentioned, "born of the seed of David," "the Incarnation," would ever be whispering to him, "Yes, and the risen and glorified One sprang, too, like himself, from mortal flesh and blood." The reason of the "Incarnation" being expressed in this special manner, "born of the seed of David," was to include another truth. The "risen One "was not only born of flesh and blood, but belonged to the very race specified in those prophets so revered by Timothy and the chosen people as <span class= "ital">the</span> race from which should spring the Messiah: "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth . . . and this is His name whereby He shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS" (<a href="/context/jeremiah/23-5.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.">Jeremiah 23:5-6</a>). To raise the fainting heart of his much-tried disciple in this hour of discouragement, to supply a ground of confidence to yet unborn Christians, who in their day would be tried as Timothy was then, was the Apostle's first purpose when he pressed these thoughts on his son in the faith; but in the background, no doubt, there lay another purpose. These great comforting truths were to be maintained and taught in the presence of those false teachers who were ever ready to explain away or even to deny, <span class= "ital">then as now, </span>the beginning and the end of the Son of God's life and ministry on earth--His Incarnation and His Resurrection.<p><span class= "bld">According to my gospel.</span>--This formula, for so it may be considered, occurs frequently in St. Paul's Epistles (<a href="/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a>, and again <a href="/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>, and in other places), and, with very slight variations, in <a href="/1_timothy/1-11.htm" title="According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.">1Timothy 1:11</a> and <a href="/1_corinthians/15-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and wherein you stand;">1Corinthians 15:1</a>. Jerome's remark, "As often as St. Paul in his Epistles writes '<span class= "ital">according to my Gospel,</span>' he refers to the volume of Luke," although received with reserve by many expositors, considering the weighty traditional evidence we possess of St. Luke's Gospel being in reality written by St. Paul, appears on the whole substantially correct. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="accented">Jesus Christ, risen from the dead</span> for <span class="accented">that Jesus Christ...was raised from the dead</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">of the seed of David</span> for <span class="accented">Jesus Christ of the seed of David</span>, A.V. Remember Jesus Christ. The A.V. seems to give the sense more correctly than the R.V. The point of the exhortation is to remember that Jesus Christ was raised from the dead, and by that remembrance to be encouraged to face even death courageously. The verb <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span>, in the New Testament, usually governs the genitive case as <span class="accented">e.g.</span> <a href="/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>; <a href="/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>. But in <a href="/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="/matthew/16-9.htm">Matthew 16:9</a>; <a href="/revelation/18-5.htm">Revelation 18:5</a>, it has an accusative, as here, and commonly in classical Greek. There seems to be hardly sufficient ground for the distinction mentioned by Bishop Ellicott, that with a genitive it means simply "remember," with the accusative "keep in remembrance." It is more difficult to determine the exact force and intent of the clause, "of the seed of David." It seems, however, to point to Christ's human nature, so as to make the example of Christ's resurrection apposite as an encouragement to Timothy. And this view is much strengthened by <a href="/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>, where the addition, "according to the flesh," as contrasted with "the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness," marks the clause, "of the seed of David," as specially pointing to the human nature of Christ. The particular form which the reference takes probably arises from the form to which the apostle refers us as "my gospel." In that creed, which was the epitome of the gospel as preached by St. Paul, there was no doubt mention made of Christ's Davidic descent. Others, as Huther, think the clause points to the Messianic dignity of David. Others that it is inserted in refutation of the Docetae, and to show the reality of the death and resurrection of Christ; or that it is meant to mark especially the fulfilment of prophecy.
