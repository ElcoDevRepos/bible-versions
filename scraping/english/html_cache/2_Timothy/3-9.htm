In the context of 2 Timothy, Paul is warning Timothy about false teachers and those who lead others astray. The assurance that they "will not advance much further" implies divine intervention and the ultimate triumph of truth over deception. This echoes the biblical theme that God will not allow evil to prevail indefinitely, as seen in passages like <a href="/psalms/37-12.htm">Psalm 37:12-13</a>, where the wicked plot against the righteous, but the Lord laughs at them, knowing their day is coming.<p><b>For just like Jannes and Jambres,</b><br>Jannes and Jambres are traditionally understood to be the magicians who opposed Moses in Pharaoh's court, as referenced in <a href="/exodus/7-11.htm">Exodus 7:11-12</a>. Although their names are not mentioned in the Old Testament, Jewish tradition and extra-biblical texts identify them as such. Their opposition to Moses symbolizes the resistance to God's truth and authority. This reference serves as a historical parallel, illustrating that just as these magicians were eventually exposed, so too will false teachers be revealed.<p><b>their folly will be plain to everyone.</b><br>The term "folly" here refers to the foolishness and error of those who oppose the truth. The promise that it "will be plain to everyone" indicates that their deception will be uncovered and recognized by all. This is consistent with the biblical principle that truth ultimately prevails, as seen in <a href="/proverbs/12-19.htm">Proverbs 12:19</a>, which states that truthful lips endure forever, but a lying tongue lasts only a moment. The exposure of folly serves as a warning and a reassurance that God&#8217;s justice will be evident to all.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance and encouragement to his young prot&#233;g&#233;.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and close companion of Paul, recipient of the letter, tasked with leading the church in Ephesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/j/jannes_and_jambres.htm">Jannes and Jambres</a></b><br>Traditionally understood as the magicians who opposed Moses in Pharaoh's court, representing opposition to God's truth.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>The city where Timothy was leading the church, known for its challenges with false teachings and cultural pressures.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/f/false_teachers.htm">False Teachers</a></b><br>Individuals within the church who were spreading erroneous doctrines, likened to Jannes and Jambres in their opposition to truth.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_inevitability_of_truth's_triumph.htm">The Inevitability of Truth's Triumph</a></b><br>Despite the presence of false teachings, God's truth will ultimately prevail.

To human eyes, such a state of things as here pictured by the Apostle would appear desperate. It would seem as though a deadly and incurable cancer was eating away the whole life of the community; but Timothy need not despair: the evil would only be allowed to advance to a certain point; and since St. Paul thus wrote, the same prophecy, not only in Ephesus but in a thousand churches, has been fulfilled to the very letter. Still, the same old foes under new faces make havoc of the Church. But they never seem to advance beyond a certain point, and after all these centuries the Church is still full of faith and life, bright, too, in spite of discouragements, in spite of the perpetual presence of these treacherous, deceitful men, with promise for the future.<p><span class= "bld">For their folly shall be manifest.</span>--Men and women would be led away for a season by the plausible words of such deceivers, but one school of error after another would fall into disrepute, then into neglect, then into the silent darkness of utter oblivion (the event in numberless instances has shown the truth of this prophecy); and Timothy might take comfort, by considering what Holy Scripture had placed on record respecting the Egyptian sorcerers, <span class= "ital">whose folly was manifest unto all men</span> (<a href="/context/exodus/8-18.htm" title="And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice on man, and on beast.">Exodus 8:18-19</a>; <a href="/exodus/9-11.htm" title="And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was on the magicians, and on all the Egyptians.">Exodus 9:11</a>).
