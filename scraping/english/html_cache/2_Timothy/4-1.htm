The presence of God and Christ Jesus underscores the divine authority and accountability involved. In biblical context, invoking the presence of God and Christ is a common way to affirm the truth and importance of a statement (<a href="/deuteronomy/31-28.htm">Deuteronomy 31:28</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/5-21.htm">1 Timothy 5:21</a>). It reflects the understanding that all actions and teachings are ultimately accountable to God, aligning with the biblical principle that God is omnipresent and omniscient (<a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7-12</a>).<p><b>who will judge the living and the dead</b><br>This phrase refers to the eschatological role of Christ as the judge of all humanity, both those who are alive at His return and those who have died. This concept is rooted in Jewish eschatology and is affirmed in Christian doctrine (<a href="/acts/10-42.htm">Acts 10:42</a>; <a href="/1_peter/4-5.htm">1 Peter 4:5</a>). It highlights the belief in a final judgment, where Christ will evaluate the deeds of every person (<a href="/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12-13</a>). This judgment is a central theme in Christian theology, emphasizing accountability and the ultimate justice of God.<p><b>and in view of His appearing and His kingdom</b><br>The "appearing" refers to the second coming of Christ, a future event anticipated by early Christians and a key element of Christian eschatology (<a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>; <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>). The "kingdom" signifies the reign of Christ, both in a present spiritual sense and a future physical manifestation (<a href="/matthew/6-10.htm">Matthew 6:10</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>).

Like a military commander handing his orders to a trusted officer, he places Timothy under a sacred obligation to act. This isn&#8217;t casual advice; it is a binding directive that Timothy must obey. The same gravity echoes in <a href="/1_timothy/5-21.htm">1 Timothy 5:21 and 6</a>:13, where Paul &#8220;solemnly charges&#8221; Timothy in a similar way. Every believer who opens this passage senses that identical mandate: God&#8217;s call on our lives is serious, specific, and not to be postponed.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus</b><p>Timothy isn&#8217;t merely hearing from Paul; he stands before the throne of heaven itself. Paul reminds him that both the Father and the Son witness every decision he makes (<a href="/hebrews/4-13.htm">Hebrews 4:13</a>; <a href="/psalms/139-7.htm">Psalm 139:7&#8211;12</a>). <a href="/matthew/18-20.htm">Matthew 18:20</a> underscores the point&#8212;whenever we gather in Jesus&#8217; name, He is right there. Realizing who is watching transforms ordinary ministry into holy ground.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>who will judge the living and the dead</b><p>Christ&#8217;s oversight is not passive; He is &#8220;appointed by God as Judge of the living and the dead&#8221; (<a href="/acts/10-42.htm">Acts 10:42</a>). <a href="/john/5-22.htm">John 5:22</a> says, &#8220;The Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son.&#8221; One day every believer and unbeliever alike will stand before Him (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-10.htm">2 Corinthians 5:10</a>; <a href="/romans/14-10.htm">Romans 14:10&#8211;12</a>). Knowing this, Timothy must preach and lead with eternity in view, aware that his own faithfulness&#8212;and that of his hearers&#8212;will be evaluated.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and in view of His appearing</b><p>Paul ties Timothy&#8217;s present duty to Christ&#8217;s future return.

Living daily in anticipation of that moment keeps our priorities straight, fuels perseverance, and adds urgency to every act of service.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and His kingdom</b><p>Christ&#8217;s kingdom is both a present reality and a coming culmination (<a href="/luke/17-21.htm">Luke 17:21</a>; <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>). Believers are already citizens of a realm that &#8220;cannot be shaken&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/12-28.htm">Hebrews 12:28</a>), yet we still await its full unveiling when &#8220;entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be abundantly supplied&#8221; (<a href="/2_peter/1-11.htm">2 Peter 1:11</a>). Timothy&#8217;s ministry, therefore, is kingdom work&#8212;advancing the reign of Christ in hearts now while looking ahead to its final, visible triumph.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_timothy/4-1.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a> places Timothy&#8212;and every follower of Jesus&#8212;under a solemn commission. In full view of God the Father, Christ the Judge, His certain return, and His everlasting kingdom, we are called to serve with unwavering seriousness. Each phrase layers on motivation: the authority issuing the charge, the accountability of divine witness, the reality of final judgment, the nearness of Christ&#8217;s appearing, and the majesty of His kingdom. Understanding this verse frames all ministry and daily obedience as sacred, urgent, and eternally significant.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_timothy/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div><span class= "bld">IV.</span><p>(1) <span class= "bld">I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span>--The parchment, or papyrus, in the prison room of St. Paul on which, probably, Luke (<a href="/2_timothy/4-11.htm" title="Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.">2Timothy 4:11</a>), the faithful friend, was writing to the Apostle's dictation, was nearly filled up. What has still to be said to the chief presbyter of the Church of Ephesus must be brief. But St. Paul would have the last words introduced by a most impressive preface. So before he sums up his directions and exhortations, he appeals to him in these stately and solemn words. The Greek word rendered "I charge (thee)," is more accurately translated by, <span class= "ital">I solemnly charge </span>(<span class= "ital">thee</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>before those divine witnesses, the Eternal Father and the Blessed Son, present with me in this prison of mine in Rome, present equally with you in study-chamber or church in Asia.<p><span class= "bld">Who shall judge the quick and the dead.</span>--These words must have sounded with strange power in the ears of men like Timothy, and must have impressed them with an intense feeling of responsibility. The Apostle in his divine wisdom was charging these teachers of the Church to be faithful and zealous in their work, by the thought, which must be ever present, that <span class= "ital">they</span>--either alive on the day of the Coming of the Lord, or, if they had tasted death already, raised from the dead incorruptible (comp. <a href="/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm" title="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.">1Thessalonians 4:17</a>)--must stand before the Judge and give an account of their stewardship; on that awful morning must every man and woman render up, before the Judge who knows all and sees all, a strict account of the deeds done in the body. The looking forward to the judgment morning must surely be a spur to any faint-hearted, dispirited servant of the Lord disposed to temporise, or reluctant to face the dangers which threaten a faithful discharge of duties.<p><span class= "bld">At his appearing and his kingdom.</span>--The older authorities here--instead of the preposition "at"--read "and." The rendering then would be: "I charge thee in the sight of God and Jesus Christ, who will judge quick and dead (I charge thee) by His appearing (<span class= "ital">epiphany</span>) and by His kingdom," the construction in Greek being the usual accusative of adjuration, as in <a href="/mark/5-7.htm" title="And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the most high God? I adjure you by God, that you torment me not.">Mark 5:7</a>; <a href="/acts/19-13.htm" title="Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took on them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.">Acts 19:13</a>. So, too, <a href="/deuteronomy/4-26.htm" title="I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto you go over Jordan to possess it; you shall not prolong your days on it, but shall utterly be destroyed.">Deuteronomy 4:26</a> (LXX.): "I solemnly charge you to-day by heaven and earth." The passage, by this restoration of the ancient, and, at first sight, more difficult reading, gains, as we shall see, immeasurably in strength and power. "By his appearing," or by His manifestation or epiphany, refers, of course, to the Lord's coming a second time to judge the earth in the glory of the Father with His angels. (<a href="/matthew/16-27.htm" title="For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.">Matthew 16:27</a>; <a href="/context/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm" title="For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:">1Thessalonians 4:16-17</a>.) "And by His kingdom:" His kingdom, that kingdom is here meant which, in the words of the Nicene Creed, "shall have no end." This glorious sovereignty of Christ is to succeed what Pearson (<span class= "ital">Creed, </span>Article VI., p. 529, Chevallier's edit.) calls "the modificated eternity of His mediatorship," which will end when all His enemies shall have been subdued, and He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father. The "kingdom" here spoken of is to commence at Christ's glorious epiphany or manifestation, when "the kingdoms of the world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of His Christ; and He shall reign for ever and ever" (<a href="/revelation/11-15.htm" title="And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.">Revelation 11:15</a>). Timothy was conjured by the "appearing" of Christ when he would have to stand before Him and be judged; he was conjured, too, by "His kingdom," in which glorious state Timothy hoped to share, for was it not promised that His own should reign with Him? (<a href="/2_timothy/2-12.htm" title="If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:">2Timothy 2:12</a>.) There seems in this solemn ringing adjuration something which reminds us of "a faithful saying." The germs at least of one of the ancient creeds are apparent here, where allusion is made to God (the Father) and to Jesus Christ, the judge of quick and dead, to His coming again with glory and then to His kingdom. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">In the sight of God, and of Christ Jesus</span> for <span class="accented">therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">and by</span> for <span class="accented">at</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">I charge thee</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>); as <a href="/2_timothy/2-14.htm">2 Timothy 2:14</a> and <a href="/1_timothy/5-21.htm">1 Timothy 5:21</a> (where see note). The words <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;</span>, wanting in some of the best manuscripts, are "rejected by Griesbach, Tischendorf, Lachmann," and by Huther, Alford, Ellicott, and others. The chapter opens rather abruptly without the connecting "therefore." <span class="cmt_word">And by his appearing and his kingdom.</span> The reading of the T.R., <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>., "at his appearing and kingdom," makes such excellent sense, and is in such perfect accordance with the usual grammar, and with the usual connection of events, that it is difficult not to believe that it is the right reading (see <a href="/matthew/27-15.htm">Matthew 27:15</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, "at the feast;" <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "on every sabbath;" <a href="/acts/13-27.htm">Acts 13:27</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, "in the day;" <a href="/hebrews/3-8.htm">Hebrews 3:8</a> for the grammar; and the universal language of Scripture and the Creeds connecting the judgment with the Lord's appearing and kingdom). On the other hand, the reading <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> is almost impossible to construe. No two commentators scarcely are agreed how to do so. Some take <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span> as the object governed by <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> as in the LXX. of <a href="/deuteronomy/4-26.htm">Deuteronomy 4:26</a>, "I call to witness... Christ's epiphany and kingdom," taking <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> in two senses or two constructions. Others take them as the accusatives of the things sworn by, "I charge thee before God and Jesus Christ, and by his epiphany and kingdom," as <a href="/mark/5-7.htm">Mark 5:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "by God;" <a href="/acts/19-13.htm">Acts 19:13</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;</span>, "by Jesus;" <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-27.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:27</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, "by the Lord." But how awkward such a separation of the thing sworn by from the verb <span class="accented">is</span>, and how unnatural it is to couple with <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span> the two ideas, "before God" and "by Christ's epiphany," and how absolutely without example such a swearing by Christ's epiphany and kingdom is, nobody needs to be told. Others, as Huther, try to get over part at least of this awkwardness by taking the two <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>s as "both:" "by both his epiphany and his kingdom." Ellicott explains it by saying that as you could not put "the epiphany and the kingdom" in dependence upon <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> (as if they were persons like <span class="accented">God</span> and <span class="accented">Christ</span>), they "naturally pass into the accusative."
