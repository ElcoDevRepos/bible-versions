In the biblical context, it implies a return to spiritual awareness and truth. The imagery is reminiscent of the prodigal son in <a href="/luke/15-17.htm">Luke 15:17</a>, who "came to his senses" and returned to his father. This awakening is often seen as a work of the Holy Spirit, convicting individuals of their need for repentance and alignment with God's truth.<p><b>and escape the snare of the devil</b><br>The "snare of the devil" refers to the traps and deceptions laid by Satan to lead people away from God. In <a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>, believers are warned to be sober and vigilant because the devil prowls like a roaring lion. The imagery of a snare suggests subtlety and entrapment, indicating that the devil's tactics are often deceptive and not immediately obvious. This phrase underscores the spiritual warfare believers face and the need for discernment and reliance on God's power to overcome.<p><b>who has taken them captive</b><br>This phrase highlights the devil's influence over those who are ensnared. The concept of captivity suggests a loss of freedom and autonomy, echoing the spiritual bondage described in <a href="/ephesians/2.htm">Ephesians 2:1-3</a>, where individuals are said to follow the "prince of the power of the air." The captivity here is not physical but spiritual, indicating a state of being controlled by sinful desires and falsehoods.<p><b>to his will</b><br>The devil's will is in direct opposition to God's will. This phrase indicates that those who are captive are not acting in accordance with God's purposes but are instead fulfilling the desires of the enemy. In <a href="/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>, Jesus describes the devil as a liar and the father of lies, emphasizing that his will is rooted in deception and destruction.

Those taken in the snare of the devil are represented as not only captives in the snare of the devil, but as also helplessly wrapped in slumber.<p>The deadly peril of all "captives of sin" is here well painted. These unhappy ones, before they can free themselves from the toils of the evil one, must awake from the deep slumber in which they are wrapped: in other words, must first be <span class= "ital">conscious</span> of their awful danger.<p><span class= "bld">Who are taken captive by him at his will.</span>--These words have been variously interpreted by commentators. The meaning that, on the whole, seems most satisfactory, represents the captive to sin waking up from his deathly slumber and escaping the toils of the evil one, for the purpose of carrying out for the future the will of God. The rendering of the whole verse would be as follows: "<span class= "ital">And that they may recover</span> <span class= "ital">themselves out of the snare of the devil</span>--<span class= "ital">being held captive by him</span>--<span class= "ital">to do His</span> (God's) <span class= "ital">will.</span>"<p>It must be remembered that the first pronoun in this sentence, "being held captive by him," referred here to the devil, and the second pronoun in the sentence, "to do <span class= "ital">His</span> will," referred here to God, are represented in the Greek by two distinct words: the first by <span class= "greekheb">??</span>?<span class= "greekheb">???</span>?, the second by <span class= "greekheb"></span>?<span class= "greekheb">???</span>?<span class= "greekheb">???</span><span class= "ital">.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="accented">They</span> for <span class="accented">that they</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">having been taken captive by the Lord's servant unto the will of God</span> for <span class="accented">who are taken captive by him at his will</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Having been taken captive,</span> etc. This is undoubtedly a difficult passage. We will first take the individual words, and then turn to the general meaning. <span class="cmt_word">Recover themselves</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c8;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); only found here in the New Testament, and never in the LXX. In classical Greek, where it is, however, uncommon, it means literally "to recover from drunkenness," hence, "to come to one's self," "to come to a right mind" (see Steph., 'Thes.'). <span class="cmt_word">Snare</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span>); as <a href="/1_timothy/3-7.htm">1 Timothy 3:7</a>; <a href="/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a>. Compare the use of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> (<a href="/matthew/22-15.htm">Matthew 22:15</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Having been taken captive</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); only found in the New Testament in <a href="/luke/5-10.htm">Luke 5:10</a> besides this place, but common in the LXX. and in classical Greek, in the sense of "to take alive," of prisoners of war, who, if not ransomed, always became slaves of the conqueror. Here, therefore, the meaning is "having been captured and enslaved." <span class="cmt_word">By him</span> (margin), (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of course the devil, who had just been named as having ensnared them. <span class="cmt_word">Unto the will of him</span> (margin), (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>). The difficulty of the passage lies in the word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, which at first sight seems to indicate a different antecedent from the antecedent of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. This grammatical difficulty has led to the strange rendering of the R.V., and to the wholly unjustifiable intrusion into the text of the words, "the Lord's servant" and of "God," producing altogether a sentence of unparalleled awkwardness and grotesqueness, and utter improbability. But there is no real difficulty in referring <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> to the same person as <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> (meaning in both cases the devil), as in the passage from Plato's 'Cratylus,' cited by Huther, after De Wette, the cause of the use of <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> being that St. Paul was at the moment emphasizing the fact of these captives being deprived of their own will, and made subservient to the will of another. The passage may be paraphrased: "If peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth, so as to recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, after they had been led captive by him, so as to be no longer their own masters, but obliged to do his will." The implied contrast is <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, just as in the passage from the 'Cratylus,' p. 430 (vol. 4. p. 306, Bekker's edit.), <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> is contrasted with <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The full passage is <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x1fc3;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x7d;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. Another example of the transition from <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is in <a href="/john/1-7.htm">John 1:7, 8</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3ba;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;&#x2c;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;&#x2e;</span>, where there is a contrast between John as the witness and Christ as the true Light (compare, too, <a href="/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> has the force of "not you, but he"). For the general turn of phrase, comp. <a href="/2_corinthians/10-5.htm">2 Corinthians 10:5</a>, "Bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ," where <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span> (see <a href="/2_timothy/3-6.htm">2 Timothy 3:6</a>) corresponds to <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>. It should be noted further that the sentence is certainly rather a peculiar one, from the use of such uncommon words as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>, and the mixture of metaphors. But the sense of the A.V. is fully borne out. The interpretation preferred by Bishop Ellicott is "they may recover themselves from the snare of the devil unto his will (viz. God's), having (previously) been led captive by him (viz. the devil)." <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_timothy/2-26.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Then</span><br /><span class="grk">&#954;&#945;&#8054;</span> <span class="translit">(kai)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_2532.htm">Strong's 2532: </a> </span><span class="str2">And, even, also, namely. </span><br /><br /><span class="word">they will come to their senses</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#942;&#968;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(anan&#275;ps&#333;sin)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Aorist Subjunctive Active - 3rd Person Plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_366.htm">Strong's 366: </a> </span><span class="str2">To become sober again, recover sound sense.
