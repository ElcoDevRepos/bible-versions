Throughout his ministry, Paul faced numerous threats and persecutions (<a href="/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-27</a>). His assurance here is rooted in the belief that God is sovereign over all circumstances and can protect His servants from harm. This echoes the promise found in <a href="/psalms/34-19.htm">Psalm 34:19</a>, "Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers him out of them all." The phrase also suggests a spiritual rescue, indicating that God will preserve Paul from the spiritual harm that evil actions could cause.<p><b>and bring me safely into His heavenly kingdom.</b><br>Paul's focus shifts from earthly deliverance to eternal security. The "heavenly kingdom" refers to the eternal reign of God, a theme prevalent in the New Testament (<a href="/matthew/6-10.htm">Matthew 6:10</a>, <a href="/revelation/11-15.htm">Revelation 11:15</a>). This reflects the Christian hope of eternal life with God, transcending earthly trials. Paul's confidence in being brought safely into this kingdom underscores the assurance of salvation and eternal life promised to believers (<a href="/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28-29</a>). It also highlights the eschatological hope that sustains Christians through persecution and suffering.<p><b>To Him be the glory forever and ever.</b><br>This doxology attributes eternal glory to God, a common practice in Paul's writings (<a href="/romans/11-36.htm">Romans 11:36</a>, <a href="/galatians/1-5.htm">Galatians 1:5</a>). It acknowledges God's supreme authority and the eternal nature of His kingdom. The phrase emphasizes that all glory belongs to God, not only for His acts of deliverance but also for His eternal plan of salvation. This reflects the biblical theme that God's glory is the ultimate purpose of creation and redemption (<a href="/isaiah/43-7.htm">Isaiah 43:7</a>, <a href="/ephesians/1-12.htm">Ephesians 1:12</a>).<p><b>Amen.</b><br>"Amen" is a Hebrew word meaning "truly" or "so be it," used to affirm the truth of a statement. In this context, it serves as a solemn affirmation of the preceding doxology, expressing Paul's heartfelt agreement and trust in God's promises. It is a common conclusion in biblical prayers and doxologies, signifying agreement and certainty (<a href="/revelation/22-20.htm">Revelation 22:20-21</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle and author of the letter, writing to Timothy from prison, facing the end of his life.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>- A young pastor and close companion of Paul, recipient of the letter, encouraged to remain faithful.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The Lord</a></b><br>- Refers to Jesus Christ, whom Paul trusts for deliverance and eternal salvation.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/heavenly_kingdom.htm">Heavenly Kingdom</a></b><br>- The eternal realm of God, where believers are promised eternal life with Him.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/e/evil_deed.htm">Evil Deed</a></b><br>- Represents the trials, persecutions, and spiritual attacks Paul faces.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/trust_in_divine_deliverance.htm">Trust in Divine Deliverance</a></b><br>Paul exemplifies unwavering trust in God's ability to rescue him from all evil.

In the whole Epistle there is not one note of fear--nothing which should lead us to suspect that the martyr Apostle was fearful for himself. It reads--does this last letter of the great Gentile teacher--in many places like a triumphant song of death. It, therefore, appears unnatural to introduce into the closing words of the Epistle the thought of the Lord's help in the event of the Apostle's losing heart. Far better is it to supply after "every evil work" the words "<span class= "ital">of the enemies," </span>and to understand the deliverance which the Lord will accomplish for him, not as a deliverance from any shrinking or timidity unworthy of an apostle of the Lord, not even as a deliverance from the martyr-death, which he knew lay before him, <span class= "ital">but that through this very death, </span>the Lord Jesus would deliver him from all weariness and toil, and would bring him safe into His heavenly kingdom. (See <a href="/psalms/23-4.htm" title="Yes, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for you are with me; your rod and your staff they comfort me.">Psalm 23:4</a>.) St. Paul before (<a href="/philippians/1-23.htm" title="For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:">Philippians 1:23</a> had expressed a longing to come to Christ through death. He then bursts into an ascription of praise to that Lord Jesus Christ whom he had loved so long and so well, and who, in all his troubles and perplexities, had never left him friendless. For a similar ascription of glory to the Second Person of the ever blessed Trinity, see <a href="/hebrews/13-21.htm" title="Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever.

Interpreted by the Lord's Prayer, and by its own internal evidence, the meaning clearly is, "The Lord, who stood by me at my trial, will continue to be my Saviour. He will deliver me from every evil design of mine enemies, and from all the wiles and assaults of the devil, in short, from the whole power of evil, and will bring me safe into his own kingdom of light and righteousness." There is a strong contrast, as Bengel pithily observes, between "the evil work" and "his heavenly kingdom." A triumphant martyrdom is as true a deliverance as escape from death. Compare our Lord's promise, "There shall not an hair of your head perish" (<a href="/luke/21-18.htm">Luke 21:18</a> compared with ver. 16). St. Paul's confidence simply is that the Lord would, in his own good time and way, transfer him from this present evil world, and from the powers of darkness, into his eternal kingdom of light and righteousness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_timothy/4-18.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">[And] the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
