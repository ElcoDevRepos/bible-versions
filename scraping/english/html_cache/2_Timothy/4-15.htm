The "him" refers to Alexander the coppersmith, mentioned earlier in the chapter, who caused Paul much harm. This warning highlights the reality of opposition in ministry and the need for discernment. In the broader biblical context, warnings against false teachers and those who oppose the gospel are common (e.g., <a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>, <a href="/acts/20-29.htm">Acts 20:29-31</a>). The personal nature of this warning underscores the relational aspect of early Christian communities and the importance of protecting the integrity of the message.<p><b>for he has vigorously opposed our message</b><br>The opposition described here is not passive but active and intense. The term "vigorously" suggests a determined effort to undermine the gospel. This reflects the broader context of early Christian persecution and the challenges faced by the apostles in spreading the message of Christ. Historically, figures like Alexander may have had significant influence, possibly using their trade connections to sway public opinion or incite legal action against Christians. This opposition is reminiscent of the resistance faced by Jesus and the apostles, as seen in passages like <a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a> and <a href="/acts/4.htm">Acts 4:1-3</a>.

That he had been at Rome, and had given evidence against St. Paul, and had argued against the defence of the Apostle, is probable. "Our words" some understand as especially referring to St. Paul's defence before the imperial tribunal. If we identify him with the Alexander of <a href="/context/acts/19-33.htm" title="And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defense to the people.">Acts 19:33-34</a>, then he was a Jew, one of those bitter, life-long antagonists of the Gentile Apostle who crossed his path at every step, and not improbably brought about, in the end, his death. It is an interesting suggestion which refers the connection between St. Paul and Alexander back to those days when Saul and Alexander were both reckoned as belonging to the strictest Pharisee party, determined foes to the "Nazarenes." Saul--if we adopt this supposition--became the Apostle St. Paul of the Gentiles; Alexander remained a fanatic Jew--hence the enmity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="accented">Withstood</span> for <span class="accented">hath withstood</span>, A.V.

But it is only found in <a href="/acts/21-25.htm">Acts 21:25</a>. In <a href="/luke/12-15.htm">Luke 12:15</a> the equally correct phrase, <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, is used. The inference from this caution to Timothy is that Alexander had left Rome and returned to his native Ephesus. The Jews were always on the move. <span class="cmt_word">He greatly withstood our words</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>). For an exactly similar use, see <a href="/acts/13-8.htm">Acts 13:8</a>, where Elymas "withstood" Paul and Barnabas; and <a href="/2_timothy/3-8.htm">2 Timothy 3:8</a>, where Jannes and Jambres "withstood" Moses. In this case we may be sure that Paul, in pleading for his life, did not omit to preach the gospel to his Gentile audience. Alexander tried to refute his words, not without effect. The apostle says "<span class="accented">our</span> words" (not "<span class="accented">my</span> words"), perhaps to associate with himself those other Christians who were with him. It certainly cannot mean "yours and mine," as Timothy was not with him when the "words" were spoken. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_timothy/4-15.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">You</span><br /><span class="grk">&#963;&#8058;</span> <span class="translit">(sy)</span><br /><span class="parse">Personal / Possessive Pronoun - Nominative 2nd Person Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_4771.htm">Strong's 4771: </a> </span><span class="str2">You.
