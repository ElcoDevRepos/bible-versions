The "crown of righteousness" is a metaphorical expression, drawing from the imagery of athletic competitions in ancient Greece, where victors received a laurel wreath. In a biblical context, this crown represents the ultimate reward for a life lived in faithfulness to Christ. The concept of a "crown" is also found in <a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a> and <a href="/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>, where it symbolizes eternal life and victory over sin. The righteousness mentioned here is not self-derived but imputed through faith in Jesus Christ, aligning with Paul's teachings in <a href="/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>.<p><b>which the Lord, the righteous Judge</b><br>Paul refers to Jesus Christ as the "righteous Judge," emphasizing His divine authority and perfect justice. This title assures believers that their lives will be evaluated fairly and justly. In the cultural context of the Roman Empire, judges were often seen as corrupt, but Paul contrasts this with the incorruptible nature of Christ. The righteousness of Christ as Judge is a theme echoed in <a href="/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31</a>, where God has appointed a day to judge the world in righteousness through Jesus.<p><b>will award to me on that day</b><br>"That day" refers to the eschatological event of Christ's return, often called the Day of the Lord. This is a time of both judgment and reward, as seen in <a href="/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a> and <a href="/2_peter/3-10.htm">2 Peter 3:10</a>. For Paul, this is a day of hope and fulfillment, when his faithfulness will be recognized. The assurance of this future award reflects Paul's confidence in the promises of God, as seen in <a href="/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>.<p><b>and not only to me</b><br>Paul expands the promise beyond himself, indicating that the reward is not exclusive to apostles or church leaders. This inclusivity is a hallmark of the gospel message, which offers salvation and reward to all who believe, as seen in <a href="/romans/10-12.htm">Romans 10:12-13</a>. It underscores the communal aspect of the Christian faith, where all believers share in the hope of eternal life.<p><b>but to all who crave His appearing</b><br>The phrase "crave His appearing" highlights the eager anticipation and longing for Christ's return. This desire is a mark of genuine faith and love for Christ, as seen in <a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>, where believers are encouraged to look forward to the blessed hope and glorious appearing of Jesus. The cultural context of the early church, which faced persecution and hardship, made this hope particularly poignant. The longing for Christ's return is a central theme in Christian eschatology, encouraging believers to live righteously and remain steadfast in their faith.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle who wrote this letter to Timothy, expressing his confidence in the reward awaiting him after his faithful service.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>A young pastor and close companion of Paul, recipient of this letter, encouraged to remain steadfast in his ministry.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord,_the_righteous_judge.htm">The Lord, the Righteous Judge</a></b><br>Refers to Jesus Christ, who will judge all people and reward those who have been faithful.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_crown_of_righteousness.htm">The Crown of Righteousness</a></b><br>A metaphorical reward for those who have lived righteously and longed for Christ's return.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/that_day.htm">That Day</a></b><br>Refers to the future time of Christ's return and the final judgment.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_certainty_of_reward.htm">The Certainty of Reward</a></b><br>Believers can be assured of the reward awaiting them for their faithfulness.

The phrase signals a decisive shift: nothing remains but the reward. For believers, death is not an end but a departure to be &#8220;at home with the Lord&#8221; (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-8.htm">2 Corinthians 5:8</a>). Like the thief who heard, &#8220;Today you will be with Me in Paradise&#8221; (<a href="/luke/23-43.htm">Luke 23:43</a>), Paul&#8217;s confidence springs from Christ&#8217;s finished work, not his own efforts.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Laid up&#8221; pictures a treasure already secured in heaven (<a href="/matthew/6-20.htm">Matthew 6:20</a>).<p>&#8226; The &#8220;crown&#8221; (stephanos) evokes the victor&#8217;s wreath from the Greco-Roman games. Scripture speaks of several crowns: &#8220;the crown of life&#8221; for enduring trial (<a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>), &#8220;the unfading crown of glory&#8221; for faithful shepherds (<a href="/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>), &#8220;an imperishable crown&#8221; for disciplined runners (<a href="/1_corinthians/9-25.htm">1 Corinthians 9:25</a>). Here it is specifically &#8220;of righteousness,&#8221; highlighting the reward that flows from Christ&#8217;s imputed righteousness (<a href="/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>) and our lived-out obedience (<a href="/revelation/19-8.htm">Revelation 19:8</a>).<p>&#8226; The crown is future yet certain, already waiting for the believer just as the inheritance is &#8220;imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, reserved in heaven&#8221; (<a href="/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me</b><p>Jesus Himself bestows the prize.

Because His judgment is righteous, no faithful work will be overlooked (<a href="/hebrews/6-10.htm">Hebrews 6:10</a>). Paul is sure of the award because it rests on Christ&#8217;s own righteousness credited to him (<a href="/2_corinthians/5-21.htm">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>) and the Lord&#8217;s unfailing justice (<a href="/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>on that day</b><p>&#8220;That day&#8221; points to the final evaluation at Christ&#8217;s return.

It aligns with &#8220;the Day&#8221; when each believer&#8217;s work &#8220;will be revealed with fire&#8221; (<a href="/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>) and with the &#8220;blessed hope&#8212;the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ&#8221; (<a href="/titus/2-13.htm">Titus 2:13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and not only to me</b><p>The promise is not reserved for apostles or leaders.

Just as the Philippians were told they would &#8220;shine like stars&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-15.htm">Philippians 2:15</a>), every believer who perseveres shares the same prospect.

Such longing is nurtured by:<p>&#8226; Setting &#8220;our minds on things above&#8221; (<a href="/colossians/3-2.htm">Colossians 3:2</a>).<p>&#8226; Eagerly waiting as &#8220;citizens of heaven&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>).<p>&#8226; Purifying ourselves, for &#8220;everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure&#8221; (<a href="/1_john/3-3.htm">1 John 3:3</a>).<p>The reward therefore reaches every believer whose affection is fixed on Christ&#8217;s return, whether known or unknown, celebrated or hidden (<a href="/2_peter/3-12.htm">2 Peter 3:12&#8211;14</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/2_timothy/4-8.htm">2 Timothy 4:8</a> promises a real, heavenly reward already stored up for all who finish the race with eyes fixed on Jesus. The righteous Judge Himself will present an imperishable crown on the day of His appearing, not only to Paul but to every believer whose heart longs for the Lord. The certainty of that crown fuels present faithfulness, confident that nothing done for Christ is ever in vain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/2_timothy/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(8) <span class= "bld">A crown of righteousness.</span>--More accurately rendered, <span class= "ital">the crown of righteousness.</span> St. Paul, after speaking calmly of death, the bitterness of which he was already tasting, looks on beyond death, and speaks of the crown which awaited him. The crown was the victory prize which the "good fight" of <a href="/2_timothy/4-7.htm" title="I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:">2Timothy 4:7</a> had won. It is called "the crown of righteousness," it being the crown to which righteousness can lay claim--that <span class= "ital">is, </span>the crown awarded to righteousness.<p><span class= "bld">Which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me.</span>--As a righteous judge will the Lord award him the crown, recognising him as one who had the prize of victory. Not improbably, the expression "the righteous judge" was written in strong contrast to that unrighteous judge who had condemned Paul, and in accordance with whose unjust sentence he would presently suffer a painful death.<p><span class= "bld">At that day.</span>--This is the third time the words "that day" are used in this Epistle (see <a href="/context/2_timothy/1-12.htm" title="For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day.">2Timothy 1:12-18</a>). The day of judgment is, of course, signified, the day when the Lord shall come again with glory.<p><span class= "bld">And not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</span>--Then St. Paul, instead of concluding this section of his letter with the glorious words telling of his serene courage and of his confidence in a crowned and immortal life, adds a gentle reminder to Timothy: <span class= "ital">he, </span>too, with any others who really look for the Second Coming of the Lord, might win the same glorious crown--the sure guerdon of righteousness. The Apostle specifies here exactly the persons for whom "the crown" was reserved--those who in this life have <span class= "ital">indeed</span> longed for the appearance of the Lord in judgment. None here could in very truth desire "His appearing," save His own, who love Him and struggle to live His life. Calvin well remarks: "(St. Paul) excludes from the number of the faithful those to whom Christ's coming is a source of terror."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="accented">The</span> for <span class="accented">a</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">to me</span> for <span class="accented">me</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">only to me</span> for <span class="accented">to me only</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">also to all them</span> for <span class="accented">unto all them also</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">have loved</span> for <span class="accented">love. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Henceforth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>); as <a href="/hebrews/10-13.htm">Hebrews 10:13</a>. The work of conflict being over, it only remains to receive the crown. <span class="cmt_word">The crown of righteousness</span> means that crown the possession of which marks the wearer as righteous before God. The analogous phrases are, "the crown of glory" (<a href="/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>) and "the crown of life" (<a href="/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>; <a href="/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a>). The righteousness, the glory, and the life of the saints are conceived as displayed in crowns, as the kingly dignity is in the crown of royalty. <span class="cmt_word">The righteous Judge</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>). In <a href="/acts/10-42.htm">Acts 10:42</a> the Lord Jesus is said to be ordained of God <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>.

But nowhere else, either in the Old Testament or the New Testament, is this term applied directly either to God or to Christ. Surely its use here is influenced by the preceding metaphor of the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; and "the righteous Judge" is the impartial <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>, or "judge," who assigned the prizes at the games to those who had fairly won them. And this is the proper meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, "the umpire," applied, especially at Athens, to the "judges" at the poetic contests (Liddell and Scott). Thucydides contrasts the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>; Aristophanes the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> and the <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span>, the "spectators;" and the word "critic" is derived from this meaning of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>. The whole picture is that of the apostle running his noble race of righteousness to the very end, and of the Lord himself assigning to him the well earned crown of victory in the presence of heaven and earth assembled for the solemnity of that great day. <span class="cmt_word">That have loved his appearing.</span> It will be a characteristic of those who will be crowned at that day that all the time they were lighting the good fight they were looking forward with hope and desire for their Lord's appearing and kingdom.

They will be able to say at that day, "So, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation" (<a href="/isaiah/25-9.htm">Isaiah 25:9</a>). <span class="accented">His appearing</span>; as in ver. 2. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_timothy/4-8.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">From now on</span><br /><span class="grk">&#955;&#959;&#953;&#960;&#8056;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(loipon)</span><br /><span class="parse">Adjective - Accusative Neuter Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3063.htm">Strong's 3063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Finally, from now on, henceforth, beyond that.
