The name Alexander was common, making it difficult to identify him with certainty, but he may be the same individual mentioned in <a href="/acts/19-33.htm">Acts 19:33</a>, who was involved in the uproar in Ephesus. The trade of coppersmiths was significant in Ephesus, a city known for its commerce and idolatry, particularly the worship of Artemis. This connection suggests that Alexander might have had a vested interest in opposing Paul, whose teachings threatened the local economy tied to idol-making.<p><b>did great harm to me.</b><br>The harm Alexander caused Paul is not specified, but it could have been physical, legal, or reputational. In the context of Paul's ministry, opposition often came from those whose economic interests were threatened by the spread of Christianity. This phrase highlights the personal cost of Paul's mission and the reality of persecution faced by early Christians. It also reflects the broader spiritual battle between the early church and those resistant to the Gospel, as seen in other instances of opposition in Acts and Paul's epistles.<p><b>The Lord will repay him</b><br>This statement reflects a deep trust in divine justice. Paul does not seek personal vengeance but leaves judgment to God, aligning with teachings found in <a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>, where believers are instructed to leave room for God's wrath. This perspective is consistent with the broader biblical theme of God as the ultimate judge who will right all wrongs. It underscores the Christian principle of forgiveness and reliance on God's justice rather than personal retribution.<p><b>according to his deeds.</b><br>The concept of being repaid according to one's deeds is a recurring biblical theme, emphasizing accountability and divine justice. This principle is echoed in passages like <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, which speaks of reaping what one sows, and <a href="/revelation/22-12.htm">Revelation 22:12</a>, where Christ promises to reward each person according to their works. It serves as a reminder of the moral order established by God, where actions have consequences, and justice will ultimately prevail.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/alexander_the_coppersmith.htm">Alexander the Coppersmith</a></b><br>A metalworker who opposed Paul and caused him significant harm.

This awareness prepares believers to respond with grace and perseverance.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/forgiveness_and_letting_go.htm">Forgiveness and Letting Go</a></b><br>While acknowledging harm, Paul does not dwell on revenge. Instead, he entrusts the matter to God. Christians are called to forgive and release their grievances to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/perseverance_in_ministry.htm">Perseverance in Ministry</a></b><br>Despite opposition, Paul continued his ministry. This serves as an encouragement for believers to persevere in their calling, knowing that challenges are part of the journey.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/role_of_community_support.htm">Role of Community Support</a></b><br>Paul&#8217;s mention of Alexander serves as a warning to Timothy and the early church community.

<a href="/1_timothy/1-19.htm">1 Timothy 1:19&#8211;20</a>).<p>&#8226; By naming him, Paul is not gossiping but warning Timothy and the church to stay alert to spiritual and practical threats (<a href="/2_timothy/4-15.htm">2 Timothy 4:15</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s Word shows that false teachers or hostile antagonists can rise inside or outside the fellowship, yet believers are to deal with them in truth and love (3 <a href="/bsb/john/9.htm">John 9&#8211;10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>did great harm to me</b><p>&#8226;

Paul does not minimize pain; acknowledging it models honesty for us when we are wronged (<a href="/psalms/55-12.htm">Psalm 55:12&#8211;14</a>).<p>&#8226; Still, Paul stays on mission: even after recounting Alexander&#8217;s harm, he keeps encouraging Timothy to preach the word (<a href="/2_timothy/4-2.htm">2 Timothy 4:2, 5</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>The Lord will repay him</b><p>&#8226;

It reassures Timothy&#8212;and us&#8212;that God sees every injustice, even those unaddressed by earthly courts (<a href="/psalms/94-1.htm">Psalm 94:1&#8211;2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>according to his deeds</b><p>&#8226;

And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defense to the people.">Acts 19:33-34</a>).<p>It has been suggested that this Alexander, an influential Ephesian Jew, had done much injury to the cause of the Christians generally, and to St. Paul personally, with the imperial authorities at Rome.<p><span class= "bld">The Lord reward him according to his works.</span>--The older authorities read, "shall reward him . . ."

It seems probable, though it is necessarily uncertain, that this Alexander is the same person as that mentioned in <a href="/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a> as "a blasphemer," which agrees exactly with what is here said of him, "he greatly withstood our words" (comp. <a href="/acts/13-45.htm">Acts 13:45</a>, "contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed"). He may or may not be the same as the Alexander named in <a href="/acts/19-33.htm">Acts 19:33</a>. Supposing the Alexander of <a href="/1_timothy/1-20.htm">1 Timothy 1:20</a> and this place to be the same, the points of resemblance with the Alexander of <a href="/acts/19-33.htm">Acts 19:33</a> are that both resided at Ephesus, that both seem to have been Christians (see note on 1 Timothy 1:20), and both probably Jews, inasmuch as <a href="/1_timothy/1.htm">1 Timothy 1</a> relates entirely to Jewish heresies (vers. 4, 7, 8), and <a href="/acts/19-33.htm">Acts 19:33</a> expressly states that he was a Jew. <span class="cmt_word">The coppersmith</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span>; only here in the New Testament); properly, <span class="accented">a coppersmith</span>, but used generally of any smith - silversmith, or goldsmith, or blacksmith. <span class="cmt_word">Did me much evil</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). This is a purely Hellenistic idiom, and is found in the LXX. of <a href="/genesis/50-15.htm">Genesis 50:15, 17</a>; Song of the Three Children, 19; 2 Macc. 13:9. In classical Greek the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, in the middle voice, "to display," can only be followed by a subjective quality, as "good will," "virtue," "long suffering," an "opinion," and the like (see Alford, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>).

The question naturally arises - When and where did Alexander thus injure St. Paul? - at Ephesus or at Rome? Bengel suggests Rome, and with great probability. Perhaps he did him evil by stirring up the Jews at Rome against the apostle at the time of "his first defence;" or by giving adverse testimony before the Roman tribunal, possibly accusing him of being seditious, and bringing up the riot at Ephesus as a proof of it; or in some other way, of which the memory has perished. <span class="cmt_word">Will render.</span> The R.T. has the future, <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> for the optative <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3b7;</span>, "a late and incorrect form for <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3b7;</span> (Ellicott, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_timothy/4-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">Alexander</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7944;&#955;&#941;&#958;&#945;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span> <span class="translit">(Alexandros)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_223.htm">Strong's 223: </a> </span><span class="str2">From the same as alektor and aner; man-defender; Alexander, the name of three Israelites and one other man.</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the</span><br /><span class="grk">&#8001;</span> <span class="translit">(ho)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article - Nominative Masculine Singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">The, the definite article.
