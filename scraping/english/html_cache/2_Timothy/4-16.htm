In the Roman legal system, a "defense" would be a formal presentation of one's case before a magistrate or judge. Paul, as a Roman citizen, had the right to such a defense. Historically, this would have taken place in a Roman court, possibly in the Praetorium, where legal matters were addressed. The context suggests that Paul was facing serious charges, likely related to his preaching of the Gospel, which was increasingly seen as a threat to Roman order.<p><b>no one stood with me</b><br>Paul expresses a sense of abandonment, highlighting the loneliness and isolation he felt during this critical moment. This reflects the fear and pressure early Christians faced under Roman persecution. The cultural context of the time was one of suspicion towards Christians, who were often misunderstood and maligned. This phrase also echoes the experience of Jesus Christ, who was deserted by His disciples in His time of need (<a href="/mark/14-50.htm">Mark 14:50</a>).<p><b>but everyone deserted me</b><br>The desertion Paul experienced is reminiscent of the Old Testament prophets who often stood alone in their mission. This phrase underscores the human tendency to flee from danger, even at the cost of loyalty. It also serves as a reminder of the cost of discipleship, as Jesus warned that following Him would lead to persecution (<a href="/john/15-18.htm">John 15:18-20</a>). Theologically, it highlights the theme of suffering for the sake of the Gospel, a recurring motif in Paul's letters.<p><b>May it not be charged against them</b><br>Here, Paul demonstrates a Christ-like attitude of forgiveness, similar to Jesus' words on the cross, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" (<a href="/luke/23-34.htm">Luke 23:34</a>). This reflects the Christian principle of forgiving others, as taught by Jesus in the Lord's Prayer (<a href="/matthew/6-12.htm">Matthew 6:12</a>). It also shows Paul's pastoral heart, as he seeks to absolve those who abandoned him from guilt, emphasizing grace and mercy over judgment.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>The apostle and author of the letter, writing to Timothy from prison in Rome.

No one friend stood by him; no "advocate" pleaded his cause; no "procurator" (an official who performed the functions of the attorney in an English court) helped him in arranging and sifting the evidence; no "patronus" of any noble or powerful house gave him his countenance and support. The position of a well-known Christian leader accused in the year 66-67 was a critical one, and the friend who dared to stand by him would himself be in great danger. After the great fire of Rome, in A.D. 64, the Christians were looked upon as the enemies of the state, and were charged as the authors of that terrible disaster. Nero, to avert suspicion from himself, allowed the Christians to be accused and condemned as incendiaries. A great persecution, in which, as Tacitus tells, a very great multitude of the followers of Jesus perished, was the immediate result of the hateful charge. It is most probable that St. Paul, as a famous Nazarene leader, was eventually arrested as implicated in this crime, and brought to Rome. His implacable enemies among the Jews might well have been the agents who brought this about, and Alexander of the last verse was possibly principally concerned in this matter. But St. Paul, conscious of his own great peril, knew well that to stand by him now, implicated as he was in this net-work of false accusations, would be a service of the greatest danger; so he pleads for them, these weak, unnerved friends of his, who, through no ill-will to the cause, but solely from timidity, had deserted him, remembering, no doubt, his own Master, who, too, in His hour of deadly peril, had been forsaken. (See <a href="/john/16-32.htm" title="Behold, the hour comes, yes, is now come, that you shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.">John 16:32</a>, "Behold the hour cometh, yea is now come, that ye shall be scattered every man to his own, and ye shall leave Me alone.") But like his own Master, who proceeded to say, "Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me," so St. Paul went on to tell Timothy neither was <span class= "ital">he</span> alone, for One greater than any friend on earth stood by him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="accented">Detente</span> for <span class="accented">answer</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">no one took my part</span> for <span class="accented">no man stood with</span> me, A.V.; <span class="accented">all</span> for <span class="accented">all men</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">may it not</span> for <span class="accented">I pray God it may not</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">account</span> for <span class="accented">charge</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Defence</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x1fb3;</span>).

The simple <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> is very common in the New Testament, but nowhere in the technical sense in which it is used here. In classical Greek both forms are common in the sense of "coming to aid," "standing by any one," "assisting." Here it represents the Latin <span class="accented">assistere or adesse</span> in its technical sense of "standing by" an accused person as friend or assistant, to aid and abet them in their defence. Powerful men sometimes brought such a multitude of assistants as to overawe the magistrate, as Orgetorix the Helvetian, when summoned to trial, appeared with ten thousand followers, and so there was no trial. Paul, like his Lord and Master, of whom it is written, "All his disciples forsook him and fled," had no one to stand with him in his hour of need. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/2_timothy/4-16.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Greek</div><span class="word">At</span><br /><span class="grk">&#7960;&#957;</span> <span class="translit">(En)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/greek/strongs_1722.htm">Strong's 1722: </a> </span><span class="str2">In, on, among.
