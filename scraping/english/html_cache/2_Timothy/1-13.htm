The "pattern" suggests a model or blueprint, indicating that the teachings of Paul are not random but structured and intentional. In the early church, maintaining doctrinal purity was crucial as false teachings were prevalent. This echoes the call for steadfastness found in <a href="/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>, where Timothy is urged to guard what has been entrusted to him. The "sound teaching" refers to the healthy, life-giving doctrine that aligns with the truth of the Gospel, contrasting with the false teachings that were spreading at the time.<p><b>you have heard from me</b><br>Paul is reminding Timothy of the personal instruction he received. This personal transmission of teaching underscores the relational aspect of discipleship in the early church. Paul, as an apostle, had the authority and responsibility to pass on the teachings of Christ. This phrase also highlights the importance of apostolic tradition, which was foundational for the early Christian communities. The personal nature of this instruction is a reminder of the mentorship and accountability within the body of Christ.<p><b>with the faith and love</b><br>Faith and love are central virtues in the Christian life, often paired together in Paul's writings (e.g., <a href="/1_corinthians/13-13.htm">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>, <a href="/galatians/5-6.htm">Galatians 5:6</a>). Faith refers to trust and belief in the truth of the Gospel, while love is the practical outworking of that faith in relationships with others. These virtues are not merely abstract concepts but are to be lived out in the believer's life. They serve as the means by which Timothy is to hold on to the teachings, suggesting that doctrine is not just intellectual but also relational and ethical.<p><b>that are in Christ Jesus</b><br>This phrase locates the source and context of faith and love in the person of Jesus Christ. It emphasizes the union believers have with Christ, which is the foundation for their faith and love. In Christ, believers find the perfect example and empowerment to live out these virtues. This connection to Christ is a recurring theme in Paul's letters, highlighting the transformative relationship believers have with their Savior. It also points to the centrality of Christ in all doctrine and practice, as seen in <a href="/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>, where Christ is described as the hope of glory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/p/paul.htm">Paul</a></b><br>- The apostle who authored the letter to Timothy, providing guidance and encouragement to his young prot&#233;g&#233;.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/timothy.htm">Timothy</a></b><br>- A young pastor and close companion of Paul, entrusted with leading the church in Ephesus.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephesus.htm">Ephesus</a></b><br>- The city where Timothy was stationed, known for its diverse culture and challenges to Christian teaching.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/c/christ_jesus.htm">Christ Jesus</a></b><br>- Central figure of the Christian faith, whose teachings and love are the foundation of the message Paul is urging Timothy to uphold.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_sound_doctrine.htm">The Importance of Sound Doctrine</a></b><br>Sound teaching is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the Christian faith.

Timothy&#8217;s benchmark is the apostolic message, not personal preference.

Perhaps in the heart of St. Paul lurked some dread that the new glosses and specious explanations which the school of false teachers, so often referred to in these Pastoral Epistles, chose to add to the great doctrines of Christianity would be more likely to be listened to by Timothy when the hand of his old master was cold and the heart had ceased to beat; so he urged upon him to hold fast those inspired formularies he had heard from St. Paul's lips--such, for instance, as those "faithful sayings" which come before us so often in these Epistles to Timothy and Titus.<p><span class= "bld">In faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</span>--Timothy, in days to come, must mould and shape his teaching after the pattern of the teaching of his master St. Paul, and he must do it in that faith and love which alone comes from a life passed in communion with Christ.<p>The very frequent reference to the "sound, healthy words" in these Epistles by St. Paul, and from which he urges his disciples and successors never to depart, indicate to us the deep importance St. Paul and the first generation of believers attached to the very words and expressions used by the apostles and those who had been with the Lord.<p>False doctrines so easily might creep in, and loose forms of expression respecting great truths were an ever-present danger; a lax life, too, St. Paul knew, was the almost invariable accompaniment of false doctrine, hence these repeated exhortations of his to these representative teachers, Timothy and Titus, of the second generation of Christians, to hold fast the form of sound, healthy words--such words as these had again and again been heard from the lips of apostles and hearers of the Lord--"words which thou hast heard of me," St. Paul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="accented">Hold</span> for <span class="accented">hold fast</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">pattern</span> for <span class="accented">form</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">from</span> for <span class="accented">of</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Hold</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span>).

It may, however, well be doubted whether <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;</span> here is used in even as strong a sense as in the other two passages, inasmuch as here it follows instead of preceding the substantive (see Alford, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>The pattern</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); only here and <a href="/1_timothy/1-16.htm">1 Timothy 1:16</a> (where see note), where it manifestly means a "pattern," not a "form."
