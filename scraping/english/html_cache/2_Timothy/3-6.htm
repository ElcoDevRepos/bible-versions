In the early church, as in today, false teachers often sought to infiltrate communities and homes to spread their doctrines. The imagery of "worming" suggests a stealthy and gradual process, reminiscent of the serpent in <a href="/genesis/3.htm">Genesis 3:1</a>, who subtly deceived Eve. The household was a central unit in ancient society, often serving as a place of worship and teaching (<a href="/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>). The infiltration of false teachings into homes posed a significant threat to the integrity of the early Christian community.<p><b>and captivate vulnerable women</b><br>The term "vulnerable women" refers to those who may be more susceptible to deception due to various factors, such as social status, lack of education, or personal circumstances. In the Greco-Roman world, women often had limited access to formal education and were sometimes marginalized, making them targets for manipulation. This phrase underscores the responsibility of the church to protect and educate all its members, ensuring they are grounded in sound doctrine (<a href="/titus/2-3.htm">Titus 2:3-5</a>).<p><b>who are weighed down with sins</b><br>This part of the verse suggests that these women are burdened by guilt and shame from past sins, making them more susceptible to false teachings that promise relief or justification. The concept of being "weighed down" is reminiscent of <a href="/psalms/38-4.htm">Psalm 38:4</a>, where the psalmist speaks of sins as a heavy burden. The false teachers exploit this vulnerability, offering a counterfeit solution that ultimately leads them further from the truth.<p><b>and led astray by various passions</b><br>The phrase "led astray by various passions" indicates a susceptibility to being misled due to uncontrolled desires or emotions. In the context of the early church, this could refer to a range of temptations, from sexual immorality to idolatry or greed. <a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14-15</a> describes how desire, when it has conceived, gives birth to sin.

As we shall see, these unhappy men busied themselves in securing popularity among the female portion of the flock in the Ephesian Church, and the way by which they won their popularity was by supplying anodynes for the guilty consciences of these women, laden, we are told, with sins The expression, "which creep into houses," although perfectly natural, and one which, even in these Western countries, could be used with propriety to express the method in which these deceiving and perverting men make their way into households, yet, when we remember the comparative state of seclusion in which women usually lived and still live in Eastern lands, the words used by Paul acquire an increased force. Special fraud and deceit was needful for these false teachers to creep into the women's apartments in Asia. The Greek word translated "lead captive" is a peculiar one, and is only found in comparatively later Greek. It is supposed to be a word of Alexandrian or Macedonian origin. It here represents these women as wholly under the influence of these bad men, to the utter destruction of all true, healthy, home life. The Greek word translated "silly women," in the Vulgate "mulierculas," is simply a diminutive, expressing contempt. There is no doubt but that the older Heresiarchs made great use of women in the propagation of their new and strange systems. They worked more easily, perhaps, on the impulsive and emotional female mind; but what has never sufficiently been taken into account is the reaction which was <span class= "ital">then</span> taking place among women, so long relegated to an inferior and subordinate position, and now, by the teaching of Christ and His Apostles, raised to a position of equality with men as regards the hope of future glory. In many instances, in the first ages of Christianity, there is no doubt, but that they misunderstood their position; they claimed work they could never do, and aimed after an influence they could never exercise, and thus, no doubt, in these first feverish years many a woman fell a comparatively easy prey to these proselytisers, who, laying claim to a higher and deeper wisdom, proposed now to lead some into the knowledge of profound and hidden mysteries, now offered ease of conscience to others if they would but follow them. Irenaeus, in the second century, speaks of the special power which the Valentinian Gnostic Marcus had acquired over women; and Epiphanius, in the same century, also refers to the Gnostics' deceitful influence with the female sex. Jerome, in an interesting though rhetorical passage (<span class= "ital">Epist. ad Ctesiphontem</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>cites a number of instances in which a woman shared in the baleful influence exercised by the leading masters of heresy in doctrine and laxity of life.<p>Simon Magus, he tells us, was accompanied by the wicked Helen. Nicolas, of Antioch, a teacher of immorality, gathered round him what Jerome calls <span class= "ital">choros faemineos.</span> Montanus is associated with the well-known names of Maximilla and Prisca. Donatus is coupled with Lucilla. Marcion, Arius, Priscillian, and other Heresiarchs, famous in the annals of the early churches, he speaks of as intimately associated with or supported by female influence.<p><span class= "bld">Laden with sins, led away with divers lusts.</span>--This gives us some insight into the source of the power which these false teachers acquired over those women of Ephesus who <span class= "ital">in name</span> were Christians. They had accepted the faith of Christ, but were unable to live His life; over their passions and lusts had these no mastery. "Laden with sins," and "led away with divers lusts," these weak women fell an easy prey to men who procured them, by means of their lying doctrines, a false peace. By their words they seemed to have lulled the consciences of their female listeners to sleep. They showed them, no doubt, how in <span class= "ital">their</span> school they might still be Christians and yet indulge their divers lusts.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="accented">These</span> for <span class="accented">this sort</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">tact</span> for <span class="accented">which</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">take</span> for <span class="accented">lead</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">by</span> for <span class="accented">with</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Creep into</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); here only in the New Testament.

It is a term of contempt - he will not call them <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> - they are only <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>. In the passages quoted by Alford from Irenaeus and Epiphanius, the women made use of by the later Gnostics are called <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>. See, too, the striking quotation in the same note from Jerome, specifying by name the women whom Nicolas of Antioch, Marcion, Montanus, and others employed as their instruments in spreading their abominable heresies. So true is St. Paul's forecast in the text. <span class="cmt_word">Laden with sins</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); elsewhere only in <a href="/romans/12-20.htm">Romans 12:20</a>, "heap coals of fire." It occurs in Aristotle and other Greek writers in the sense of heaping one thing upon another, and heaping up anything with something else. The last is the sense in which it is here used.
