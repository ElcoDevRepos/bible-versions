In the context of the early church, false teachers and heretics were a significant concern, as seen in other epistles like 1 Timothy and Titus. The term "imposters" suggests those who pretend to be something they are not, echoing Jesus' warnings about false prophets in <a href="/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>. Historically, the early church faced challenges from Gnostic teachings and other heresies that distorted the gospel message.<p><b>go from bad to worse</b><br>This progression indicates a continual moral and spiritual decline. The idea of worsening evil is consistent with the biblical theme of increasing lawlessness as the end times approach, as seen in <a href="/matthew/24-12.htm">Matthew 24:12</a>. This phrase underscores the importance of vigilance and perseverance in faith, as believers are called to stand firm against such corruption. The worsening condition of these individuals reflects the consequences of rejecting truth and embracing deception.<p><b>deceiving and being deceived</b><br>This dual aspect of deception highlights both the active role these individuals play in misleading others and their own susceptibility to falsehood. It aligns with the biblical principle that those who reject the truth are given over to delusion, as described in <a href="/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a> and <a href="/2_thessalonians/2-11.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:11</a>. The cyclical nature of deception serves as a warning to believers about the dangers of straying from sound doctrine and the importance of discernment.

History has borne witness to the accuracy of these prophetic words. The false teachers known to St. Paul and Timothy developed into the leaders of the various wild and speculative Gnostic sects, whose connection with Christianity consisted alone in the name; and each succeeding age has witnessed <span class= "ital">a development</span> in opposition to the truth as it is in Jesus. In this allusion to the gradual development of hostility to the truth it will hardly be out of place to instance the eighteenth Christian century, when opposition to the teaching of Jesus had reached such a pitch that, with the approval or even the applause of thousands, the most brilliant writer in Europe wrote of Christ and His religion in the well-known words, "Ecrasez l'infame!" while it was reserved for our own century--the nineteenth--to witness the rare, though we believe ephemeral popularity, among so-called Christian peoples of a work which, with honeyed phrases, and in romantic, graceful language, paints the Redeemer of man in the strange and apparently contradictory characters of a loving enthusiast and of a conscious impostor!<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/2_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="accented">Impostors</span> for <span class="accented">seducers</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Evil men</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>).
