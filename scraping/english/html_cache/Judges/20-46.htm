This conflict arose from the grievous crime committed in Gibeah, as detailed in <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>. The phrase underscores the immediacy and finality of the judgment executed upon the Benjamites, highlighting the culmination of a series of battles. It serves as a reminder of the swift and decisive nature of divine justice in the biblical narrative.<p><b>25,000 Benjamite swordsmen fell</b><br>The number 25,000 indicates the significant loss suffered by the tribe of Benjamin. This figure emphasizes the scale of the conflict and the severity of the punishment. The Benjamites were known for their skill in battle, as seen earlier in <a href="/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>, where they are described as left-handed slingers capable of hitting a target with precision. The fall of such a large number of warriors signifies a devastating blow to the tribe, both in terms of military strength and population. This event is a stark reminder of the consequences of sin and disobedience to God's law, as the tribe faced near annihilation due to their defense of the wickedness in Gibeah.<p><b>all men of valor</b><br>The description "men of valor" highlights the bravery and combat prowess of the Benjamite warriors. This term is often used in the Old Testament to denote individuals of exceptional courage and strength, such as Gideon in <a href="/judges/6-12.htm">Judges 6:12</a>. Despite their valor, the Benjamites' downfall illustrates that human strength and bravery are insufficient when opposed to divine will. The narrative serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of pride and the importance of aligning one's actions with God's commandments. The fall of these valiant men also foreshadows the ultimate victory of righteousness over wickedness, a theme that resonates throughout the biblical text.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/b/benjamites.htm">Benjamites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel, descended from Benjamin, the youngest son of Jacob.

God had twice allowed Israel to be repulsed, but &#8220;that day&#8221; He granted victory after they sought Him with fasting and offerings (<a href="/judges/20-26.htm">Judges 20:26-28</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores a specific, historical moment&#8212;one day in which judgment descended swiftly, echoing earlier warnings that sin&#8217;s consequences can arrive suddenly (<a href="/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>25,000 Benjamite swordsmen</b><p>&#8226; Earlier, Benjamin fielded 26,000 warriors plus 700 select left-handed slingers (<a href="/judges/20-15.htm">Judges 20:15-16</a>). Losing 25,000 means almost the entire army was wiped out.<p>&#8226; The precision shows Scripture&#8217;s reliability in recounting actual numbers, just as census figures in <a href="/bsb/numbers/1.htm">Numbers 1</a> do.<p>&#8226; It also reveals the severity of Israel&#8217;s response to Benjamin&#8217;s refusal to purge the evil committed at Gibeah (<a href="/bsb/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>). The tribe chose solidarity with sin over repentance, and the cost was nearly total annihilation (cf. <a href="/joshua/7-25.htm">Joshua 7:25</a> for how collective sin can invite collective judgment).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Fell</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Fell&#8221; is the common biblical way to describe warriors slain in combat (<a href="/1_samuel/31-1.htm">1 Samuel 31:1, 8</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/judges/20-35.htm">Judges 20:35</a> makes clear who orchestrated the fall: &#8220;the LORD struck down 25,100 Benjamites before Israel.&#8221; Human swords did the striking, but divine justice directed the outcome.<p>&#8226; Their fall serves as a sober reminder that no military skill or tribal loyalty can shield against God&#8217;s righteous judgment (<a href="/psalms/33-16.htm">Psalm 33:16-17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>All men of valor</b><p>&#8226; Benjamin&#8217;s soldiers were renowned fighters&#8212;left-handed, accurate, courageous (<a href="/judges/20-16.htm">Judges 20:16</a>). Valor, however, without righteousness, cannot save (<a href="/proverbs/21-31.htm">Proverbs 21:31</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture often pairs valor with faithfulness (<a href="/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8-17</a>), but here valor is emptied of its honor because it is enlisted in defense of wickedness (<a href="/judges/19-22.htm">Judges 19:22-23</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase accentuates the tragedy: brave men destroyed not for cowardice but for standing on the wrong side of holiness. Their bravery magnifies the cost of sin.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/20-46.htm">Judges 20:46</a> records a literal, historic slaughter: on that single day, almost the entire Benjamite force&#8212;25,000 seasoned warriors&#8212;was cut down. The verse spotlights four truths: God&#8217;s justice arrives at a definitive moment; numbers matter because real people suffer real consequences; divine judgment is the true cause behind every enemy&#8217;s &#8220;fall&#8221;; and even great valor is futile when aligned against God&#8217;s righteousness.
