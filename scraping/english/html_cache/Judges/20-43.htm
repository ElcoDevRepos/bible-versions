The surrounding of the Benjamites by the other Israelite tribes signifies a strategic military maneuver, indicating the severity of the conflict. This event is part of a larger narrative where the Israelites sought justice for a grievous crime committed in Gibeah, a Benjamite city. The surrounding of the Benjamites can be seen as a fulfillment of divine justice, as the Israelites sought to purge evil from among them, a recurring theme in the Old Testament (<a href="/deuteronomy/13-5.htm">Deuteronomy 13:5</a>).<p><b>pursued them</b><br>The pursuit of the Benjamites highlights the intensity and determination of the Israelite forces. This relentless pursuit can be compared to other biblical instances where God's people are called to pursue righteousness and justice (<a href="/proverbs/21-21.htm">Proverbs 21:21</a>). The pursuit also reflects the seriousness of the covenant community in dealing with sin, as the Benjamites had refused to hand over the perpetrators of the crime in Gibeah.<p><b>and easily overtook them</b><br>The ease with which the Israelites overtook the Benjamites suggests divine intervention and favor. Throughout the Old Testament, God often grants victory to His people when they act in accordance with His will (<a href="/joshua/10-8.htm">Joshua 10:8</a>). This phrase underscores the idea that when God is with His people, their enemies cannot stand against them, a principle echoed in <a href="/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>.<p><b>in the vicinity of Gibeah</b><br>Gibeah was a significant city within the territory of Benjamin, known for its association with King Saul, Israel's first king. The events in Gibeah serve as a backdrop for the moral and spiritual decline of Israel during the time of the Judges, a period marked by the repeated cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance. The location is crucial as it ties the narrative to the broader theme of Israel's need for righteous leadership, ultimately pointing to the future kingship of David and the messianic hope in Jesus Christ.<p><b>on the east</b><br>The mention of the east may have geographical significance, indicating the direction from which the Israelites approached or the area where the Benjamites attempted to flee. In biblical symbolism, the east often represents beginnings or origins, as seen in the Garden of Eden (<a href="/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>). This directional detail might also suggest the completeness of the Israelites' victory, as they left no escape route for the Benjamites, emphasizing the totality of God's judgment against sin.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_benjamites.htm">The Benjamites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel, descended from Benjamin, the youngest son of Jacob.

(<a href="/judges/20-43.htm">Judges 20:43</a>) pictures the tactical moment when Israel&#8217;s united tribes closed ranks around their brothers from Benjamin.<p>&#8226; This enclosing maneuver fulfilled the strategy God had affirmed earlier (<a href="/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>), showing His sovereign direction in battle, just as He led Joshua to encircle Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2&#8211;5</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores accountability: sin isolates (<a href="/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22</a>), and here the tribe that had refused to repent now finds itself literally hemmed in.<p>&#8226; For believers today, the scene warns of the danger of unconfessed sin, which can leave a person surrounded by its consequences (<a href="/psalms/32-3.htm">Psalm 32:3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Pursued them</b><p>The pursuit highlights determined obedience. Once God gave the order, Israel did not hesitate (<a href="/judges/20-35.htm">Judges 20:35</a>).<p>&#8226; Similar zeal appears when Elijah pursued false prophets to complete the Lord&#8217;s judgment (<a href="/1_kings/18-40.htm">1 Kings 18:40</a>).<p>&#8226; Pursuit also shows love for righteousness&#8212;chasing after what God has declared right (<a href="/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>).<p>&#8226; It reminds us that partial obedience isn&#8217;t obedience; free from vengeance, yet faithful to divine justice (<a href="/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And easily overtook them</b><p>&#8220;Easily&#8221; signals the decisive nature of the victory God granted.<p>&#8226; Earlier defeats (<a href="/judges/20-21.htm">Judges 20:21, 25</a>) kept Israel humble, but when their hearts aligned with God&#8217;s, victory became &#8220;easy&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/118-6.htm">Psalm 118:6&#8211;7</a>).<p>&#8226; David testifies, &#8220;By my God I can leap over a wall&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/22-30.htm">2 Samuel 22:30</a>), echoing how divine empowerment turns impossibility into simplicity.<p>&#8226; The ease does not trivialize the cost; it magnifies the Lord&#8217;s strength, not human prowess (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>In the vicinity of Gibeah</b><p>Gibeah, the very place where the grievous sin began (<a href="/judges/19-22.htm">Judges 19:22&#8211;30</a>), becomes the stage of judgment.<p>&#8226; God deals with sin at its source, as He did in Sodom (<a href="/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8226; This locale-driven justice affirms that God is not distant; He steps into human settings to correct wrongs (<a href="/psalms/50-3.htm">Psalm 50:3&#8211;4</a>).<p>&#8226; For readers, it&#8217;s a call to let God address issues where they started&#8212;bringing light to hidden corners of the heart (<a href="/1_john/1-7.htm">1 John 1:7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>On the east</b><p>The eastern flank was traditionally vulnerable, symbolizing exposed weakness (<a href="/ezekiel/40-6.htm">Ezekiel 40:6</a>).<p>&#8226; Facing east also recalls the sunrise&#8212;a fresh start&#8212;yet for Benjamin it marked an ending of rebellion (<a href="/malachi/4-1.htm">Malachi 4:1&#8211;2</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail authenticates the narrative&#8217;s historicity; Scripture&#8217;s precision affirms its reliability (<a href="/luke/1-3.htm">Luke 1:3&#8211;4</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/20-43.htm">Judges 20:43</a> shows Israel, under God&#8217;s command, completely encircling, chasing, and subduing Benjamin at Gibeah&#8217;s eastern side. Every phrase testifies to God&#8217;s righteous judgment, the certainty of His word, and the urgency of wholehearted obedience. The passage warns against persistent sin and encourages believers to trust the Lord, who both disciplines and delivers with perfect justice and mercy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/20.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(43) A strong and poetic description of the total rout and massacre which ensued.<p><span class= "bld">With ease.</span>--There is no "with" in the Hebrew, but perhaps it may be understood. The LXX. and Luther make it mean "from Noria." Others render it "in their rest," i.e., in the places to which they fled for refuge. The Vulg. paraphrases it: "Nor was there any repose of the dying." But the whole verse is obscure.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 43.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thus they inclosed</span>, etc. Another difficult passage, having all the appearance of being a quotation from some poetical description of the battle. The tenses of the verbs and the absence of any conjunctions in the Hebrew makes the diction like that of <a href="/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>. The italic words <span class="accented">thus</span> and the two ands ought to be omitted, to give the stately march of the original. "They inclosed, etc.; they chased them; they trod them down," etc. <span class="accented">They inclosed</span> seems to refer to the stratagem by which the Benjamites were <span class="accented">surrounded</span> by the ambush in their rear and the Israelites in front. Then came the pursuit - "they chased them;" then the massacre - "they trod them down." The three verbs describe the three stages of the battle. <span class="cmt_word">With ease</span>. It does not seem possible that the Hebrew word <span class="accented">menuchah</span> can have this meaning. It means sometimes a <span class="accented">place of rest</span>, and sometimes <span class="accented">a state of rest.</span> Taking the latter meaning, the words <span class="accented">they trod them into rest</span> may mean <span class="accented">they quieted them by crushing them to death under their</span> feet, or <span class="accented">in rest</span> may mean <span class="accented">unresisting.</span> Some render it <span class="accented">unto Menuchah</span>, as if <span class="accented">Menuchah</span> was the name of a place, or <span class="accented">from Nochah</span>, as the Septuagint does. Others, <span class="accented">at the place of rest</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> at every place where they halted to rest the enemy was upon them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/20-43.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They surrounded</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1514;&#1468;&#1456;&#1512;&#1444;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(kit&#183;t&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Piel - Perfect - third person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3803.htm">Strong's 3803: </a> </span><span class="str2">To enclose, to crown, to besiege, to wait</span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Benjamites,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1489;&#1468;&#1460;&#1504;&#1456;&#1497;&#1464;&#1502;&#1460;&#1503;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(bin&#183;y&#257;&#183;min)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1144.htm">Strong's 1144: </a> </span><span class="str2">Benjamin -- 'son of the right hand', youngest son of Jacob, also the name of two other Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">pursued them,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1512;&#1456;&#1491;&#1460;&#1497;&#1508;&#1467;&#1428;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(hir&#183;&#7695;&#238;&#183;p&#772;u&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person common plural &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7291.htm">Strong's 7291: </a> </span><span class="str2">To pursue, chase, persecute</span><br /><br /><span class="word">and easily</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1456;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#601;&#183;n&#363;&#183;&#7717;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4496.htm">Strong's 4496: </a> </span><span class="str2">Repose, peacefully, consolation, an abode</span><br /><br /><span class="word">overtook them</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1491;&#1456;&#1512;&#1460;&#1497;&#1499;&#1467;&#1425;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(hi&#7695;&#183;r&#238;&#183;&#7733;u&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Hifil - Perfect - third person common plural &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1869.htm">Strong's 1869: </a> </span><span class="str2">To tread, to walk, to string a, bow</span><br /><br /><span class="word">in the vicinity</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1463;&#1435;&#1491;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;a&#7695;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_5704.htm">Strong's 5704: </a> </span><span class="str2">As far as, even to, up to, until, while</span><br /><br /><span class="word">of Gibeah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1490;&#1468;&#1460;&#1489;&#1456;&#1506;&#1464;&#1430;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(hag&#183;gi&#7687;&#183;&#8216;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124; Noun - proper - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_1390.htm">Strong's 1390: </a> </span><span class="str2">Gibeah -- 'hill', three cities in Palestine</span><br /><br /><span class="word">on the east.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1513;&#1473;&#1464;&#1469;&#1502;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(&#353;&#257;&#183;me&#353;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - common singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_8121.htm">Strong's 8121: </a> </span><span class="str2">The sun, the east, a ray, a notched battlement</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/judges/20-43.htm">Judges 20:43 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/judges/20-43.htm">Judges 20:43 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/judges/20-43.htm">Judges 20:43 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/judges/20-43.htm">Judges 20:43 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/judges/20-43.htm">Judges 20:43 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/judges/20-43.htm">Judges 20:43  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/judges/20-43.htm">Judges 20:43 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/judges/20-43.htm">Judges 20:43 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/judges/20-43.htm">Judges 20:43 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/judges/20-43.htm">Judges 20:43 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/judges/20-43.htm">OT History: Judges 20:43 They surrounded the Benjamites chased them (Jd Judg.
