Her response demonstrates wisdom and faith, qualities often highlighted in biblical women. Her insight contrasts with Manoah's fear, showcasing her understanding of God's character and intentions.<p><b>&#8220;If the LORD had intended to kill us,</b><br>This statement reflects a deep understanding of God's nature. The LORD, or Yahweh, is depicted throughout the Old Testament as a God of purpose and covenant. Her reasoning aligns with the broader biblical theme that God does not act capriciously but with intention and mercy, especially towards those He has chosen for a specific purpose.<p><b>He would not have accepted the burnt offering and the grain offering from our hands,</b><br>The acceptance of offerings is a sign of God's favor and presence. In the Old Testament, offerings were a means of worship and communication with God. The burnt offering signifies atonement and dedication, while the grain offering represents thanksgiving and provision. Her logic is that God&#8217;s acceptance of their offerings indicates His goodwill towards them.<p><b>nor would He have shown us all these things</b><br>The "things" refer to the angelic visitation and the prophecy concerning the birth of Samson. Divine revelations are often given to reassure and guide God's people. This aligns with other biblical instances where God reveals His plans to individuals, such as Abraham and Sarah regarding Isaac, reinforcing the idea of divine purpose and promise.<p><b>or spoken to us this way.&#8221;</b><br>God's communication with Manoah and his wife is personal and direct, a hallmark of His interactions with those He calls for a special mission. This phrase underscores the intimacy and clarity of God's revelation, similar to His communications with other biblical figures like Moses and Gideon. It also foreshadows the role of Samson as a deliverer, a type of Christ, who would ultimately fulfill God's redemptive plan for Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manoah.htm">Manoah</a></b><br>The father of Samson, a Danite, who is initially fearful after encountering the Angel of the LORD.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/manoah's_wife.htm">Manoah's Wife</a></b><br>Unnamed in the text, she demonstrates faith and understanding of God's intentions, providing reassurance to her husband.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger who appears to Manoah and his wife, announcing the birth of Samson.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/z/zorah.htm">Zorah</a></b><br>The town in the territory of Dan where Manoah and his wife lived.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/b/burnt_offering_and_grain_offering.htm">Burnt Offering and Grain Offering</a></b><br>Sacrifices made to God, symbolizing worship and dedication.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_in_god's_promises.htm">Faith in God's Promises</a></b><br>Manoah's wife exemplifies faith by trusting in God's promise despite her husband's fear.
