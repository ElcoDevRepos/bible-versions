God defends the maligned, reminiscent of David&#8217;s words, &#8220;He saves the humble but brings low those whose eyes are haughty&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-27.htm">Psalm 18:27</a>).<p>&#8226; Believers today learn to guard against contemptuous labeling within Christ&#8217;s body (<a href="/ephesians/4-29.htm">Ephesians 4:29&#8211;32</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/12-4.htm">Judges 12:4</a> records a tragic moment when internal pride triggered bloodshed among God&#8217;s people. Jephthah&#8217;s earnest rally of Gilead meets Ephraim&#8217;s jealous challenge; reckless words spark a fight that ends in Ephraim&#8217;s defeat. The verse shows that:<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s appointed leaders must sometimes confront sin even within the covenant family.<p>&#8226; Arrogant speech can carry catastrophic consequences.<p>&#8226; The LORD remains just and active in Israel&#8217;s history, vindicating the humble and humbling the proud.<p>By taking the verse at face value, we see a sober warning: unity under God cannot survive prideful rivalry, but obedience and humble speech preserve the community He blesses.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/12.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(4) <span class= "bld">All the men of Gilead.</span>--This probably implies the Eastern tribes generally.<p><span class= "bld">And the men of Gilead smote Ephraim because they said . . .</span>--The translation and the meaning are here highly uncertain. It seems to be implied that in spite of Jephthah's perfectly reasonable answer the Ephraimites advanced to attack Gilead, and goaded the Gileadites to fury by intolerable taunts, which prevented the Gileadites from giving any quarter when they had won the victory.<p><span class= "bld">Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim.</span>--If the English Version is here correct, the meaning is, "You people of the eastern half of the tribe of Manasseh are a mere race of runaway slaves, <span class= "ital">who belong neither to Ephraim nor to Manasseh" </span>(<a href="/1_samuel/25-10.htm" title="And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.">1Samuel 25:10</a>). It is very possible that fierce jealousies may have sprung up between the Eastern Manassites and their tribal brethren of the West, and that these may have mainly originated in the fact that the Eastern Manassites less and less acknowledged the lead of Ephraim, but changing their character and their habits, threw in their lot more and more with the pastoral tribes of Reuben and Gad. The taunt sounds as if it had sprung from a schism in clanship, a contemptuous disclaimer on the part of Ephraim of any ties with this Eastern half-tribe. Indeed, the taunt may have been so far true that very probably any who fell into debt or disgrace in Ephraim and Eastern Manasseh might be as likely to fly to Western Manasseh as an English defaulter might escape to New York. And if the Ephraimites indulged in such shameful jibes, it might well be deemed sufficient to account for the ruthless character of the fighting. But the rendering of the English Version is very uncertain, and the versions vary in the view they take of the meaning, punctuation, and even of the reading of the passage. On the whole, the best view is to render the words thus: <span class= "ital">The men of Gilead smote Ephraim </span>[not only in the battle, but in the far more fatal pursuit] <span class= "ital">because they </span>[the men of Gilead] <span class= "ital">said, Ye are fugitives of Ephraim </span>(see on <a href="/judges/12-5.htm" title="And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said to him, Are you an Ephraimite? If he said, No;">Judges 12:5</a>). Then follows the geographical explanation and historical illustration of the clause, which is, "It was possible for the Gileadites to inflict this vengeance, for (1) Gilead [lies] between Ephraim and [Eastern] Manasseh." [Part, at any rate, of Gilead belonged to Gad, and lies geographically between the district of Eastern Manasseh and the district of Ephraim, as is sufficiently clear since Ephraim has advanced "northwards," or <span class= "ital">towards Tsaphon </span>(<a href="/judges/12-1.htm" title="And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said to Jephthah, Why passed you over to fight against the children of Ammon, and did not call us to go with you? we will burn your house on you with fire.">Judges 12:1</a>), for the attack.] Then (2) there follows the seizure of the fords, which led to the total slaughter of all these Ephraimite fugitives. One slight circumstance which adds probability to this view is that "fugitives" (comp. <a href="/jeremiah/44-14.htm" title="So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape.">Jeremiah 44:14</a>) is a term which could hardly be applied to a <span class= "ital">whole tribe.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4, 5.</span> - The English version of these somewhat obscure verses is obviously wrong, and devoid of sense. The obscurity arises partly from verses 5 and 6 being merely an amplification, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a narrative in detail of what is more briefly related in ver. 4; and from the insertion of the explanatory words, "Gilead lies in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasseh," in ver. 4. The literal translation of the two verses is as follows: - <span class="accented">And</span> <span class="accented">the men of Gilead smote Ephraim</span> (at the fords of Jordan), <span class="accented">for</span>, <span class="accented">said they</span>, <span class="accented">ye are fugitives of Ephraim.</span> (<span class="accented">Gilead lies in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasseh</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> between Manasseh and Ephraim, so that in coming from Manasseh, where they had taken refuge, to return to Ephraim they were obliged to pass through Gilead, <span class="accented">and the Gileadites had taken the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites</span>; <span class="accented">and it was so</span>, <span class="accented">that when the fugitives of Ephraim said</span>, <span class="accented">Let me pass over</span>, <span class="accented">that the men of Gilead said</span>, <span class="accented">Art thou an Ephraimite?

Omitting the long explanatory parenthesis from the latter part of ver. 4 to the latter part of ver. 6, the narrative runs (ver. 4), <span class="accented">And the men of Gilead smote Ephraim</span>, <span class="accented">for</span>, <span class="accented">said they</span>, <span class="accented">ye are fugitives of Ephraim</span>; <span class="accented">and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.</span> The parenthesis explains why the Ephraimites had to pass through Gilead, and how the Gileadites ascertained in each case whether a man was an Ephraimite or not. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/12-4.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Then Jephthah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1460;&#1508;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1495;&#1433;</span> <span class="translit">(yip&#772;&#183;t&#257;&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3316.htm">Strong's 3316: </a> </span><span class="str2">Jephthah -- 'He opens', a Gileadite, also a city of Judah</span><br /><br /><span class="word">gathered</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1511;&#1456;&#1489;&#1468;&#1465;&#1444;&#1509;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yiq&#183;b&#333;&#7779;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
