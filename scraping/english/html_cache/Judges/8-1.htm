This context is important as it sets the stage for their reaction to Gideon's actions. Ephraim's central location in the land of Israel and its fertile territory contributed to its prominence. The tribe's desire for recognition and involvement in significant military victories reflects their historical role and expectations.<p><b>&#8220;Why have you done this to us?</b><br>The question posed by the Ephraimites reveals a sense of grievance and exclusion. This reflects the tribal dynamics and rivalries within Israel during the period of the Judges. The tribes often acted independently, and there was no centralized government, leading to tensions when one tribe felt slighted or left out of important events. This question also highlights the human tendency towards pride and the desire for recognition.<p><b>Why did you fail to call us when you went to fight against Midian?&#8221;</b><br>The Ephraimites' complaint centers on not being summoned to join the battle against the Midianites. This reflects the cultural importance of honor and participation in military victories in ancient Israel. Being part of a victorious campaign was a source of pride and honor for a tribe. The Midianite oppression had been severe, and the victory was significant, making the Ephraimites' exclusion more poignant. This also connects to the broader biblical theme of unity and cooperation among God's people.<p><b>And they contended with him violently.</b><br>The contention was not merely verbal but intense and possibly physical, indicating the depth of their anger and the seriousness of the perceived slight. This reflects the often-volatile nature of tribal relations in Israel during this period. The Hebrew word used here can imply a strong, heated dispute, showing the potential for division and conflict within the nation. This incident foreshadows later divisions in Israel, such as the eventual split into the northern and southern kingdoms. It also serves as a reminder of the need for humility and reconciliation among God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

This arrogance was destined, as we shall see later, to bring on them a terrible humiliation (<a href="/judges/12-1.htm" title="And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said to Jephthah, Why passed you over to fight against the children of Ammon, and did not call us to go with you? we will burn your house on you with fire.">Judges 12:1</a>). The complaint was fiercely urged, probably at the time when, by bringing the heads of Oreb and Zeeb (<a href="/judges/7-25.htm" title="And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb on the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the wine press of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.">Judges 7:25</a>), they had proved both their power and their fidelity to the national cause.

It is possible that the transfer of the birthright from Manasseh to Ephraim (<a href="/genesis/48-13.htm">Genesis 48:13-19</a>) may have produced some estrangement between the tribes. It is also possible that Ephraim, in view of their great tribal power, and the distinction conferred upon them by the judgeship of Joshua the son of Nun (<a href="/numbers/13-8.htm">Numbers 13:8</a>), and the possession of his grave (<a href="/joshua/24-30.htm">Joshua 24:30</a>), may have grown haughty and domineering, and perhaps more disposed to rest upon their former glories than to embark in fresh undertakings. Anyhow Gideon did not consult them, nor ask their aid, in the first instance.
