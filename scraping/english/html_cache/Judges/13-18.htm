In ancient Near Eastern culture, names were significant and often revealed something about the individual's nature or role. The angel of the LORD's response suggests that His identity is not something that can be fully grasped or contained by human understanding. This reflects the divine nature of the angel, who is often interpreted as a theophany, a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ. This is similar to the encounter Moses had with God in <a href="/exodus/3-13.htm">Exodus 3:13-14</a>, where God reveals Himself as "I AM WHO I AM," indicating a name that transcends human comprehension.<p><b>said the angel of the LORD,</b><br>The "angel of the LORD" is a unique figure in the Old Testament, often associated with divine appearances. This figure is distinct from other angels and is frequently identified with God Himself, as seen in various passages such as <a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7-13</a> and <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2-6</a>. The angel of the LORD often speaks with the authority of God, further supporting the interpretation that this is a manifestation of God, possibly a pre-incarnate Christ. This aligns with the conservative Christian view that sees Christ's presence throughout the Old Testament.<p><b>&#8220;since it is beyond comprehension?&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "beyond comprehension" indicates the transcendence and mystery of God's nature. In Hebrew, the word used can also mean "wonderful" or "incomprehensible," suggesting something that is too marvelous for human understanding. This echoes <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, where the coming Messiah is called "Wonderful Counselor," highlighting the divine wisdom and mystery of Christ. The incomprehensibility of God's name underscores the theme of God's holiness and otherness, reminding believers of the limitations of human understanding when it comes to the divine. This serves as a call to faith and trust in God's revealed character and purposes, even when they surpass human understanding.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_angel_of_the_lord.htm">The Angel of the LORD</a></b><br>A divine messenger who appears to Manoah and his wife, announcing the birth of Samson.

This was a sincere request, but the angel pushes Manoah to consider why he wants the information.<p>&#8226; Similar moments in Scripture show that knowing God&#8217;s name is more than collecting data; it involves understanding His character and submitting to His authority:<p>&#8211; Jacob asked, &#8220;Please tell me Your name,&#8221; and was gently redirected (<a href="/genesis/32-29.htm">Genesis 32:29</a>).<p>&#8211; Moses asked God&#8217;s name, and the LORD revealed &#8220;I AM WHO I AM,&#8221; highlighting His self-existence (<a href="/exodus/3-13.htm">Exodus 3:13-14</a>).<p>&#8226; The question exposes our tendency to put God in manageable categories. The angel&#8217;s response reminds us that we approach the Holy One on His terms, not ours (<a href="/isaiah/55-8.htm">Isaiah 55:8-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>said the angel of the LORD</b><p>&#8220;said the angel of the LORD,&#8221;<p>&#8226; This figure consistently speaks as God, receives worship, and bears the divine name (<a href="/judges/13-16.htm">Judges 13:16</a>; 13:20-22).<p>&#8226; Elsewhere, the Angel of the LORD appears:<p>&#8211; To Hagar, promising what only God can promise (<a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7-13</a>).<p>&#8211; To Moses in the burning bush, identifying Himself as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2-6</a>).<p>&#8211; To Gideon, accepting sacrifice and bringing peace (<a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-24</a>).<p>&#8226; These encounters point to a pre-incarnate manifestation of the Son, foreshadowing the incarnation (<a href="/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>).

Manoah need not dissect God&#8217;s mystery; he must trust and worship, which he does by offering a burnt offering and witnessing the angel ascend in the flame (<a href="/judges/13-19.htm">Judges 13:19-20</a>).<p>&#8226; The lesson carries forward to Christ, whose &#8220;name is above every name&#8221; (<a href="/philippians/2-9.htm">Philippians 2:9</a>) and who still surpasses full comprehension, even as He makes God known (<a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/13-18.htm">Judges 13:18</a> reveals that God&#8217;s name embodies His incomprehensible nature. The Angel of the LORD&#8212;God Himself&#8212;asks Manoah why he seeks a label that his finite mind cannot contain. Instead of giving the name, He displays His character in power and holiness, leading Manoah to worship. The passage calls us to humility, awe, and trust in the One whose greatness is wonderful beyond measure yet who graciously draws near to redeem.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">Seeing it is secret.</span>--The word <span class= "ital">is peli, </span>which in <a href="/isaiah/9-5.htm" title="For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.">Isaiah 9:5</a> is rendered "wonderful."
