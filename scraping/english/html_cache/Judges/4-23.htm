This reflects the recurring biblical theme that victories are attributed to God's power rather than human strength. It echoes other instances where God fights for Israel, such as in <a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a> during the crossing of the Red Sea. The term "subdued" suggests a complete and overwhelming defeat, aligning with the idea that God is sovereign over all nations.<p><b>Jabin king of Canaan</b><br>Jabin is identified as the king of Canaan, ruling from Hazor, a significant city in northern Israel. Historically, Hazor was a major Canaanite city, and archaeological evidence supports its prominence during this period. The mention of Jabin connects to earlier biblical narratives, as Hazor was previously defeated by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/11.htm">Joshua 11:1-11</a>), indicating a resurgence of Canaanite power that God once again dismantles.<p><b>before the Israelites</b><br>This phrase highlights the role of the Israelites as witnesses to God's power. It serves to strengthen their faith and trust in God, reinforcing the covenant relationship. The victory is not just a military success but a spiritual affirmation of God's promises to His people. It also foreshadows the ultimate victory of God's people over their enemies, a theme that resonates throughout the Bible, culminating in the eschatological triumph in Revelation.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/god.htm">God</a></b><br>The sovereign Lord who orchestrates the events and delivers His people.

We are not yet in a position to formulate the law which regulates the interchange of these names. It need hardly be added that this attribution of the deliverance of Israel to God's providence and aid does not necessarily involve the least approval of the false and cruel elements which stained the courage and faith of Jael. Though God overrules even criminal acts to the fulfilment of His own purposes, the crimes themselves meet with their own just condemnation and retribution. This may be seen decisively in the case of Jehu. His conduct, like that of Jael, was of a mixed character. He was an instrument in the hands of God to punish and overthrow the guilty house of Ahab, and in carrying out this Divine commission, he, too, showed dauntlessness and faith, yet his atrocious cruelty is justly condemned by the voice of the prophet (<a href="/hosea/1-4.htm" title="And the LORD said to him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel on the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel.">Hosea 1:4</a>), just as that of Baasha had been (<a href="/1_kings/16-7.htm" title="And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.">1Kings 16:7</a>), though he, too, was an instrument of Divine retribution. To explain this clause, and the triumphal cry of Deborah--"So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord"--as Bishop Wordsworth does, to mean that "<span class= "ital">the work of Jael </span>is represented by the sacred writer as <span class= "ital">the work of God," </span>is to claim Divine sanction for a wish that wicked or hostile powers should always "so" perish by cruel and treacherous assassination. At the same time, Jael must not be classed with women actuated only by a demoniacal thirst for vengeance, like Criemhild, in the Niebelungen; or even with Aretophila, of Cyrene, whom Plutarch so emphatically praises (<span class= "ital">On the Virtues of Women, </span>p. 19, quoted by Cassel); but rather with women like Judith in ancient, or Charlotte Corday in modern times, who regarded themselves as the champions of a great and good cause.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/4-23.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">On that</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1463;&#1492;&#1428;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;</span> <span class="translit">(ha&#183;h&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
