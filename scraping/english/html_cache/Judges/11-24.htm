Chemosh was the national deity of the Moabites, often associated with war and destruction. The mention of Chemosh here is significant because it highlights the cultural and religious differences between the Israelites and their neighbors. The Moabites and Ammonites, though related to Israel through Lot, had distinct religious practices that often led to conflict with Israel. Jephthah's rhetorical question implies that just as the Ammonites claim land given by their god, Israel has a similar claim through Yahweh. This reflects the ancient Near Eastern belief that deities granted land and victory in battle. Theologically, it underscores the idea of divine sovereignty over nations and territories.<p><b>So also, we possess whatever the LORD our God has granted us.</b><br>This statement asserts Israel's divine right to the land they occupy, as granted by Yahweh. The LORD, or Yahweh, is the covenant name of God, emphasizing His personal relationship with Israel. This claim is rooted in the promises made to the patriarchs, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, regarding the land of Canaan (<a href="/genesis/12-7.htm">Genesis 12:7, 15</a>:18-21). Theologically, it reflects the fulfillment of God's promises and His faithfulness to His covenant people. Historically, this period in Judges is marked by cycles of apostasy, oppression, and deliverance, with leaders like Jephthah raised up to deliver Israel. The phrase also highlights the contrast between the living God of Israel and the idols of the surrounding nations. In a broader biblical context, this can be seen as a type of Christ, who secures an eternal inheritance for His people, not through territorial conquest, but through His redemptive work.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, known for his leadership and his vow.
