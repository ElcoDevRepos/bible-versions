This moment of weakness contrasts with his previous triumph over the Philistines, emphasizing the dependency of even the strongest individuals on God for sustenance. Thirst is a recurring biblical motif symbolizing spiritual longing (<a href="/psalms/42.htm">Psalm 42:1-2</a>).<p><b>Samson cried out to the LORD</b><br>This marks a rare instance of Samson directly praying to God, indicating a moment of humility and recognition of divine authority. It reflects the biblical theme of calling upon the Lord in times of distress (<a href="/psalms/18-6.htm">Psalm 18:6</a>). Samson's prayer shows a shift from self-reliance to seeking divine intervention.<p><b>&#8220;You have accomplished this great deliverance through Your servant.</b><br>Samson acknowledges that the victory over the Philistines was not by his own strength but by God's power. This confession aligns with the biblical principle that God is the source of all deliverance (<a href="/psalms/44-3.htm">Psalm 44:3</a>). The term "servant" indicates Samson's role as an instrument of God's will, similar to other judges and prophets.<p><b>Must I now die of thirst</b><br>Samson's question underscores the irony of achieving a great victory only to face death from a basic need. It reflects the human tendency to doubt God's provision after experiencing His power. This echoes Israel's complaints in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/17-3.htm">Exodus 17:3</a>), where physical needs tested faith.<p><b>and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?&#8221;</b><br>The term "uncircumcised" refers to the Philistines, highlighting the covenantal distinction between Israel and its enemies. Circumcision was a sign of the Abrahamic covenant (<a href="/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>), and Samson's concern reflects the shame of being defeated by those outside God's covenant.

The judge who moments ago wielded supernatural strength now shows humble dependence (<a href="/psalms/34-6.htm">Psalm 34:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase &#8220;cried out&#8221; hints at urgency and faith. God had promised deliverance through Samson (<a href="/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>), and Samson clings to that promise.<p>&#8226; Throughout Judges, Israel&#8217;s pattern is to cry out in distress and find mercy (<a href="/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9-15</a>; 10:10-16). Samson steps into that pattern personally.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;You have accomplished this great deliverance through Your servant</b><p>&#8226; Samson credits victory to the Lord, acknowledging himself merely as an instrument&#8212;echoing Moses&#8217; song in <a href="/exodus/15-1.htm">Exodus 15:1-2</a> and David&#8217;s conviction that &#8220;the battle is the LORD&#8217;s&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>).<p>&#8226; This confession reinforces God&#8217;s sovereignty in Israel&#8217;s salvation history. Any strength Samson possesses is God-given (<a href="/judges/14-6.htm">Judges 14:6</a>).<p>&#8226; The humility in the phrase &#8220;Your servant&#8221; sets the tone for true leadership (<a href="/numbers/12-7.htm">Numbers 12:7</a>; <a href="/2_timothy/2-24.htm">2 Timothy 2:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Must I now die of thirst</b><p>&#8226; The question is honest, almost plaintive. Faith does not eliminate real fears; it brings them to God (<a href="/psalms/22-14.htm">Psalm 22:14-15</a>).<p>&#8226; Samson believes the Lord cares for physical as well as spiritual needs&#8212;anticipating Jesus&#8217; teaching that the Father knows we need daily sustenance (<a href="/matthew/6-31.htm">Matthew 6:31-32</a>).<p>&#8226; His plea also recognizes the covenant promise of life in the land for God&#8217;s people (<a href="/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7-9</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Uncircumcised&#8221; highlights covenant identity: Israel belongs to God; the Philistines do not (<a href="/genesis/17-9.htm">Genesis 17:9-14</a>).<p>&#8226; To die at their hands would seem to nullify the deliverance just given. Samson argues from God&#8217;s own purpose: You spared me for victory; do not now surrender me to the enemy (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6</a>; 17:26).<p>&#8226; The phrase echoes David&#8217;s later disdain for Goliath&#8217;s covenant-outsider status, linking Israel&#8217;s heroes in a common theology of God-given triumph over the nations.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/15-18.htm">Judges 15:18</a> captures a dramatic pivot from triumph to need. Samson, physically spent yet spiritually aware, turns immediately to the Lord who empowered him. He confesses God&#8217;s sole authorship of victory, pleads for sustaining mercy, and anchors his request in covenant realities. The verse teaches that every deliverance, great or small, is God&#8217;s work; that servants who wield divine power must also voice humble dependence; and that the same Lord who grants victory delights to meet the everyday, bodily needs of His people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(18) <span class= "bld">He was sore athirst.</span>--It was in the heat of harvest time, and he had pursued the Philistines till he was exhausted.<p><span class= "bld">Into the hand.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">by the hand.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He was sore athirst</span>.
