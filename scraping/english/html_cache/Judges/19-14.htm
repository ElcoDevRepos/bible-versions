The journey reflects the period of the Judges, characterized by a lack of centralized leadership in Israel, as "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). The Levite's journey underscores the tribal and fragmented nature of Israelite society at the time.<p><b>and the sun set</b><br>The setting sun signifies the approach of night, a time often associated with danger and uncertainty in biblical narratives. In ancient times, travel after dark was perilous due to the lack of lighting and the threat of bandits. This detail foreshadows the impending events in Gibeah, highlighting the vulnerability of travelers and the moral darkness prevalent in Israel during the Judges period.<p><b>as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin</b><br>Gibeah, a town in the territory of Benjamin, becomes the setting for the tragic events that follow. The town's name means "hill," and it is historically significant as the birthplace of King Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/10-26.htm">1 Samuel 10:26</a>). The narrative in <a href="/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a> serves as a precursor to the civil strife between the tribes of Israel and Benjamin, leading to the near destruction of the Benjamites (Judges 20-21). The events in Gibeah echo the depravity found in Sodom (Genesis 19), drawing a parallel between the moral decay in both stories. This connection emphasizes the need for righteous leadership and foreshadows the eventual establishment of the monarchy in Israel.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A central figure in this account, the Levite is traveling with his concubine and servant.
