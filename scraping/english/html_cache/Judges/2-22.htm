The context is the period after Joshua's death when Israel failed to fully drive out the Canaanites. This divine testing serves as a means to reveal Israel's faithfulness or lack thereof.<p><b>I will test</b><br>The concept of testing is prevalent throughout Scripture, often used by God to refine and prove the faith of His people. Examples include Abraham's test with Isaac (Genesis 22) and the Israelites in the wilderness (<a href="/exodus/16-4.htm">Exodus 16:4</a>). Testing is not for God's knowledge, as He is omniscient, but for the benefit of the people to understand their own hearts.<p><b>whether Israel will keep</b><br>Keeping the way of the LORD involves obedience to His commandments and statutes. The covenant relationship established at Sinai required Israel to adhere to God's laws as a sign of their faithfulness and devotion. This phrase underscores the conditional nature of the covenant blessings.<p><b>the way of the LORD</b><br>This phrase signifies the path of righteousness and obedience to God's commands. It is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, emphasizing a lifestyle that aligns with God's will. <a href="/proverbs/10-29.htm">Proverbs 10:29</a> refers to the way of the LORD as a stronghold for the blameless, highlighting its protective and guiding nature.<p><b>by walking in it</b><br>Walking in the way of the LORD implies a continuous, active lifestyle of obedience and faith. It is not merely about knowing God's laws but living them out daily. This imagery of walking is used throughout Scripture to describe a life of faith, as seen in Enoch's walk with God (<a href="/genesis/5-24.htm">Genesis 5:24</a>).<p><b>as their fathers did</b><br>This refers to the patriarchs and faithful ancestors who followed God's commands. It serves as a reminder of the covenantal faithfulness expected of Israel, drawing on the legacy of figures like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. The call to emulate their faithfulness is a recurring exhortation in the Old Testament.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The nation chosen by God, consisting of the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

If in one point of view the non-extermination of Canaan at first led the Israelites into temptation and brought down retributive punishments upon them, yet out of these evils God raised the two-fold good, that they meanwhile increased sufficiently in numbers to be able effectually to till the soil and keep down the wild beasts, and were also being trained in bravery and warlike skill, while the aborigines were being driven out "by little and by little." Further, we see that a real growth was going on during this period of suffering and anarchy. The peril of internal discord was partly averted by the noble life, and inspiring memories, and treasures of infinite truth which they had acquired in the free air of the desert. "They learned by perpetual struggle to defend their new home, and the free exercise of their religion, and so they prepared for coming generations a sacred place where that religion and national culture might develop. During the long pause of apparent inaction a hidden movement was going on, and the principles and truths so marvellously brought to light were taking firm root."
