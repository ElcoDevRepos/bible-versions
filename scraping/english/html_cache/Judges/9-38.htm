Gloating, or boasting, is often condemned in Scripture as prideful (<a href="/proverbs/16-18.htm">Proverbs 16:18</a>). Zebul's question underscores the futility of Gaal's earlier arrogance and serves as a reminder of the biblical principle that pride precedes a fall.<p><b>Zebul replied.</b><br>Zebul was the governor of Shechem under Abimelech. His role is significant as he represents the internal political dynamics and loyalties within the city. His reply indicates his allegiance to Abimelech and his strategic position in the unfolding events. This interaction reflects the complex political landscape of the time, where local leaders often had divided loyalties.<p><b>&#8220;You said, &#8216;Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?&#8217;</b><br>This recalls Gaal's earlier defiance against Abimelech, questioning his legitimacy and authority. The rhetorical question mirrors the challenge posed by the Israelites in <a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>, questioning Moses' authority. It highlights the recurring theme of questioning God-appointed leadership, which often leads to conflict and judgment.<p><b>Are these not the people you ridiculed?</b><br>Zebul points out Gaal's previous mockery of Abimelech's forces, emphasizing the irony of the situation. Ridicule and scorn are frequently depicted in the Bible as tools of the wicked (<a href="/psalms/1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>). This phrase serves as a reminder of the consequences of underestimating one's opponents and the biblical warning against speaking ill of others.<p><b>Go out now and fight them!&#8221;</b><br>Zebul's command to Gaal is a call to action, challenging him to back his words with deeds. This reflects the biblical principle that faith and words must be accompanied by action (<a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>). The challenge to fight also echoes the numerous biblical battles where God&#8217;s people are called to stand firm and trust in divine deliverance, though in this case, it is a test of Gaal's own bravado.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/z/zebul.htm">Zebul</a></b><br>The governor of Shechem and a supporter of Abimelech.

Loyalty to his appointed ruler outweighs personal irritation (<a href="/proverbs/17-17.htm">Proverbs 17:17</a>; <a href="/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1</a>).<p>- His response also reveals God&#8217;s hidden hand: the ruler of the city prevents a coup that would have plunged Israel into deeper chaos, preserving order long enough for God&#8217;s judgment to unfold exactly as prophesied (<a href="/judges/9-22.htm">Judges 9:22-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>You said, &#8216;Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?&#8217;</b><p>- Gaal&#8217;s disdain echoes Pharaoh&#8217;s &#8220;Who is the LORD&#8230;?&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/5-2.htm">Exodus 5:2</a>) and Nabal&#8217;s &#8220;Who is David&#8230;?&#8221; (<a href="/1_samuel/25-10.htm">1 Samuel 25:10</a>). Such contempt consistently precedes downfall.<p>- The statement illustrates Israel&#8217;s cycle in Judges: rejecting God-ordained leadership invites disorder and oppression (<a href="/jude/1-8.htm">Jude 1:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Are these not the people you ridiculed?</b><p>- Zebul points to the very troops Gaal mocked&#8212;now marching against him. The taunt highlights the principle that mockery invites recompense (<a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>).<p>- Like Sennacherib&#8217;s blasphemous boasts later silenced by the Angel of the LORD (<a href="/2_kings/19-10.htm">2 Kings 19:10-13, 35</a>-37), Gaal&#8217;s scorn rebounds upon his own head, fulfilling Jotham&#8217;s earlier curse that fire would come from Abimelech to consume Shechem (<a href="/judges/9-20.htm">Judges 9:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Go out now and fight them!</b><p>- Zebul forces Gaal to act on his words&#8212;no retreat, no excuses. Empty bravado must face reality (<a href="/1_kings/20-11.htm">1 Kings 20:11</a>).<p>- The command exposes the difference between bold speech and true courage grounded in faith (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45</a>). Without the LORD, even a large following is powerless (<a href="/proverbs/24-21.htm">Proverbs 24:21-22</a>).<p>- The ensuing battle ends with Gaal&#8217;s defeat and expulsion (<a href="/judges/9-39.htm">Judges 9:39-41</a>), proving that God vindicates authority He permits and humbles those who exalt themselves.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/9-38.htm">Judges 9:38</a> captures the turning point where proud words meet God-arranged consequences. Zebul&#8217;s sharp challenge unmasks Gaal&#8217;s arrogance, compels accountability, and advances divine judgment foretold against Shechem. The verse reminds that boasting apart from God is short-lived, authority matters, and every idle taunt is answered&#8212;often by the very circumstances once despised.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(38) <span class= "bld">Where is now thy mouth . . .?</span><span class= "ital">--</span>"Mouth" here means <span class= "ital">boastfulness. </span>This is usually taken as a bitter taunt, as though Zebul could now safely throw off his deceitful acquiescence in Gaal's plans.
