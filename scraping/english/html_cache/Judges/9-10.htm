The trees represent the people of Israel seeking a leader. The fig tree is symbolic of prosperity and blessing in the Bible, often associated with peace and security (<a href="/1_kings/4-25.htm">1 Kings 4:25</a>, <a href="/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>). The fig tree's mention here suggests a desire for a leader who can provide stability and abundance.<p><b>&#8216;Come and reign over us.&#8217;</b><br>The request for the fig tree to reign indicates the people's search for a king or ruler. In the context of Judges, this reflects Israel's recurring cycle of seeking leadership to deliver them from oppression. The plea for the fig tree to rule highlights the people's desire for a leader who embodies the qualities of the fig tree&#8212;fruitfulness and provision. This request can be seen as a foreshadowing of Israel's later demand for a king in <a href="/1_samuel/8.htm">1 Samuel 8</a>, which ultimately leads to the anointing of Saul. Theologically, it points to the human tendency to seek earthly leaders rather than relying on God's sovereignty.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_trees.htm">The Trees</a></b><br>Symbolic representation of the people of Shechem seeking a leader.
