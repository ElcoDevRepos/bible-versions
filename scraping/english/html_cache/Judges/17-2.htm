The mother-son relationship here is crucial, as it sets the stage for the unfolding narrative. The family unit was the primary social structure, and the respect and authority within it were paramount.<p><b>&#8220;The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you</b><br>The mention of "eleven hundred shekels of silver" is significant, as it represents a substantial amount of wealth during this period. This sum is reminiscent of the amount offered to Delilah by the Philistine rulers in <a href="/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5</a>, indicating its considerable value. The silver's theft suggests a breach of trust and familial discord, highlighting the moral and spiritual decline in Israel during the time of the Judges.<p><b>and about which I heard you utter a curse&#8212;</b><br>Curses in the ancient Near East were taken very seriously, often believed to invoke divine retribution. The mother's curse would have been perceived as powerful, potentially invoking fear or guilt in the son. This reflects the cultural belief in the power of spoken words and the spiritual consequences of actions.<p><b>I have the silver here with me; I took it.&#8221;</b><br>The confession of theft by the son reveals a moment of moral clarity or fear of the curse's consequences. This act of confession is pivotal, as it demonstrates the internal conflict and the struggle between right and wrong. It also underscores the theme of personal responsibility and the need for repentance.<p><b>Then his mother said, &#8220;Blessed be my son by the LORD!&#8221;</b><br>The mother's response is one of forgiveness and blessing, invoking the name of the LORD. This reflects the cultural and religious practice of seeking divine favor and the power of parental blessing. Her reaction contrasts with the curse, showing a shift from potential judgment to grace. This blessing can be seen as a type of Christ's redemptive work, where confession leads to forgiveness and restoration.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A man from the hill country of Ephraim who confesses to stealing silver from his mother.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah's_mother.htm">Micah's Mother</a></b><br>The woman who curses the thief of her silver, not knowing it was her son, and later blesses him upon his confession.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hill_country_of_ephraim.htm">The Hill Country of Ephraim</a></b><br>The region where Micah and his mother reside, significant in the tribal allotments of Israel.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_silver.htm">The Silver</a></b><br>Eleven hundred shekels of silver, a substantial amount, which Micah confesses to stealing and returning.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_curse_and_blessing.htm">The Curse and Blessing</a></b><br>The mother's initial curse upon the thief and subsequent blessing upon her son highlight the power of words and intentions in Hebrew culture.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_confession.htm">The Importance of Confession</a></b><br>Micah's confession to his mother demonstrates the biblical principle of confessing sins to restore relationships and receive forgiveness.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_power_of_words.htm">The Power of Words</a></b><br>The mother's curse and subsequent blessing illustrate the significant impact of our words, both positive and negative, on others.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/r/restitution_and_repentance.htm">Restitution and Repentance</a></b><br>Returning the stolen silver is an act of restitution, showing that true repentance involves making amends for wrongs done.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/family_dynamics_and_faith.htm">Family Dynamics and Faith</a></b><br>The interaction between Micah and his mother highlights the complexities of family relationships and the role of faith in resolving conflicts.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_role_of_blessings_and_curses.htm">The Role of Blessings and Curses</a></b><br>This passage reminds us of the spiritual weight of blessings and curses, urging us to be mindful of how we use our words.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_17_2_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 17:2?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Judges_17_2_Honor_parental_authority.htm">How does Judges 17:2 illustrate the importance of honoring parental authority today?

The repetition signals that money was a powerful temptation in those chaotic days (cf. <a href="/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>).<p>&#8226; The narrative reminds us how material wealth can become a snare when a society drifts from God&#8217;s law (<a href="/psalms/62-10.htm">Psalm 62:10</a>; <a href="/matthew/6-24.htm">Matthew 6:24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>taken from you</b><p>&#8226; The silver had been stolen from Micah&#8217;s mother.

A parent&#8217;s curse over stolen property invoked God&#8217;s justice (<a href="/deuteronomy/27-16.htm">Deuteronomy 27:16</a>).<p>&#8226; Micah&#8217;s fear of the curse shows that conscience survives even in spiritual decline (<a href="/romans/2-15.htm">Romans 2:15</a>). He recognizes that hidden sin puts him under divine judgment (<a href="/numbers/32-23.htm">Numbers 32:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>I have the silver here with me; I took it</b><p>&#8226; Micah confesses, yet his motive seems self-preservation more than contrition; he wants the curse lifted.

Micah admits guilt, yet the ensuing verses reveal he will use the silver for an idol (<a href="/judges/17-3.htm">Judges 17:3-4</a>), showing the shallow nature of his turning.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Blessed be my son by the LORD!</b><p>&#8226; The mother swiftly replaces her curse with a blessing. Parental blessing was deeply significant (<a href="/genesis/27-28.htm">Genesis 27:28-29</a>).<p>&#8226; Her eagerness to bless, without addressing the violated commandments, reflects the spiritual confusion of the era. She invokes &#8220;the LORD&#8221; (YHWH) yet soon funds an image contrary to the second commandment (<a href="/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene illustrates syncretism&#8212;using covenant language while disregarding covenant law (<a href="/isaiah/29-13.htm">Isaiah 29:13</a>; <a href="/james/1-22.htm">James 1:22</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/17-2.htm">Judges 17:2</a> exposes the moral drift of Israel during the Judges. A son steals a fortune from his mother, fears a spoken curse, and confesses primarily to escape it.

See <a href="/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">Thou cursedst</span>. The Cethib and the Alexandrian Codex of the Septuagint read, <span class="accented">Thou cursedst</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span>. adjuredst me, which is a better reading. There is a direct and verbal reference to the law contained in <a href="/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>. The word <span class="accented">thou cursedst</span> here and the voice of <span class="accented">swearing</span> in Leviticus are the same root. It was in consequence of this <span class="accented">adjuration</span> that Micah confessed his guilt. Compare <a href="/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a>, when our Lord, on the adjuration of the high priest, broke his silence and confessed that he was Christ, the Son of God. In Achan's confession (<a href="/joshua/7-19.htm">Joshua 7:19, 20</a>) there is no distinct reference to <a href="/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>, though this may have been the ground of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/17-2.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">He said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1443;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
