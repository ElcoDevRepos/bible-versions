The call to arms was a rallying cry for the tribes to unite against a common enemy, in this case, the Midianites. This reflects the tribal confederation system of Israel before the establishment of a monarchy, where leaders like Gideon would rise to deliver the people in times of crisis.<p><b>Gideon sent messengers throughout Manasseh</b><br>Gideon, from the tribe of Manasseh, begins his call to arms within his own tribe. Manasseh was one of the larger tribes, and Gideon's leadership role is significant as it shows his influence and the trust placed in him by his own people. This action also highlights the importance of tribal loyalty and kinship in ancient Israelite society.<p><b>as well as Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali</b><br>These tribes were located in the northern part of Israel, indicating that the threat from the Midianites was widespread, affecting multiple regions. The inclusion of these tribes shows the need for a united front among the Israelites. Historically, these tribes had varying degrees of interaction and cooperation, and Gideon's ability to rally them speaks to his leadership and the severity of the threat.<p><b>so that they came up to meet him</b><br>The response of the tribes to Gideon's call demonstrates their willingness to follow his leadership and engage in battle. This collective action is crucial for the success of their mission against the Midianites. It also foreshadows the unity that would later be sought under the monarchy, as seen in the reigns of Saul, David, and Solomon. The phrase suggests a readiness and urgency among the tribes to confront their oppressors, reflecting the desperation and hope for deliverance that characterized this period in Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Gideon is called by God to deliver Israel from the oppression of the Midianites.

This time Asher did not linger on the sands of Accho or the rocks of the Tyrian Ladder. Issachar, however, as before, "bowed his shoulder to the yoke." Perhaps the fact that the Plain of Jezreel, the battle-field of Palestine, was in the domains of this tribe, though not far from the border of Manasseh (<a href="/joshua/17-16.htm" title="And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.">Joshua 17:16</a>), was unfavourable to their independence and strength.
