The "evil" refers to actions that are contrary to God's commandments, particularly idolatry and disobedience. The phrase "in the sight of the LORD" emphasizes that God is always aware of human actions, and His standards are the measure of righteousness. This cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance is central to the narrative of Judges. The Israelites' actions are often contrasted with the covenantal expectations set forth in the Torah, particularly in Deuteronomy, where blessings and curses are outlined based on obedience or disobedience to God's law.<p><b>and served the Baals</b><br>The term "Baals" refers to the various local deities worshiped in Canaan, with Baal being a prominent god associated with fertility, storms, and agriculture. The Israelites' worship of Baal represents a direct violation of the first commandment, which prohibits the worship of other gods. This idolatry is not just a religious failure but also a cultural assimilation into the practices of the surrounding Canaanite peoples. The worship of Baal often included rituals that were abhorrent to the Israelites' covenant with God, such as child sacrifice and temple prostitution. This phrase highlights the spiritual adultery of the Israelites, as they turn away from their exclusive relationship with Yahweh. The struggle against Baal worship is a significant theme throughout the Old Testament, with prophets like Elijah and Hosea confronting this idolatry. The Israelites' repeated return to Baal worship underscores the tension between faithfulness to God and the temptation of surrounding pagan practices.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were delivered from Egypt and brought into the Promised Land.

The problem was not limited to a fringe group but represented a widespread heart-shift away from covenant faithfulness (<a href="/judges/2-10.htm">Judges 2:10</a>; <a href="/psalms/78-56.htm">Psalm 78:56-58</a>).<p>&#8226; &#8220;Did evil&#8221; is God&#8217;s own verdict, not merely human opinion. Earlier, Moses had warned, &#8220;You shall not do as we are doing here today, everyone doing whatever is right in his own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/deuteronomy/12-8.htm">Deuteronomy 12:8</a>). By <a href="/bsb/judges/2.htm">Judges 2</a>, that warning has been ignored.<p>&#8226; The wording echoes a pattern that recurs throughout the book (<a href="/judges/3-7.htm">Judges 3:7, 12</a>; 4:1; 6:1), signaling a cycle: sin &#8658; oppression &#8658; crying out &#8658; deliverance &#8658; relapse. Each time the cycle restarts, the evil grows, underscoring the seriousness of straying from God&#8217;s commands.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>in the sight of the LORD</b><p>&#8226; Sin is measured by what God sees, not by cultural norms. &#8220;The eyes of the LORD are in every place&#8221; (<a href="/proverbs/15-3.htm">Proverbs 15:3</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s perspective is personal; He is not a distant observer. Acts of disobedience affront His holiness (<a href="/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Because the evil was &#8220;in the sight of the LORD,&#8221; discipline followed. The next verse explains that He &#8220;delivered them into the hands of raiders&#8221; (<a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>), just as He had promised in <a href="/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14-17</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and served the Baals</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Served&#8221; means more than casual participation; it implies devoted allegiance&#8212;time, offerings, rituals&#8212;redirected from the LORD to idols (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Baal (&#8220;lord, master&#8221;) was a title for local Canaanite fertility deities. Each region had its own Baal, hence the plural form. By embracing them, Israel adopted the moral practices tied to Baal worship&#8212;sexual immorality, child sacrifice (<a href="/2_kings/17-16.htm">2 Kings 17:16-17</a>).<p>&#8226; This was a direct violation of earlier vows: &#8220;The LORD our God we will serve&#8221; (<a href="/joshua/24-24.htm">Joshua 24:24</a>). Turning to Baal signaled covenant treachery and spiritual adultery (<a href="/jeremiah/2-11.htm">Jeremiah 2:11-13</a>).<p>&#8226; The same wording returns later: &#8220;The Israelites again did evil&#8230;and served the Baals and the Ashtoreths&#8221; (<a href="/judges/10-6.htm">Judges 10:6</a>), showing that idolatry, once tolerated, quickly becomes entrenched.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11</a> records a nationwide collapse of loyalty: Israel committed overt sin that God clearly saw and judged, shifting their worship from the living LORD to lifeless Baals.
