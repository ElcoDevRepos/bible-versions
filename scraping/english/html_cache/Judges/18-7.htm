Laish, later known as Dan, was located in the northern part of Israel. This journey reflects the Danites' struggle to find a permanent inheritance, as their original allotment was insufficient (<a href="/joshua/19-40.htm">Joshua 19:40-48</a>). The movement towards Laish signifies a pivotal moment in the tribe's history.<p><b>where they saw that the people were living securely</b><br>The inhabitants of Laish lived in a state of peace and security, indicating a lack of military preparedness. This security is reminiscent of the peace described in the Garden of Eden before the fall (<a href="/genesis/2-15.htm">Genesis 2:15</a>). The peaceful state of Laish contrasts with the often turbulent existence of the Israelites, who frequently faced threats from surrounding nations.<p><b>like the Sidonians</b><br>The Sidonians were known for their maritime trade and wealth, living in the coastal city of Sidon. The comparison suggests that the people of Laish shared similar cultural and economic characteristics, possibly engaging in trade and enjoying prosperity. This connection highlights the influence of Canaanite culture in the region.<p><b>quiet and unsuspecting</b><br>The phrase suggests a lack of vigilance or awareness of potential threats, making Laish vulnerable to attack. This mirrors the spiritual complacency warned against in the New Testament, where believers are urged to be watchful (<a href="/1_peter/5-8.htm">1 Peter 5:8</a>). The unsuspecting nature of Laish's inhabitants foreshadows their impending downfall.<p><b>There was nothing lacking in the land</b><br>The abundance in Laish indicates a fertile and prosperous region, echoing the description of the Promised Land as "flowing with milk and honey" (<a href="/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>). This abundance made Laish an attractive target for the Danites, who were seeking a more fruitful inheritance.<p><b>and no oppressive ruler</b><br>The absence of an oppressive ruler suggests a form of self-governance or a lack of external control, which was unusual in a time when city-states were often dominated by powerful kings. This autonomy is reminiscent of the period of the Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><b>And they were far away from the Sidonians</b><br>The geographical distance from Sidon implies isolation, reducing the likelihood of immediate assistance in times of conflict. This isolation made Laish an easy target for conquest. The distance also signifies a separation from the influence of Sidonian culture and politics.<p><b>and had no alliance with anyone</b><br>The lack of alliances left Laish vulnerable, as they had no external support to call upon in times of need. This absence of alliances contrasts with the numerous covenants and alliances seen throughout the Bible, such as those between Israel and other nations (e.g., <a href="/1_kings/5.htm">1 Kings 5:1-12</a>). The vulnerability of Laish serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of community and support.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/f/five_men.htm">Five Men</a></b><br>These are the scouts sent by the tribe of Dan to explore the land for potential settlement.

Laish (also called Leshem, <a href="/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a>) lay far to the north, fertile and remote&#8212;an attractive &#8220;fresh start&#8221; for a tribe tired of struggling in the lowland.<p>&#8226; Much like the twelve spies in <a href="/bsb/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>, these men weigh the land&#8217;s possibilities; but unlike Joshua and Caleb, their report will feed self-interest rather than obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>where they saw that the people were living securely</b><p>&#8226;

Isolation often breeds overconfidence; <a href="/proverbs/18-1.htm">Proverbs 18:1</a> warns that those who &#8220;isolate themselves&#8221; break out against sound wisdom.<p>&#8226; For Dan, distance equaled low risk&#8212;again appealing to convenience over covenant obedience.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and had no alliance with anyone</b><p>&#8226; No treaties, defensive pacts, or regional partners (contrast with Abram&#8217;s alliance in <a href="/genesis/14-13.htm">Genesis 14:13</a>).<p>&#8226; In the ancient Near East a city without allies was exposed; similarly, believers isolated from the body are spiritually exposed (<a href="/hebrews/10-24.htm">Hebrews 10:24-25</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse paints a complete picture of a people rich in goods yet poor in defenses&#8212;ripe, in human terms, for the taking.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a> sketches Laish as prosperous, peaceful, complacent, and utterly unprepared for attack. For the Danite scouts, every detail confirms that this remote city will be an easy target compared with the God-assigned territory they have failed to secure. The verse therefore exposes both the vulnerability of worldly self-reliance and the tragic tendency of God&#8217;s people to choose the path of least resistance over faithful obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(7) <span class= "bld">Laish.</span>--It is called <span class= "ital">Leshem </span>in <a href="/joshua/19-47.htm" title="And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelled therein, and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.">Joshua 19:47</a>, and is now called <span class= "ital">Tel el-Kadi, </span>"the mound of <span class= "ital">the judge," </span>possibly (though not probably) with some reference to the name of Dan (<a href="/genesis/49-16.htm" title="Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.">Genesis 49:16</a>). It is four miles from Paneas and Caesarea Philippi, and was the northernmost city of Palestine (<a href="/judges/20-1.htm" title="Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the land of Gilead, to the LORD in Mizpeh.">Judges 20:1</a>). As such, its name recurs in <a href="/isaiah/10-30.htm" title="Lift up your voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard to Laish, O poor Anathoth.">Isaiah 10:30</a>, if our version is there correct. It is sometimes called <span class= "ital">el-Leddan, </span>because it is at the source of the Leddan, the chief stream of the Jordan. The position of the town, on a round hill girt with trees, is very striking, and fully bears out the description of this chapter (Robinson, <span class= "ital">Bible Res. </span>3:392). The <span class= "ital">name "</span>Dan" in <a href="/genesis/14-14.htm" title="And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them to Dan.">Genesis 14:14</a> may have been altered from Laish at a later date (Ewald, <span class= "ital">Gesch. </span>1:73).<p><span class= "bld">After the manner of the Zidonians</span>--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> <span class= "ital">in luxurious commercial ease. </span>There can be little doubt that they were a colony from Zidon. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To Laish</span>. Called in <a href="/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a> <span class="accented">Leshem</span>, which is perhaps a corruption caused by the statement that they called it after the name (<span class="accented">Ke-shem</span>) of Dan, or it may be only another form. The name is strangely corrupted in the Septuagint of ver. 29 of this chapter into <span class="accented">Oulamais</span>, and in <a href="/joshua/19-47.htm">Joshua 19:47</a> into <span class="accented">Lesem-dan.</span> St. Jerome, misled by the Septuagint, has <span class="accented">Lesem Dan.</span> Laish was situated four Roman miles from Bahias, on the road to. Tyre, on one of the sources of the Jordan. Robinson identifies it unhesitatingly with <span class="accented">Tell-el-Kady</span>, "the mount of the judge" (where <span class="accented">Kady</span> has the same meaning as <span class="accented">Dan</span>), close to the great fountain, "one of the largest fountains in the world," called <span class="accented">el-Leddan</span>, which is the source of the lesser Jordan (Josephus), and which may very possibly be the ultimate form of ed-Dan, corrupted into Eddan, el-Eddan, Led-dan, el-Leddan, by successive incorporations of the article <span class="accented">el</span> into the word itself, of which there are other examples. The remainder of this verse is exceedingly obscure; a probable translation is as follows: "And they saw the people that was in the midst of it dwelling in security after the manner of the Zidonians, '<span class="accented">quiet and secure</span>, <span class="accented">and none doing any injury to any one in the land</span>, <span class="accented">possessing wealth</span>;' and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no business with any man." The words in italics are probably a poetical quotation, descriptive of the people of Laish, which would account for the peculiar diction and the grammatical changes; for whereas the word <span class="accented">dwelling</span> is in the feminine gender, agreeing with <span class="accented">people</span>, the words <span class="accented">quiet</span> and <span class="accented">secure</span> and <span class="accented">possessing</span> are in the masculine, which can be readily accounted for if they are a quotation. This would also account for the tautology, "dwelling in security," "quiet and secure," and for the poetical character of the phrase "<span class="accented">possessing wealth</span>," and for the unusual form of the word here rendered <span class="accented">wealth</span> (<span class="accented">etzer</span> with an ain, instead of the usual <span class="accented">otzar</span> with an aleph), in accordance with the Septuagint and Vulgate and Gesenius, who derive the meaning of <span class="accented">wealth</span> from <span class="accented">collecting</span>, from which the common word <span class="accented">atzereth</span> derives its meaning of a <span class="accented">collection</span> or <span class="accented">congregation</span> of people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/18-7.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">So the five</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1495;&#1458;&#1502;&#1461;&#1443;&#1513;&#1473;&#1462;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(&#7717;a&#774;&#183;m&#234;&#183;&#353;e&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Number - masculine singular construct<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2568.htm">Strong's 2568: </a> </span><span class="str2">Five</span><br /><br /><span class="word">men</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1464;&#1488;&#1458;&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;&#1460;&#1428;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(h&#257;&#183;&#8217;a&#774;&#183;n&#257;&#183;&#353;&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Article &#124;
