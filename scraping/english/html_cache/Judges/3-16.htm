The double-edged sword symbolizes the Word of God, which is described as sharper than any two-edged sword in <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>. This weapon was designed for effectiveness in close combat, reflecting the need for precision and decisiveness in spiritual battles. The act of making the sword himself indicates personal preparation and commitment to God's calling.<p><b>a cubit long</b><br>A cubit is an ancient measurement roughly equivalent to 18 inches or 45 centimeters. This length suggests a weapon that is easily concealable yet effective for its intended purpose. The specific measurement indicates careful planning and forethought, as Ehud needed a weapon that could be hidden yet still lethal. The size also implies a personal and direct approach to confronting evil, as opposed to relying on larger, more impersonal weapons.<p><b>He strapped it to his right thigh</b><br>Strapping the sword to his right thigh was strategic, as Ehud was left-handed (<a href="/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a>). This unusual placement would have been unexpected, allowing him to bypass security checks that would typically focus on the left side, where a right-handed person would draw a weapon. This detail highlights the importance of using one's unique abilities and perspectives in service to God. It also underscores the theme of God using the unexpected and the weak to accomplish His purposes, as seen throughout Scripture.<p><b>under his cloak</b><br>Concealing the sword under his cloak allowed Ehud to approach King Eglon without arousing suspicion. This act of concealment can be seen as a metaphor for the hidden nature of God's plans, which are often not immediately apparent to human understanding. It also reflects the wisdom of being "wise as serpents and innocent as doves" (<a href="/matthew/10-16.htm">Matthew 10:16</a>) in carrying out God's work. The cloak serves as a reminder of the need for discretion and discernment in fulfilling divine missions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ehud.htm">Ehud</a></b><br>A left-handed man from the tribe of Benjamin, chosen by God to deliver Israel from Moabite oppression. His left-handedness is significant in the account, as it plays a crucial role in his ability to conceal the weapon and execute his plan.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A nation that oppressed Israel during this period. The Moabites were led by King Eglon, whom Ehud was sent to assassinate as part of God's deliverance plan for Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/d/double-edged_sword.htm">Double-edged sword</a></b><br>A weapon crafted by Ehud, specifically designed for his mission.

Although God raised him up as deliverer (<a href="/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a>), Ehud still exercised practical obedience by crafting the tool needed for the task.<p>&#8226; Scripture often pairs divine calling with human readiness (<a href="/nehemiah/4-17.htm">Nehemiah 4:17&#8211;18</a>; <a href="/james/2-17.htm">James 2:17</a>).<p>&#8226; Ehud&#8217;s action illustrates responsible preparation rather than presumption&#8212;he does not wait passively for a miracle but cooperates with God&#8217;s plan (<a href="/proverbs/16-3.htm">Proverbs 16:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>a double-edged sword a cubit long</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;a double-edged sword a cubit long&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; A cubit (about 18 inches/45 cm) makes the weapon small enough to conceal yet large enough to be lethal&#8212;suited perfectly for close-quarters work (<a href="/judges/3-21.htm">Judges 3:21&#8211;22</a>).<p>&#8226; The double edge allows effective thrust in either direction, reflecting completeness and decisiveness. God&#8217;s word is later pictured the same way&#8212;sharp on both sides, cutting cleanly (<a href="/psalms/149-6.htm">Psalm 149:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm">Hebrews 4:12</a>).<p>&#8226; The specific description shows the historical reliability of the account; real measurements ground the narrative in time and space (<a href="/1_samuel/17-4.htm">1 Samuel 17:4, 7</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>He strapped it to his right thigh</b><p>&#8220;He strapped it to his right thigh&#8230;&#8221;<p>&#8226; Most warriors carried weapons on the left for a right-handed draw. Ehud, identified earlier as left-handed (<a href="/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a>), reverses the norm.<p>&#8226; By fastening the sword on the right, he avoids suspicion at the security check before entering King Eglon&#8217;s presence&#8212;guards would be less likely to search there. God often uses what the world overlooks (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>).<p>&#8226; The detail reminds us that our unique traits, even weaknesses, can become strategic advantages in God&#8217;s deliverance plan (<a href="/exodus/4-10.htm">Exodus 4:10&#8211;12</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>under his cloak</b><p>&#8220;&#8230;under his cloak.&#8221;<p>&#8226; The cloak hides the sword, preserving the element of surprise (<a href="/1_kings/20-38.htm">1 Kings 20:38</a>).<p>&#8226; Concealment serves the larger purpose of liberating Israel from Moabite oppression (<a href="/judges/3-30.htm">Judges 3:30</a>). Like Gideon&#8217;s jars hiding torches (<a href="/judges/7-16.htm">Judges 7:16&#8211;20</a>), God sometimes works through hidden means until the decisive moment.<p>&#8226; This underscores Jesus&#8217; teaching that what is hidden will ultimately serve God&#8217;s kingdom purposes (<a href="/matthew/10-26.htm">Matthew 10:26</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/3-16.htm">Judges 3:16</a> depicts Ehud&#8217;s careful preparation for God-ordained deliverance.

Each detail showcases sovereign strategy married to human obedience, assuring us that God equips ordinary people with practical wisdom to accomplish extraordinary salvation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/3.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">Made him a dagger which had two edges.</span>--Probably, as in other servitudes, the children of Israel had been disarmed. The "two edges" (comp. <a href="/revelation/1-16.htm" title="And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shines in his strength.">Revelation 1:16</a>) show that it was not a mere knife (comp. <a href="/psalms/144-6.htm" title="Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out your arrows, and destroy them.">Psalm 144:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/4-12.htm" title="For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.">Hebrews 4:12</a>). Jerome, in the Vulgate, after rightly rendering the word <span class= "ital">ancipitem, </span>adds, "having a handle in the midst," which seems useless and meaningless, and has no equivalent in the Hebrew.<p><span class= "bld">A cubit length.</span>--The LXX. and Vulgate render it <span class= "ital">a span long </span>(<span class= "ital">spitham?s, palm?; </span>Luther, <span class= "ital">eine elle lang</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The Hebrew word is not <span class= "ital">amm?h, </span>the usual word for a cubit, but <span class= "ital">gomed. </span>A dagger of <span class= "ital">a span long </span>hardly, however, suits the following narrative, and perhaps <span class= "ital">gomed </span>is an archaic word for <span class= "ital">amm?h. </span>It meant originally "a staff."<p><span class= "bld">Under his raiment.</span>--The LXX. and Vulgate have "under his war-cloak" (LXX. <span class= "ital">manduan, </span>Vulg. <span class= "ital">sagum</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>The LXX., however, are only adopting a method very common with them--of choosing a Greek or, as in this case, a Persian (Hesych.) word which <span class= "ital">resembles </span>the Hebrew word (<span class= "ital">maddim</span>) in sound. The root of the Hebrew word shows that a long flowing robe (<span class= "ital">vestis talaris</span>) is intended. Dean Stanley suggests that he wore it as leader of the tribe. Prudentius describes Discord as "hiding a dagger under her robe."<p><span class= "bld">Upon his right thigh.</span>--This would avert all suspicion. Doubtless the war-cloak was flung in folds over the left shoulder, and Eglon, unaware that the bearer of the tribute was left-handed, would see that the side at which arms were usually worn was covered with a flowing robe, and would not suspect the dagger hidden at the <span class= "ital">right </span>side. Daggers were often, however, worn at the right side, when a sword was slung to the left. Amasa fell by a similar act of treachery. Joab, advancing to kiss him, clasped his beard with his <span class= "ital">right </span>hand, while with his unsuspected left he gave the deadly thrust (<a href="/context/2_samuel/20-9.htm" title="And Joab said to Amasa, Are you in health, my brother?
