In the Old Testament, God's presence is often associated with His guidance and protection, as seen with Moses (<a href="/exodus/3-12.htm">Exodus 3:12</a>) and Joshua (<a href="/joshua/1-5.htm">Joshua 1:5</a>). The assurance of divine presence is crucial for Gideon, who feels inadequate for the task ahead. This promise is a reminder of God's faithfulness and His ability to empower those He calls. It also foreshadows the New Testament promise of Jesus' presence with His followers (<a href="/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>).<p><b>the LORD replied,</b><br>The use of "the LORD" (Yahweh) signifies the covenantal name of God, highlighting His relationship with Israel. This personal interaction between God and Gideon underscores the direct communication God has with His chosen leaders. It reflects the theocratic nature of Israel during the time of the Judges, where God directly intervenes in the affairs of His people. This divine reply is a response to Gideon's doubts and fears, providing reassurance and authority.<p><b>and you will strike down all the Midianites as one man.</b><br>This phrase prophesies the complete victory over the Midianites, who were oppressing Israel. The Midianites, nomadic people from the Arabian Peninsula, had invaded Israel, leading to severe hardship (<a href="/judges/6.htm">Judges 6:1-6</a>). The expression "as one man" suggests unity and decisiveness in the victory, indicating that the defeat of the Midianites will be swift and comprehensive. This victory is not due to Gideon's strength but God's power working through him. It prefigures the ultimate victory over sin and evil through Jesus Christ, who, as one man, brings salvation to all (<a href="/romans/5-17.htm">Romans 5:17-19</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.
