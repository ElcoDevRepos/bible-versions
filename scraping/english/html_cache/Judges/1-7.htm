Bezek was a city in the territory of Judah. The mention of Adoni-bezek highlights the ongoing conflict between the Israelites and the Canaanite inhabitants of the land. This statement marks a moment of realization and confession from a pagan king, acknowledging the justice of God.<p><b>&#8220;Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off</b><br>The mutilation of the thumbs and big toes was a common practice in ancient warfare to incapacitate enemies, rendering them unable to wield weapons or run effectively. This act of humiliation and subjugation was a demonstration of power and control. The number seventy may symbolize completeness or totality, indicating the extent of Adoni-bezek's conquests and cruelty.<p><b>have gathered the scraps under my table.</b><br>This imagery of defeated kings scavenging for scraps under a table signifies utter humiliation and subservience. In ancient Near Eastern culture, eating under a table was a sign of disgrace. This phrase underscores the reversal of fortune that Adoni-bezek experiences, as he himself becomes subject to the same fate he imposed on others.<p><b>As I have done to them, so God has repaid me.&#8221;</b><br>Adoni-bezek acknowledges a divine retribution, recognizing that his own actions have brought about his downfall. This reflects the biblical principle of sowing and reaping, as seen in <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, where it states that a man reaps what he sows. It also echoes the concept of divine justice found throughout Scripture, where God repays individuals according to their deeds.<p><b>And they brought him to Jerusalem,</b><br>Jerusalem, at this time, was not yet the capital of Israel but was a significant city in the region. The Israelites' control over Jerusalem was not fully established until later under King David. Bringing Adoni-bezek to Jerusalem signifies the Israelites' growing influence and foreshadows the city's future importance in Israel's history.<p><b>where he died.</b><br>The death of Adoni-bezek in Jerusalem marks the end of his reign and serves as a testament to the fulfillment of divine justice. His demise in a city that would become central to God's plan for His people highlights the transition from Canaanite rule to Israelite dominance. This event prefigures the ultimate victory of God's kingdom over earthly powers, pointing to the future reign of Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adoni-bezek.htm">Adoni-bezek</a></b><br>A Canaanite king who was defeated by the tribes of Judah and Simeon.

The "seventy" kings may have been the rulers of the towns which Adoni-bezek had taken in extending the territory of Bezek. Josephus says seventy-two kings (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 2, ? 2), and this common variation is found in some MSS. of the LXX. The Persians treated their Greek captives in this way (Curtius, v. 5,6). Mutilation in the East was so common that it was hardly accounted cruel (Xen. <span class= "ital">Anab. i.</span> 9-13). Cutting off the hand or foot was the prescribed Mohammedan punishment for theft in British India (Mill, iii. 447), and many mutilated persons are still to be seen in Northern Scinde (see Grote's <span class= "ital">Greece, </span>xii. 235).<p><span class= "bld">Gathered their meat under my table.</span>--The words "their meat" are wanting in the original.

Posidonius says that the king of Parthia used to fling food to his courtiers, who seized it like dogs (Athen. 4:152).
