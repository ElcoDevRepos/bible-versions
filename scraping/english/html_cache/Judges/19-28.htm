The Levite's words are stark and lack compassion, highlighting the moral decay present in Israel during the time of the Judges. This period was marked by a cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance, as described throughout the Book of Judges. The Levite's command can be seen as indicative of the societal breakdown and the lack of respect for human dignity, especially towards women, which was prevalent in that era.<p><b>&#8220;Let us go.&#8221;</b><br>The Levite's insistence on leaving quickly suggests a desire to escape the scene of the crime and avoid further confrontation or shame. This reflects the broader theme in Judges of individuals acting in their own interest rather than seeking justice or righteousness. The phrase also underscores the transient and unstable nature of life during the time of the Judges, where there was no king in Israel, and everyone did what was right in their own eyes (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p><b>But there was no response.</b><br>This tragic statement indicates the concubine's death or near-death state, a result of the brutal events she endured. Her silence is a powerful testament to the consequences of unchecked sin and the failure of the community to protect the vulnerable. It also serves as a narrative device to highlight the Levite's callousness and the gravity of the situation, as he does not immediately recognize or respond to her condition.<p><b>So the man put her on his donkey</b><br>The act of placing her on the donkey signifies the Levite's practical response to the situation, yet it also underscores his detachment and lack of emotional engagement. In biblical times, a donkey was a common means of transport, symbolizing the burdens people carried. This image can be seen as a metaphor for the spiritual and moral burdens borne by Israel due to their disobedience and idolatry.<p><b>and set out for home.</b><br>The Levite's return home with his concubine's body marks the beginning of a series of events that lead to civil war within Israel (Judges 20). This journey back home is not just a physical return but also a narrative turning point that exposes the deep-seated issues within the nation. The Levite's actions, and the subsequent response of the tribes of Israel, illustrate the need for righteous leadership and foreshadow the eventual establishment of monarchy in Israel, which would bring a semblance of order and justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A man from the tribe of Levi, who is central to this account.

Like Peter shaking the sleeping disciples (<a href="/matthew/26-40.htm">Matthew 26:40-41</a>) or Deborah urging Barak to rise for battle (<a href="/judges/4-14.htm">Judges 4:14</a>), the call is direct and urgent.<p>&#8226; After the night&#8217;s horrific abuse (<a href="/judges/19-25.htm">Judges 19:25-27</a>), the command rings hollow; his tone reveals more concern for continuing the journey than for her condition.<p>&#8226; His expectation contrasts sharply with moments where God truly revives life&#8212;Elijah and the widow&#8217;s son (<a href="/1_kings/17-21.htm">1 Kings 17:21-22</a>) or Jesus calling, &#8220;Talitha koum!&#8221; (<a href="/mark/5-41.htm">Mark 5:41</a>). Here no divine power is sought; the Levite relies on human habit.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;Let us go.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; He speaks as though normal travel can resume, echoing Lot urging his family to flee Sodom at dawn (<a href="/genesis/19-15.htm">Genesis 19:15-17</a>).<p>&#8226; The words expose Israel&#8217;s spiritual numbness; instead of pausing to seek the LORD&#8217;s help (<a href="/psalms/34-17.htm">Psalm 34:17-18</a>), he focuses on moving on.<p>&#8226; The phrase also underlines the Levite&#8217;s role as leader of his household (<a href="/ephesians/5-23.htm">Ephesians 5:23</a>), yet his leadership is self-serving, not sacrificial.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>But there was no response.</b><p>&#8226; Silence confirms death or at least fatal trauma, recalling Nabal&#8217;s heart turning to stone after his drunken feast (<a href="/1_samuel/25-37.htm">1 Samuel 25:37</a>) or the lifeless idol mocked by Elijah: &#8220;there was no voice, no answer&#8221; (<a href="/1_kings/18-26.htm">1 Kings 18:26</a>).<p>&#8226; Israel itself is portrayed as unresponsive to God (<a href="/isaiah/65-12.htm">Isaiah 65:12</a>); the concubine&#8217;s silence mirrors the nation&#8217;s moral collapse described in the refrain, &#8220;In those days there was no king in Israel&#8221; (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<p>&#8226; Her lack of reply confronts the Levite&#8212;and every reader&#8212;with the cost of unchecked sin (<a href="/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>So the man put her on his donkey</b><p>&#8226; The donkey, a humble beast of burden (<a href="/numbers/22-21.htm">Numbers 22:21</a>), now carries a lifeless burden. It evokes the Good Samaritan lifting the wounded man onto his animal for care (<a href="/luke/10-34.htm">Luke 10:34</a>). Yet the Levite&#8217;s action lacks compassion; there is no bandaging or oil, only transport.<p>&#8226; Ownership language (&#8220;his donkey&#8221;) subtly treats the woman as another possession&#8212;contrasting God&#8217;s intent that husbands cherish their wives as their own bodies (<a href="/ephesians/5-28.htm">Ephesians 5:28-29</a>).<p>&#8226; The scene also foreshadows Saul cutting up oxen to rally Israel (<a href="/1_samuel/11-7.htm">1 Samuel 11:7</a>); the Levite will later cut up her body to shock the tribes (<a href="/judges/19-29.htm">Judges 19:29-30</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and set out for home.</b><p>&#8226; Returning home without seeking justice in Gibeah underscores the disorder of the period; civic leaders should hear cases at the city gate (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">Deuteronomy 21:19</a>), yet he departs in isolation.<p>&#8226; His journey anticipates confrontation: the tribes will assemble at Mizpah and wage civil war (<a href="/judges/20-1.htm">Judges 20:1-11</a>).<p>&#8226; Spiritually, &#8220;home&#8221; is hollow when God&#8217;s standards are ignored (<a href="/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21-24</a>); the Levite&#8217;s domestic security is an illusion built on tragedy.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/19-28.htm">Judges 19:28</a> captures the chilling aftermath of sin&#8217;s brutality. The Levite&#8217;s commands, the woman&#8217;s silence, and the hurried departure paint a society numbed to wickedness. The verse exposes self-protective leadership, disordered gender roles, and a community estranged from God&#8217;s life-giving power. In a few stark lines, Scripture shows that when people do what is right in their own eyes, the result is death, silence, and a journey home that can never truly bring peace until God&#8217;s righteousness is restored.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">But none answered.</span>--The sacred writer, in his horror, will not say that she was dead.<p><span class= "bld">Upon an ass.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">the ass, </span>which had borne her while she was living. The omission of every detail, the narration of the naked facts in the simplest words, without pausing to say so much as a single word respecting the Levite's or the old man's feelings, is a striking example of the difference of the historic method of ancient and modern times.<p><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/19-28.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Get up,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1511;&#1445;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1460;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(q&#363;&#183;m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Imperative - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6965.htm">Strong's 6965: </a> </span><span class="str2">To arise, stand up, stand</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he told her.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1447;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
