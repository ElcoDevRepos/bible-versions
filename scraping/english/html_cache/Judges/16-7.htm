This phrase highlights the beginning of his downfall due to his vulnerability and trust in Delilah, a Philistine woman. The context of Samson's life shows a pattern of personal weaknesses, particularly in relationships with women, which ultimately lead to his capture. This interaction is a reflection of the broader theme of Israel's struggle with idolatry and unfaithfulness to God.<p><b>If they tie me up with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried</b><br>The use of "seven" is significant in biblical numerology, often symbolizing completeness or perfection. The choice of "fresh bowstrings" suggests a material that is strong and flexible, yet not fully processed, indicating a deceptive strength. This reflects Samson's own deceptive strength, which is not rooted in physical bindings but in his Nazirite vow. The mention of bowstrings, typically made from animal tendons, also connects to the cultural practices of the time, where such materials were common in weaponry and tools.<p><b>I will become as weak as any other man</b><br>Samson's statement reveals his awareness of his unique strength, which sets him apart from other men. This strength is a divine gift, linked to his Nazirite vow, which includes abstaining from cutting his hair. The phrase foreshadows his eventual downfall when he reveals the true source of his strength to Delilah. It also serves as a reminder of the consequences of disobedience and the loss of divine favor, a recurring theme in the history of Israel. Samson's eventual weakness parallels the spiritual weakness that comes from turning away from God's commandments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God tied to his Nazirite vow.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/delilah.htm">Delilah</a></b><br>A woman from the Valley of Sorek whom Samson loved.

Samson habitually yields sacred secrets to persistent women.<p>&#8226; Scripture warns that repeated compromise erodes resolve: &#8220;Each one is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire&#8221; (<a href="/james/1-14.htm">James 1:14</a>).<p>&#8226; The Philistine leaders have promised Delilah &#8220;eleven hundred shekels of silver&#8221; (<a href="/judges/16-5.htm">Judges 16:5</a>), echoing the betrayal price that later appears in <a href="/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>.

Fresh strands, however, were pliable. Samson flips logic by claiming they will drain his power.<p>&#8226; The enemy loves rituals and numbers, but power belongs to the LORD alone. Remember Naaman&#8217;s seven dips in the Jordan (<a href="/2_kings/5-14.htm">2 Kings 5:14</a>); obedience, not artifacts, determines the outcome.<p>&#8226; Samson is testing Delilah&#8217;s resolve while inching closer to the real secret.
