This act of running away is a common biblical motif where individuals flee from danger, as seen with David fleeing from Saul (<a href="/1_samuel/19-10.htm">1 Samuel 19:10</a>) and Moses fleeing from Pharaoh (<a href="/exodus/2-15.htm">Exodus 2:15</a>). It highlights the immediate danger and the need for self-preservation.<p><b>escaping to Beer</b><br>Beer is a location mentioned in the Old Testament, though its exact location is not definitively known today. It is thought to be a place of refuge, possibly in the territory of Judah or Benjamin. The name "Beer" means "well" in Hebrew, suggesting it was a place with a water source, which would be essential for survival. This move to Beer indicates Jotham's strategic choice to find a safe haven away from Abimelech's reach.<p><b>and he lived there</b><br>Jotham's decision to reside in Beer suggests a period of waiting and watching, possibly hoping for divine justice or a change in circumstances. This mirrors other biblical figures who lived in exile or in hiding, such as Elijah during the drought (<a href="/1_kings/17-3.htm">1 Kings 17:3-5</a>) and the Israelites in Babylonian captivity. It reflects a time of uncertainty and reliance on God's protection.<p><b>for fear of his brother Abimelech</b><br>The fear of Abimelech is well-founded, given Abimelech's ruthless ambition and willingness to kill his own family to gain power. This fear underscores the theme of familial betrayal and the destructive nature of unchecked ambition. It also serves as a reminder of the consequences of Gideon's legacy, as Abimelech is the son of Gideon, and his actions are a direct result of Gideon's failure to establish a godly legacy. This fear and resulting action by Jotham can be seen as a precursor to the eventual downfall of Abimelech, fulfilling the curse Jotham pronounced earlier in <a href="/judges/9-7.htm">Judges 9:7-20</a>.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jotham.htm">Jotham</a></b><br>The youngest son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal), who survived the massacre of his brothers by Abimelech.

After fulfilling that duty, retreating preserved his life so the prophecy could unfold.<p>&#8226; Scripture often commends strategic withdrawal: <a href="/1_samuel/19-10.htm">1 Samuel 19:10&#8211;12</a> (David), <a href="/matthew/10-23.htm">Matthew 10:23</a> (Jesus to the disciples), and <a href="/acts/9-25.htm">Acts 9:25</a> (Paul).

Moving away limited Abimelech&#8217;s reach.<p>&#8226; God repeatedly shelters His servants in out-of-the-way places&#8212;Elijah at Cherith (<a href="/1_kings/17-3.htm">1 Kings 17:3</a>) and Joseph with Mary in Egypt (<a href="/matthew/2-13.htm">Matthew 2:13</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse stresses that escape was successful; no pursuit or capture is recorded, underscoring God&#8217;s preserving hand (<a href="/psalms/121-7.htm">Psalm 121:7-8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And he lived there</b><p>&#8226; &#8220;Lived&#8221; points to an extended stay, not a brief hiding place.

Waiting seasons are part of God&#8217;s plan (<a href="/psalms/27-14.htm">Psalm 27:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Stability in Beer shows God provides not only escape but also ongoing daily needs (<a href="/philippians/4-19.htm">Philippians 4:19</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>For fear of his brother Abimelech</b><p>&#8226; The fear was well-founded; Abimelech had murdered 70 brothers (<a href="/judges/9-5.htm">Judges 9:5</a>). <a href="/proverbs/29-25.htm">Proverbs 29:25</a> warns, &#8220;The fear of man is a snare,&#8221; yet pairing fear with faith-filled action&#8212;flight and trust&#8212;keeps the believer safe.<p>&#8226; Family hostility is a recurring biblical theme: Jacob fled Esau (<a href="/genesis/27-41.htm">Genesis 27:41-43</a>), and Jesus&#8217; own brothers doubted Him (<a href="/john/7-5.htm">John 7:5</a>). Loyalty to God may require distance from blood relatives when they oppose His purposes.<p>&#8226; Jotham&#8217;s survival allowed God&#8217;s prophetic curse (<a href="/judges/9-7.htm">Judges 9:7-20</a>) to stand as a witness. In time, Abimelech&#8217;s violence turned back on him (<a href="/judges/9-53.htm">Judges 9:53-55</a>), fulfilling <a href="/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/9-21.htm">Judges 9:21</a> records prudent, God-directed self-preservation. Jotham, having boldly spoken truth, fled to an obscure place, found long-term refuge, and lived under God&#8217;s protection because Abimelech&#8217;s murderous ambition made staying impossible.
