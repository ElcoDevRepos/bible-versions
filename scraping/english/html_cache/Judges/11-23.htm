The use of "LORD" (YHWH) signifies the personal name of God, highlighting His sovereignty and faithfulness. The title "God of Israel" underscores His unique relationship with the nation, chosen to be His people (<a href="/exodus/6-7.htm">Exodus 6:7</a>). This sets the stage for understanding the divine authority behind Israel's actions.<p><b>has driven out the Amorites</b><br>The Amorites were a significant Canaanite group inhabiting the land before Israel's conquest. This phrase recalls God's promise to Abraham that his descendants would inherit the land (<a href="/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>). The driving out of the Amorites is a fulfillment of divine judgment against their iniquity and a demonstration of God's power and faithfulness to His promises.<p><b>from before His people Israel,</b><br>This indicates the direct intervention of God in history to benefit His chosen people. It reflects the broader narrative of the Exodus and conquest, where God acts on behalf of Israel to establish them in the Promised Land. This divine action is a recurring theme, showing God's commitment to His covenant and His role as a warrior for Israel (<a href="/exodus/14-14.htm">Exodus 14:14</a>).<p><b>should you now possess it?</b><br>This rhetorical question challenges the legitimacy of any claims to the land by others, specifically the Ammonites in this context. It implies that since God has given the land to Israel, any attempt to reclaim it is against divine will. This reflects the biblical principle that the land belongs to God, and He grants it according to His purposes (<a href="/leviticus/25-23.htm">Leviticus 25:23</a>). The question underscores the futility of opposing God's decrees and serves as a warning to those who would challenge His plans.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, known for his leadership and vow.
