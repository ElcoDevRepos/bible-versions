They were known for their fortified cities and military prowess. The term "Amorite" can sometimes refer broadly to the inhabitants of Canaan. In the context of Judges, the Amorites represent the persistent challenge and influence of pagan cultures on the Israelites, highlighting the incomplete conquest of the land.<p><b>extended from the Ascent of Akrabbim</b><br>The Ascent of Akrabbim, meaning "Scorpion Pass," is a geographical location marking the southern boundary of the Amorite territory. It is believed to be located near the southern part of the Dead Sea, possibly in the region of the Negev. This area was a strategic location, serving as a natural barrier and a point of control for trade routes. The mention of this boundary underscores the territorial limits and the challenges Israel faced in fully possessing the land.<p><b>to Sela</b><br>Sela, meaning "rock" in Hebrew, is often identified with the city of Petra in modern-day Jordan. It was a significant city known for its rock-cut architecture and strategic location. Sela's mention here indicates the extent of Amorite influence and control, reaching into areas that were difficult for the Israelites to conquer. This highlights the ongoing struggle between the Israelites and the native inhabitants of the land.<p><b>and beyond</b><br>The phrase "and beyond" suggests that the Amorite influence extended even further than the specific locations mentioned. This indicates the pervasive presence and power of the Amorites in the region, which posed a continual threat to the Israelites. The inability to fully drive out the Amorites and other Canaanite peoples is a recurring theme in Judges, symbolizing Israel's struggle with faithfulness and obedience to God's commands. This ongoing presence of the Amorites serves as a reminder of the spiritual and physical battles that the Israelites faced in maintaining their covenant relationship with God.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/amorites.htm">Amorites</a></b><br>A group of ancient people living in Canaan, often in conflict with the Israelites.

The verse under study marks how far the Amorites still control territory even after Israel&#8217;s entry.<p>- Their stubborn presence underscores Israel&#8217;s partial obedience. God had pledged, &#8220;I will drive them out little by little&#8221; (<a href="/exodus/23-30.htm">Exodus 23:30</a>), but Israel&#8217;s compromise leaves a foothold for future trouble (<a href="/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1&#8211;3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Extended from the Ascent of Akrabbim</b><p>- The places the Ascent of Akrabbim on the southern approach to the Judean wilderness: &#8220;It will go down across the Ascent of Akrabbim, continue to Zin, and end at Kadesh-barnea&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/34-4.htm">Numbers 34:4</a>; cf. <a href="/joshua/15-3.htm">Joshua 15:3</a>).<p>- Akrabbim (&#8220;Scorpions Pass&#8221;) was part of the border between Judah and Edom. That the Amorite line reaches this far south shows they occupy land Israel should have secured (<a href="/joshua/13-1.htm">Joshua 13:1</a>).<p>- Practically, this means travel routes and trade corridors remain under pagan control, limiting Israel&#8217;s economic and military freedom.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>To Sela</b><p>- Sela (&#8220;rock&#8221;) lies east of the Arabah, later known as Edom&#8217;s mountain fortress&#8212;Petra (<a href="/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>; <a href="/isaiah/16-1.htm">Isaiah 16:1</a>).<p>- The mention of Sela widens the picture: Amorite influence pushes not only south but also eastward across the Rift.<p>- This rock-hewn stronghold illustrates how the Amorites leveraged natural defenses. Israel&#8217;s reluctance to confront such fortifications foreshadows later struggles with similar hilltop enclaves (<a href="/1_samuel/13-6.htm">1 Samuel 13:6</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And beyond</b><p>- &#8220;And beyond&#8221; tells us the line is open-ended; Amorite strength spills past the named landmarks.<p>- Scripture often speaks this way to emphasize a situation bigger than the reader might expect (<a href="/deuteronomy/3-5.htm">Deuteronomy 3:5</a>; <a href="/joshua/11-4.htm">Joshua 11:4</a>).<p>- Spiritually, the phrase warns that any territory we leave unconquered&#8212;sins we tolerate&#8212;tends to spread. Judges will repeatedly show how compromise grows into oppression (<a href="/judges/3-12.htm">Judges 3:12&#8211;14</a>; 6:2).<p>- Yet even here God is faithful: He raises deliverers as Israel cries out (<a href="/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9</a>; 10:15&#8211;16), proving He keeps covenant even when His people falter.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/1-36.htm">Judges 1:36</a> records the literal boundary line still dominated by the Amorites: from the steep desert pass of Akrabbim down to the rocky fortress of Sela and onward. The verse highlights Israel&#8217;s incomplete conquest and the far-reaching grip of an enemy they failed to expel. It is a sober reminder that partial obedience leaves room for ongoing conflict, whereas full trust in God&#8217;s promises brings complete freedom and blessing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(36) <span class= "bld">The coast of the Amorites.</span>--This notice is added to account for the obstinate resistance of the Amorites, by showing the extent of their domain, which reached far to the south of Petra.
