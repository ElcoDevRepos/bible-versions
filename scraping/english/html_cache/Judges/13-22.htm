This belief is rooted in the understanding of God's holiness and the sinful nature of humanity. In <a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>, God tells Moses, "You cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live." This reflects the belief that seeing God in His full glory would be overwhelming and fatal to humans. Manoah's reaction is consistent with this cultural and theological perspective.<p><b>he said to his wife,</b><br>Manoah's communication with his wife highlights the patriarchal structure of ancient Israelite society, where the husband often took the lead in spiritual and family matters. However, it is notable that Manoah's wife is a central figure in the narrative, receiving the initial revelation from the angel of the Lord. This indicates her significant role in God's plan, similar to other biblical women like Sarah and Hannah, who were also pivotal in the birth of significant figures.<p><b>&#8220;for we have seen God!&#8221;</b><br>The phrase "we have seen God" refers to the appearance of the angel of the Lord, who is often understood as a theophany or a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ. In <a href="/judges/13.htm">Judges 13</a>, the angel of the Lord is identified with God Himself, as seen in verses 21-22, where Manoah and his wife realize the divine nature of their visitor. This encounter foreshadows the incarnation of Christ, where God would be seen in human form. The fear of death upon seeing God underscores the awe and reverence due to His holiness, a theme that runs throughout Scripture, emphasizing the need for a mediator between God and humanity, ultimately fulfilled in Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manoah.htm">Manoah</a></b><br>The father of Samson, Manoah is a Danite who, along with his wife, receives a divine message about the birth of their son, Samson, who is to be a Nazirite dedicated to God from the womb.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/manoah's_wife.htm">Manoah's Wife</a></b><br>Although her name is not mentioned, she plays a crucial role in the account.

Scripture consistently teaches that sinful human beings cannot survive an unmediated encounter with God&#8217;s holiness.<p>&#8226; <a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a> affirms, &#8220;You cannot see My face, for no one can see Me and live.&#8221;<p>&#8226; When Gideon realized he had spoken with the Angel of the LORD, he cried out much the same (<a href="/judges/6-22.htm">Judges 6:22&#8211;23</a>).<p>&#8226; Isaiah&#8217;s &#8220;Woe to me! I am ruined&#8221; in <a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a> echoes the same dread.<p>Manoah&#8217;s words show he takes God&#8217;s warning seriously and believes the covenant warnings are literally true.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he said to his wife</b><p>The conversation highlights their spiritual partnership.<p>&#8226; Both had heard the angelic message (<a href="/judges/13-2.htm">Judges 13:2&#8211;14</a>), yet Manoah verbalizes the fear while his wife will soon offer faith-filled reasoning (v. 23).<p>&#8226; <a href="/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> presents marriage as a union in which two become &#8220;one flesh&#8221;; here the couple faces divine revelation together, modeling mutual support.<p>&#8226; <a href="/1_peter/3-7.htm">1 Peter 3:7</a> urges husbands to dwell with their wives &#8220;in an understanding way,&#8221; and Manoah&#8217;s transparency&#8212;though fearful&#8212;keeps communication open.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for we have seen God!</b><p>Manoah equates seeing the Angel of the LORD with seeing God Himself, recognizing the Angel as a divine Person, not a mere messenger.<p>&#8226; Earlier in the chapter the Angel accepts worship and a burnt offering (<a href="/judges/13-15.htm">Judges 13:15&#8211;20</a>), acts inappropriate for a created being (compare <a href="/revelation/22-8.htm">Revelation 22:8&#8211;9</a>).<p>&#8226; Jacob similarly concluded, &#8220;I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been spared&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>).<p>&#8226; <a href="/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a> later clarifies that no one has seen the Father, but the Son makes Him known&#8212;pointing to this Angel as a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ.<p>Manoah&#8217;s statement is therefore doctrinally weighty: he literally encountered God&#8217;s presence, and his fear underscores humanity&#8217;s need for a mediator.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22</a> records Manoah&#8217;s reflexive terror after realizing he has encountered the living God in the Angel of the LORD. Convinced that sinners cannot survive such holiness, he shares his dread with his wife, displaying both covenant awareness and marital unity. The verse confirms that the Angel is truly divine and anticipates the greater mediation fulfilled in Christ, through whom believers may now behold God without fear.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(22) <span class= "bld">We shall surely die.</span>--See on <a href="/judges/6-22.htm" title="And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face.">Judges 6:22</a>.<p><span class= "bld">We have seen God.</span>--<span class= "ital">As seeing Him who is invisible; </span>by seeing a manifestation of Him in human form, "Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me and live" (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm" title="And he said, You can not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.">Exodus 33:20</a>).

And so Isaiah said, "Woe is me! for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts" (<a href="/isaiah/6-5.htm">Isaiah 6:5</a>). So again the Lord said to Moses, "There shall no man see me and live" (<a href="/exodus/33-20.htm">Exodus 33:20</a>). The name of the well, Beer-lahai-roi, is also thought to mean the well of him that is alive after seeing God (<a href="/genesis/16-14.htm">Genesis 16:14</a>). And Jacob called the name of the place where he wrestled with the angel Peniel, "for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved" (<a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>). See too <a href="/exodus/20-19.htm">Exodus 20:19</a>. The same belief also prevailed amongst the heathen, that seeing a god without his special permission was visited by death or some grave calamity, as Callimachus, quoted by Grotius, says- <p><span class="accented">"The laws of Saturn thus decree,<br />Who dares immortal gods to see<br />Shall suffer loss, whoe'er he be."</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/13-22.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;We are going to die,&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1443;&#1493;&#1465;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#333;&#183;w&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Infinitive absolute<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4191.htm">Strong's 4191: </a> </span><span class="str2">To die, to kill</span><br /><br /><span class="word">he</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1464;&#1504;&#1435;&#1493;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#257;&#183;n&#333;&#183;w&#183;a&#7717;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4495.htm">Strong's 4495: </a> </span><span class="str2">Manoah -- father of Samson</span><br /><br /><span class="word">said</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1447;&#1488;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;mer)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124; Verb - Qal - Consecutive imperfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_559.htm">Strong's 559: </a> </span><span class="str2">To utter, say</span><br /><br /><span class="word">to</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1462;&#1500;&#1470;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;el-)</span><br /><span class="parse">Preposition<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_413.htm">Strong's 413: </a> </span><span class="str2">Near, with, among, to</span><br /><br /><span class="word">his wife,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1430;&#1493;&#1465;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;i&#353;&#183;t&#333;w)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - feminine singular construct &#124; third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_802.htm">Strong's 802: </a> </span><span class="str2">Woman, wife, female</span><br /><br /><span class="word">&#8220;for</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1445;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">we have seen</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1512;&#1464;&#1488;&#1460;&#1469;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1475;</span> <span class="translit">(r&#257;&#183;&#8217;&#238;&#183;n&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - first person common plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_7200.htm">Strong's 7200: </a> </span><span class="str2">To see</span><br /><br /><span class="word">God!&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1488;&#1457;&#1500;&#1465;&#1492;&#1460;&#1430;&#1497;&#1501;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8217;&#277;&#183;l&#333;&#183;h&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_430.htm">Strong's 430: </a> </span><span class="str2">gods -- the supreme God, magistrates, a superlative</span><br /><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><div class="vheading">Links</div><a href="/niv/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22 NIV</a><br /><a href="/nlt/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22 NLT</a><br /><a href="/esv/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22 ESV</a><br /><a href="/nasb/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22 NASB</a><br /><a href="/kjv/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="//bibleapps.com/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22  BibleApps.com</a><br /><a href="//bibliaparalela.com/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="//holybible.com.cn/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="//saintebible.com/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22 French Bible</a><br /><a href="/catholic/judges/13-22.htm">Judges 13:22 Catholic Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="/judges/13-22.htm">OT History: Judges 13:22 Manoah said to his wife We shall (Jd Judg.
