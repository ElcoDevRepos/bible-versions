This reflects the period of the Judges, characterized by religious and moral chaos, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>). The shrine suggests a personal or family place of worship, which was contrary to the Mosaic Law that prescribed worship at a single, God-ordained location.<p><b>and he made an ephod</b><br>The ephod was a priestly garment, typically associated with the high priest, used in seeking divine guidance (<a href="/exodus/28-6.htm">Exodus 28:6-30</a>). Micah's creation of an ephod indicates an attempt to replicate legitimate priestly functions outside of the established Levitical system. This act reflects the syncretism and religious confusion of the time, as Micah sought to blend elements of true worship with idolatrous practices.<p><b>and some household idols</b><br>Household idols, or teraphim, were small figurines used in domestic worship and divination. Their presence in Micah's shrine highlights the infiltration of pagan practices into Israelite worship. This syncretism was explicitly forbidden in the Law (<a href="/exodus/20-3.htm">Exodus 20:3-4</a>), and it demonstrates the spiritual decline during the era of the Judges. The use of idols contrasts sharply with the commandment to worship Yahweh alone.<p><b>and ordained one of his sons as his priest</b><br>By appointing his son as a priest, Micah further violated the Mosaic Law, which designated the Levites as the only legitimate priestly tribe (<a href="/numbers/3-10.htm">Numbers 3:10</a>). This act underscores the lack of adherence to God's commandments and the absence of centralized religious authority during this period. It also foreshadows the later establishment of a false priesthood in the Northern Kingdom under Jeroboam (<a href="/1_kings/12-31.htm">1 Kings 12:31</a>), illustrating a recurring theme of unauthorized worship in Israel's history.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah.htm">Micah</a></b><br>A man from the hill country of Ephraim who created a private shrine and appointed his son as a priest, demonstrating a departure from the established worship practices of Israel.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah's_shrine.htm">Micah's Shrine</a></b><br>A private place of worship that Micah established in his home, which included an ephod and household gods, indicating syncretism and deviation from the worship of Yahweh alone.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/ephod.htm">Ephod</a></b><br>A priestly garment, often associated with seeking divine guidance, which Micah made for his shrine, suggesting an attempt to replicate legitimate religious practices in an illegitimate context.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/h/household_gods.htm">Household Gods (Teraphim)</a></b><br>Small idols used for worship, reflecting the influence of surrounding pagan practices and a breach of the first and second commandments.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/m/micah's_son.htm">Micah's Son</a></b><br>Appointed by Micah as a priest, despite not being from the Levitical priesthood, highlighting the disregard for God's established order for worship.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_danger_of_syncretism.htm">The Danger of Syncretism</a></b><br>Mixing true worship with pagan practices leads to spiritual confusion and disobedience.

It is quite clear that Micah did not abandon the worship of God under the names of Jehovah and Elohim, by which He was known to the Israelites. How he coordinated this worship with his grossly idolatrous symbols, or whom those symbols were intended to represent, it is impossible to say. The fact remains that in the Beth-Micah we find "a house of gods"--"whole chapel of idols"--consecrated to Jehovah as a pious act (<a href="/judges/17-2.htm" title="And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you, about which you cursed, and spoke of also in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.

If it was consequent upon his mother's vow, then we have in the opening verses of this chapter a history of the circumstances of the foundation of Micah's "house of God," which was to play an important part in the colony of Danites, whose proceedings arc related in the following chapter, and for the sake of which this domestic history of Micah is introduced. <span class="cmt_word">House of gods</span>.
