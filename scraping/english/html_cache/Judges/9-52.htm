His ambition led him to violent actions, including the massacre of his seventy brothers. The tower mentioned here is likely a fortified structure within the city of Thebez, where the remaining inhabitants sought refuge. Towers were common in ancient cities for defense purposes, often serving as the last line of protection during sieges. Abimelech's attack on the tower reflects his ruthless determination to eliminate any opposition to his rule.<p><b>he approached its entrance</b><br>The entrance of a tower would be a strategic point of vulnerability. In ancient warfare, attackers often focused on gates or entrances to breach defenses. Abimelech's approach to the entrance indicates his intent to directly confront and overcome the resistance. This action demonstrates his boldness and perhaps overconfidence, as he underestimated the potential defenses of the tower. The entrance also symbolizes a point of decision, where the fate of both the attacker and the defenders would be determined.<p><b>to set it on fire</b><br>Setting a tower on fire was a common military tactic to force defenders out or to destroy the structure. Fire was a powerful weapon in ancient warfare, capable of causing panic and chaos. Abimelech's decision to use fire shows his willingness to employ extreme measures to achieve his goals. This act of destruction can be seen as a reflection of his character, marked by violence and a lack of regard for human life. The use of fire also connects to other biblical narratives where fire is a tool of judgment or purification, such as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. In a broader theological context, fire often symbolizes divine judgment, which foreshadows Abimelech's own downfall as a consequence of his actions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/abimelech.htm">Abimelech</a></b><br>The son of Gideon (also known as Jerubbaal) and a concubine from Shechem.

The residents of Thebez ran inside, trusting stone walls and elevation to save them.<p>&#8226; Abimelech had just burned the tower of Shechem (<a href="/judges/9-49.htm">Judges 9:49</a>), so this attack repeats a brutal tactic. The repetition underlines a deliberate, calculated cruelty, not a momentary lapse.<p>&#8226; By targeting a stronghold, Abimelech sets himself against the very symbol of safety, contrasting with the Lord who is repeatedly called &#8220;my fortress&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>he approached its entrance</b><p>&#8226; The verse zooms in from the army to the man: Abimelech himself steps forward.

Now, however, that same fire turns against its wielder, a vivid reminder of <a href="/psalms/7-15.htm">Psalm 7:15-16</a> where the wicked fall into their own pits.<p>&#8226; The act escalates violence from conventional siege to total annihilation&#8212;men, women, and children inside (<a href="/judges/9-49.htm">Judges 9:49</a>). Such severity brings to light God&#8217;s justice seen later when Babylon&#8217;s cruelty rebounds on itself (<a href="/jeremiah/51-24.htm">Jeremiah 51:24-26</a>).<p>&#8226; In a broader biblical pattern, ungodly &#8220;fire&#8221; contrasts with God&#8217;s righteous fire that purifies (<a href="/malachi/3-2.htm">Malachi 3:2-3</a>) or empowers (<a href="/acts/2-3.htm">Acts 2:3</a>).

The verse shows:<p>&#8226; persistent sin unchecked leads to greater cruelty;<p>&#8226; pride blinds a man to obvious peril;<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s earlier warnings (through Jotham) prove reliable and literal;<p>&#8226; the same violence a sinner employs becomes the instrument of his downfall.<p>Taken literally and in context, the line is a turning point where Abimelech&#8217;s wrath reaches its peak, positioning him for the swift, poetic justice that follows in the very next verse.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/9.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(52) <span class= "bld">Went hard unto the door.</span>--Hard, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>close.
