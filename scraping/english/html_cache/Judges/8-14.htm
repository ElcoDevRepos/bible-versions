Succoth is a town east of the Jordan River, within the territory of Gad. The capture of a young man from Succoth highlights the tension between Gideon and the people of Succoth, who had earlier refused to assist him (<a href="/judges/8-5.htm">Judges 8:5-6</a>). This act of interrogation reflects the urgency and determination of Gideon to secure victory over the Midianites. The cultural context of the time allowed for such interrogation, especially in wartime, to gather intelligence. The young man's capture and subsequent interrogation underscore the theme of divine justice and retribution, as Gideon seeks to hold the leaders of Succoth accountable for their lack of support.<p><b>The young man wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven leaders and elders of Succoth.</b><br>The act of writing down names indicates a level of literacy and record-keeping in ancient Israel, which was not universally common. The number seventy-seven is significant, often symbolizing completeness or divine order in biblical numerology. The leaders and elders of Succoth represent the town's authority and decision-makers, who had previously denied aid to Gideon. This list serves as evidence for Gideon to confront the leaders, fulfilling the principle of accountability. The mention of seventy-seven leaders may also reflect the structured governance within the tribal system of Israel. This event foreshadows the judgment Gideon will bring upon Succoth, aligning with the biblical theme of God using human agents to execute His justice.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>The judge of Israel who led the Israelites to victory over the Midianites.
