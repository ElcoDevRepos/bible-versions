This setting highlights the Philistine's religious practices and their reliance on their deities for victory and protection. The gathering of men and women in the temple signifies a significant event, likely a festival or celebration, which was common in ancient Near Eastern cultures. This context sets the stage for a dramatic confrontation between the God of Israel and the gods of the Philistines.<p><b>all the lords of the Philistines were there,</b><br>The presence of all the Philistine lords indicates a major assembly, possibly a national celebration or a strategic meeting. The Philistine lords were the rulers of the five major cities: Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. Their gathering underscores the importance of the event and the perceived triumph over Samson, who had been a significant threat to their dominance.<p><b>and about three thousand men and women were on the roof</b><br>The mention of three thousand people on the roof suggests the temple's large size and the architectural style of the time, which often included flat roofs used for gatherings. This number emphasizes the scale of the event and the multitude of witnesses to the impending act of divine judgment. The crowd's presence on the roof also indicates their eagerness to witness the spectacle involving Samson, whom they had captured.<p><b>watching Samson entertain them.</b><br>Samson, once a mighty judge of Israel, is now reduced to a source of entertainment for his enemies. This reflects the Philistines' mockery and scorn towards him and, by extension, towards the God of Israel. Samson's role as an entertainer is a stark contrast to his previous position as a deliverer of Israel, highlighting his fall due to personal failings. This situation foreshadows his final act of strength, which will serve as a type of Christ's sacrificial victory over sin and death, as Samson's death ultimately leads to the defeat of the Philistines gathered there.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God tied to his Nazirite vow.

Second, God is positioning events so that when Samson calls on Him, the collapse of the temple will strike the heart of Philistine power, vindicate the Lord&#8217;s name, and begin Israel&#8217;s deliverance&#8212;exactly as promised from Samson&#8217;s birth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(27) <span class= "bld">The house was full of men and women . . . upon the roof about three thousand men and women.</span>--The words for "men and women" in the first clause are <span class= "ital">anashim </span>and <span class= "ital">nashim, </span>and in the second <span class= "ital">eesh </span>and <span class= "ital">eeshsha. </span>The more distinguished people were with the lords in the house itself; the common people were on the flat roof.<p><span class= "bld">There were upon the roof.</span>--The temple may have been like a Turkish kiosk, "a spacious hall, of which the roof rested in front upon four columns, two of them standing at the ends, and two close together in the centre.

The roof itself was fiat, and had the weight of 3000 people upon it, throwing a great strain upon the beams which rested upon the pillars. The sudden removal of the pillars would bring the roof down at that end, crowded as it was with the people, and would inevitably drag the whole mass in the same direction one over another, while the swaying of the people would bring the whole roof down upon the heads of those beneath, who would be crushed by the heavy timbers and stones and bodies of men falling upon them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/16-27.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Now the temple</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1456;&#1492;&#1463;&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1431;&#1497;&#1460;&#1514;</span> <span class="translit">(w&#601;&#183;hab&#183;ba&#183;yi&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw, Article &#124;
