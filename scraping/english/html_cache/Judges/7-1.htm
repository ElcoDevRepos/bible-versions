Early morning is often a time of new beginnings and divine encounters in Scripture, as seen in <a href="/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a> when Abraham rises early to obey God's command. It suggests a fresh start and a readiness to follow God's leading.<p><b>Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon)</b><br>Jerubbaal means "Let Baal contend against him," a name given to Gideon after he destroyed the altar of Baal (<a href="/judges/6-32.htm">Judges 6:32</a>). This highlights Gideon's role as a reformer and a man of faith who stood against idolatry. His dual name reflects his identity as both a warrior for God and a challenger of false gods.<p><b>and all the men with him</b><br>Gideon's men were initially 32,000 strong, but God would later reduce this number to 300 to demonstrate His power (<a href="/judges/7-2.htm">Judges 7:2-7</a>). This group represents those chosen by God to fulfill His purposes, emphasizing reliance on divine strength rather than human numbers.<p><b>camped beside the spring of Harod</b><br>The spring of Harod is located in the Jezreel Valley, a strategic location for military campaigns. The name "Harod" means "trembling," possibly foreshadowing the fear that would later grip the Midianites. This setting underscores the theme of God's provision and preparation for battle.<p><b>And the camp of Midian was north of them</b><br>The Midianites were descendants of Abraham through Keturah (<a href="/genesis/25.htm">Genesis 25:1-2</a>) and were often adversaries of Israel. Their camp's location to the north signifies a looming threat, setting the stage for God's deliverance through Gideon. This geographical detail highlights the imminent confrontation.<p><b>in the valley near the hill of Moreh</b><br>The valley near the hill of Moreh is part of the Jezreel Valley, a fertile and significant battleground in biblical history. The hill of Moreh is associated with divine revelation, as seen in <a href="/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6-7</a> when God appeared to Abram. This location suggests a place where God would reveal His power and fulfill His promises through Gideon's victory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jerubbaal.htm">Jerubbaal (Gideon)</a></b><br>Gideon, also known as Jerubbaal, is the central figure in this passage. He is a judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites. His name, Jerubbaal, means "Let Baal contend," reflecting his role in tearing down the altar of Baal.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_men_with_gideon.htm">The Men with Gideon</a></b><br>These are the Israelite warriors who have gathered under Gideon's leadership to fight against the Midianites. Initially, there are 32,000 men, but God will later reduce their number to demonstrate His power.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_spring_of_harod.htm">The Spring of Harod</a></b><br>This is the location where Gideon and his men camp. The name "Harod" means "trembling" or "fear," which may symbolize the fear and anxiety present among the troops.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_camp_of_midian.htm">The Camp of Midian</a></b><br>The Midianites are the oppressors of Israel at this time. Their camp is located north of Gideon's position, in the valley near the hill of Moreh.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_hill_of_moreh.htm">The Hill of Moreh</a></b><br>This geographical landmark is near the Midianite camp. It serves as a strategic point in the account, setting the stage for the upcoming battle.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_leadership.htm">God's Sovereignty in Leadership</a></b><br>God chooses and equips leaders according to His purposes, often selecting those who seem least likely by human standards. Gideon's account reminds us to trust in God's wisdom and timing.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faith_over_fear.htm">Faith Over Fear</a></b><br>The location at the spring of Harod symbolizes the fear that can grip us in times of trial. Like Gideon, we are called to move forward in faith, trusting in God's promises and presence.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/divine_strategy.htm">Divine Strategy</a></b><br>God's ways are not our ways. He often uses unconventional methods to achieve His purposes, as seen in the reduction of Gideon's army. We should remain open to God's leading, even when it defies human logic.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/p/preparation_for_battle.htm">Preparation for Battle</a></b><br>Spiritual battles require preparation and reliance on God. Gideon's positioning and obedience set the stage for victory.

The Spirit-empowered act of tearing down Baal&#8217;s altar publicly re-identified Gideon.<p>&#8226; Using both names reminds readers that the once-timid farmer (<a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11-15</a>) now carries a testimony of victory over idolatry, reinforcing that the upcoming battle is the Lord&#8217;s, not Baal&#8217;s (<a href="/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21-39</a>).<p>&#8226; It also clarifies leadership continuity&#8212;Gideon, already validated by signs (<a href="/judges/6-36.htm">Judges 6:36-40</a>), commands with God-given authority (<a href="/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32-34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And all the men with him camped beside the spring of Harod</b><p>&#8226; Location matters. &#8220;Harod&#8221; means &#8220;trembling,&#8221; hinting at the fear soon to be sifted out (<a href="/judges/7-3.htm">Judges 7:3</a>).<p>&#8226; Springs supply water and concealment; God will later test the troops&#8217; vigilance by how they drink here (<a href="/judges/7-4.htm">Judges 7:4-6</a>).<p>&#8226; Elijah gathered Israel near a spring for decisive confrontation (<a href="/1_kings/18-30.htm">1 Kings 18:30-40</a>); similarly, Gideon&#8217;s staging ground sets up a miraculous deliverance where no one can claim credit but God (<a href="/deuteronomy/20-1.htm">Deuteronomy 20:1</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And the camp of Midian was north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh</b><p>&#8226; The Midianites occupy fertile Jezreel Valley, north of Gideon.

God again turns this region into a classroom of covenant faithfulness.<p>&#8226; From Gideon&#8217;s vantage point he sees both adversary and promise: God&#8217;s past faithfulness at Moreh and the present threat waiting for judgment (<a href="/isaiah/31-8.htm">Isaiah 31:8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/7-1.htm">Judges 7:1</a> sets the stage for God&#8217;s astounding victory.

Facing a vast Midianite force camped below Moreh, Gideon stands where patriarchs worshiped and prophets contended.

There is another reading, "Endor" (comp. Ps. 82:10).<p><span class= "bld">By the hill of Moreh.</span>--Bertheau renders it, "stretching from the hill of Moreh into the valley." The only hill of this name which we know from other sources is that at Shechem (<a href="/genesis/12-6.htm" title="And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.">Genesis 12:6</a>; <a href="/deuteronomy/11-30.htm" title="Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the sun goes down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the desert over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?">Deuteronomy 11:30</a>), but that is twenty-five miles south of Mount Gilboa. There can be no doubt that Moreh is here used for Little Hermon, now Jebel ed-Duhy. The Vulgate renders it "of a lofty hill," perhaps to avoid a supposed difficulty. The word Moreh means "archer," and Little Hermon may have been called "the Archer's Hill," from the bowmen of the Amalekites. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jerubbaal</span>.
