In ancient Near Eastern culture, children and livestock were considered vital for the continuation of family lineage and economic stability. By placing them at the front, the Danites ensured their safety from potential attacks from behind, demonstrating a tactical retreat. This action reflects the importance of family and property in Israelite society, as seen in other biblical narratives where protection of family and assets is prioritized (e.g., <a href="/genesis/33.htm">Genesis 33:1-3</a>, where Jacob arranges his family to meet Esau).<p><b>they turned and departed</b><br>The departure signifies the Danites' final decision to leave their previous territory and move towards Laish, which they later rename Dan. This movement is part of the larger narrative of the tribe of Dan seeking a permanent inheritance, as their allotted territory was insufficient or difficult to secure (<a href="/judges/1-34.htm">Judges 1:34</a>). Historically, this reflects the period of the Judges, characterized by tribal movements and conflicts over land. Theologically, it underscores the theme of seeking God's promise and the challenges of faithfulness to God's covenant, as the Danites' actions are later criticized for idolatry (<a href="/judges/18-30.htm">Judges 18:30-31</a>). This departure can also be seen as a metaphor for spiritual journeys, where believers must sometimes leave behind familiar but unfaithful practices to pursue God's promises.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_danites.htm">The Danites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel seeking a new territory to inhabit.

By placing the most vulnerable and the most valuable out front, they created a living shield that forced any pursuers to think twice before attacking from the rear (cf. <a href="/deuteronomy/25-18.htm">Deuteronomy 25:18</a>; <a href="/judges/18-24.htm">Judges 18:24&#8211;25</a>).<p>&#8211; Practical motives surface:<p>&#8226; Children first highlights the permanent nature of the migration, echoing Jacob arranging his family when approaching Esau (<a href="/genesis/33-1.htm">Genesis 33:1&#8211;3</a>).<p>&#8226; Livestock next signals their intent to settle new land, reminding us of Israel&#8217;s earlier journeys with &#8220;very large droves of livestock&#8221; (<a href="/numbers/32-1.htm">Numbers 32:1</a>).<p>&#8226; Possessions include the stolen images and ephod (<a href="/judges/18-17.htm">Judges 18:17&#8211;18</a>), revealing how deeply idolatry had already taken hold.<p>&#8211; Spiritually, the order exposes twisted priorities&#8212;protecting stolen idols as zealously as their own children. Compare Saul sparing the best spoil in <a href="/1_samuel/15-9.htm">1 Samuel 15:9</a>; in both cases obedience to God is sacrificed for personal gain.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>They turned and departed</b><p>&#8211; The verb pair shows a decisive break. Having secured people, animals, and goods, the Danites &#8220;turned&#8221; their backs on Micah and any rightful claims, then &#8220;departed&#8221; toward Laish (<a href="/judges/18-27.htm">Judges 18:27</a>).<p>&#8211; This mirrors the repeated refrain of the era: &#8220;In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes&#8221; (<a href="/judges/17-6.htm">Judges 17:6</a>). Their confidence rested not in the LORD&#8217;s presence but in numbers and stolen religious tokens (<a href="/psalms/20-7.htm">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p>&#8211; God permitted their getaway, yet later history shows that compromise never brings lasting peace (<a href="/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a>). What begins with idolatry and self-reliance ends in captivity.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/18-21.htm">Judges 18:21</a> paints a vivid, literal scene: the Danites organize their caravan so the weak and the loot lead the way, while warriors guard the rear. The formation reveals strategic caution, permanent relocation plans, and hearts already devoted to idols rather than to God. Their turning and departure underline the book&#8217;s theme of unrestrained autonomy&#8212;people moving confidently, yet far from the LORD&#8217;s will.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/18.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(21) <span class= "bld">The little ones and the cattle.</span>--It is only in this incidental way that the fact of this being a regular migration is brought out.
