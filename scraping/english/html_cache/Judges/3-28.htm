This phrase signifies leadership and the call to unity among the people of God. In the context of the Judges, leaders were often raised by God to deliver Israel from oppression. This call to follow is reminiscent of other biblical leaders like Moses and Joshua, who also led the people in times of need. It foreshadows the ultimate call to follow Christ, who invites His disciples to follow Him.<p><b>&#8220;for the LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.&#8221;</b><br>This statement reflects the belief in divine intervention and the fulfillment of God's promises to Israel. The Moabites, descendants of Lot, were often in conflict with Israel. The phrase underscores the recurring theme in Judges of God delivering His people despite their unfaithfulness. It also highlights the sovereignty of God in battles, as seen in other scriptures like <a href="/1_samuel/17-47.htm">1 Samuel 17:47</a>, where David acknowledges that the battle is the Lord's.<p><b>So they followed him down</b><br>The Israelites respond to Ehud's call, demonstrating trust in his leadership and faith in God's deliverance. This action signifies obedience and courage, essential qualities for God's people. The act of following a leader chosen by God is a recurring theme in the Bible, seen in the followers of Moses, Joshua, and ultimately Jesus Christ.<p><b>and seized the fords of the Jordan leading to Moab</b><br>The fords of the Jordan were strategic locations, as they were the crossing points of the river. Controlling these fords meant cutting off the Moabites' escape and reinforcements. This strategic move reflects the importance of geography in biblical narratives and the tactical wisdom given by God to His leaders. The Jordan River often symbolizes transitions and new beginnings, as seen in the Israelites' crossing into the Promised Land under Joshua.<p><b>and they did not allow anyone to cross over.</b><br>This decisive action ensured the complete victory over the Moabites. It demonstrates the thoroughness of God's deliverance and the importance of obedience to His commands. The phrase also highlights the finality of God's judgment against His enemies, a theme that resonates throughout scripture, pointing to the ultimate victory over sin and death through Jesus Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ehud.htm">Ehud</a></b><br>A left-handed judge of Israel who delivered the Israelites from Moabite oppression.
