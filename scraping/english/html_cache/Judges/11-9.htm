His question reflects a cautious approach, likely due to his past experiences of rejection. This moment highlights the theme of God using unlikely individuals for His purposes, similar to how David was chosen despite being the youngest and least likely (<a href="/1_samuel/16-11.htm">1 Samuel 16:11-13</a>).<p><b>&#8220;If you take me back to fight the Ammonites</b><br>The Ammonites were descendants of Lot (<a href="/genesis/19-38.htm">Genesis 19:38</a>) and had a long-standing enmity with Israel. Jephthah's willingness to fight them indicates his desire to protect Israel despite his personal grievances. This reflects the broader biblical theme of God raising leaders to deliver His people, as seen with Moses and the Exodus (<a href="/exodus/3-10.htm">Exodus 3:10</a>).<p><b>and the LORD gives them to me</b><br>Jephthah acknowledges that victory depends on the LORD, not merely on human strength or strategy. This reliance on divine intervention is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, as seen in battles like Jericho (<a href="/joshua/6-2.htm">Joshua 6:2-5</a>). It underscores the belief that God is sovereign over the affairs of nations and battles.<p><b>will I really be your leader?&#8221;</b><br>Jephthah seeks assurance of his leadership role, reflecting a need for legitimacy and acceptance. This mirrors the Israelites' request for a king in <a href="/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>, where leadership and authority are central concerns. Jephthah's question also foreshadows the conditional nature of his leadership, which ultimately leads to his tragic vow (<a href="/judges/11-30.htm">Judges 11:30-31</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A Gileadite warrior, son of Gilead and a prostitute, who was initially rejected by his family but later called upon to lead Israel against the Ammonites.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/g/gilead.htm">Gilead</a></b><br>The region east of the Jordan River, home to Jephthah and his family.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/a/ammonites.htm">Ammonites</a></b><br>A neighboring nation and frequent adversary of Israel, who were oppressing the Israelites at this time.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/e/elders_of_gilead.htm">Elders of Gilead</a></b><br>Leaders of the Gileadite community who sought Jephthah's help to defeat the Ammonites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, whom Jephthah acknowledges as the one who grants victory.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/l/leadership_and_god's_sovereignty.htm">Leadership and God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Jephthah's question reflects a recognition that true leadership and victory come from God.

He was only half an Israelite; he had been wronged by his father's kin; he had spent long years of his manhood among heathens and outlaws, who gained their livelihood by brigandage or mercenary warfare. "As Gideon is the highest pitch of greatness to which this period reaches," says Dean Stanley. "Jephthah and Samson are the lowest points to which it descends." Since, then, we have marked elements of ferocity and religious ignorance and ambition even in the noble character of Gideon, we must remember that we might naturally make allowance for a still lower level of attainment in one who had been so unfavourably circumstanced as Jephthah. Apart from the Syrian influences which had told upon him, the whole condition of the pastoral tribes on the east of the Jordan was far below that of the agricultural western tribes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall I be</span>, etc. There is no interrogative in the Hebrew.
