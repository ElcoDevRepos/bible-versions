This phrase highlights their proactive role in fulfilling God's command to take possession of the Promised Land. The Canaanites were the indigenous people of the region, known for their idolatrous practices, which were in direct opposition to the worship of Yahweh. This march signifies the continuation of the conquest that began under Joshua, emphasizing the need for obedience to God's commands.<p><b>who were living in Hebron</b><br>Hebron is one of the oldest cities in the world, with significant biblical history. It was previously the home of Abraham, who purchased the Cave of Machpelah there as a burial site for his wife Sarah (Genesis 23). Hebron's strategic location in the hill country of Judah made it a key city in the conquest. The city's association with the patriarchs added spiritual significance to its capture, symbolizing the fulfillment of God's promises to Abraham.<p><b>(formerly known as Kiriath-arba)</b><br>Kiriath-arba means "City of Arba," named after Arba, who was considered the greatest man among the Anakim, a race of giants (<a href="/joshua/14-15.htm">Joshua 14:15</a>). The renaming of the city to Hebron reflects the transition from Canaanite to Israelite control and the establishment of a new identity under God's covenant people. This change signifies the transformation and redemption of the land from paganism to a place of worship for Yahweh.<p><b>and they struck down Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai</b><br>These three individuals are identified as descendants of Anak, the Anakim, known for their formidable size and strength (<a href="/numbers/13-33.htm">Numbers 13:33</a>). Their defeat by the tribe of Judah demonstrates God's power and faithfulness in overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles. This victory serves as a reminder of God's promise to give the land to the Israelites and foreshadows the ultimate triumph of God's people over evil. The conquest of these giants can also be seen as a type of Christ's victory over sin and death, as He conquers the spiritual giants that stand against humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/judah.htm">Judah</a></b><br>One of the twelve tribes of Israel, descended from Jacob's son Judah.

God now reclaims this historic place for His covenant people.<p>- Caleb had been promised Hebron as his inheritance (<a href="/joshua/14-13.htm">Joshua 14:13-14</a>). Judah&#8217;s campaign thus serves both the tribal mission and fulfillment of that personal pledge.<p>- God&#8217;s people are taking back territory with deep history, showing that no place is beyond the reach of His redemptive plan (<a href="/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>; <a href="/psalms/105-11.htm">Psalm 105:11</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and they struck down Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai</b><p>- These three are identified elsewhere as Anakim&#8212;giants who terrified the original spies (<a href="/numbers/13-22.htm">Numbers 13:22, 28, 33</a>).<p>&#8226; Their defeat illustrates that obstacles once seen as unbeatable fall easily when God fights for His people (<a href="/deuteronomy/9-2.htm">Deuteronomy 9:2-3</a>).<p>&#8226; Caleb had already driven them out once (<a href="/joshua/15-14.htm">Joshua 15:14</a>); Judah now completes the task, ensuring no remnant remains (<a href="/judges/1-20.htm">Judges 1:20</a>).<p>- By naming the enemies, Scripture highlights a tangible victory: real men in a real place met real judgment, proving the LORD&#8217;s promises are concrete, not abstract (<a href="/joshua/21-45.htm">Joshua 21:45</a>).<p>- The rout of these giants foreshadows later triumphs, such as David&#8217;s over Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-45.htm">1 Samuel 17:45-47</a>), reinforcing the theme that size and strength mean nothing against the living God.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Judah&#8217;s advance, Hebron&#8217;s capture, and the defeat of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai together showcase God&#8217;s faithfulness to every detail of His word.

Hebron was the burial-place of Abraham and Sarah (<a href="/genesis/23-2.htm">Genesis 23:2</a>, etc.; Genesis 25:9), of Isaac and Rebekah, and of Jacob and Leah (<a href="/genesis/35-27.htm">Genesis 35:27-29</a>; <a href="/genesis/49-31.htm">Genesis 49:31</a>; <a href="/genesis/50-13.htm">Genesis 50:13</a>), and the mosque, within whose massive walls the tombs of Abraham and the other four above mentioned are still preserved with the utmost reverence, is the most remarkable object in the modern city, which is called <span class="accented">El-Khalil</span> (the friend), after Abraham, the <span class="accented">friend of</span> God. A very interesting account of the Prince of Wales's visit to the Mosque of Hebron in 1862 is given in Dean Stanley s 'Sermons in the East.' David reigned in Hebron seven years and six mouths before he transferred the seat of power to Jerusalem (see <a href="/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1</a>, etc.; 2 Samuel 5:1-5). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/1-10.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">Judah</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1464;&#1431;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(y&#601;&#183;h&#363;&#183;&#7695;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3063.htm">Strong's 3063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Judah -- 'praised', a son of Jacob, also the southern kingdom, also four Israelites</span><br /><br /><span class="word">also marched</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1461;&#1443;&#1500;&#1462;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#234;&#183;le&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
