In the context of <a href="/judges/9.htm">Judges 9</a>, the olive tree represents a figure of stability and productivity. The olive tree's response is part of Jotham's parable, which is a critique of Abimelech's kingship. The olive tree's refusal to become king highlights the idea that true leadership should not be self-serving but should focus on serving others.<p><b>Should I stop giving my oil</b><br>Olive oil was a valuable commodity in ancient Israel, used for anointing, cooking, lighting lamps, and religious offerings. The rhetorical question emphasizes the olive tree's essential role and the importance of its contributions. This reflects the biblical principle that each person has unique gifts and roles that should not be abandoned for personal ambition.<p><b>that honors both God and man</b><br>Olive oil was used in religious ceremonies, symbolizing the presence and blessing of God. It was also used in everyday life, providing light and sustenance. This dual purpose underscores the idea that true service honors both divine and human needs. The olive tree's oil is a metaphor for actions that glorify God and benefit others, aligning with the biblical call to love God and love one's neighbor.<p><b>to hold sway over the trees?</b><br>The phrase "to hold sway" suggests authority and control. The olive tree's refusal to rule over the other trees illustrates the biblical theme that leadership should not be about power or dominance. This echoes Jesus' teaching in the New Testament that the greatest leaders are those who serve others (<a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42-45</a>). The parable critiques the desire for power that characterized Abimelech's rule, contrasting it with the selfless service exemplified by Christ.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1.

When the olive tree is addressed, it &#8220;replied&#8221; (<a href="/judges/9-9.htm">Judges 9:9</a>). The olive tree is personified, highlighting that even creation recognizes its God-given role (cf. <a href="/psalms/96-11.htm">Psalm 96:11&#8211;13</a>).<p>&#8226; The olive tree speaks from a position of contentment rather than ambition, echoing <a href="/psalms/131-2.htm">Psalm 131:2</a> where the psalmist rests in God&#8217;s assignment.<p>&#8226; Its answer exposes the folly of the other trees&#8217; political scheming, just as <a href="/1_samuel/8-7.htm">1 Samuel 8:7&#8211;9</a> warns Israel about misplaced trust in human rule.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Cessation or Continuation: &#8220;Should I stop giving my oil&#8221;</b><p>The phrase introduces a rhetorical question: Would it abandon its primary purpose?<p>&#8226; Olive oil was vital for light (<a href="/exodus/27-20.htm">Exodus 27:20</a>), anointing (<a href="/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>), and daily sustenance (<a href="/1_kings/17-12.htm">1 Kings 17:12&#8211;16</a>).<p>&#8226; Stepping away from producing oil would deny others God&#8217;s provision, much like hiding one&#8217;s talent in <a href="/matthew/25-24.htm">Matthew 25:24&#8211;27</a>.<p>&#8226; The implied answer is &#8220;No,&#8221; teaching believers to stay faithful to their calling instead of chasing prominence (<a href="/1_corinthians/7-17.htm">1 Corinthians 7:17</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Purpose of the oil: &#8220;that honors both God and man&#8221;</b><p>The oil &#8220;honors&#8221; God through temple worship and anointing, and it &#8220;honors&#8221; man by meeting human needs.<p>&#8226; In worship: Oil fueled the golden lampstand, symbolizing God&#8217;s presence (<a href="/leviticus/24-2.htm">Leviticus 24:2</a>).<p>&#8226; In consecration: Priests and kings were anointed, marking divine approval (<a href="/psalms/89-20.htm">Psalm 89:20</a>).<p>&#8226; In refreshment: Oil eased wounds and refreshed guests (<a href="/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>; <a href="/luke/7-46.htm">Luke 7:46</a>).<p>The dual honor connects vertical devotion to God with horizontal service to people (<a href="/matthew/22-37.htm">Matthew 22:37&#8211;39</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Ambition questioned: &#8220;to hold sway over the trees?&#8221;</b><p>The olive tree refuses kingship because ruling would distract from its divinely appointed task.<p>&#8226; &#8220;Holding sway&#8221; suggests oppressive authority, the very abuse later seen in Abimelech (<a href="/judges/9-22.htm">Judges 9:22&#8211;24</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture warns against trading service for selfish rule (<a href="/mark/10-42.htm">Mark 10:42&#8211;45</a>).<p>&#8226; The olive tree models the heart attitude of Jesus, who declined worldly crowns to accomplish His redemptive mission (<a href="/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>; <a href="/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6&#8211;8</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/9-9.htm">Judges 9:9</a> portrays the olive tree as a picture of contented, purposeful service.
