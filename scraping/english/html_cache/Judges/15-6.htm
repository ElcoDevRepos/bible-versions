Their demand reflects a culture of retribution and justice, common in ancient Near Eastern societies. This question arises after Samson's act of vengeance, which involved setting fire to the Philistines' grain fields, vineyards, and olive groves (<a href="/judges/15-4.htm">Judges 15:4-5</a>). The Philistines' inquiry indicates their intent to identify and punish the perpetrator, highlighting the cycle of violence between them and the Israelites.<p><b>&#8220;It was Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite,&#8221; they were told.</b><br>Samson, a judge of Israel, was known for his extraordinary strength and tumultuous relationship with the Philistines. His marriage to a Philistine woman from Timnah was part of God's plan to confront the Philistines (<a href="/judges/14-4.htm">Judges 14:4</a>). The reference to him as the "son-in-law of the Timnite" underscores the personal nature of the conflict, as familial ties were significant in ancient cultures. This connection also foreshadows the tragic consequences of intermarriage with pagan nations, a recurring theme in Israel's history.<p><b>&#8220;For his wife was given to his companion.&#8221;</b><br>This phrase reveals the immediate cause of Samson's anger. His wife being given to another man, likely a friend or associate, was a grave insult and breach of trust. In ancient times, marriage arrangements were binding, and such an act would be seen as a severe dishonor. This personal betrayal fueled Samson's retaliation against the Philistines, illustrating the intertwining of personal grievances with national conflicts.<p><b>So the Philistines went up and burned her and her father to death.</b><br>The Philistines' response is brutal and reflects the harsh realities of ancient justice systems, where collective punishment was common. This act of retribution fulfills Samson's earlier threat in <a href="/judges/14-15.htm">Judges 14:15</a>, where the Philistines had threatened his wife with burning if she did not betray Samson's riddle. The burning of Samson's wife and her father also serves as a grim reminder of the destructive consequences of sin and disobedience, echoing the broader biblical theme of judgment. This event foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who breaks the cycle of sin and retribution.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his extraordinary strength, which was given by God.

<a href="/1_samuel/18-8.htm">1 Samuel 18:8</a>).<p>&#8211; It also highlights how human authorities often act swiftly when their own interests are threatened, yet ignore greater moral concerns (<a href="/luke/23-24.htm">Luke 23:24-25</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>It was Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, they were told.</b><p>&#8211;

Their reaction&#8212;burning his wife and her father&#8212;reveals the cruelty of sin, the irony of threats turned on the threateners, and God&#8217;s sovereign use of even tragic circumstances to judge oppressors and advance His deliverance of Israel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/15.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(6) <span class= "bld">They answered.</span>--The phrase is impersonal; but Samson had quite openly threatened vengeance in speaking to the Timnites, and is not likely to have done his work unaided or to have been very reticent about it; nor would the poor oppressed Israelites be inclined to keep his secret when they were confronted with the fury of the Philistines.<p><span class= "bld">Burnt her and her father with fire.</span>--Was this meant as a way of revenging themselves on Samson, or of avenging him for the wrongs which he had received from the Timnite? The latter seems to be most unlikely. Looking with despair and fury at the blackened fields which but a few days before had been thick with golden corn, it is inconceivable that the Philistines would be in a mood to perform an act of justice for the sake of the deadly enemy who had inflicted this loss upon them. Their motive is clear enough. They wished to insult and injure Samson, and, at the same time, vent their fierce spleen on the man whose family and whose conduct had led to all these troubles. That they thought about "burning as the punishment of adultery among the Jews" (<a href="/genesis/38-24.htm" title="And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar your daughter in law has played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by prostitution. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.">Genesis 38:24</a>, &c.) is still more improbable. To burn a person, and his house and his family, seems to have been the ordinary revenge of these barbarous days. (See <a href="/judges/12-1.htm" title="And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went northward, and said to Jephthah, Why passed you over to fight against the children of Ammon, and did not call us to go with you? we will burn your house on you with fire.">Judges 12:1</a>; <a href="/judges/14-15.htm" title="And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife, Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle, lest we burn you and your father's house with fire: have you called us to take that we have? is it not so?">Judges 14:15</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Philistines... burnt her and her father with fire</span>. See <a href="/judges/14-15.htm">Judges 14:15</a>. It appears from <a href="/genesis/38-24.htm">Genesis 38:24</a>; <a href="/leviticus/20-14.htm">Leviticus 20:14</a>; <a href="/leviticus/21-9.htm">Leviticus 21:9</a>; <a href="/joshua/7-15.htm">Joshua 7:15, 25</a>, that burning with fire was a judicial punishment among the Hebrews. Possibly the Philistines, in their fear of Samson, and perhaps also from a rude sense of justice, inflicted this punishment upon the Thimnathite and her father as the real authors of the destruction of their corn-fields, by giving Samson so unheard-of provocation. Note the fact of the identical fate overtaking Samson's wife which she had sought to escape by base treachery (cf. <a href="/john/11-48.htm">John 11:48</a> with what actually happened). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/15-6.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">&#8220;Who</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1502;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(m&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interrogative<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_4310.htm">Strong's 4310: </a> </span><span class="str2">Who?, whoever, in oblique construction with prefix, suffix</span><br /><br /><span class="word">did</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1506;&#1464;&#1443;&#1513;&#1474;&#1464;&#1492;</span> <span class="translit">(&#8216;&#257;&#183;&#347;&#257;h)</span><br /><span class="parse">Verb - Qal - Perfect - third person masculine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6213.htm">Strong's 6213: </a> </span><span class="str2">To do, make</span><br /><br /><span class="word">this?&#8221;</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1494;&#1465;&#1488;&#1514;&#1426;</span> <span class="translit">(z&#333;&#7791;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Pronoun - feminine singular<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_2063.htm">Strong's 2063: </a> </span><span class="str2">Hereby in it, likewise, the one other, same, she, so much, such deed, that, </span><br /><br /><span class="word">the Philistines</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1508;&#1456;&#1500;&#1460;&#1513;&#1473;&#1456;&#1514;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1501;&#1454;</span> <span class="translit">(p&#772;&#601;&#183;li&#353;&#183;t&#238;m)</span><br /><span class="parse">Noun - proper - masculine plural<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_6430.htm">Strong's 6430: </a> </span><span class="str2">Philistines -- inhabitants of Philistia</span><br /><br /><span class="word">demanded.</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1468;&#1465;&#1488;&#1502;&#1456;&#1512;&#1443;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;y&#333;&#183;m&#601;&#183;r&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
