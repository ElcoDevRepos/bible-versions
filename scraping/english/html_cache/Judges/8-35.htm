Jerubbaal, another name for Gideon, means "Let Baal contend against him," reflecting his role in tearing down the altar of Baal (<a href="/judges/6-32.htm">Judges 6:32</a>). This lack of kindness is significant in the context of ancient Israel, where familial loyalty and gratitude were highly valued. The Israelites' failure to honor Gideon's family contrasts with the covenantal loyalty expected in the community, as seen in other parts of the Old Testament, such as the loyalty shown to David's house (<a href="/2_samuel/9.htm">2 Samuel 9:1</a>).<p><b>(that is, Gideon)</b><br>Gideon, a judge of Israel, was a military leader and prophet who delivered Israel from Midianite oppression (Judges 6-8). His leadership was marked by faith in God, as demonstrated in the miraculous victory with only 300 men (<a href="/judges/7-7.htm">Judges 7:7</a>). The mention of both names emphasizes his dual role as a warrior against idolatry and a leader of Israel. Gideon's story is a type of Christ, as he was a savior figure who delivered his people, prefiguring Jesus' ultimate deliverance from sin.<p><b>for all the good things he had done for Israel.</b><br>Gideon's contributions included military victories and a period of peace lasting 40 years (<a href="/judges/8-28.htm">Judges 8:28</a>). His actions were instrumental in restoring Israel's faith in God and freeing them from foreign oppression. The phrase underscores the theme of human forgetfulness and ingratitude, which is a recurring issue in Israel's history (<a href="/psalms/78-11.htm">Psalm 78:11</a>). This ingratitude foreshadows the rejection of Jesus, who, despite His good works, was not accepted by many of His own people (<a href="/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon (Jerubbaal)</a></b><br>A judge of Israel who led the Israelites to victory against the Midianites.

Forgetting God quickly turns into forgetting people who represent His deliverance.<p>- Kindness here is covenant loyalty&#8212;active, tangible goodwill. David later praised the men of Jabesh-gilead for such loyalty to Saul (<a href="/2_samuel/2-5.htm">2 Samuel 2:5-6</a>), showing what Israel should have offered Gideon&#8217;s family.<p>- Israel&#8217;s neglect contrasts sharply with God&#8217;s own nature: &#8220;Give thanks to the LORD, for He is good; His loving devotion endures forever&#8221; (<a href="/psalms/136-1.htm">Psalm 136:1</a>).<p>- Ingratitude always breeds decline (<a href="/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a>).

The people&#8217;s silence during that atrocity exposes their hardened hearts.<p>- Scripture elsewhere teaches honoring the household of one whom God used: Jonathan&#8217;s line was spared &#8220;for the sake of Saul&#8217;s son&#8221; (<a href="/2_samuel/21-7.htm">2 Samuel 21:7</a>); Mephibosheth ate at David&#8217;s table because of covenant faithfulness (<a href="/2_samuel/9-7.htm">2 Samuel 9:7</a>).<p>- Failing Gideon&#8217;s family meant rejecting the memory of God&#8217;s victory achieved through him.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>for all the good things he had done for Israel</b><p>- Gideon&#8217;s &#8220;good things&#8221; were many:<p>&#8226; Deliverance from Midian&#8217;s oppression (<a href="/judges/7-19.htm">Judges 7:19-25</a>)<p>&#8226; Forty years of peace (<a href="/judges/8-28.htm">Judges 8:28</a>)<p>&#8226; Refusal to set up a dynasty, pointing the nation back to God as King (<a href="/judges/8-23.htm">Judges 8:23</a>)<p>- God calls His people to remember His works and the instruments He uses (<a href="/psalms/103-2.htm">Psalm 103:2</a>; <a href="/hebrews/13-7.htm">Hebrews 13:7</a>).

Their refusal to show covenant loyalty to Gideon&#8217;s household reveals ingratitude, spiritual drift, and a disregard for God&#8217;s chosen means of blessing. The verse warns every generation to treasure God&#8217;s past mercies, honor those He has used, and live out steadfast kindness in response to His unfailing love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(35) <span class= "bld">Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon.</span>--It is doubtful whether we should not join the two names (Jerubbaal-Gideon), as in the Vulgate.
