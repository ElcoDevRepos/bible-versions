This reflects the cultural and legal practices of inheritance rights in ancient Israel, where legitimacy was crucial. His rejection parallels other biblical figures like Joseph, who was also rejected by his brothers but later became a leader. This theme of rejection and eventual leadership is a recurring motif in Scripture.<p><b>and settled in the land of Tob</b><br>The land of Tob is believed to be located northeast of Gilead, possibly in modern-day Syria. It was outside the traditional boundaries of Israel, indicating Jephthah's status as an outcast. This region was likely a place of refuge for those who were marginalized or in trouble, similar to David's time in the wilderness. The geographical setting underscores Jephthah's separation from his people and his outsider status.<p><b>where worthless men gathered around him</b><br>The term "worthless men" refers to those who were socially marginalized or discontented, similar to the men who gathered around David at the cave of Adullam. These men were often seen as outlaws or mercenaries. In the biblical narrative, God frequently uses those deemed "worthless" by society to accomplish His purposes, highlighting the theme of God choosing the unlikely to fulfill His plans.<p><b>and traveled with him</b><br>Jephthah's leadership over these men foreshadows his future role as a judge of Israel. This group of followers can be seen as a precursor to his military leadership, as they likely formed the core of his fighting force. This aspect of Jephthah's life can be compared to Jesus Christ, who also gathered a group of unlikely followers and was initially rejected by His own people. Jephthah's story illustrates how God can use difficult circumstances and unlikely individuals to bring about deliverance for His people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jephthah.htm">Jephthah</a></b><br>A mighty warrior and the son of Gilead, Jephthah was rejected by his family due to his mother being a prostitute.
