The term "master" indicates his authority over his servant, reflecting the social hierarchy of ancient Israel. The Levite's role is significant as he represents the religious leadership of the time, which is often depicted as flawed in the Book of Judges.<p><b>We will not turn aside to the city of foreigners</b><br>The Levite's decision not to enter a city of foreigners highlights the tension between Israelites and non-Israelites. This reflects the Israelites' concern for maintaining cultural and religious purity, as interactions with foreigners often led to idolatry and moral corruption, a recurring theme in Judges.<p><b>where there are no Israelites</b><br>This phrase underscores the Levite's desire to remain within the community of God's chosen people. It reflects the importance of tribal and national identity in ancient Israel. The absence of Israelites in a city would imply a lack of shared values and covenantal faithfulness, which the Levite seeks to avoid.<p><b>We will go on to Gibeah</b><br>Gibeah, a city in the territory of Benjamin, is chosen as a destination because it is an Israelite city. This decision is ironic, as Gibeah becomes the setting for a grievous sin against the Levite's concubine, leading to civil war. The choice of Gibeah foreshadows the moral decay within Israel itself, despite the Levite's attempt to avoid foreign influence. This narrative echoes the broader theme of Judges, where Israel's internal corruption is as dangerous as external threats.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A central figure in this account, the Levite is traveling with his concubine and servant.
