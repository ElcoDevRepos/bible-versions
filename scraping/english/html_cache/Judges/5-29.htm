In the ancient Near Eastern context, it was common for women of high status to have a retinue of attendants. These women are described as "wisest," indicating their role as advisors or counselors. This reflects the cultural practice of seeking wisdom and counsel from trusted individuals, a theme seen throughout the Bible, such as in <a href="/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a>, which emphasizes the value of wise counsel.<p><b>indeed she keeps telling herself,</b><br>This part of the verse highlights the self-deception or false reassurance that Sisera's mother engages in. The repetition suggests a desperate attempt to convince herself of a positive outcome despite the reality. This mirrors the human tendency to deny unpleasant truths, a theme explored in various biblical narratives. The phrase also foreshadows the futility of her hopes, as Sisera has already been defeated by the Israelites, led by Deborah and Barak. This can be seen as a contrast to the assurance and hope found in God's promises, as seen in passages like <a href="/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>, which speaks of God's sovereignty and purpose.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sisera.htm">Sisera</a></b><br>A Canaanite commander defeated by the Israelites under Deborah and Barak's leadership.
