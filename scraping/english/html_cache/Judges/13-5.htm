It signifies divine intervention and purpose. The angel's message to Manoah's wife highlights God's sovereignty in choosing and preparing individuals for His plans. The birth of Samson is part of God's ongoing work to deliver Israel, a theme seen throughout the book of Judges.<p><b>And no razor shall touch his head,</b><br>This phrase introduces the Nazirite vow, a special commitment to God described in <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6:1-21</a>. The vow includes abstaining from wine, avoiding contact with the dead, and not cutting one's hair. Samson's uncut hair symbolizes his dedication and separation to God. This physical sign of the vow is a constant reminder of his divine calling and the source of his strength.<p><b>because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from the womb,</b><br>Samson's Nazirite status from birth is unique, as most Nazirites took the vow voluntarily and temporarily. This lifelong dedication underscores the special role Samson is to play in God's plan. It also foreshadows the challenges he will face in maintaining his commitment, reflecting the broader struggle of Israel to remain faithful to God.<p><b>and he will begin the deliverance of Israel from the hand of the Philistines.&#8221;</b><br>Samson's mission is to initiate the liberation of Israel from Philistine oppression, a task that will not be completed until the time of King David (<a href="/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17-25</a>). The Philistines were a significant threat during this period, and Samson's role as a judge is part of God's response to Israel's cries for help. His actions, though flawed, are part of the divine strategy to weaken the Philistine hold on Israel.

Like Gabriel&#8217;s message to Mary, &#8220;You will conceive in your womb and bear a son&#8221; (<a href="/luke/1-31.htm">Luke 1:31</a>), the statement underscores that conception itself is a work of the Lord (<a href="/psalms/127-3.htm">Psalm 127:3</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>And give birth to a son</b><p>A specific gender is named because this child will carry a divinely appointed mission.

The verse invites us to trust that when God sets someone apart&#8212;even from the womb&#8212;He equips and sustains that person to launch His saving plans, no matter how daunting the enemy or how long the process.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(5) <span class= "bld">No razor shall come on his head.</span>--The law of the Nazarite is laid down in Numbers 6, and when that chapter is read as the <span class= "ital">Parashah </span>(or first lesson) in the synagogue-worship, this account of the birth of Samson, the first recorded Nazarite, is read as the <span class= "ital">Haphtarah </span>(or second lesson).<p><span class= "bld">Shall begin to deliver.</span>--The weaknesses of Samson's own character rendered him unfit to achieve that complete deliverance which was carried out by Samuel. In the cases of Jephthah and Samson the Israelites learnt the power which rests in individual vows to display the occult and mysterious heroism of the human spirit, and to save people from sinking into the lowest depths (Ewald, 2:397). The vow became a new force of the age. In Jephthah's case it had been an isolated vow, but in Samson's it was the devotion of a life, and developed an indomitable energy and power.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The child shall be a Nazarite</span>, etc. So it was said, though not in the same words, concerning Samuel (<a href="/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>) and concerning John the Baptist (<a href="/luke/1-15.htm">Luke 1:15</a>). A Nazarite (or, more correctly, a <span class="accented">Nazi-rite</span>) means one <span class="accented">separated</span>, and specially dedicated to God. The law of the Nazarites is contained in <a href="/numbers/6.htm">Numbers 6</a>, where, however, only <span class="accented">Nazarites of days</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> Nazarites for a definite time, arc spoken cf. Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist were <span class="accented">perpetual Nazarites</span>, Nazarites of <span class="accented">for ever</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> the Mishna classifies them. Abstinence from strong drink, and from anything made of the grape; letting the locks of the head grow unchecked by the razor; and keeping quite clear of any pollution from a dead body, even in case of the death of his nearest relations, were the chief articles of a Nazarite's vow. St. Paul took the vow of a Nazarite of days, and offered the prescribed sacrifices, together with "the hair of the head of his separation," as we read in <a href="/acts/18-18.htm">Acts 18:18</a>; <a href="/acts/21-23.htm">Acts 21:23-26</a>. <span class="cmt_word">He shall begin</span>, etc. This is an exact description of what Samson did. He did not "deliver Israel" as the other judges did; but he began to shake the Philistine power, and prepared the way for the deliverance of Israel in the time of his worthier successor Samuel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/13-5.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">For</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1499;&#1468;&#1460;&#1497;&#1449;</span> <span class="translit">(k&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunction<br /></span><span class="str"><a href="/hebrew/strongs_3588.htm">Strong's 3588: </a> </span><span class="str2">A relative conjunction</span><br /><br /><span class="word">behold,</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1492;&#1460;&#1504;&#1468;&#1464;&#1448;&#1498;&#1456;</span> <span class="translit">(hin&#183;n&#257;&#7733;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Interjection &#124;
