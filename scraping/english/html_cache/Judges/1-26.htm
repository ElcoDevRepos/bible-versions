The Hittites were an ancient people mentioned frequently in the Old Testament, known for their powerful empire in Anatolia (modern-day Turkey). The mention of the Hittites here suggests a migration or settlement outside the immediate region of Canaan, indicating the widespread influence and interactions among ancient Near Eastern cultures. The Hittites were known for their advanced civilization and military prowess, which might have provided a suitable environment for the man to establish a new settlement.<p><b>built a city</b><br>The act of building a city signifies the establishment of a new community or settlement. In ancient times, building a city involved not only constructing physical structures but also establishing social, political, and religious systems. This reflects the man's initiative and leadership in creating a new place of habitation. The construction of cities was often associated with the spread of culture and influence, as well as the fulfillment of divine promises or judgments, as seen throughout the biblical narrative.<p><b>and called it Luz</b><br>Naming a city was a significant act in the ancient world, often reflecting the founder's heritage, experiences, or aspirations. The name "Luz" is notable because it was the original name of Bethel before Jacob renamed it (<a href="/genesis/28-19.htm">Genesis 28:19</a>). This renaming could symbolize a connection to the past or a desire to preserve a cultural or familial identity. The act of naming also indicates authority and ownership, suggesting that the man had a significant role in the establishment and identity of the new city.<p><b>which is its name to this day</b><br>This phrase indicates the enduring legacy of the city and its name, suggesting that the city of Luz continued to exist and be recognized by that name at the time the text was written. This enduring name serves as a testament to the historical accuracy and continuity of the biblical narrative. It also highlights the importance of names and places in maintaining cultural and historical identity over generations. The phrase underscores the reliability of the biblical account and the lasting impact of the events described.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_man.htm">The Man</a></b><br>An unnamed individual who was spared by the Israelites after revealing the entrance to the city of Bethel.

This act of mercy led to the establishment of a new city, Luz, in the land of the Hittites. It reminds us of the potential long-term impact of our decisions to show mercy or judgment.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_spread_of_influence.htm">The Spread of Influence</a></b><br>The man&#8217;s relocation and establishment of a new city demonstrate how individuals can carry cultural and spiritual influences to new places. As Christians, we are called to be salt and light, spreading the influence of Christ wherever we go.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/t/the_importance_of_names.htm">The Importance of Names</a></b><br>The naming of places in the Bible often carries significant meaning. Luz, both the original and the new city, serves as a reminder of the continuity and change in God's plan. Names can reflect identity and purpose, both in biblical times and today.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty_in_human_affairs.htm">God&#8217;s Sovereignty in Human Affairs</a></b><br>The account of the man and the city of Luz illustrates how God&#8217;s plans unfold through human actions, even those that seem insignificant.
