The tribute was a form of tax or offering paid by a subjugated people to their conqueror, in this case, Eglon, the king of Moab. This act of presenting tribute was common in ancient Near Eastern cultures as a sign of submission and servitude. The tribute likely consisted of agricultural produce or precious metals, reflecting the economic burden placed on Israel. This moment sets the stage for Ehud's cunning plan to deliver Israel, highlighting the theme of God using unexpected means and people to achieve His purposes.<p><b>he ushered out those who had carried it</b><br>Ehud's action of sending away the carriers of the tribute indicates his strategic planning. By dismissing them, he ensured that he would be alone with King Eglon, facilitating his assassination plan. This reflects Ehud's wisdom and courage, as he took a significant risk to fulfill God's deliverance of Israel. The carriers were likely fellow Israelites, and their departure signifies Ehud's solitary role in the upcoming act of deliverance. This moment foreshadows the individual responsibility and bravery required to confront evil, a theme echoed throughout Scripture, including in the life of Jesus Christ, who faced His mission alone at critical moments.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/e/ehud.htm">Ehud</a></b><br>A left-handed judge of Israel from the tribe of Benjamin, chosen by God to deliver Israel from Moabite oppression.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/tribute.htm">Tribute</a></b><br>A payment made by the Israelites to Eglon, the king of Moab, as a sign of subjugation and servitude.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/e/eglon.htm">Eglon</a></b><br>The king of Moab who oppressed Israel for eighteen years.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moab.htm">Moab</a></b><br>A nation located east of the Dead Sea, often in conflict with Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/i/israelites.htm">Israelites</a></b><br>The people of God, who were under Moabite oppression due to their disobedience to God.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_deliverance_through_unlikely_means.htm">God's Deliverance through Unlikely Means</a></b><br>Ehud, a left-handed man, was an unlikely hero.

Nothing here feels accidental; Scripture shows the Lord using ordinary acts to set up extraordinary deliverance (<a href="/genesis/45-5.htm">Genesis 45:5&#8211;8</a>; <a href="/esther/4-14.htm">Esther 4:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Presenting the tribute signals closure of a formal ceremony.

Scripture often highlights strategic separation before decisive moments: Abraham and the servants at Moriah (<a href="/genesis/22-5.htm">Genesis 22:5</a>), Elisha and Gehazi outside the room (<a href="/2_kings/4-4.htm">2 Kings 4:4</a>).<p>&#8226; Ehud now stands alone before Eglon, mirroring future solitary confrontations for God&#8217;s glory&#8212;David before Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-32.htm">1 Samuel 17:32</a>), Elijah on Carmel (<a href="/1_kings/18-22.htm">1 Kings 18:22</a>).<p>&#8226; God&#8217;s deliverance frequently arises through a single obedient servant. By ushering the carriers away, Ehud demonstrates courage and faith, trusting the Lord to act through him alone (<a href="/zechariah/4-6.htm">Zechariah 4:6</a>; <a href="/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32&#8211;34</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/3-18.htm">Judges 3:18</a> marks a critical hinge in the narrative.
