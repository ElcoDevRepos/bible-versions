Sisera was a formidable military leader under King Jabin of Canaan, known for his oppressive rule over Israel. The mention of "drawing out" suggests a strategic maneuver orchestrated by God, emphasizing His sovereignty and control over the events. This reflects the biblical theme of God using unlikely means to achieve His purposes, as seen in other instances like the story of Gideon (Judges 7).<p><b>his chariots, and his troops</b><br>The reference to chariots highlights the military superiority of the Canaanites, as they possessed 900 iron chariots (<a href="/judges/4-3.htm">Judges 4:3</a>), a significant technological advantage over the Israelites. Chariots were the tanks of the ancient world, symbolizing strength and power. This sets the stage for a miraculous victory, as Israel, lacking such resources, would need divine intervention to overcome this formidable force. This mirrors other biblical narratives where God delivers His people against overwhelming odds, such as the crossing of the Red Sea (Exodus 14).<p><b>to the River Kishon</b><br>The River Kishon is a significant geographical feature in the Jezreel Valley, known for its seasonal flooding. This location plays a crucial role in the battle's outcome, as the river's flooding would render Sisera's chariots ineffective, turning their advantage into a liability. This demonstrates God's control over nature and His ability to use it to fulfill His purposes, reminiscent of the plagues in Egypt (Exodus 7-12).<p><b>and I will deliver him into your hand.&#8217;&#8221;</b><br>This promise of deliverance underscores the theme of divine salvation and victory. It assures Israel of God's faithfulness to His covenant people, despite their previous disobedience. The phrase "into your hand" signifies complete victory and control, a common biblical expression of triumph (<a href="/joshua/10-8.htm">Joshua 10:8</a>).
