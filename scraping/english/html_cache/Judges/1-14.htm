Like Rebekah approaching Isaac (<a href="/genesis/24-62.htm">Genesis 24:62-65</a>), the narrative pauses to spotlight a decisive act within a covenant family.<p>&#8226; The setting is the newly conquered territory of Judah.

By requesting a specific tract, Acsah shows confidence in that promise.<p>&#8226; She &#8220;urged&#8221; Othniel, yet remained within the order God has set: husband speaks for wife (cf. <a href="/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1-11</a>, the daughters of Zelophehad who appeal through proper channels).<p>&#8226; Their request honors Caleb&#8217;s authority while recognizing his generosity (<a href="/joshua/15-19.htm">Joshua 15:19</a>).

The LXX. render it "screamed" or "shouted from the ass;" the Vulg., "sighed as she was sitting on the ass;" but they probably had a different reading. "Suddenly," says Ewald, "<span class= "ital">as if some accident had happened to her, </span>she fell from her ass, and on being embraced by her anxious father, she adjured him as if in words of inspiration" (<span class= "ital">Hist.

The Septuagint reads, "Othniel urged her to ask the field of her father," and the Vulgate has, "Her husband told her to ask her father," and then it follows naturally, "and she lighted from off her ass," etc. But the Hebrew reading may be right, and it may be that when her husband, brave in storming a city, but timid in asking a favour, hung back, she, with the tenacious will of a woman, sprang off the ass herself, and successfully preferred her request. Dean Stanley identifies (though not with absolute certainty) the "field thus obtained by Achsah with an unusually green valley amidst the dry, barren hills of the south country, lying south or west of Hebron, called Wady Nuukur, through which Caleb and Achsah must have ridden on their way from Hebron to Debir, or Kirjath-sepher. This valley breaks into a precipitous and still greener ravine, and both the upper and lower pastures are watered by a clear, bubbling rivulet, which rises in the upper meadow, and flows to the bottom of the ravine below. The name of a village, <span class="accented">Dewir</span>, seems to represent the ancient <span class="accented">Debir.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/1-14.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">One day</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1497;&#1456;&#1492;&#1460;&#1443;&#1497;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;h&#238;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
