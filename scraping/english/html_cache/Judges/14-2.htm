Samson's return to his parents indicates the importance of familial approval and involvement in marital arrangements. This reflects the patriarchal structure of society, where parents, particularly the father, had significant authority over their children's choices. The act of returning to his parents also highlights the close-knit family dynamics typical of the time.<p><b>&#8220;I have seen a daughter of the Philistines in Timnah.&#8221;</b><br>Timnah was a town located in the territory allotted to the tribe of Dan, near the border of Philistine territory. The Philistines were a significant presence in the region and often in conflict with the Israelites. Samson's interest in a Philistine woman is notable, as it foreshadows the tension between his divine calling as an Israelite judge and his personal desires. The Philistines were known for their advanced culture and military prowess, which often put them at odds with the Israelites. This phrase also sets the stage for the recurring theme of Israel's struggle with foreign influences and the temptation to assimilate.<p><b>Now get her for me as a wife.&#8221;</b><br>Samson's demand for a Philistine wife is contrary to the Mosaic Law, which discouraged intermarriage with foreign nations to prevent idolatry and cultural assimilation (<a href="/deuteronomy/7-3.htm">Deuteronomy 7:3-4</a>). His insistence reflects a pattern of impulsive behavior and disregard for divine commandments, which characterizes much of his life. This request also prefigures the broader narrative of Israel's repeated failure to remain separate from surrounding nations, leading to spiritual and moral decline. Samson's actions can be seen as a type of Christ in the sense that both figures engage with those outside the covenant community, though with vastly different purposes and outcomes.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his extraordinary strength, which was a gift from God.
