These two princes represent the leadership and strength of the Midianite forces. The Midianites were a nomadic people often in conflict with Israel, and their oppression of Israel is a recurring theme in the Book of Judges. The capture of their leaders symbolizes a significant victory for Israel, as it disrupts the command structure of the enemy. This event fulfills God's promise to deliver the Midianites into the hands of Gideon, showcasing divine intervention in Israel's military endeavors.<p><b>and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb.</b><br>The specific locations of their deaths, the rock and the winepress, may have been named after these events, indicating the significance of the victory. The rock and the winepress are symbolic of judgment and deliverance. The rock often represents strength and refuge in biblical literature, while the winepress can symbolize judgment, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>. The execution of these princes at these sites underscores the completeness of Israel's triumph and God's judgment against the oppressors.<p><b>So they pursued the Midianites</b><br>The pursuit of the Midianites demonstrates the thoroughness of Israel's victory. It reflects the relentless nature of God's deliverance, ensuring that the threat is entirely neutralized. This pursuit is reminiscent of other biblical accounts where enemies are chased down to ensure complete victory, such as in the battles led by Joshua. It also highlights the obedience and courage of Gideon's men, who follow through on God's command to defeat the Midianites.<p><b>and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of the Jordan.</b><br>Bringing the heads of the defeated princes to Gideon serves as a tangible proof of victory and a morale booster for the Israelites. It is a common practice in ancient warfare to display the heads of defeated leaders as a sign of triumph and to demoralize the remaining enemy forces. This act also reinforces Gideon's role as the divinely appointed leader and judge of Israel, fulfilling his mission to deliver Israel from Midianite oppression. The crossing of the Jordan signifies a return to the land of promise, echoing the Israelites' earlier crossing into Canaan under Joshua's leadership.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>The judge of Israel chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

Such names are common among nomads. The capture of these two powerful sheykhs was the result of the second part of the battle, and was not accomplished without a terrible slaughter. See <a href="/context/psalms/73-9.htm" title="They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walks through the earth.">Psalm 73:9-12</a>, where the word rendered "houses" of God should be "pastures" of God. It is remarkable that in this passage there seems to be almost an identification of the victories of Barak and Gideon, as though they were the result of one great combined movement. In the phrase "became as the dung of the earth" we see that tradition preserved a memory of the fertilisation of the ground by the dead bodies (see Note on <a href="/judges/4-16.htm" title="But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, to Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell on the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.">Judges 4:16</a>; <a href="/judges/5-21.htm" title="The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon.

The brief narrative of Judges perhaps hardly enables us to realise the three acts of this great tragedy of Midianite slaughter--at Gilboa, the Fords, and Karkor.<p><span class= "bld">Upon the rock Oreb.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">at the raven's rock. </span>Only again mentioned in <a href="/isaiah/10-26.htm" title="And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a whip for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was on the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.">Isaiah 10:26</a> : "according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb." Reland identifies it with Orbo, near Bethshean. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Oreb,</span> a raven, and <span class="cmt_word">Zeeb,</span> a wolf. The rock known afterwards as the <span class="accented">rock of Oreb</span> (<a href="/isaiah/10-26.htm">Isaiah 10:26</a>), and the wine-press (see <a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11</a>) known as the <span class="accented">wine-press of Zeeb</span>, were so called from being the places where these two princes were taken and slain by the Eph-raimites. In like manner the <span class="accented">well of Harod</span> is called by the name it afterwards received (ver. 1), and the <span class="accented">palm tree of Deborah</span> in like manner (<a href="/judges/2-5.htm">Judges 2:5</a>), and <span class="accented">Lehi</span> (<a href="/judges/15-9.htm">Judges 15:9</a>). These are valuable indications (to which many more might be added) of a living tradition older than the written history. The capture of Oreb and Zeeb is celebrated in <a href="/psalms/83-11.htm">Psalm 83:11</a> and <a href="/isaiah/10-26.htm">Isaiah 10:26</a>. On the other side Jordan, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the east side of the river, which Gideon had now crossed, as is related in <a href="/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4</a>. The narrative runs on here to complete the history of the doings of the men of Ephraim, and goes back at <a href="/judges/8-4.htm">Judges 8:4</a> to take up the thread of the history of Gideon (see <a href="/judges/2-1.htm">Judges 2:1-6</a>, note). <p> <p> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="versiontext"><a href="/commentaries/judges/7-25.htm">Parallel Commentaries ...</a></span><span class="p"><br /><br /><br /></span><a name="lexicon" id="lexicon"></a><div class="vheading">Hebrew</div><span class="word">They also captured</span><br /><span class="heb">&#1493;&#1463;&#1469;&#1497;&#1468;&#1460;&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1468;&#1456;&#1491;&#1441;&#1493;&#1468;</span> <span class="translit">(way&#183;yil&#183;k&#601;&#183;&#7695;&#363;)</span><br /><span class="parse">Conjunctive waw &#124;
