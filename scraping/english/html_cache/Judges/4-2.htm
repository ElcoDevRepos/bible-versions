The concept of the LORD "selling" His people suggests a relinquishing of protection, allowing them to fall under foreign oppression as a consequence of their sin. This is a recurring theme in the Book of Judges, where Israel's cycle of sin leads to subjugation by surrounding nations. Jabin, the king of Canaan, represents a significant threat, as Canaanites were long-standing adversaries of Israel. Historically, Jabin is a dynastic title, and this Jabin is likely a successor to the Jabin defeated by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/11.htm">Joshua 11:1-11</a>). This reflects the persistent struggle between Israel and the Canaanites, emphasizing the consequences of Israel's failure to fully obey God's command to drive out the inhabitants of the land.<p><b>who reigned in Hazor</b><br>Hazor was a major Canaanite city, strategically located in northern Israel. Archaeological evidence supports its prominence during the Late Bronze Age, aligning with biblical accounts of its significance. Hazor's ruins reveal a city of considerable size and fortification, underscoring its role as a center of power. The mention of Hazor highlights the formidable nature of Israel's oppressors, as it was a well-fortified city with a history of resistance against Israelite conquest. The city's destruction by Joshua (<a href="/joshua/11-10.htm">Joshua 11:10-13</a>) and its reestablishment by Jabin's dynasty illustrate the cyclical nature of Israel's struggles and the enduring influence of Canaanite culture and religion.<p><b>The commander of his forces was Sisera</b><br>Sisera is introduced as the military leader under Jabin, indicating a well-organized and formidable military presence. His role as commander suggests a structured and powerful army, which posed a significant threat to the Israelites. Sisera's mention sets the stage for the subsequent narrative, where his defeat becomes a pivotal moment in Israel's deliverance. The presence of a named commander highlights the personal nature of the conflict and foreshadows the dramatic encounter with Deborah and Barak. Sisera's eventual downfall serves as a testament to God's sovereignty and ability to deliver His people through unexpected means.<p><b>who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim</b><br>Harosheth-hagoyim, meaning "woodland of the nations," is identified as Sisera's base of operations. Its location is debated, but it is generally believed to be in the region of the Jezreel Valley, a strategic area for military campaigns. The name suggests a place of mixed populations, possibly indicating a hub of Canaanite and other non-Israelite influences. This setting underscores the cultural and religious challenges faced by Israel, as they were surrounded by diverse and often hostile peoples. The mention of Harosheth-hagoyim emphasizes the entrenched nature of Canaanite power and the complexity of Israel's struggle for faithfulness amidst external pressures.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The sovereign God of Israel, who allows His people to face consequences for their disobedience.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/j/jabin,_king_of_canaan.htm">Jabin, King of Canaan</a></b><br>A Canaanite king who ruled in Hazor, representing the oppressive force against Israel.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/h/hazor.htm">Hazor</a></b><br>A significant Canaanite city, known for its strength and strategic importance.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/s/sisera.htm">Sisera</a></b><br>The commander of Jabin's army, known for his military prowess and oppression of Israel.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/h/harosheth-hagoyim.htm">Harosheth-hagoyim</a></b><br>The location where Sisera resided, possibly a military stronghold or administrative center.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/c/consequences_of_disobedience.htm">Consequences of Disobedience</a></b><br>Just as Israel faced oppression due to their disobedience, we must recognize that turning away from God can lead to spiritual and practical consequences in our lives.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/g/god's_sovereignty.htm">God's Sovereignty</a></b><br>Even when Israel was oppressed, God remained in control.

Every detail&#8212;the divine &#8220;sale,&#8221; Jabin&#8217;s authority, Hazor&#8217;s revival, Sisera&#8217;s might, and his strategic headquarters&#8212;highlights both the seriousness of Israel&#8217;s sin and the stage God sets for miraculous deliverance through Deborah and Barak.

This seems to be the reason why Josephus, in his account of the earlier event (<span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 1, ? 18), does not mention either Jabin or Hazor, though strangely enough he says, in both instances, with his usual tendency to exaggeration, that the Canaanites had 300,000 foot, 10,000 horse, and 3,000 chariots. It is again a curious, though it may be an unimportant circumstance, that in <a href="/1_samuel/12-9.htm" title="And when they forgot the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.">1Samuel 12:9</a> the prophet mentions Sisera <span class= "ital">before </span>Eglon. Of course, if the received view of the chronology be correct, we must make the not impossible supposition, that in the century and a half which is supposed to have elapsed since the death of Joshua, Hazor had risen from its obliteration and its ashes (<a href="/joshua/11-11.htm" title="And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.">Joshua 11:11</a>; Jos., <span class= "ital">Antt. v.</span> 5, ? 4), under a new Canaanite settlement, governed by a king who adopted the old dynastic name. If, on the other hand, there are chronological indications that the whole period of the Judges must be greatly shortened, we may perhaps suppose that the armies of Joshua and Barak combined the full strength of the central and northern tribes in an attack from different directions, which ended in a common victory. In that case, the different tribal records can only have dwelt on that part of the victory in which they were themselves concerned. It is remarkable that even so conservative a critic as Bishop Wordsworth holds "that some of the judges of Israel were only judges of portions of Canaan, and that the years run parallel to those of other judges in other districts of the same country." If there are difficulties in whatever scheme of chronology we adopt, we must remember the antiquity and the fragmentary nature of the records, which were written with other and far higher views than that of furnishing us with an elaborate consecutive history. . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sold them</span>. See <a href="/judges/2-14.htm">Judges 2:14</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">Jabin king of Hazor</span>. The exact site of <span class="accented">Hazor</span> has not been identified with certainty, but it is conjectured by Robinson, with great probability, to have stood on the Tell now called <span class="accented">Khuraibeh</span>, overlooking the waters of Merom (now called Lake Huleh), where are remains of a sepulchre, Cyclopean walls, and other buildings. In <a href="/joshua/11-1.htm">Joshua 11:1-14</a> we read of the total destruction by fire of Hazor, and of the slaughter of Jabin, the king thereof, with all the inhabitants of the city, and of the slaughter of all the confederate kings, and the capture of their cities; Hazor, however, "the head of all those kingdoms," being the only one which was "burnt with fire." It is a little surprising, therefore, to read here of another Jabin reigning in Hazor, with confederate kings under him (<a href="/judges/5-19.htm">Judges 5:19</a>), having, like his predecessor, a vast number of chariots (cf. <a href="/judges/4-3.htm">Judges 4:3, 13</a> with <a href="/joshua/11-4.htm">Joshua 11:4, 9</a>), and attacking Israel at the head of a great force (cf. <a href="/judges/4-7.htm">Judges 4:7, 13, 16</a> with <a href="/joshua/11-4.htm">Joshua 11:4</a>). It is impossible not to suspect that these are two accounts of the same event. If, however, the two events are distinct, we must suppose that the Canaanite kingdoms had been revived under a descendant of the former king, that Hazor had been rebuilt, and that Jabin was the hereditary name of its king. <span class="cmt_word">Gentiles</span>, or <span class="accented">nations</span>, or <span class="accented">Goim</span>, as <a href="/joshua/12-23.htm">Joshua 12:23</a>, and <a href="/genesis/14-1.htm">Genesis 14:1</a>.
