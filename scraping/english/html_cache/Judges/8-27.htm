In biblical terms, an ephod is a priestly garment, often associated with the high priest (<a href="/exodus/28-6.htm">Exodus 28:6-14</a>). Gideon's creation of an ephod suggests a desire to establish a religious symbol or center, possibly to consolidate spiritual authority. This act reflects a deviation from the prescribed worship practices centered around the Tabernacle.<p><b>which he placed in Ophrah, his hometown</b><br>Ophrah, located in the territory of Manasseh, was Gideon's hometown. By placing the ephod there, Gideon may have intended to make Ophrah a religious center, drawing people away from the central worship site in Shiloh. This act could be seen as an attempt to elevate his family's status and influence within Israel, contrary to the centralized worship God had commanded.<p><b>But soon all Israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there</b><br>The phrase "prostituted themselves" is a metaphor for idolatry, indicating that the Israelites turned away from God to worship the ephod. This reflects a recurring theme in Judges, where Israel repeatedly falls into idolatry (<a href="/judges/2-17.htm">Judges 2:17</a>). The ephod, intended as a symbol of victory or divine favor, became an object of false worship, leading the people into spiritual adultery.<p><b>and it became a snare to Gideon and his household</b><br>The ephod, rather than being a blessing, became a "snare," or a trap, leading to spiritual downfall. This highlights the danger of creating objects or symbols that can become idols, drawing people away from true worship of God. For Gideon and his family, the ephod's presence led to unintended consequences, illustrating the principle that even well-intentioned actions can lead to sin if they deviate from God's commands. This serves as a warning against the subtlety of idolatry and the importance of adhering to God's instructions.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel who led the Israelites to victory over the Midianites.

It was a sleeveless coat of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen, with two ouches of onyx on the shoulders, bound by a rich girdle. Over this was worn the splendid jewelled breastplate, the <span class= "ital">choshen, </span>with the Urim and Thummim. This ephod, with its "oracular gems," was by far the most splendid and sacred adjunct of worship which the Israelites possessed, and hence was regarded with extreme reverence (<a href="/1_samuel/21-9.htm" title="And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you slew in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if you will take that, take it: for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it me.">1Samuel 21:9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/23-9.htm" title="And David knew that Saul secretly practiced mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod.">1Samuel 23:9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-7.htm" title="And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray you, bring me here the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither the ephod to David.">1Samuel 30:7</a>), and it seems clear that Gideon's object was to provide a counter-attraction to it in an ephod of equally precious materials. It is a mistake to suppose (as Gesenius and others do, following the Peshito and Arabic versions) that <span class= "ital">ephod </span>here means an idol or some unauthorised symbol of Jehovah, like the later "calves." Ewald, too (<span class= "ital">Alterthmer, </span>p. 232), assumes that the <span class= "ital">"</span>ephod" was really "a gilded household idol." But we may hope that Gideon, though guilty of a great sin, had not sunk quite so low as Jeroboam did. On the other hand, we cannot believe, with the Rabbis, that his ephod was only intended as a memorial of his victory.<p><span class= "bld">Thereof.</span>--This does not necessarily imply that he devoted the <span class= "ital">whole </span>of his mass of gold to this object. In <a href="/hosea/2-13.htm" title="And I will visit on her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgot me, said the LORD.">Hosea 2:13</a>, "decking herself with earrings" is one of the signs of the "days of Baalim." Hence, perhaps, an earring is called in Chaldee <span class= "ital">kaddisha.</span> . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gideon made an ephod thereof</span>. There is great difference of opinion among commentators as to the significance of this statement. The ephod (<a href="/exodus/28-4.htm">Exodus 28:4, 6-30</a>) was that part of the high priest's dress (<a href="/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/21-9.htm">1 Samuel 21:9</a>) which covered the breast in front, and the upper part of the back behind, the two parts being clasped together by two large onyx stones, one on each shoulder, and kept together by the curious girdle, just above which was fastened the breastplate of judgment. In a modified form the "linen ephod" was worn by all priests; but it was especially worn by the high priest when he inquired of God by Urim and Thummim (<a href="/1_samuel/23-9.htm">1 Samuel 23:9</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/30-7.htm">1 Samuel 30:7</a>). Hence it was also connected with idolatrous worship, as we see by ch. Judges 17:5, and <a href="/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>, being probably used for purposes of divination, as we know that idolatrous kings of Israel, instead of inquiring of the Lord, inquired of the false gods (<a href="/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2, 3</a>). What, then, was Gideon's purpose in making this costly ephod? We may infer from his proved piety that at all events his intention was to do honour to the Lord, who had given him the victory. Then, as he was now at the head of the State, though he had declined the regal office, and as it was the special prerogative of the head of the State to "inquire of the Lord" (<a href="/numbers/27-21.htm">Numbers 27:21</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/22-13.htm">1 Samuel 22:13</a>; <a href="/1_samuel/23-2.htm">1 Samuel 23:2, 4</a>, etc.; 1 Samuel 28:6, etc.), he may have thought it his right, as well as a matter of great importance to the people, that he should have the means ready at hand of inquiring of God. His relations with the great tribe of Ephraim may have made it inconvenient to go to Shiloh to consult the high priest there, and therefore he would have the ephod at his own city of Ophrah, just as Jephthah made Mizpeh his religious centre (ch. Judges 11:11). Whether he sent for the high priest to come to Ophrah, or whether he made use of the ministry of some other priest, we have no means of deciding. The people, however, always prone to idolatry, made an idol of the ephod, and Gideon, either because it was a source of gain or of dignity to his house, or thinking it was a means of keeping the people from Baal-worship (ver. 33), seems to have connived at it.
