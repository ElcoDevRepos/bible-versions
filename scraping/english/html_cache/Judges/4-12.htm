His name is associated with oppression and military might. The fact that he was informed suggests a network of intelligence and communication within the Canaanite forces. This reflects the organized nature of their military operations, which were a significant threat to the Israelites.<p><b>that Barak son of Abinoam</b><br>Barak, whose name means "lightning," was chosen by God through the prophetess Deborah to lead the Israelites against the Canaanites. His lineage, being the son of Abinoam, places him from the tribe of Naphtali, which is significant as it highlights the tribal dynamics and the role of different tribes in the deliverance of Israel. Barak's hesitance to go into battle without Deborah (<a href="/judges/4-8.htm">Judges 4:8</a>) shows his reliance on God's guidance through her.<p><b>had gone up Mount Tabor</b><br>Mount Tabor is a prominent hill in the Jezreel Valley, strategically significant due to its elevation and location. It served as a rallying point for Barak's forces, providing a tactical advantage. The choice of Mount Tabor is symbolic of God's providence, as it was a place where God would demonstrate His power over the Canaanite forces. This location is also significant in biblical history, later associated with the Transfiguration of Jesus (<a href="/matthew/17.htm">Matthew 17:1-9</a>), symbolizing divine revelation and victory.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/sisera.htm">Sisera</a></b><br>The commander of the Canaanite army under King Jabin of Hazor.

The same sovereignty is seen when Pharaoh learns of Israel&#8217;s route (<a href="/exodus/14-5.htm">Exodus 14:5-9</a>) and when news reaches Nebuchadnezzar about the three Hebrews (<a href="/daniel/3-9.htm">Daniel 3:9-12</a>).<p>&#8226; The verse underscores that God orchestrates even the enemy&#8217;s knowledge. <a href="/psalms/33-10.htm">Psalm 33:10-11</a> reminds us, &#8220;The LORD frustrates the plans of the nations&#8230; the plans of His heart stand firm forever.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>that Barak son of Abinoam</b><p>&#8226; Barak&#8217;s name is spoken in Sisera&#8217;s court, marking him as the instrument God chose through Deborah (<a href="/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6</a>). Though earlier hesitant (<a href="/judges/4-8.htm">Judges 4:8-9</a>), he is now obedient and moving in faith.<p>&#8226; God often highlights His servants to their adversaries&#8212;think of David&#8217;s reputation before Goliath (<a href="/1_samuel/17-23.htm">1 Samuel 17:23-24</a>) or Elijah before Ahab (<a href="/1_kings/18-17.htm">1 Kings 18:17-18</a>).<p>&#8226; Barak later joins the <a href="/bsb/hebrews/11.htm">Hebrews 11</a> &#8220;faith roll&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-32.htm">Hebrews 11:32</a>), showing that imperfect courage placed in God&#8217;s hands becomes victorious.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>had gone up Mount Tabor</b><p>&#8226; Mount Tabor rises abruptly from the Jezreel Valley, a natural fortress. Barak positions 10,000 men there (<a href="/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6, 10</a>), gaining elevation and surprise.<p>&#8226; Yet the mountain is more than high ground; it is bait. From Tabor, God will &#8220;lure Sisera&#8221; into the flood-prone Kishon Valley where 900 iron chariots become useless (<a href="/judges/4-13.htm">Judges 4:13-15</a>). This echoes God&#8217;s earlier tactic at the Red Sea: place Israel where only divine intervention can save (<a href="/exodus/14-2.htm">Exodus 14:2-4, 16</a>).<p>&#8226; The move up Tabor signals faith in advance deliverance&#8212;much like Jonathan&#8217;s ascent against the Philistines (<a href="/1_samuel/14-6.htm">1 Samuel 14:6-13</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p><a href="/judges/4-12.htm">Judges 4:12</a> records the precise moment God allows critical information to reach Sisera: &#8220;Barak&#8230; had gone up Mount Tabor.&#8221; Each phrase shows the LORD&#8217;s hand&#8212;governing what the enemy hears, elevating a willing but flawed leader, and positioning His people for a victory that only He could design.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/4.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(12) <span class= "bld">They shewed Sisera.</span>--The previous verse has been introduced by way of anticipation, that the reader--who has last heard of the Kenites in the south of Judah (<a href="/judges/1-16.htm" title="And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelled among the people.">Judges 1:16</a>)--may not be surprised at <a href="/judges/4-17.htm" title="However, Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.">Judges 4:17</a> to find them in Naphtali.
