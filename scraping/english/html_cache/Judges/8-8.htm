It is significant in biblical history as the place where Jacob wrestled with God and saw Him face to face (<a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>). This encounter marked a pivotal moment in Jacob's life, symbolizing transformation and divine blessing. Gideon's journey to Penuel reflects a continuation of his pursuit of the Midianite kings, emphasizing the relentless nature of his mission. The geographical ascent to Penuel indicates a movement towards a place of historical and spiritual significance, suggesting a parallel between Gideon's struggle and Jacob's encounter with God.<p><b>and asked the same from them</b><br>Gideon's request from the men of Penuel mirrors his earlier request to the men of Succoth for provisions for his weary troops. This repetition underscores the dire need for support in his campaign against the Midianites. The request highlights the communal responsibility and the expectation of mutual aid among the tribes of Israel during times of conflict. It also reflects the broader theme of unity and cooperation that is often challenged in the narrative of the Judges, where tribal divisions and local allegiances frequently hinder collective action.<p><b>but the men of Penuel gave the same response as the men of Succoth</b><br>The refusal of the men of Penuel to assist Gideon parallels the response of the men of Succoth, indicating a widespread reluctance or fear among the Israelites to support Gideon against the Midianites. This response can be seen as a lack of faith or trust in Gideon's leadership and God's deliverance, echoing the recurring theme of Israel's spiritual and moral decline during the period of the Judges. The refusal also sets the stage for Gideon's subsequent actions against these towns, highlighting the consequences of failing to support God's chosen deliverer. This narrative tension reflects the broader biblical theme of obedience and the cost of disobedience, as well as the importance of faith in God's promises and leaders.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>The central figure in this passage, Gideon is a judge of Israel who is leading a campaign against the Midianites.
