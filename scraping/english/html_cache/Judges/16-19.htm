The act of lulling Samson to sleep signifies a betrayal of trust, as Samson is vulnerable and unaware of the impending danger. This scene is reminiscent of other biblical narratives where trust is broken, such as Judas betraying Jesus with a kiss (<a href="/matthew/26-48.htm">Matthew 26:48-49</a>). The imagery of sleep can also symbolize spiritual complacency or blindness, as seen in <a href="/ephesians/5-14.htm">Ephesians 5:14</a>, which calls believers to awaken from spiritual slumber.<p><b>she called a man to shave off the seven braids of his head</b><br>The act of shaving Samson's head is significant because it breaks his Nazirite vow, which included not cutting his hair (<a href="/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5</a>). The seven braids symbolize completeness and divine strength, as the number seven often represents perfection or completion in the Bible (<a href="/genesis/2-2.htm">Genesis 2:2-3</a>). The involvement of another man in this act underscores the betrayal and the communal aspect of Samson's downfall, as it wasn't just Delilah but others who participated in his capture.<p><b>In this way she began to subdue him</b><br>Delilah's actions lead to the subjugation of Samson, a judge of Israel who was meant to deliver his people from the Philistines. This subduing is both physical and spiritual, as Samson's strength was a gift from God, contingent upon his faithfulness to his Nazirite vow. The narrative reflects the broader theme of Israel's cyclical sin and subjugation in the Book of Judges, where the Israelites repeatedly fall into idolatry and are oppressed by their enemies (<a href="/judges/2-11.htm">Judges 2:11-19</a>).<p><b>and his strength left him</b><br>Samson's loss of strength signifies the departure of the Lord's presence and favor, as his physical power was directly linked to his spiritual commitment. This moment parallels the departure of God's glory from the temple in <a href="/ezekiel/10.htm">Ezekiel 10</a>, symbolizing judgment and the consequences of disobedience. Samson's plight foreshadows the ultimate deliverance through Christ, who, unlike Samson, remained faithful and obedient, even unto death, to secure victory over sin and death for humanity (<a href="/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/s/samson.htm">Samson</a></b><br>A judge of Israel known for his supernatural strength, which was a gift from God tied to his Nazirite vow, including not cutting his hair.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/d/delilah.htm">Delilah</a></b><br>A Philistine woman who was used by the Philistine rulers to discover the secret of Samson's strength.

Delilah&#8217;s lap, a conspirator&#8217;s razor, and Samson&#8217;s shaved locks expose a heart already surrendered to sin. When the outward sign of his vow falls, the inward reality collapses too, and the strength supplied by God departs. The verse stands as a cautionary snapshot: spiritual drowsiness invites betrayal, small concessions lead to great losses, and true strength rests not in human muscle but in faithful obedience to the LORD who empowers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/16.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(19) <span class= "bld">Made him sleep upon her knees.</span>--As his locks could hardly be shaved off without awaking him from any ordinary sleep, the expression looks as if she had administered some "drowsy syrup," like mandragora.<p><span class= "bld">She called for a man.</span>--Probably the concealed spy (<a href="/judges/16-9.htm" title="Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the chamber.

"Laying down his head amongst the strumpet flatteries . . . while he sleeps and thinks no harm, they, wickedly shaving off all those bright and weighty tresses . . . which were his ornament and his strength, deliver him over . . ." (Milton, <span class= "ital">Reason of Church Government</span>)<span class= "ital">. </span>Whether the pagan legends of the lock of Nisus or Pterolaus were distant echoes of this incident we cannot say.

We cannot tell the exact meaning of the clause, since it is only in the next verse that Samson is said to awake.
