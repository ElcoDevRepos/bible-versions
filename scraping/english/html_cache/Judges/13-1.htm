The Israelites repeatedly turned away from God, engaging in idolatry and adopting the sinful practices of surrounding nations. This cycle of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance is a central motif in Judges. The phrase "in the sight of the LORD" underscores that their actions were not hidden from God, emphasizing His omniscience and the moral accountability of His people.<p><b>so He delivered them into the hand of the Philistines</b><br>The Philistines were a significant threat to Israel during this period, known for their advanced military technology, including iron weaponry. This phrase reflects God's sovereignty and justice, as He allows the Israelites to face the consequences of their disobedience by being oppressed by their enemies. The Philistines were a seafaring people who settled along the coastal regions of Canaan, and their conflicts with Israel are a recurring theme in the biblical narrative, notably in the stories of Samson and later David.<p><b>for forty years</b><br>The number forty is significant in biblical literature, often symbolizing a period of testing, trial, or judgment. Examples include the forty days and nights of rain during the flood, the forty years the Israelites wandered in the wilderness, and Jesus' forty days of fasting in the desert. Here, the forty years of Philistine oppression serve as a period of chastisement for Israel's unfaithfulness, intended to bring them to repentance and reliance on God. This duration also sets the stage for the rise of Samson, who would begin to deliver Israel from Philistine domination.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_israelites.htm">The Israelites</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, who repeatedly fall into cycles of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance throughout the Book of Judges.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who is just and righteous, allowing consequences for sin but also providing deliverance.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_philistines.htm">The Philistines</a></b><br>A powerful and oppressive enemy of Israel, often used by God as instruments of judgment against His people.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/f/forty_years.htm">Forty Years</a></b><br>A significant period in biblical terms, often associated with testing, judgment, and preparation.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/t/the_cycle_of_sin_and_deliverance.htm">The Cycle of Sin and Deliverance</a></b><br>Recognize the repetitive nature of sin in our lives and the need for genuine repentance.

But the end of the forty years probably coincided with the judgeship of Samuel; for there was no complete deliverance in the time of Samson, only occasional cheeks to the Philistine domination (see ver. 5). It was not till the days of Samuel that the Philistines were really smitten (see <a href="/1_samuel/7-3.htm">1 Samuel 7:3-14</a>).
