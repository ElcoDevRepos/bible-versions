The elders' refusal to assist him was seen as a lack of faith and support for God's deliverance through Gideon. In ancient Israel, elders held significant authority and were responsible for the welfare and decisions of their community. Their actions reflected the collective stance of the city, making them accountable for the refusal to support Gideon.<p><b>and using the thorns and briers of the wilderness</b><br>The wilderness surrounding Succoth was known for its harsh terrain, including thorns and briers. These natural elements were often used metaphorically in Scripture to represent pain, suffering, and divine judgment (e.g., <a href="/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>, <a href="/isaiah/10-17.htm">Isaiah 10:17</a>). Gideon's choice of punishment was both practical and symbolic, serving as a physical reminder of the consequences of opposing God's chosen deliverer.<p><b>he disciplined the men of Succoth</b><br>The term "disciplined" here implies a corrective action intended to teach a lesson. Gideon's actions were not merely punitive but aimed at restoring the proper fear and reverence for God among the people of Succoth. This discipline can be seen as a reflection of God's justice, where disobedience and lack of faith are met with correction. The incident underscores the importance of supporting God's work and leaders, as seen in other biblical narratives where God disciplines His people to bring them back to righteousness (e.g., <a href="/hebrews/12-6.htm">Hebrews 12:6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel, chosen by God to deliver the Israelites from the oppression of the Midianites.

Their position gave them influence, but also responsibility (<a href="/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">Deuteronomy 21:19</a>; <a href="/ruth/4-2.htm">Ruth 4:2</a>).<p>&#8226; By seizing these elders first, Gideon shows that leadership bears the weight of communal sin (<a href="/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a>; <a href="/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>and using the thorns and briers of the wilderness</b><p>&#8226; Gideon chooses a punishment drawn from the local terrain&#8212;sharp desert thorns and briers.

By seizing the elders, using natural thorns as instruments, and carrying out the promised correction, Gideon upholds the principle that those who oppose God&#8217;s work face tangible consequences. The verse reminds us that leadership carries accountability, that disobedience invites painful correction, and that God&#8217;s justice&#8212;though sometimes sharp&#8212;is always purposeful and redemptive.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/8.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(16) <span class= "bld">He taught.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">made to know </span>(<a href="/proverbs/10-9.htm" title="He that walks uprightly walks surely: but he that perverts his ways shall be known.">Proverbs 10:9</a>); but <span class= "greekheb">??</span> may be a misreading for <span class= "greekheb">???</span> "he threshed," as in <a href="/judges/6-7.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried to the LORD because of the Midianites,">Judges 6:7</a>.
