This detail highlights Jael's resourcefulness and courage. The tent peg symbolizes an unexpected tool of deliverance, reminiscent of how God often uses the humble and unexpected to achieve His purposes, as seen in <a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>.<p><b>her right hand for the workman&#8217;s hammer</b><br>The right hand is often associated with strength and skill in biblical literature. The use of a workman&#8217;s hammer, a common tool, emphasizes Jael's practical approach to fulfilling God's plan. This act can be seen as a parallel to David using a sling to defeat Goliath, where God uses ordinary means to accomplish extraordinary victories (<a href="/1_samuel/17-49.htm">1 Samuel 17:49</a>).<p><b>She struck Sisera and crushed his skull</b><br>This phrase underscores the decisive and lethal action taken by Jael. Crushing the skull is a vivid depiction of total defeat, echoing the prophecy in <a href="/genesis/3-15.htm">Genesis 3:15</a> about the seed of the woman crushing the serpent's head, symbolizing ultimate victory over evil. Jael's act is a fulfillment of Deborah's prophecy in <a href="/judges/4-9.htm">Judges 4:9</a> that a woman would defeat Sisera.<p><b>she shattered and pierced his temple</b><br>The temple is a vulnerable part of the human body, and this detail highlights the precision and effectiveness of Jael's action. The shattering and piercing signify a complete and irreversible defeat. This act of deliverance is a type of Christ's ultimate victory over sin and death, where He decisively defeats the powers of darkness (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jael.htm">Jael</a></b><br>The wife of Heber the Kenite, who played a crucial role in the defeat of Sisera, the commander of the Canaanite army.

God again shows He is not limited by conventional resources&#8212;compare Shamgar&#8217;s oxgoad (<a href="/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>) or Samson&#8217;s donkey jawbone (<a href="/judges/15-15.htm">Judges 15:15</a>).<p>&#8226; By gripping the hammer, Jael joins the ranks of those who partner with God in judgment (<a href="/jeremiah/51-20.htm">Jeremiah 51:20</a>).

Jael&#8217;s blow is therefore both literal and theological: God is executing justice through her hand.<p>&#8226; Sisera&#8217;s skull represents Canaanite oppression over Israel (<a href="/judges/4-3.htm">Judges 4:3</a>). By crushing it, the yoke over God&#8217;s people is shattered (<a href="/isaiah/10-27.htm">Isaiah 10:27</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>She shattered and pierced his temple</b><p>&#8226; The double description&#8212;&#8220;shattered&#8221; and &#8220;pierced&#8221;&#8212;emphasizes totality.

Similar dual verbs appear in <a href="/habakkuk/3-13.htm">Habakkuk 3:13-14</a> when the Lord crushes and pierces the leader of wickedness.<p>&#8226; Striking the temple is a recurring biblical motif for decisive victory, as when David&#8217;s stone sank into Goliath&#8217;s forehead (<a href="/1_samuel/17-49.htm">1 Samuel 17:49</a>). God&#8217;s champions strike at the vulnerable point to display His supremacy.<p>&#8226; The imagery also foreshadows the ultimate triumph of Christ over all powers (<a href="/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>).

With common household tools, she acts decisively, fulfilling prophecy and illustrating the age-old promise that the seed of the woman will crush the serpent&#8217;s head. Each clause in the verse paints a step in that victory: the ready hand, the chosen instrument, the crushing blow, and the complete defeat of the oppressor. The passage assures believers that God can use willing servants and ordinary means to accomplish extraordinary deliverance, and that no enemy can stand when He moves in judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/5.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Nail. . . . workmen's hammer.</span>--See on <a href="/judges/4-21.htm" title="Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.">Judges 4:21</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Smote.</span>--<span class= "ital">Hammered.</span><p><span class= "bld">Smote off his head.</span>--Rather, <span class= "ital">shattered his head. </span>The Hebrew is onomatopoetic, i.e., the sound echoes the sense, recalling the smashing and crashing blows of the hammer. The repetition of these terrible alliterative verbs, "hammered," "shattered," "battered," "transfixed," the signs that the imagination of the prophetess seems to revel in the description, have been ascribed to "the delight of a satisfied thirst for revenge." This is hardly a right view of her character. It must be remembered that the feelings of modern times are far more refined and complex than those of previous ages. The sense of tenderness, the quickness of compassion, the value set on human life, are immeasurably increased, and with them the power of realising by universal sympathy the position and sufferings of others. In ancient days no close moral analysis was applied to acts of which the general tendency was approved as right and beneficial. Caesar was not inherently a cruel man, yet he records without a shudder the massacre and misery of multitudes of Gaulish men, women, and children at Alesia; and he suffered the brave Vercingetorix to be led away from his triumph, to be strangled in the Tullianum, without the slightest qualm of pity. Deborah, in the spirit of her day, seems to regard with pitiless exultation the wild throes of Sisera's death, and the agonising frustration of his mother's hopes. only because she views those events in the single aspect of the deliverance of Israel. The tenderness of the Mother of Israel was absorbed in the thought of her own long-afflicted, but now rescued, race. "She was a mother in Israel, and with the vehemency of a mother's and a patriot's <span class= "ital">love, </span>she had shot the light of love from her eyes, and poured the blessings of love from her lips on the people that had jeopardised their lives unto the death against the oppressors, and the bitterness awakened and borne aloft by the same love she precipitates in curses on the selfish and cowardly recreants who came not to the help of the Lord against the unjust" (Coleridge); and we may add, on all connected with the cruel oppressor.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">With the hammer</span>.
