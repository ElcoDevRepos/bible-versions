The "angel of the LORD" is a significant figure in the Old Testament, often considered a theophany, or a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ. This encounter is similar to other biblical instances where the angel of the LORD appears, such as to Hagar in <a href="/genesis/16.htm">Genesis 16</a> and to Gideon in <a href="/judges/6.htm">Judges 6</a>. The presence of the angel signifies a direct communication from God, emphasizing the importance of the message being delivered.<p><b>&#8220;What is your name,</b><br>In ancient Near Eastern culture, knowing someone's name was associated with understanding their character or essence. Manoah's request for the angel's name reflects a desire to understand more about the divine messenger and the authority behind the message. This mirrors Jacob's encounter with God in <a href="/genesis/32-29.htm">Genesis 32:29</a>, where he also asks for a name but receives no direct answer, highlighting the mystery and transcendence of God.<p><b>so that we may honor you</b><br>Manoah's intention to honor the angel indicates a recognition of the divine nature of the visitor. In biblical times, honoring a messenger was a way to show respect and gratitude for the message delivered. This reflects the cultural practice of offering hospitality and reverence to those who bring significant news or blessings, as seen in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a> when Abraham entertains three visitors.<p><b>when your word comes to pass?&#8221;</b><br>Manoah expresses faith in the fulfillment of the angel's prophecy. This statement shows his belief in the reliability and truth of God's promises. The phrase "when your word comes to pass" echoes the biblical theme of God's faithfulness, as seen in <a href="/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>, where God's word is described as never returning void but accomplishing its purpose. This also foreshadows the birth of Samson, a deliverer for Israel, and connects to the broader narrative of God's deliverance throughout Scripture.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manoah.htm">Manoah</a></b><br>A man from the tribe of Dan, Manoah is the father of Samson.

Realizing the gravity of the promise, he speaks directly to &#8220;the angel of the LORD,&#8221; a figure who earlier accepted worship and foretold births (<a href="/genesis/16-7.htm">Genesis 16:7-13</a>; <a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2-6</a>). That Manoah talks to Him as to God shows he recognizes divine authority. The verse begins with &#8220;Then,&#8221; tying his request to the firm belief that the messenger&#8217;s words carry the same weight as God&#8217;s own (<a href="/numbers/22-35.htm">Numbers 22:35</a>; <a href="/judges/6-22.htm">Judges 6:22-24</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>What is your name</b><p>In Scripture, knowing a name means grasping character and mission (<a href="/exodus/3-13.htm">Exodus 3:13-15</a>; <a href="/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>). Manoah seeks more than an introduction; he wants to understand the nature of the One who has spoken. God&#8217;s messengers sometimes reveal their names (<a href="/luke/1-19.htm">Luke 1:19</a>), yet at other times keep silent to emphasize awe and mystery (<a href="/genesis/32-29.htm">Genesis 32:29</a>; <a href="/judges/13-18.htm">Judges 13:18</a>). Manoah&#8217;s question shows healthy curiosity, not skepticism.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>so that we may honor you</b><p>Manoah plans to show gratitude once the promise is fulfilled. To &#8220;honor&#8221; can include:<p>&#8226; Bringing an offering, as Gideon did when the Angel met him (<a href="/judges/6-17.htm">Judges 6:17-20</a>).<p>&#8226; Building an altar to commemorate divine intervention (<a href="/genesis/35-14.htm">Genesis 35:14</a>).<p>&#8226; Publicly acknowledging God&#8217;s work before others (<a href="/psalms/50-23.htm">Psalm 50:23</a>).<p>His intent is worshipful, but verse 16 will redirect that honor fully to the LORD, reminding us that true messengers never accept glory reserved for God (<a href="/revelation/19-10.htm">Revelation 19:10</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>when your word comes to pass?</b><p>Faith shines here. Manoah speaks of the future as certain, echoing Abraham, who &#8220;considered Him faithful who had promised&#8221; (<a href="/hebrews/11-11.htm">Hebrews 11:11</a>). He does not say &#8220;if,&#8221; but &#8220;when,&#8221; standing in contrast to Zacharias&#8217;s doubt centuries later (<a href="/luke/1-18.htm">Luke 1:18-20</a>). Manoah&#8217;s confidence models how believers should treat every word God speaks: as guaranteed (<a href="/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>).<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Manoah&#8217;s request reveals a man who recognizes divine authority, desires deeper revelation of God&#8217;s character, longs to give proper worship, and trusts completely that God&#8217;s promise will be fulfilled. <a href="/judges/13-17.htm">Judges 13:17</a> therefore teaches that honoring God begins with knowing Him, continues in obedient worship, and rests on unshakable faith in the certainty of His word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(17) <span class= "bld">What is thy name?</span>--Comp. <a href="/genesis/32-29.htm" title="And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray you, your name.
