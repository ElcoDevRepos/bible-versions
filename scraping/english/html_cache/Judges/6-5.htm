Historically, they were nomadic people, often moving with their livestock and tents, which is consistent with their lifestyle as described in this passage. This nomadic lifestyle allowed them to be mobile and opportunistic, often raiding settled communities. The presence of livestock and tents suggests a large, organized group capable of sustaining themselves during prolonged campaigns.<p><b>like a great swarm of locusts</b><br>The comparison to locusts is significant in the biblical context, as locusts were known for their destructive power, consuming everything in their path. This imagery conveys the overwhelming number and the devastating impact of the Midianite invasion. In the Bible, locusts are often associated with divine judgment (e.g., <a href="/exodus/10-12.htm">Exodus 10:12-15</a>), highlighting the severity of the situation faced by the Israelites. The metaphor underscores the sense of helplessness and the need for divine intervention.<p><b>They and their camels were innumerable</b><br>The mention of camels is noteworthy, as it indicates the Midianites' advanced capabilities in warfare and trade. Camels were a relatively new addition to military campaigns in this period, providing a strategic advantage due to their speed and endurance. The term "innumerable" emphasizes the vastness of the Midianite forces, creating a sense of intimidation and despair among the Israelites. This overwhelming force serves as a backdrop for God's deliverance through Gideon, highlighting the contrast between human weakness and divine strength.<p><b>and they entered the land to ravage it</b><br>The purpose of the Midianite invasion was not just to conquer but to plunder and destroy. This aligns with the cyclical pattern in the Book of Judges, where Israel's disobedience leads to oppression by foreign powers, followed by cries for deliverance. The term "ravage" indicates the complete devastation of the land, affecting the Israelites' ability to sustain themselves. This destruction sets the stage for God's intervention, as He raises up Gideon to deliver His people, foreshadowing the ultimate deliverance through Jesus Christ, who rescues humanity from spiritual oppression.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/midianites.htm">Midianites</a></b><br>A nomadic people who oppressed Israel during the time of the Judges.
