This situation serves as a divine test for Israel, examining their faithfulness and obedience to God. The concept of testing is a recurring theme in Scripture, seen in passages like <a href="/deuteronomy/8-2.htm">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>, where God tests His people to know what is in their hearts. Theologically, this reflects God's sovereignty and His use of circumstances to refine and purify His people.<p><b>to find out whether they would keep the commandments of the LORD</b><br>The commandments of the LORD refer to the laws given to Israel, encompassing moral, ceremonial, and civil aspects. This phrase underscores the covenant relationship between God and Israel, where obedience is a sign of faithfulness. The testing by these nations is a means to reveal Israel's commitment to God's covenant. This mirrors the broader biblical narrative where obedience to God's commandments is a measure of one's love and devotion to Him, as seen in <a href="/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15</a>.<p><b>which He had given their fathers through Moses</b><br>This phrase highlights the continuity of God's covenantal promises and laws from generation to generation. Moses, as the mediator of the Old Covenant, delivered God's laws to Israel, which are foundational to their identity and relationship with God. The reference to "their fathers" emphasizes the historical and communal aspect of the covenant, reminding Israel of their heritage and the faithfulness required of them. This continuity is fulfilled in the New Covenant through Jesus Christ, who is seen as the greater Moses, bringing a new law written on the hearts of believers (<a href="/hebrews/3-3.htm">Hebrews 3:3-6</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The chosen people of God, descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were given the Promised Land.<br><br>2. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_nations.htm">The Nations</a></b><br>Refers to the Canaanite nations left in the land to test Israel's faithfulness to God's commandments.<br><br>3. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_lord.htm">The LORD (Yahweh)</a></b><br>The covenant God of Israel, who delivered the commandments through Moses.<br><br>4. <b><a href="/topical/m/moses.htm">Moses</a></b><br>The prophet and leader who received the Law from God and delivered it to the Israelites.<br><br>5. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_commandments.htm">The Commandments</a></b><br>The laws and decrees given by God to guide Israel in righteousness and holiness.<div class="vheading2">Teaching Points</div><b><a href="/topical/p/purpose_of_testing.htm">Purpose of Testing</a></b><br>God allows tests to reveal the true nature of our faith and commitment to His commandments.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/f/faithfulness_to_god's_word.htm">Faithfulness to God's Word</a></b><br>The presence of challenges and temptations should drive us to cling more closely to God's Word and His promises.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/l/learning_from_the_past.htm">Learning from the Past</a></b><br>Reflect on the history of Israel to understand the importance of obedience and the consequences of disobedience.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/s/spiritual_vigilance.htm">Spiritual Vigilance</a></b><br>Be aware of the spiritual "nations" or influences in our lives that test our faithfulness to God.<br><br><b><a href="/topical/d/dependence_on_god.htm">Dependence on God</a></b><br>Trials remind us of our need for God's strength and guidance to remain faithful.<div class="vheading2">Bible Study Questions and Answers</div><span class="count">1. </span><a href="/q/What_does_Judges_3_4_mean.htm">What is the meaning of Judges 3:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">2. </span><a href="/q/Judges_3_4_God_s_test_of_Israel_s_faith.htm">How does Judges 3:4 illustrate God's purpose in testing Israel's faithfulness?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">3. </span><a href="/q/Lessons_from_Israel_s_tests_in_Judges.htm">What lessons can we learn from Israel's response to God's tests in Judges?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">4. </span><a href="/q/Judges_3_4_Deut_Obedience_Idolatry.htm">How does Judges 3:4 connect with Deuteronomy's warnings about obedience and idolatry?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">5. </span><a href="/q/How_to_spot_and_resist_faith_challenges.htm">In what ways can we identify and resist modern-day "tests" of faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">6. </span><a href="/q/Applying_Judges_3_4_obedience_daily.htm">How can we apply the principle of obedience from Judges 3:4 in daily life?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">7. </span><a href="/q/Why_did_God_let_nations_test_Israel.htm">Why did God allow the nations to test Israel in Judges 3:4?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">8. </span><a href="/q/Judges_3_4_God_s_purpose_in_testing_faith.htm">What does Judges 3:4 reveal about God's purpose for testing faith?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">9. </span><a href="/q/Judges_3_4_and_divine_testing_link.htm">How does Judges 3:4 align with the concept of divine testing in the Bible?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">10. </span><a href="/top10/lessons_from_judges_3.htm">What are the top 10 Lessons from Judges 3?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">11. </span><a href="/q/main_themes_of_bible's_books.htm">What are the main themes of the Bible's books?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">12. </span><a href="/q/how_does_moses_praise_god's_deliverance.htm">How does Moses praise God for His deliverance?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">13. </span><a href="/q/what_does_an_asherah_pole_represent.htm">What does an Asherah pole represent?</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="count">14. </span><a href="/q/why_does_god_speak_audibly_in_exodus_3_4.htm">In Exodus 3:4, why does God speak audibly only here, and not in a consistent manner throughout the Old Testament?</a><a name="commentary" id="commentary"></a><div class="vheading2">What Does Judges 3:4 Mean</div><b>These nations were left</b><p>The surrounding peoples the LORD chose not to expel all at once (<a href="/judges/2-21.htm">Judges 2:21&#8211;23</a>;
