Her blessing is reminiscent of the praise given to other women in Scripture, such as Mary, the mother of Jesus, who is also called "blessed among women" (<a href="/luke/1-42.htm">Luke 1:42</a>). This parallel highlights the significant role women play in God's redemptive history. Jael's actions are seen as divinely inspired, fulfilling Deborah's prophecy that a woman would claim victory over Sisera (<a href="/judges/4-9.htm">Judges 4:9</a>).<p><b>the wife of Heber the Kenite</b><br>The Kenites were a nomadic tribe with connections to the Israelites through Moses' father-in-law, Jethro (<a href="/exodus/3.htm">Exodus 3:1</a>). Heber, Jael's husband, had separated from the main Kenite group and settled near Kedesh (<a href="/judges/4-11.htm">Judges 4:11</a>). This separation allowed Jael to act independently, aligning with Israel against the Canaanites. The Kenites' metalworking skills may have contributed to their strategic importance, as they were often allied with Israel.<p><b>most blessed of tent-dwelling women</b><br>The reference to "tent-dwelling" emphasizes Jael's nomadic lifestyle, typical of the Kenites. Living in tents signifies a transient, humble existence, yet Jael's actions elevate her status. This phrase underscores the theme that God often uses the humble and unexpected to achieve His purposes, as seen throughout Scripture (<a href="/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27-29</a>). Jael's story is a reminder that God's deliverance can come from the most unlikely sources, and her blessing is a testament to her courage and faithfulness.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/j/jael.htm">Jael</a></b><br>The wife of Heber the Kenite, Jael is celebrated for her decisive action in killing Sisera, the commander of the Canaanite army, thereby delivering Israel from oppression.

The morals of that early age were not sufficiently enlightened to understand that treachery and assassination are <span class= "ital">never </span>justifiable, however good may be the end in view. But, as serious moralists, even in the nineteenth century, have held up to admiration the murder of Marat by Charlotte Corday, and have even given to her the title of "the Angel of Assassination," we can hardly be surprised that Deborah should exult in Jael's heroism, and her choice of the right side, without expressing--perhaps even without the degree of later moral enlightenment which would have led her to feel--any moral reprobation of the means by which the end was accomplished. But to compare this outburst of patriotic approval for such a deed with the salutation of "Blessed art thou among women," addressed by the angel to the blessed Virgin Mary (as is done by some commentators), seems to me a most dangerous way of handling the mere words of Scripture, apart from their context and true significance.<p><span class= "bld">Above women in the tent.</span>--The honour paid to her because of her deed would raise her far above the common mass of ignorant and downtrodden nomad women.
