In the context of Judges, the term "congregation" often denotes a gathering for a significant purpose, such as making a covenant or addressing a national crisis. The unity of the tribes is emphasized here, highlighting the importance of collective action in resolving internal conflicts.<p><b>sent a message of peace</b><br>The act of sending a message of peace indicates a desire for reconciliation and restoration of fellowship. This is significant given the preceding chapters, where the tribe of Benjamin was nearly annihilated due to a civil war sparked by the grievous sin in Gibeah. The message of peace reflects a turning point from judgment to mercy, aligning with biblical themes of forgiveness and restoration found throughout Scripture, such as in <a href="/matthew/5-9.htm">Matthew 5:9</a>, "Blessed are the peacemakers."<p><b>to the Benjamites</b><br>The Benjamites, one of the twelve tribes of Israel, were in a precarious position after the conflict. Historically, the tribe of Benjamin held a strategic location in the central highlands of Canaan, which was significant for trade and military defense. The tribe's near destruction posed a threat to the unity and strength of Israel as a whole. This outreach to the Benjamites underscores the importance of maintaining the integrity of the twelve tribes.<p><b>who were at the rock of Rimmon</b><br>The rock of Rimmon served as a refuge for the surviving Benjamites. Geographically, it is located in the wilderness of Benjamin, providing a natural fortress. This location is significant as it symbolizes both the isolation and the protection of the remnant of Benjamin. The rock of Rimmon can be seen as a type of Christ, who is often referred to as a rock or refuge in Scripture (e.g., <a href="/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>), offering safety and hope to those who seek Him.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_whole_congregation.htm">The Whole Congregation</a></b><br>Refers to the assembly of the Israelites, representing the collective tribes of Israel, excluding Benjamin at this point.
