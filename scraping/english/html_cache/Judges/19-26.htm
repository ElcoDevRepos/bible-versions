In biblical narratives, mornings often symbolize hope or a fresh start, yet here it contrasts with the tragic events that have unfolded. The timing underscores the urgency and desperation of the woman's situation.<p><b>the woman went back to the house</b><br>The woman, a concubine, is central to this narrative. Her return to the house signifies her attempt to seek refuge or safety, highlighting her vulnerability. In the cultural context of ancient Israel, a concubine held a lower status than a wife, which may have contributed to her mistreatment and the events leading to this moment.<p><b>where her master was staying</b><br>The term "master" reflects the patriarchal structure of ancient Israelite society, where women were often under the authority of male figures. This relationship dynamic is crucial to understanding the power imbalance and the lack of protection she experienced. The Levite, her master, represents a failure of leadership and protection, themes prevalent in the Book of Judges.<p><b>collapsed at the doorway</b><br>Her collapse at the doorway is symbolic of her exhaustion and the culmination of her suffering. Doorways in biblical literature can represent transitions or thresholds between safety and danger. Her position at the threshold underscores her tragic plight and the failure of the household to provide sanctuary.<p><b>and lay there until it was light</b><br>The phrase "until it was light" suggests a period of waiting and suffering through the night, a common biblical motif representing trials or tribulations. The arrival of light often symbolizes revelation or judgment. In this context, it foreshadows the grim discovery and the subsequent actions that lead to the Levite's call for justice, albeit through shocking means. This moment also serves as a prelude to the broader narrative of moral decay and the need for righteous leadership in Israel, themes that resonate throughout the Book of Judges.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_levite.htm">The Levite</a></b><br>A man from the tribe of Levi, who was traveling with his concubine.

Each detail exposes Israel&#8217;s spiritual decay: leaders failing in protective duty, households ignoring covenant love, and society tolerating violence. The verse calls today&#8217;s reader to reject moral compromise, protect the vulnerable, and step from darkness into the light of obedient faith, remembering that God&#8217;s sunrise always reveals what the night has tried to hide.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/19.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(26) <span class= "bld">Then came the woman. . . .--</span>It would be scarcely possible to enhance the depth of pathos and of horror which the sacred writer throws into these simple words.
