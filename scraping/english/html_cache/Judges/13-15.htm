This request indicates Manoah's desire to honor the visitor, whom he perceives as a man of God. Hospitality was a significant cultural practice, as seen in <a href="/genesis/18.htm">Genesis 18</a> when Abraham entertains three visitors.<p><b>Manoah said to the angel of the LORD,</b><br>The angel of the LORD is a recurring figure in the Old Testament, often considered a theophany or a pre-incarnate appearance of Christ. This encounter is significant as it involves divine intervention in the lives of Manoah and his wife, leading to the birth of Samson, a judge of Israel. The angel of the LORD appears in other key biblical moments, such as to Hagar in <a href="/genesis/16.htm">Genesis 16</a> and to Gideon in <a href="/judges/6.htm">Judges 6</a>.<p><b>&#8220;and we will prepare a young goat for you.&#8221;</b><br>Offering a young goat was a common practice for a meal or sacrifice, symbolizing respect and reverence. In the context of Judges, sacrifices were often made to seek favor or express gratitude to God. This act of preparing a meal aligns with the sacrificial system outlined in Leviticus, where offerings were made to honor God. The preparation of a young goat also echoes the hospitality shown by Gideon in <a href="/judges/6-19.htm">Judges 6:19</a>, where he prepares a young goat for the angel of the LORD.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/m/manoah.htm">Manoah</a></b><br>A man from the tribe of Dan, the father of Samson.

He does not want the heavenly visitor to depart too quickly, echoing Abraham&#8217;s plea, &#8220;Please let my lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass your servant by&#8221; (<a href="/genesis/18-3.htm">Genesis 18:3</a>).<p>&#8226; The request also displays a hunger for further revelation. Staying longer would give Manoah more time to understand the divine message about the child who would become Samson. Compare the two disciples on the road to Emmaus urging Jesus, &#8220;Stay with us, for it is nearly evening&#8221; (<a href="/luke/24-29.htm">Luke 24:29</a>).<p>&#8226; Scripture consistently commends welcoming the messengers of God. <a href="/hebrews/13-2.htm">Hebrews 13:2</a> reminds believers, &#8220;Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing it.&#8221;<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>Manoah said to the angel of the LORD,</b><p>&#8226; Manoah addresses the visitor as &#8220;angel of the LORD,&#8221; yet later verses reveal he still grapples with the full identity of his guest (<a href="/judges/13-16.htm">Judges 13:16&#8211;22</a>). Encounters with the Angel of the LORD often end in the realization that one has met God Himself in visible form (<a href="/exodus/3-2.htm">Exodus 3:2&#8211;6</a>; <a href="/genesis/32-30.htm">Genesis 32:30</a>).<p>&#8226; The phrase underscores that God takes the initiative to appear to ordinary people. Just as Gideon once heard from &#8220;the angel of the LORD&#8221; in <a href="/judges/6-11.htm">Judges 6:11&#8211;22</a>, Manoah and his wife now stand on holy ground, even if they do not entirely grasp it at first.<p>&#8226; By recounting this detail, the text affirms the literal reality of such divine visitations; they are not dreams or symbols but historical encounters that advance God&#8217;s redemptive plan.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>&#8220;and we will prepare a young goat for you.&#8221;</b><p>&#8226; Offering a meal&#8212;especially a young goat&#8212;signals respect and covenant fellowship in the ancient Near East. Abraham hurried to choose &#8220;a choice calf&#8221; for his angelic visitors (<a href="/genesis/18-7.htm">Genesis 18:7</a>), and Gideon prepared &#8220;a young goat&#8221; before the Angel of the LORD (<a href="/judges/6-19.htm">Judges 6:19</a>).<p>&#8226; Manoah&#8217;s intent goes beyond mere hospitality; a young goat is suitable for a peace offering (<a href="/leviticus/3-6.htm">Leviticus 3:6&#8211;7</a>). Though Manoah initially thinks of it as food, the angel will redirect it into an offering to the Lord (<a href="/judges/13-16.htm">Judges 13:16</a>).<p>&#8226; The gesture also reflects faith. Sacrificing an animal from one&#8217;s flock carries real cost, yet Manoah gladly invests it because he trusts the messenger&#8217;s promise about the coming child.<p><hr color="#eeeeee"><b>summary</b><p>Manoah&#8217;s invitation, his address to the Angel of the LORD, and his offer of a young goat together illustrate reverent hospitality, unfolding recognition of divine presence, and willing sacrifice. The verse models how believers respond when God draws near: urge Him to linger, honor His messenger, and give generously in anticipation of His promised work.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/13.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(15) <span class= "bld">A kid for thee.</span>--Literally, <span class= "ital">before thy face. </span>The narrative is closely analogous to that of the appearance of the angel to Gideon, and there is the same uncertainty in the terms used, so that we cannot certainly decide whether Manoah's object was to offer a sacrifice or to offer hospitality.
