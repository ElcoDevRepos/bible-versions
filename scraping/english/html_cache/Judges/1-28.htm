The strengthening of Israel can be seen as a fulfillment of God's promise to give them the land, yet it also reflects a time of incomplete obedience. Historically, this period follows the conquest led by Joshua, where the tribes of Israel were tasked with taking possession of their allotted territories. The strengthening could be attributed to their growing numbers, military successes, and the establishment of a more organized tribal confederation.<p><b>they pressed the Canaanites into forced labor</b><br>Instead of fully obeying God's command to drive out the Canaanites, the Israelites chose to subjugate them, using them for labor. This decision reflects a compromise with the surrounding pagan culture, which would later lead to spiritual and moral decline. The practice of using conquered peoples for labor was common in the ancient Near East, and it provided economic benefits. However, it also meant that the Canaanites remained a significant influence, leading to idolatry and syncretism among the Israelites.<p><b>but they never drove them out completely</b><br>This incomplete obedience had long-term consequences for Israel. The presence of the Canaanites among them led to ongoing conflicts and spiritual corruption, as seen in later narratives throughout the book of Judges. The failure to fully drive out the Canaanites is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, symbolizing the persistent struggle between faithfulness to God and the temptation to conform to the world. This phrase also foreshadows the cyclical pattern of sin, oppression, repentance, and deliverance that characterizes the period of the Judges. Theologically, it serves as a reminder of the importance of complete obedience to God's commands.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/i/israel.htm">Israel</a></b><br>The collective name for the descendants of Jacob, also known as the Israelites.

Full obedience protects future faithfulness; partial obedience plants seeds of idolatry.<div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/ellicott/judges/1.htm">Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers</a></div>(28) <span class= "bld">Did not utterly drive them out.</span>--This is mentioned by way of blame, as the cause of their future sins and disasters (<a href="/judges/2-2.htm" title="And you shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; you shall throw down their altars: but you have not obeyed my voice: why have you done this?">Judges 2:2</a>; Josh. 16:16, <a href="/joshua/17-13.htm" title="Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not utterly drive them out.">Joshua 17:13</a>). As to the morality of these exterminating wars, we must bear in mind that men and nations must alike be judged by the moral standard of their own day, not by the advanced morality of later ages. We learn from unanimous testimony that the nations of Canaan had sunk to the lowest and vilest depths of moral degeneracy. When nations have fallen thus low, the cup of their iniquity is full; they are practically irreclaimable. To mingle with them would inevitably be to learn their works, for their worst abominations would find an ally in the natural weakness and corruption of the human heart. The Israelites therefore believed that it was their positive duty to destroy them, and the impulse which led them to do so was one which sprang from their best and not from their worst instincts. It must not be forgotten that the teaching of Christ has absolutely changed the moral conceptions of the world. It intensified, to a degree which we can hardly estimate, our sense of the inalienable rights of humanity and of the individual man. In these days there is scarcely any amount of evidence which would convince us that we were bidden to exterminate a whole population, and involve women and children in one indistinguishable massacre. But neither the Israelites nor any other ancient nations, at this early stage of their moral development, had any conception corresponding to those which would in our minds rightly excite horror, were we to receive a command like that given by Moses, that "thou shalt save nothing alive that breatheth" (<a href="/deuteronomy/22-16.htm" title="And the damsel's father shall say to the elders, I gave my daughter to this man to wife, and he hates her;">Deuteronomy 22:16</a>), or by Samuel, "Slay both man and woman, <span class= "ital">infant and suckling, </span>ox and sheep, camel and ass" (<a href="/1_samuel/15-3.htm" title="Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.">1Samuel 15:3</a>). We should instantly declare it to be <span class= "ital">impossible </span>that God--as Christ has revealed to us the character of our Father in heaven--should give us commands which would militate against our sense of justice no less than against our sense of compassion. To quote such commands as an excuse for, or an incentive to, such horrible acts of wickedness as the Sack of Beziers, or the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, is ignorantly and recklessly to obliterate the whole results of God's progressive moral education of our race. It is to ignore the fact that we are living under a wholly different dispensation, and to disavow every blessing which has accrued to humanity from the broadening light and divine revelation of three thousand years. But the ancient Israelites, living as they did in the "days of ignorance" which God "winked at" (<a href="/acts/17-30.htm" title="And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commands all men every where to repent:">Acts 17:30</a>), had never attained to that idea of human individuality--that sense of the independence and infinite worth of each human life--which would have shown them that they knew not what manner of spirit they were of (<a href="/luke/9-56.htm" title="For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.">Luke 9:56</a>). The wild and passionate sense of severe justice, the comparative indifference to human life, the familiarity with pain and death which blunted the keen edge of pity, "the deficient sense of individuality, the exaggerated sense of the solidarity which united a criminal with all his surroundings and possessions," prevented them from regarding the execution of their ban on guilty nations, cities, or families in any other light than that of the zeal for righteousness by which it was impelled. Their deeds must be estimated by the elements of nobleness which mingled with them, and not indiscriminately condemned by standards of judgment of which neither they nor the age in which they lived had any conception. They firmly believed that in exterminating Canaan they were acting under Divine commands; and there was nothing in such commands which would in that day have shocked the moral sense of the world. "They did not look unnatural to the ancient Jew; they were not foreign to his standard; they excited no surprise or perplexity; they appealed to a genuine but rough idea of justice which existed, when the longing for retribution upon crime in the human mind was not checked by the strict sense of human individuality" (Mozley, <span class= "ital">Lectures on the Old Test., </span>p. 103). . . . <div class="vheading2"><a href="/commentaries/pulpit/judges/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Put the Canaanites to tribute</span>, or made them tributaries, as in vers. 30, 33, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> imposed forced labour upon them, as the Gibeonites were made hewers of wood and drawers of water (<a href="/joshua/9-21.htm">Joshua 9:21, 27</a>;
