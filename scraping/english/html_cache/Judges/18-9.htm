The call to "go up against them" indicates a readiness for military action, a common theme in the conquest narratives of the Old Testament. The Danites were seeking a territory to settle, as their allotted inheritance was insufficient. This mirrors the earlier Israelite conquests under Joshua, where God commanded the Israelites to take possession of the Promised Land. The phrase also highlights the aggressive nature of the Danites' expansion, which was not sanctioned by God in the same way as the initial conquests.<p><b>for we have seen the land, and it is very good.</b><br>The spies' report echoes the positive reports given by Caleb and Joshua about the Promised Land in <a href="/numbers/13-30.htm">Numbers 13:30</a>. The description of the land as "very good" suggests fertility and abundance, reminiscent of the land "flowing with milk and honey" promised to the Israelites. This phrase underscores the recurring biblical theme of God's provision and the goodness of His creation. However, unlike the earlier conquests, this venture lacks divine approval, highlighting a contrast between God's ordained plans and human ambition.<p><b>Why would you fail to act?</b><br>This rhetorical question serves as a motivational challenge to the Danites, urging them to seize the opportunity. It reflects a sense of urgency and impatience, possibly indicating a lack of faith in God's timing and provision. The question implies a rebuke for inaction, similar to the exhortations found in the book of Joshua, where the Israelites are encouraged to be strong and courageous. It also suggests a human tendency to rely on self-initiative rather than waiting on divine guidance.<p><b>Do not hesitate to go there and take possession of the land!</b><br>The command to "take possession" is reminiscent of God's instructions to the Israelites during the conquest of Canaan. However, in this context, it lacks the divine mandate that characterized earlier conquests. The phrase "do not hesitate" implies a sense of urgency and determination, urging immediate action. This reflects a broader biblical theme of seizing God-given opportunities, yet it also serves as a cautionary tale about acting outside of God's will. The Danites' actions foreshadow the later struggles and moral decline of Israel, as seen in the book of Judges, where "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (<a href="/judges/21-25.htm">Judges 21:25</a>).<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/t/the_danites.htm">The Danites</a></b><br>A tribe of Israel seeking a new territory to inhabit because they had

(<a href="/genesis/1-31.htm">Genesis 1:31</a>).<p>&#8211; Seeing God&#8217;s blessing should stir gratitude and confidence rather than hesitation (<a href="/psalms/34-8.htm">Psalm 34:8</a>).<p><hr
