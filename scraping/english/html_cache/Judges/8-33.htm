Gideon, also known as Jerubbaal, was a judge who delivered Israel from the oppression of the Midianites. His leadership brought a period of peace and stability. The phrase highlights the immediate shift in Israel's behavior following his death, indicating the lack of enduring spiritual commitment among the people. This pattern of falling away after the death of a leader is seen throughout the book of Judges, emphasizing the cyclical nature of Israel's faithfulness and apostasy.<p><b>the Israelites turned and prostituted themselves with the Baals</b><br>The term "prostituted" is used metaphorically to describe Israel's unfaithfulness to God. In the ancient Near Eastern context, idolatry was often associated with spiritual adultery, as the covenant relationship between God and Israel was likened to a marriage. The Baals were Canaanite deities associated with fertility and agriculture, and worshiping them involved practices that were abhorrent to the God of Israel. This turning away from God to serve other gods was a direct violation of the first commandment and a recurring issue for Israel, as seen in other passages like <a href="/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15-16</a> and <a href="/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>.<p><b>and they set up Baal-berith as their god</b><br>Baal-berith, meaning "Lord of the Covenant," was a local deity worshiped in Shechem, a significant city in the tribal territory of Ephraim. The choice of Baal-berith reflects a syncretism where the Israelites attempted to merge their covenantal traditions with Canaanite practices. This act of setting up Baal-berith as their god signifies a formal and public rejection of Yahweh's covenant. Theologically, this represents a profound betrayal, as Israel was called to be a distinct and holy nation. The setting up of Baal-berith can be seen as a type of antichrist, opposing the true covenant relationship that points to Jesus Christ, who is the ultimate fulfillment of God's covenant with humanity.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/g/gideon.htm">Gideon</a></b><br>A judge of Israel who led the Israelites to victory over the Midianites.
