Bezek was a city in the territory of Judah, indicating the Israelites' campaign to conquer the land promised to them. The act of fleeing suggests a battle or confrontation, typical of the period of the Judges when Israel was in the process of taking possession of Canaan. This reflects the ongoing struggle between the Israelites and the Canaanite inhabitants, fulfilling God's command to drive out the inhabitants of the land (<a href="/deuteronomy/7.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1-2</a>).<p><b>they pursued him</b><br>The Israelites' pursuit of Adoni-bezek demonstrates their commitment to God's command to conquer the land. This pursuit is indicative of the military campaigns led by the tribes of Israel during the conquest period. It also reflects the broader theme of divine justice and retribution, as the Israelites act as instruments of God's judgment against the Canaanite kings who opposed them.<p><b>seized him</b><br>The capture of Adoni-bezek signifies a victory for the Israelites and the fulfillment of God's promise to give them the land. This act of seizing a king is symbolic of the transfer of power and the establishment of Israelite dominance in the region. It also serves as a reminder of God's sovereignty and the fulfillment of His promises to the patriarchs regarding the land of Canaan.<p><b>and cut off his thumbs and big toes</b><br>This act of mutilation was a common practice in ancient warfare to incapacitate a captured enemy, rendering them unable to wield a weapon or run effectively. It was a form of humiliation and a demonstration of complete victory over an adversary. Adoni-bezek himself acknowledges this practice in the following verse, indicating that he had done the same to seventy kings. This reflects the principle of "measure for measure" justice found throughout Scripture (e.g., <a href="/matthew/7-2.htm">Matthew 7:2</a>). The act also serves as a reminder of the consequences of sin and rebellion against God, as the Canaanite kings faced judgment for their opposition to God's people.<div class="vheading2">Persons / Places / Events</div>1. <b><a href="/topical/a/adoni-bezek.htm">Adoni-bezek</a></b><br>A Canaanite king who ruled over seventy kings, known for his cruelty in cutting off their thumbs and big toes.

The cutting off of his great toes would deprive him of that speed which was so essential for an ancient warrior, that "swift-footed" is in Homer the normal epithet of Achilles. Either of these mutilations would be sufficient to rob him of his throne, since ancient races never tolerated a king who had any personal defects. This kind of punishment was not uncommon in ancient days, and it was with the same general object that the Athenians inflicted it on the conquered 'ginetans.
